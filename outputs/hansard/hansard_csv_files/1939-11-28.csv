Acting Minister for Air whether there is a rule which obliges candidates for the Air Force to have had flying experience totalling at least 50 hours, which they must gain at their own expense, at a cost of from £50 to £100? In view of the fact that we are at war, will the honourable gentleman consider the advisability of admitting candidates to the Air Force without this experience? nature suggested. Probably the honourable member has in mind men who apply for the position of instructor. So far as pilots are concerned, there is no such preliminary requirement nf which I am aware. the Postmaster-General been drawn ts the advertising by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of the journal that it proposes to issue? Even if this be within the letter of the law, does not the honourable gentleman consider the spirit of the.law? Is it part of the policy of the honourable gentleman to use this public monopoly to displace privately-owned radio publications which for several years have been publishing radio programmes in full without any charge to the commission? been drawn to the matter complained of by the honourable member. I have fully investigated the position. The view of the Solicitor-General, which is supported by weighty outside opinion, is that the commission has statutory power to advertise its publication and any of its other activities. It is no part of any honourable gentleman would probably be laid-d.own policy of either myself or any glad to do the work undertaken! by ' Sir other Minister to permit the commission to publish a journal; the power to do so is conferred on the commission by this Parliament. The Government does not intend to amend the act to rob the commission of that power. Minister whether the Government proposes to establish a board of business administration in connection with defence matters? If it does, who will be the members of the board, and what payment will be made to them by way of salary, honorarium or expenses? the Government to appoint a body to act as a Board of Business Administration in connection with the defence expenses of the Government. The board will consist in the first instance of three members, but will probably have other members added to it as time goes on in connection with specialized activities for which the appointees are suited. The first members will be Mr Essington Lewis as chairman -h e has already been acting for some time and will continue to act in an honorary capacity as adviser to the Government; Mr Norman Myer, who has also done invaluable work in an honorary capacity in connection with clothing supplies, and will continue to act in that special way; and Sir George Pearce, who is well known as a man of great ability, sound judgment, and unrivalled experience in defence' administration in Austhat it is contravening tralia, in circumstances that are familiar to honourable members. Minister inform the House whether Sir George Pearce is acting on the Defence Board of Business Administration in an honorary capacity; if not, what remuneration is paid to him by way of salary, expenses or otherwise? precisely the ""position in relation to this matter. My recollection is that a very small fee is provided for in the case of Sir George Pearce.",7,Setup

I'OB THE DEFENCE FORGES-MINIS matta-Acting Minister for Supply and Development) I ask leave to make a statement in respect of action taken by the Department of Supply and Development relating to footwear for the defence forces. ment be debated in conjunction wjith Order of the Day No. 12"" Department of Supply and Development-Action Taken Since the Outbreak of War-Min isterial Statement-Motion for Printing Paper "". have no objection to that course being followed. the statement. I shall make n decision. [Leave granted.] rhe 16th NovemberI submitted to this House a statement informing honourable members of the activities of the Supply and Development. Department. In the course of that statement. I referred to a concerted attempt by certain boot manufacturers in New South Wales and Victoria to exploit the department and the community by adherence to a predetermined scale of prices when tendering for footwear of the various types required for the defence forces, such scale representing increases of up to 30 per cent, and in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart, 40 per cent, on the prices that had previously prevailed. In view of published denials and protestations from the manufacturers concerned, I think it necessary to place on the records of this House the facts upon which my allegation was based, facts which are supported by relevant documents that I propose to table. I regret having to affirm that a perusal of these documents, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, discloses a deliberate attempt at war profiteering on the part of at least ten manufacturers, including a number from whom the Defence Department has previously obtained its footwear requirements. At an appropriate stage of this statement 1 shall name the ten firms concerned. Towards the end of September, my department was asked to obtain for the purpose of the military and air forces, the following footwear:For the Military ForcesPairs. Hoots, ankle brown . . 100,000 Hoots, half heavy brown .. 15,000 Boots, black heavy 4,800 For the Royal Australian A i r ForceShuus, black nirmeii's -4,800 Hoots, black officers' .. 460 Shoes, black officers' .. 450 On the 29th September, 26 days after the outbreak of war, quotations were sought from the principal boot manufacturers of all States, and a large response resulted. The principal item, it will be observed, was the 100,000 pairs of boots, ankle brown. The following were the main quotations for this item, and they were submitted subject to variations of I have heard price on account of fluctuations in the cost of leather:AlcMiirtric (Now South Wales) Proprietary Limited, Sydney, l is . 8d. leas 3 per cent, or l is . 3.8d. nut.

Quotations were received also from firms but for the purposes of this statement, those from the main Victorian and New South Wales firms arc the relevant ones. It will be seen that at the 29th September the tendering for this item was on a. competitive basis, ranging from lis. 33 d. a pair to 14s. l i d . a pair; yet a few weeks later four of these firmsand others-were no longer competitive,",13,Defence Expenditure Board Of Business Administration

It has been claimed that the meeting at which the price fixing was agreed upon had no official status, and, in the wording of Mr Salfinger, president of the Victorian association, was ""merely a handful of boot manufacturers interested in military footwear "". Inquiries however, revealed that this meeting was attended by 22 representatives from. Victoria and fourteen from New South Wales, and was presided over by Mr Salfinger. Since Mr Forest Boot Factory, Sydney. Salfinger's firm, is not interested at all It in military footwear, it is presumed that McMurtries Limited, he was acting in his official capacity, and Messrs.

Moreover, representatives of the manufacturers whom I met in Sydney on Friday last were emphatic in declaring that boots built to this standard were an excellent production and, in the words of Mr Salfinger, "" comparable with the 1914 boot, and nothing better could be made."" l t was suggested, however, that some of pairs of military boots for the Egyptian the boots recently supplied were not in Government, and it was freely rumoured strict conformity with the specification. in trade circles that this was but the preThis suggestion is being closely followed lude to very large overseas orders. up, but what I wish to emphasize is that refer members to the first paragraph of the manufacturers themselves quite the letter from Messrs.

Rampling and Hall, Melbourne, in October, 1939, one month after the outbreak of war, quoted and were allotted an order for 3,400 pairs of these boots at 13s. 9d. a pair. It is remarkable that this firm, when quoting for an additional quantity, tendered at the fixed price of 17s. l i d . a pair for boots which they had but four weeks previously been able to In the case of the boots, black, heavy, of which 4,800 pairs were required, the order was placed at 14s. lOd. a pair as against the price of 17s. 5d. a pair fixed at the meeting. The Lynn Shoe Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, was allotted an order for S.900 pairs of these boots in August, 1939, at 12s. l i d . a pair; yet this firm increased its quote to 17s. 5d. a pair. It is perhaps not out of place to mention here that at the time the meeting of manufacturers was held, on the 16th October, inquiries had been instituted by the Department, of Commerce for 24,000 I These exDuring the past few days I have been preference to government orders, and For boots, is proposed to call upon certain of the Wheti meeting the boot manufacturers in conference last week, I indicated that it was my intention to place the whole of the facts before Parliament; but in order to exclude any unfairness, I offered to table, simultaneously with my statement, any explanations which the manufacturers' organization desired to make. My purpose was to afford to the manufacturers concerned an opportunity to justify or explain the series of incidents to which I have referred. My offer to table any such documents would have given their explanation equal and concurrent publicity with my own relation of the facts. The only response to this invitation is the document, tabled in file No. 12, from the secretary of the New South Wales Boot -Manufacturers Association. It will be noted that this document is entirely silent on the circumstances of my serious charges. Honourable members will hardly fail to appreciate the significance of this silence.

I made a fairly careful examination of the camp, and I am perfectly satisfied with the conditions hospitals? In view of'the position' being which exist there and with its layout generally. The first intimation that I [17] had that the right honourable member for Cowper was displeased with the arrangements was contained in a newspaper report, which no doubt was the one referred to by the honourable member. the Minister for the Army whether, during his visit to the Ingleburn camp, he noticed that the cookhouse is situated in a position which has been provided by excavating a portion of a hill, and that the surplus water from the hill swamps the cookhouse during heavy rains? Did he also notice that the drainage from the various wash-up places goes through the. floor and on to the ground beneath, a condition which would not be tolerated in any municipality in Australia? I also ask whether he intends to give effect to the assurance given to me last week that permanent military camps would, where possible, be sewered? reveal the conditions suggested by the right honourable gentleman. I also made it my business to discuss the matter with the cooks of the various units who have to do the work in the cookhouse under the conditions which the right honourable gentleman mentions, and they expressed high praise concerning the layout of the kitchens and the wash-up places. The drainage in all camps is a difficult problem, and I considered that that at Ingleburn camp presents no greater difficulties than that in any other camp, and is capable of being handled in an efficient manner. I stated previously that where possible it is intended to install a sewerage system, but there is no sewerage system adjacent to the Ingleburn camp.

55,Sir Earle Page,"In view of theofficers to examine the question as to whether sewerage should not be provided generally in the camps? broadly speaking, the reply to the first part of the right honourable gentleman's question is that supervision is more easily carried out at hospitals. The right honourable gentleman knows that a septic tank system, to function successfully, requires supervision. With regard to the second part of the question, I believe that the skilled engineers advising the Government in regard to the drainage of camps are sufficiently qualified to enable the most satisfactory drainage scheme to be put in operation in the camps. for the Army take steps to ensure that better transport facilities are provided for conveying troops on leave from Ingleburn Camp to Liverpool, so that there may be no repetition of the recent accident which resulted in the death of a soldier through the men trying to crowd into a small bus? what the actual position is in regard to such transport, but I shall make inquiries.

Leader of the Country party) [4.13] This debate marks the arrival in the Australian political arena of the youngest of our Commonwealth departments. how this youngster came to appear we do not know. The speech by the Minister for Information ( Sir Henry Gullett), who is in charge of this infant, was singularly devoid of any information on that point. Looking at the circumstances immediately prior to the establishment of this department, I think that honourable members will agree that there was little necessity to superimpose upon the means we hadof collecting information and news, another government department at a cost of £22,500, which cost will be considerably exceeded, I should say, before the infant is much older, since most of these departments have an awkward habit of increasing in cost at a much more rapid rate than their parents expected at the outset. For some months, each member of the Cabinet, with few exceptions, has had his own publicity officer attached to his staff, and has, therefore, been in an excellent position to issue such statements as seem to be best to himself. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) is similarly catered for, and so am I as Leader of the Country party. Therefore, there was little to be gained* by having this 'extra department. Moreover, a very useful service was performed by the Department of External Affairs in issuing a valuable fortnightly publication, Current Notes, and the information section of the Deoartment of Commerce also did fairly useful work. In addition, we had an extensive system for the collection of news, both overseas and local, in the hands of the press organizations. Much of this news was received by cable, and had a system for the collection of news to which the present Department of In formation can add nothing of importance, as far as can be ascertained at the present time. I claim that the proper department to handle official information is the Department of External Affairs, because that will be charged with the responsibility of supplying to this Parliament, the press and the public, from time to time, authentic statements as to the position of affairs overseas. But the situation is complicated by the fact that, during wartime, certain negotiations take place between ourselves and other powers. CerJust tain military questions may arise, such as the recently reported peace overtures, which must not be discussed in the press. Therefore, in addition to the natural restraint that may be exercised by those handling news services in wartime, there must be some sort of control in the form of a censorship over the dissemination of news. Recognizing that the Department of External Affairs must deal with that matter, we come to the consideration of the kind of information that this newdepartment is to handle. ""What is it to collect? What is it to disseminate? Surelyi t is not suggested that it is to engage in the collection of news within",26,Spender Th E Honourable In Limousines Judiciar Ybill 1939

118,Mr Archie Cameron ( B A R K E R,"Australia? It would be very interesting to know bow it becomes necessary for tbe department to have a great number of volunteers at work sending out thousands of letters. employed? Surely it is not suggested by the Government that a department costing at least £22,500 a year will be able to set up a new organization in Australia that will be more authentic and more trustworthy than that of the press to-day? Referring even to press news, there are some points which the Minister may well clear up at an early date."" There was a report yesterday of the sinking of the German pocket battleship, Deutschland. To-day, in one section of the press, it is stated that what really happened was the sinking of a British armed merchantman. One section of the press said that this vessel was sunk by a submarine 150 miles south of Iceland, . whereas section of the press named the same vessel and gave the same tonnage, but alleged that it had been sunk in the Indian Ocean by the German pocket battleship, Admiral von Scheer. Surely the Department of Information should be able to exercise some control in regard to statements of that description. We may have the opportunity to hear something on that point from the Minister in the not far distant future. There are two main sources already established for the dissemination of this information, one the newspapers and the other the wireless broadcasting stations, both national and commercial. To some extent the commercial broadcasting stations are linked with the newspaper services. It is not suggested that the Department of Information 'should supplant those sources in any way, so any activities that it undertakes must be superfluous to those engaged in by the newspapers and broadcasting stations. I grant that from time to time information may be given out by the Minister for Information or his assistants, but what happened here yesterday would make us extremely sceptical about the reliability of that information. Last week the Department of Information circulated to honourable members a statement issued by the Department of Commerce dated the 14th November which gave most interesting information in regard to our marketing Mr Archie Cameron. abroad, but yesterday honourable members received another statement which simply statesThis memorandum is to notify you that For what reason are they circular (C.14 of 17/11/39) headed""WAR-TIME MARKETING OP PRIMARY is withdrawn from circulation. had something to do with that I think. may be, but surely to heaven Parliament is entitled to know whether this new department has .any objective, any guiding principle whether the Government is making statements which it can stand to or statements which it has to withdraw. Honourable members are entitled to know what was wrong with the first statement and what was the reason for its being withdrawn from circulation. I have another grave doubts as to whether the Department of Information on its performances is likely to give satisfaction in this regard. I do not know whether other honourable gentlemen were similarly blessed, but on Saturday morning I received through the post in a big official envelope from the Department of Information five photolithograph copies of a speech made here the other day by the Prime Minister. There is no necessity to create a department to do that sort of thing. A previous Minister for Defence used to send out copies of every speech that he made at the Manly Town Hall without the aid of any department of information, so there again I have grave doubt as to the necessity for this new department. I have two strong suspicions about the reasons for the formation of this department. One suspicion is that, when the British Government, for reasons unknown to us, established a similair department, it was felt by the Commonwealth Government that whether it was right or wrong, justified or unjustified, timely or untimely, we had to follow suit. The other suspicion that I have is this: I remember that during the currency of the last war the words "" British Official"" attached to any statements, amongst the troops at any rate, called for a good deal of hilarity and jocular comment as to the veracity of activities many of those statements. For instance,",27,Henry Gullett

120,Mr Archie Cameron,"Thatit is 'undeniable history that one of the best battleships of the British Navy was sunk off the Irish coast a few days after the last war broke out, but the sinking was never officially admitted until after the war was overa period of more than four years. I also remember one interesting instance which came under my notice of the lack of reliance that the British troops placed on "" British Official"". On the 30th August, 1915, in France, when the First Battalion from New South Wales was engaged at a place called Peronne, my battalion followed. We came upon an abandoned German steam-a-oller which had steam up. There were plenty of wags' among the troops and in.the locality there was plenty of chalk. Some one chalked on the steam-roller "" Captured by the First Battalion "". Another improved it with "" Captured by the First Battalion Cooks "", another ' with "" Captured by the Military Police"", and another, ""Captured by the Waacs"", but the crown of the lot was "" British Official: Shot down inflames"". In time of. war we have to adopt one of two attitudes on information. Either we come out quite frankly and tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth whether it pleases us or not; or-and I would adopt this alternative-w e tell the public that certain information, for milithey have published reports from tary and national reasons, cannot be divulged, and make no bones about it. All of this talk about "" the whole truth and nothing but the truth "", to any one who has experience of the subject, is so much talk. I nearly used another expression, but I got into trouble the last time. I used it. rate, we all know, whether we have one or twenty departments of inCommonwealth department for the colformation, that information which cannot be. released with a Minister at the head and underduring wartime. The proper thing neath him a Director of Information in for the Government to do is to tell each of the States. Below that we have the people that that is so. It should not all sorts of committees in the capital endeavour to delude the people into cities and, judging by the Minister's believing that this new department"" will statement the other day, we are to have do a lot of the wonderful things which similar committees in the country areas. tbe Minister suggests that it will do. Under the old system the wartime economize. censorship had its faults, but it certainly did the work. Why is it necessary to tees are honorary bodies. take military censorship out of the hands of the Defence Department and put it into the hands of the Department of In formation? I understand that the Defence Department did the work tolerably well. I do not suggest that the Army has any desire to retain the duties of the censorship, because the work involves one of the worse responsibilities that the Army ever had to undertake. Still more interesting would be an answer to this question: Why was it necessary to take the Cinematograph Branch from the Department of Commerce and place it under the control of this new department? The Department of Commerce was doing a special job in a special way. How in the name of common sense the work of the Cinematograph Branch can be linked up with the Department of Information I do not know, unless the real purpose is to try to justify something which cannot otherwise be justified. Likewise, the old system under which the press collected and disseminated information worked fairly well. Nobody has ever suggested that the press is exactly the fountain of truth. The newspapers get their cables from overseas. They cannot check the truth of what they receive from overseas, and they have to publish it just as to-day two cable services, which, I am interested to note on information I have received, were supposed to be working in common from the 14th November, giving entirely different versions of the sinking of the Rawalpindi, one alleging that the vessel was sunk in the Indian Ocean and the other giving the locality as south of Iceland. How that disparity comes about I do not know. I cannot see the necessity for a special there is certain lection and dissemination of information,",28,Products

124,Sir Henry Gullett,"Thos e commitary II have very vivid recollections that early this year we had a National Health and Medical Research Council, which was supposed to be entirely honorary. I know a great deal about that council. It was not honorary. Indeed, it would be interesting to know what it cost before the Government was done with it. Although it cannot be so much as the Department of Information will cost the Government for the first twelve months, I am sure that it was a considerable amount. On a question of the result derived from that expenditure, I ask the Minister for Health( Sir Frederick Stewart) "" Exactly what did the people of Australia get out of the National Health and Medical Research Council scheme ?"" My next point relates to the method to be adopted by the department in distributing information. Does it propose to guarantee the accuracy of news which is published in the newspapers? Is it in any way connected with the press? Does the censorship which the department imposes to-day carry any warranty of the accuracy of the news appearing in the press and broadcast over the radio networks? If it does not carry such a warranty, I suggest that the Minister will have something to explain before very long. AnotheT important aspect is the department's relationship to local information. Since now we have evidence that one of the duties of the department is to distribute copies of speeches made by Ministers, even to honourable members who have themselves heard the speeches in this chamber, I should like to know what, eventually, the department will develop into. Does the department take the attitude that it must justify the speeches made in this chamber by Ministers; and, in fact, must it justify those speeches? If that he so, we must conclude that the job of this new department is to engage in controversy in connection with statements made by Ministers. My view is that, if a Government department distributes copies of statements made hy Ministers, the public will naturally nxpect that department to take responsibility for the accuracy of the statements themselves; and should any controversy arise out of their publication, I imagine that any one having an objection will apply to the Minister for Information for confirmation or otherwise. At that rate it would uot be long before the Minister for Information became engaged in a first-class controversy in regard to some departmental matter, or some aspect of Government policy. Important questions of public controversy may develop from small beginnings. I could name two or three such matters which, if they formed the subject of comment through the Department of Information, would produce immediate reactions; but I shall not. Those matters may be raised in this House at any time. I think one was mentioned to-day. The upshot may be that the Minister will find himse.f engaged in an awkward debate with people outside this Parliament. I admit that the department is in an experimental stage, but I should like the Minister to answer this question, which I put to him by interjection the other day: "" What is the relationship between the Department of Information and Amalgamated Wireless-(Australasia) Limited in regard to the broadcasting of Australian viewpoints over short-wave stations?"" My experience of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, when I was Postmaster-General, was such that I would have taken action in this House had I held office much longer than I did. I regard Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited as one of the greatest profiteering concerns in Australia, and the great pity is that the Commonwealth Government owns one more than half of the shares in it. The Minister for Information, if he is responsible for Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, will have difficulty in explaining the disparity that exists between the cost of sending a radio message from shore to ship through Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the cost of sending a message from New Zealand to tbe same ship. honourable gentleman does not suggest that I am responsible for Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia.)

It appears to me that the honourable member is anticipating debate on that measure. order of the day relates to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, not to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, which is an entirely different concern . I 1 ask the Minister to tell. Parliament upon what terms and conditions Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is undertaking the broadcasting of programmes on behalf of the Department of Information. the House a full statement upon the conditions of that overseas service before it is initiated, probably on one day next week. I point out to the honourable member that it was my intention to make such a statement; I shall not make it merely in response to his demand to-day. await that statement with interest. If inI f we are to accept the position that formation issued by the department, especially in connection with overseas news, is not verified and does not carry the warranty of the department, then it is of no more value to the community than is the news which comes through the ordinary channels of the press and which in many cases should be dubbed "" rumour"". If , on the contrary, the department takes the stand that it will not guarantee anything that is published until its accuracy has been verified, the news will be stale by the time it reaches the general public. The department, in my opinion, must decide actually what truth is. That is a very awkward question, which even Pontius Pilate himself would not decide. there will be the gravest conflict between truth and fact, truth being that which a man believes, and fact being that which he can prove it. Awkward questions will arise from that distinction during wartime. If the department is to decide what truth is, I suspect, perhaps mistakenly, that it will regard it as its duty to see that only the truth reaches the public. If that be the case, then, perforce, it must ensure that what it considers to be not the truth must not reach the people. As a consequence, an awkward system of censorship will be imposed by the department within Australia. tem during the last war; it could not be worse. speak with authority on that point, but all of us, even honourable members opposite, must recognize that during wartime there must be some limitation on the dissemination of news. Obviously we can1 not publish to the world facts which may be awkward for us in a military sense, awkward for us in a political sense, and, since we have many contracts for sale and barter with other governments, awkward also for us in a commercial sense. Therefore, there must be some censorship of news which, in time of peace, would naturally not be tolerated by a democratic community. Prior to the establishment of the Department of Information, every facility existed to ensure the distribution of information setting out departmental views. to-day no statements may be issued by government departments, except through the Department of Information 1 get the still more extraordinary position.

The more the Minister has to say about this department the less we are able to understand the genesis of it and the purposes which it is intended to serve. In my opinion, the sooner the Government has a second thought on this subject, as it has had on several other subjects recently, and consigns this department to the oblivion from which it should never have emerged, the better it will be for the Parliament and also for the taxpayers of Australia, who are expected to find the additional £22,500 required for the purposes of the department. expect the Minister for Information ( Sir Henry Gullett) to sift out the truth from the many statements that are made in wartime, it seems to me we are expecting a little too much from him, and, in fact, more than it is reasonable to expect. I confess, however, like the Leader of the Country party ( Mr Archie Cameron), that this department has not come up to expectations. The pronouncement that the Government intended to establish the department was hailed with a good deal of pleasure, for the cable service was not very eatisfactory. News was scarce and unreliable, and it was felt that the new department might be able to go a considerable distance to supply the public with news which would be marked by a fair measure of reliability. achievement of the department, up to liant, and the prospectuses which he has date, seems to have been the publication issued have led us to expect big things; of a libel on the Leader of the Country but the actual results have been very party. support of the honourable member for traveller "".

The new department suffers from the fact that the Minister threw himself into it without having first organized his scheme, and without having paid due regard to how his ideas would develop. Already the department has floundered. There is no kind of a suggestion of coordination. In my opinion, this department, if it is to act as a central departMinister. I refer to the action he has ment of information, should co-ordinate Government statements on national affairs and distribute them. I understand that there has been no co-ordination whatever. The Defence Department has two publicity officers, and the Supply and Development Department also has a publicity officer. Now we have a department created for publicity purposes. Yet the other publicity agencies in existence are still proceeding independently. Eor a department organized to provide the public with reliable information to act without co-ordination with other departments in the issuing of statements on national affairs is, in my opinion, fantastic. It is fantastic also that the department should not have access to the publicity sections associated with the two main arms of our defence services. If the Minister would say something that could justify the existence of his department and its right to continue as a separate information bureau, he would do something much more useful than he is doing by interjecting. There are, I believe, certain limited spheres in which this department might usefully be engaged, but the work could he done without the heavy expense now being incurred. The Minister has referred to the very useful service which the department is performing in supplying information to country newspapers which cannot afford comprehensive and expensive cable services. In supplying such newspapers with reliable information, the department is rendering a definite service to people who live in country districts. At the same time, it I had no intention to should be pointed out that some of the articles supplied have been rather ponderous and have contained more comment than information. Another sphere of service for the department would be in the preparation of replies to German propaganda that is circulating within Australia. Some of this propaganda is extremely clever. It is framed on the lines of the German propaganda in Great Britain, but is couched in terms designed to influence Australians. So far, the Department of Information has done nothing to reply to this propaganda. In one respect, I can commend the taken to establish a short-wave station, which could act as a mouthpiece for the distribution of national information on behalf of Australia. It is unfortunate that action along this line was not taken some time ago. Government from this side of the House months ago. a demand for a short-wave station from members of all parties. I make no claim to having conceived the idea-non e at all. that the Minister will be sorry that he has conceived any ideas if he has to listen too long to the kind of comment that is coming from his own side of the House. casting Commission should have taken action in this connection some time ago. Another useful service that the Department of Information might render in the future has relation to the publicity which the Government will need when it is making applications for loan money for war purposes. The department might be able to do something to put people into the right frame of thought and mind to subscribe to the war loans that must come If it does that, it will do something oi substantial value.

I have not heard of these committees having rendered any useful service, and I fail to see how they can assist the department in the mere collection and distribution of information. In any case, work of that kind could have been done more satisfactorily by smaller committees. However, I foresee that when loans are being floated for war purposes, these committees may be of some value. I suppose that the Government is committed to this expenditure, and I suppose, also, that we shall have to look to the Minister and his department to do the best that can be done to give some real service to the community for the money that is being expended; but I hope that the Minister will not be too resentful of criticism as such resentment causes bitterness. AlthoughI am prepared to agree that the department may be able to render some useful service in a limited sphere, I am of The great jurist, Blackstonc, said that the opinion that it could have been done at much less cost. The department should have been organized on less ambitious lines. When this department was constituted it was intended to discharge two functions which, in the last war, had been discharged by the Defence Department, and the merit of the idea behind its creation was that it would entrust to a civilian Minister, and to civilian methods, the administration and the discharge of the functions which were formerly entrusted to a military Minister and to military methods. two: first, the function of saying what ment of Defence.

We know that quarrel very much, but I understand wartime information falls short of truth; that the censors are operating under not at best, it is only relative truth. The important function of the Department of .Information, that which is of greatest importance and interest now, is, of course, the function of censorship. Everybody will admit that in a time of war, as the Leader of the Country party ( Mr Archie Cameron) has said, it is necessary to prevent facts, or information which may be useful to the enemy, from being transmitted to the enemy, although the utterer or transmitter of them may be perfectly innocent of any disloyal intention. It is necessary to do that, and, therefore, it is also necessary to endow some authority with the power of saying that those things should not be published. If you give to an authority that power you must also give to it very wide discretion. As the result, we get what is called the preventive censorship, which says that the actual publication of these things should be prevented. It is not a case of the publisher being punished afterwards. Therein lies the danger to the liberties of the people. liberty of the press consists in laying no previous restraints upon publication and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. As an answer given to-day indicates, the censorship in this country is divided into a publicity censorship covering censorship of the press, cinema and broadcasting, which is a function of the Department of Information, and the censorship of communications such as letters, telegrams, radio telegrams and cablegrams, which is a 7-esponsibility of the Department of Defence.

Thus every one would know the extent to which the liberties of the people were being curtailed. In addition, the person charged with an offence would be prosecuted in open court, and a report of the evidence would be made available.

The point I am making is >this: What is the good of all the guarantees we have attemptedto secure for the freedom of speech and discussion during the war if the Minister-and as a civilian he has not the excuses of soldierly training or military bias-ca n brush them aside and say, "" I will see that you have no chance of saying, or' writing, these things.

The Department of Information could be doing a lot of other useful things, because it cannot successfully repress everything.

The best thing this department can do is to allow the people to express their opinions and to refute these opinions if it can. able gentleman suggest that there should be no wartime censorship? be a wartime censorship of statements which may be useful to the enemy.

In every time of war there is freedom of speech to those persons whose views are acceptable to the Government and no freedom of speech to persons whose opinions are not acceptable to the Government. If the Government were to say that no opinions except those which it authorized for publication should be expressed, it would be consistent; but it does not do that. The way the censorship is being administered in Australia means that people can be prevented from saying what they believe to be their duty to say. ful statement, the harm is done as soon as it is published. assuming that the statement is harmful.

I had thought that it would be an advantage to have a civilian in charge of the Department of Information, but I sliould much prefer to have the Minister for the Army( Mr Street) in charge of it than the present Minister for Information. an utterance is treasonable or disloyal is a matter which the court should decide, in the same way as a court decides whether an act is murder. That issue is decided, not by cutting off the head of the tion to be expressed in the exact words suspected person, but by twelve good men and true in a properly constituted court. Should the suspected person be found guilty, he is punished. In that way, others are deterred from committing similar offences. That is the only way in which such things should be decided in a free utterances are country. Whether or not certain opinions should be expressed is a matter for the courts to decide. If freedom to express opinions is to be repressed or suppressed, the decision should rest with a body set up by law for that purpose. Moreover, according to settled rules of law and accepted principles of evidence, and not according to the will or whim of any official. I think that most people in this country will agree with me in that. .1 believe that there is much constructive work that the Department of Information can do. I am not blaming the department for the paucity of its output up to date. This war has been conducted in an unexpected and unique way. In time, its form will no doubt change, and the people will then look to the department for information. I do not suggest that the Department of Information should supersede the newspapers, because I believe that a trained newspaper man is more likely to get at the news of value than is a government official. In my opinion, the department can perform a useful service in supplying, in an authoritative form, statements containing the opinions which are held in neutral countries and by some of the great American newspapers and periodicals, the newspapers of other dominions and, perhaps, most of all, those of Ireland. All of these things would be tremendously valuable to us. We should know the opinions of people in other countries. The honourable member'for Perth( Mr Nairn) has suggested that news should be supplied by the Department of Information to small country newspapers which find the costs of obtaining such information in the ordinary way prohibitive. Such information The issue as to whether should be published under the authority of the Government, and should be clearly set out as having been supplied by the Department of Information.

The primary object was to establish, in conjunction with the press, a system of communication so that in the event of London being cut off accurate information, could be supplied from other centres to the people of GreatB r it a in and of the Dominions. saidThe second reason was that so far there had been very little information to give-wit h a few conspicuous exceptions there had been no dramatic events. Mr Greenwood had said that it was better to trust the people and to give them whatever news was available, whether it be good or bad. It is true, as Sir Samuel Hoare has stated, that, so far, there has been very little information to give to the people.

192,Mr Anthony,"I have investigatedshows that there has been an extraordinary increase, which, no doubt, accounts to some degree for the agitation in certain parts of Australia for the abolition of State Parliaments. Parliaments are not alone responsible, because costs in the Commonwealth sphere have increased enormously within the last few years. A great deal is due to the penchant of members and departmental officials to create new departments in order to increase the importance of their own positions. The following table shows the degree to which expenditure in Commonwealth departments has increased :£ Governor-Qenerni Parliament Prime Minister Treasury 2,414,742 207,279 2,403,259 263,319 Attorney-General Interior Trade and Customs. . Health Commerce 7,404,461 + Increase Bocreoso. The only exception is that of the Treasury where, for a time, there was a decrease of £11,000. The expenditure of that department, which in 1928-29 was £757,000, had increased by 1932-33 to £2,253,000 due to the introduction of sales tax, an increase of over £1,560,000 per annum. It will be seen from the table that the cost of conducting Commonwealth departments increased from £7,404,461 in 1933-34 to £S,350,204 in 1938-39, an annual increase of £945,743 or a weekly increase of £18,187. have been informed by the Minister that the estimated cost of the Department of Information for the remainder of the financial year is £22,500, and it is reasonable to assume that for a full year the estimated cost will be between £60,000 and £70,000. For the expenditure of such a large sum we are justified in asking for a reliable and efficient service. Where is the justification for the establishment of this department ? We should not consider this subject Austrian gentleman, with every reason to from the point of view of a totalitarian detest the Nazi regime to the uttermost, State department established with the offered his services in connection with a Mr Anthony. object of giving the people only certain information. I understand that it is the desire to give reliable news concerning the progress of the war, and to that I State offer no objection; but that service is already being provided by the daily newspapers with' the exception of a few journals representing small organizations. The Department of Information should collaborate more closely with the British Broadcasting Commission in the presentation of news; because at present we are receiving only a curtailed news service from that source. The Associated Press has, I understand, placed certain obstacles in the way of the presen-: tation of news because of the competition with their journals. The 1933-34. 1938-39.

Another matter which I should like We to discuss briefly at this juncture is the provision of a short-wave service in a foreign language.

205,Mr Barnard (Bass) [5.48],"Iletter was addressed to me in my capacity as president of the Launceston Musical Comedy Society, and after setting out the purpose for which the new department was formed, extended to me an invitation to attend a meeting to be held at Launceston this week to initiate the formation of a local information council. Since then I have endeavoured, without success, to find the slightest value in the establishment of such a council in Launceston. I am indebted to the Minister for his letter, however, in that it gave fuller information on certain aspects of the functions of the new department than was given in the official statement which the Minister made in this House last week. The letter readsThe department has been created with the sole purpose of justifyin g and sustaining the cause for which the United Kingdom and the Dominions and their Allies are fighting; and ut the same time to spread as widely as possible within tlie Commonwealth, sound information which has direct and indirect bearing upon the conflict. The department will also engage in oversea propaganda which will keep the world day by day informed of Australia's activity in the war and w ill , at the same time, counter enemy propaganda of an unt r u t h f u l or an unfair kind. I need scarcely add that the new department in its work will be completely free from political party colour or activity. The necessity for such a department is, in the mind of the Government, very strong. In brief, the Government believes that Great Britain and the Dominions have in this war a good cause, and that war was forced upon us. It wishes to keep these facts clearly before our own Australian people, and as many people as we can reach in neutral countries. The Department of Information is of a temporary nature for the duration of the war. head-quarters in Melbourne. The choice of Melbourne is unavoidable owing to the fact that the Defence and Supply Departments and (which is responsible for communications) are located here. Thus most of the members ot the War Cabinet, including the Prime Minister, will be compelled to spend a great deal of their time in Melbourne. I , in my present position as Minister for External Affairs, must be always in close touch with Mr Menzies. Much of the real work of the new depart, ment, however, will be carried out through an honorary council of information and committees to be established States, with a small State executive of the department working unric r my direction, and nt their service. You aru cordially invited to attend a meeting at which plans will be dismissed for the formation of the council. you wish to associate with yourself the secrei f r . liarnard. tary of your organization and any other particular member, they w ill be warmly welcomed. These councils w ill be built up, I hope, of representatives of religious, educational, social, industrial (primary and secondary) business, and other activities on the widest possible basis. In addition a number of outstanding citizens w ill be co-operated because of their special qualifications as publicists. A meeting to initiate the formation of the Launceston Council and committees w ill be held iu King's Hall, Charles Street, at 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, 30th November. I hope it will be possible for you to attend. If , however, it is not possible, perhaps you would be good enough to arrange for a deputy to represent you. I will not now attempt to explain the details of the proposed organization, as I do not wish to make this letter unduly long. I should be grateful for advice from you whether I may count on your support. If you will be accompanied when you attend the meeting, will you please let me know who w ill be with you. There are several points in the letter that have given me considerable food for thought. I am wondering how these committees, which are to be appointed in the various States, together with the small councils which are to operate for them, will be kept free from political influence. Apart from that, I cannot understand how these organizations are to be of any use in the issuing of news to the people of Australia or of other countries. The whole organization will be unwieldy, and will be responsible for delaying the presentation of news until it is out of date. It is proposed this year to expend £22,000 on the department, and I cannot see how that expenditure can be justified. It is I am now setting up a limited central an axiom among journalists that there is nothing so stale as yesterday's news, but there will be no hope of getting anything the Postmaster-General's Department from this department except stale news. I am not making any charge against the Minister. He has been given this job to do, and he is trying to make the best ho can of it. I have no .doubt that he will put his heart into it, and he is himself a journalist, but I still cannot see how the department will serve any useful purpose. There is no reason why news cannot be circulated through the channels already in each of the six in existence. The present organization may need a little strengthening, but there is no reason for creating a new department just because it has been done in If Great Britain. I am also strongly opposed to the proposal that the department should be located in Melbourne. The Minister has said that that is necessary because the Departments of Defence and Supply, and the Postmaster-General's Department, are there. That may sound plausible on the face of it, but the fact is that defence news is, for the most part, subject to severe censorship, and I understand that the Department of External Affairs, which might reasonably be expected to exercise an influence upon this censorship, is to remain in Canberra. It seems to me that the location of the Department of External Affairs in Canberra, and the Department of Information in Melbourne, both under the control of the one Minister, is likely to lead to a great deal of confusion, more than offsetting any possible good that might result from having the Department of Information in the same city as the Departments of Defence and Supply. I have been informed that, because the Department of Information is located in Melbourne there has already been considerable delay in regard to correspondence. Letters have been posted later than the date shown upon them, and' this, in conjunction with the delay in the preparation of the matter concerned, has resulted in the information reaching the newspapers too late to be of much use. Some of this delay may, of course, be incidental to the creation of a new department, and the trouble may in some degree be remedied when the organization is complete. I have also been informed that there exists in Canberra a very complete organization for the collection and dissemination of news. All of the metropolitan newsMinister to establish the Department of papers have trained staffs in Canberra, and the value of this organization will be largely nullified if the head-quarters of the new department are to be located in Melbourne. I believe it to be true that the quickest and best news cover is to be found in Canberra. After all, this is the National Capital, and I am convinced that this is the place where the new department should be, if there is any reason for having it anywhere. I have on previous occasions raised this question of the location of Commonwealth departments, and this seems to be a particularly appropriate time to bring it forward again when the creation of a new department is in contemplation. I cannot accept without a good deal of reservation the statement of the Minister that it is unavoidable that the Department of Information should have its head-quarters in Melbourne. These are days of rapid communication, and if it is necessary that one centre should keep in touch with another, Melbourne should avail itself of the existing facilities to communicate with Canberra rather than Canberra with Melbourne. News could be despatched more quickly and more efficiently from the Eederal press gallery here in Canberra than from anywhere else in Australia. I see no justification for establishing the head-quarters of the new department anywhere other than at Canberra, where it would be near the Department of External Affairs, whose expert officers are trained in the dissemination of news. Therefore, I urge the Government, even at this stage, to reconsider its decision. How can the Minister justify the establishment of the Department of Information in Melbourne since his head-quarters as Minister for External Affairs are in Canberra? There must be divided control. two places at once. I should prefer to be in Canberra, if circumstances permitted it. argument that the head-quarters of the Department of Information should be located here. Launceston ?

Neither am I unmindful that a little over a century ago a resident of Launceston set sail for the mainland of Australia, and when he reached the River Yarra he declared, "" This will be the place for a village""; but that fact does not justify the Government in establishing in Melbourne departments which should be administered from Canberra. I shall not silently acquiesce in any decision to set up a department outside the National Capital, but continue my active opposition to the practice. not think that any member of this chamber can accuse me of being an unfair critic of the Government, but I consider that a certain amount of comment is called for in this matter. I am somewhat disappointed at the setting up of this new department, because, in my opinion, the work to be undertaken by it could have been done in and through the Department of External 'Affairs, which has all the machinery necessary for the purpose. It is staffed by most efficient officers, and I am quite satisfied the Opposition) [8.0] -We are dealing that the work could have been done successfully through that department. I am not certain that the Government was wise in its choice of the Minister.who is in charge of the Department of Information. I have spent a considerable time this afternoon in reading speeches made by the Minister for Information (. Sir Henry Gullett) during the period when he was out of the Ministry, and I have found no instance of his having had a good word to say about the Government or anything done by it. His criticism of the Ministry was most severe. When he was not a member of the Government, nothing that the Government did was right, and I a.m afraid that we cannot expect the best results from such a Minister. Since the establishment of the new department, the Minister has visited the various States, addressed meetings, and formed large committees, but I do not anticipate that much good will come from that. Several weeks ago honourable members were promised that certain information would be supplied to them, but they have looked for it in vain. Prior to the establishment of this department, certain information was posted in our rooms daily by officers of the External Affairs Department, but since then we have had nothing. Any information supplied to us on request has been read by us in the press beforehand. The Government, even at this late stage, would be wise to reconsider its decision to set up this new department, because I do not consider the proposed expenditure to be warranted. The department will cost over £22,000 a year, yet the Department of External Affairs could have carried out the work successfully. If the Government persists in its decision, I am in agreement with the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) that the work should be done from Canberra. I am an advocate for concentrating administrative work in the National Capital. When the seat of Government was transferred to Canberra, every effort should have been made to transfer all Commonwealth administrative activities to this city, and I hope that the Department of Information, if it continues to operate at all, will do so from Canberra. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. with a department which has been recently instituted, and which, in its potentialities, can be said to represent one of the most important of the various activities which the Government has set going since the onset of war. It will be acknowledged that it is of the first importance to Australia, that not only our own people, but also, indeed, the people of as many countries as we can influence, shall be fully informed about why we are at war. the cause that we seek to defend, the general principles which have influenced us in the manmer in which we shall conduct the war, and the kind of world that we shall seek when the war is over.

I agree that there ought to be in this country an authoritative source of information to the people of Australia and a reliable vehicle to the people of other countries, so that they may know what is being said in Australia and distinguish that which is irresponsibly or speculatively said from that which is authoritatively said. I do not seek in any way to abate the rights of ' individuals to state their opinions, but it would be a mistake for the people of other countries to form their judgment as to the public conscience of this nation on any of the number of utterances or articles which all of us can recall as having been said or published even since this war started. Therefore, I am not opposed at all to the establishment of the Ministry of Information in order to make available to our own people and to other peoples what can be said to be authoritative, even official, declarations in order to minimize the number of as to what the facts are. There are vested interests in this counsible that our position will be constantly try which may find satisfaction! in the state of war. Indeed there are interests in this country, as in other countries, which seek to make a profit out of war; interests which would be quite satisfied, so long as they were safe themselves, to allow an undue prolongation of the struggle. In standing up for the defence of this nation, I hope that at least we shall keep in mind that there is in this country, in character if not in magnitude, the same set of circumstances and interests as have in other parts of the world, led to policies and actions which have been detrimental to other countries, and, most certainly detrimental to the larger interests of their own peoples. The Department of Information, therefore, can. do a very important work. I welcome the intention of the Minister what Ciii; he construed reasonably fairly for Information ( Sir Henry GulletH-it by in..dligent commentators as the general is not his suggestion, as he readily position of the Australian people. The acknowledges-that there shall be shortbroadcast to the peoples of other countries wave wireless transmissions to other lands of views as well as news will not only help and other peoples.

If there is anything in goodwill as an important factor in the securing of world peace, most certainly the preservation of goodwill among the already declared neutrals is one of the most important functions of government, not only as a possible factor in the early termination of the war, but also because of the important strategic consideration of lessening the number of nations with which we may find ourselves at war. Therefore, it is an obligation on the Government to have regular and systematic contact of the right kind with all countries with which we are not now at war, not only opponents that Australia may have to meet, but also to ensure as far as posunderstood. Thi3 department is to engage in that kind of work and I give it encouragement. I venture to say that if that work be well done we shall do service to Australia; indeed, service to the world. It has been said that information can lie of two kinds-that it can be national in its character and consist of news, and that it can be propaganda and consist of views. Here we need to be clear-headed. J do not object to a statement to other countries of what would be considered, to be views, provided that there is on the part of the Minister and his officers a clear understanding of what can be said to be the views of the Australian nation. Wo have to distinguish between the special po°itio:-.. of political parties and neighbours in particular. There is an that it is easy for the reader to gain a immense field of knowledge which has wrong impression of the situation. to be covered in that important activity.

That allowed to carry on in time of war, is a commercial adjunct to the problem because in the war the liberty and safety that will arise during the war, with which of the people are more at stake than they short-wave stations may be able to deal to are in time of peace. There should be our advantage. When we come to consider the question is alleged that it is not safe to allow the of information within Australia, I venpeople to know everything.

The press, and nowadays the radio, in wartime. The press meant by Sir no despotic authority over opinions of good citizens in time of war because it We are, after all is said and done, a we shall support and with what cause we shall ally ourselves. It should be noted that, in this connection, I use the word "" we "" not in an editorial sense, but to express the popular demand to be informed of the march of events.. The absence of news in time of Avar would create in this country apprehensions which ought not to exist, and might easily constitute a foundation upon which national unity would be very difficult to maintain. Indeed, absence of news might cause national unity to disappear. Sir Samuel Hoare went on to argue his point by saying that wartime would mean restrictions which would not entirely be connected with censorship itself. Economic problems would dictate the publication of newspapers smaller in size. Therefore the smaller and more independent journals, that is to say, more independent of conventional views, would have greater difficulty in surviving. Thus the newspaper information open to the public would tend to become less, in the sense that news could not be made available because it was wartime, and war conditions also lessened the supply of general neAvs. Sir Samuel Hoare went on to deal with the censorship of news in peacetime, to which, he said, he was strongly opposed. He added that it was important that his vieAvs should be stated then, because in time of war it Avas very probable that not very much notice would be taken of him. He then saidEven in wartime I should like to see the censorship worked upon lines that are in harmony with our general conception of the place that the press should occupy in our national life, as a platform and a safety valve for purification and an independent bulwark of the public morale. The Minister for Information has signified his acquiescence in that declaration. Therefore, I very much regret that I have to bring to his notice a recent violation of that general principle by the department Avhich he administers. On Friday last there arose, at the camp at Woodside, in South Australia, a matter which was considered by those concerned to require ventilation. I have since represented this particular subject to the Minister for the Army( Mr Street), and I shall not deal with it at length now, but it related to a matter which, in the interim, has been greatly altered. This submission was made, in the first place, to my very able colleague in the Labour movement, the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of South Australia, the Honourable R. S. Richards. Mr Richards, believing that it was important that the matter should be ventilated, made a statement to the press of Adelaide on Saturday. On .Saturday night a newspaper called the Mail is published in that city. Mr Richards also made a statement to a representative of The Advertiser, the next issue of which was not published until the Monday morning. I understand that although The Advertiser this morning published a version of Avhat Mr Richards said, his statement was first completely censored and later partially censored. That is to say, it was completely suppressed for a period. I Avas for so long associated Avith the press and had such an intimate experience of the censorship in AvhatI sources of prefer to describe as a preA'ious incarnation, so long ago Avas it, that I know that when a newspaper says that it has not suppressed something it means that it has allowed a part of it to be published subsequently; therefore there has not been a total suppression. ThusI say that this statement by Mr Richards Avas completely suppressed for a while and then partially suppressed. The matter did not relate to any neAvs that Avould be of significance to the enemy; it did not relate to any treasonable activity in Australia. refer ? ditions obtaining in respect of men going on leave before being transferred to the East for training in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. That is a matter of first importance and it should be dealt with on its merits. The question of whether proper transport facilities were provided is a matter for decision by the Minister. Most certainly it is one for representation by members of this Parliament if complaints are made, and it should not be Avithheld from the knowledge of the Australian people. I must add that the Minister for the Army took action AvhenI brought the matter to his notice.",44,Products

Buti t would not have been fixed by now if I had not been told about it , or if my friend, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, had not been told about it. I am not aware of what is going on in many places throughout Australia, but apparently some people have a certain amount of confidence in my willingness to represent cases that have merit in them, and in that way matters of this kind come to my notice by a roundabout route. There was no cause for the censorship to jump down on that item of news about the Woodside camp; I draw attention to it at this early stage in the lif e of the Department of Informatio n because it affects the censorship aspect of the Minister's work, and because the kind of news made available to the Australian public w ill determine whether or not this important department is functioning in a way that w ill meet with the approbation of this Parliament. I give to the Minister the utmost credit for sincerity in hoping and desiring that his department w ill function properly; but I cannot help recalling to mind my indirect victimization by the censorship during the last war. I do not mind admitting that a Labour Prime Minister was in office for a considerable portion of that period. Londoni n August, 1917, that Prime Minister, the Right Honourable W . M . Hughes, was reported to have saidIn his capacity as a Minister in Australia the censor and the maximum number it had been his duty to impose restrictions on the press. He' had never .been able to convince the press of the necessity for these reI n A p r i l , 1918, the then Minister for Destrictions; and indeed, in his own most posifence, Sir George Pearce, had been so tive moments, ho had doubts about them himself. Through him the Australian press censor had his being. But he had never been able to understand the working of the censor's mind. Nor, often, could the Australian editors. That views represented an infinitesimal minwas their grievance. That statement was made by the present with that conference; I say that straight Attorney-General after three years' exaway. Only three of us could be said to perience of the censorship working under adhere in any way to the views his own administration, and after the most held by honourable gentlemen who sit on extraordinary exhibitions by himself of this side of the House. All of the other ruthless interference with public opinion, editors who attended that conference from about September, 1916, until the represented newspapers which, by and time of his arrival in London. In 1917, the British Government instances, a whole-hearted support to the appointed commissioners to inquire into Government. A sub-committee appointed industrial unrest in certain areasT As the honourable point out to the House that this is not irrelevant, because it relates to the manner in which the public are deprived of news-and the commissioners, in a report published in the debates of the House of Commons on the 2nd December, 1920, saidThe Government have all through been toomuch afraid of the public; they have not realized how solid and unbroken is the determination to finish the war, and they seem to have been led by a few spasmodic outbreaks and irresponsible utterances to the opinion that there was a dangerous element who might misuse any information it obtained. That view was expressed this afternoon by the Leader of the Country party ( Mr. Archie Cameron), who said that the public should not be given all of the information available. The commissioners went on to sayThe result has been that the public has been kept in the dark, not only on military matters, but on matters on which no necessity for secrecy existed. When1 recall what took place under the censorship in Australia during the last w a r I notice that the Minister is frowning ; obviously he has the same outlook no relation to what the honourable gentleman was saying. the censorship myself, and I did frown about it almost daily during the last war.

221,Speaking I N Mr Curtin,"I could f r o wn aboutin the words of ""Professor Ernest Scott, compiler of the Official History of Australia in the War, "" practically all its members unanimously affirmed "". That report statedThat the only proper function of the press censorship is to prevent the publication of matters that might be of naval or militar y value to the enemy, offensive to an ally, or likely to embroil us with a friendly power. I subscribe to that declaration. That ought to be the proper function of a censorship. The sub-committee then presented a finding, which the conference adopted, couched in the following terms:It protests against the use of censorship for political purposes, and further declares that the employment of the censorship to prevent publication of matter which, in the opinion of the censor, is calculated to prejudice recruiting, has itself become highly prejudicial to recruiting by hindering the redress of grievances. That is the point to which I return in relation to the matter which arose at the Woodside camp. "" By hindering the redress of grievances "", may be expounded in the following way: by not allowing the public to know that there are grievances, by therefore making it difficult for public men or members of Parliament to take action, because they may not know or, if knowing, may not have sufficient public opinion formed behind them to redress that grievance, the Government being adamant either owing to financial considerations or for other reasons. The very fact that there is unvoiced discontent, unvoiced because it is prevented from being stated to the public, is itself a core around which national division and national disunity are certain to germinate. At this early stage it is desirable to put on record our experience and our deductions from our previous knowledge of the censorship, so that the Minister and his officers may have a clear conception of what they owe to the Parliament and the country. As the Minister himself has said, this very important department is as yet experimental. When we had our last experience of the censorship approximately 1843 newspapers and periodicals were being published regularly in Australia. The number is somewhat smaller to-day. Many newspapers and periodicals will not require any aid from the Department of Information, but others, anxious to avoid the publication of misstatements or inaccuracies, will appeal to it for assistance. It is, therefore, of the first importance that the department shall be soundly staffed and that its work shall be done with a maximum of expedition. The Minister realizes that he is dealing with news. It is perfectly true that news 24 hours old loses its vitality and that rapidity in the collection and presentation of news is essential. News, hot news unsafe news! news that has been verified. That is of value. I am moved to make these remarks because a little of the data which the department seems to be distributing has reached me. I take it that the matter to which I refer came to me from the Ministry for Information. It may, of course, have come from the Ministry for External Affairs. unless the Leader of the Opposition shows it to me. tiveness of the work of this department will depend greatly upon whether the news is made available quickly or otherwise. One of the activities of the department adumbrated in the Minister's statement was voluntary work. The honourable gentleman said that a good deal of the work was being carried out by honorary councils in the State. distribution purposes only. mean that these councils are concentrating on the distribution of leaflets? sarily. There are various organizations which have held meetings, and so on. what the Minister intends to convey, but I know that he has called meetings of a great variety of organizations in the various capital cities. As the honourable member for Bass( Mr BaTnard) stated, the president of a musical society was invited to attend one meeting.

229,Mr Curtin,"I am not quite surewhich the Minister or the principal officer of his department in the State, or some other officer, has delivered an address. I have not attended any of these meetings, hut I have read reports of them. Sir of the various meetings have been published. the reports, and all I can gather from them is that a speech had been made in which it was stated in effect that the Minister had declared, as he has declared in the House, that it was the purpose of his department to make available the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It was said that the department was concerned in the effectual presentation of reliable news of occurrences at home and abroad, so that the Australian public would always have available a complete knowledge of events. That is the sort of speech that one would expect to be delivered at such a place. But the Minister is making a mistake if he expects, by the organizing of public assemblages of this kind, to distribute information effectively. should confine its attention to the supplying of information to newspapers, radio stations, and so on. Educational authorities, university professors, and others in like circumstances should be kept informed. interests might also be kept in mind, if we include them among the educational department interests as those informed it would do much more effective work than it will do by using its machinery to whip up people to public meetings in order to hear addresses or receive pamphlets for distribution. If the department confined itself to the issue of reliable data and to documentation for the guidance of newspapers, radio stations and the like, as well as to publicists who desire to make speeches or to write articles, we shou'd be assured that these authorities would have what we call "" the bones of the thing"". speeches or articles could be relied upon as to facts and statistics. Persons who wish to make speeches or write articles on, for example, the relations between Britain and Poland, or Britain and Belgium, should be able to go to the department for information. They should also be able to obtain from it authentic information on such a matter as the latest "" lineto devote its attention to matters of the kind I have indicated it could perform a have read some of useful service. I put it to the Minister that the only points upon which I have profound discontent are the whipping up of people to public meetings and the entrusting of the work of his department to honorary councils. I agree with the honourable member for Bourke that it is far better that the censorship should be entrusted to a civilian department than to the Defence Department. gentleman went back on that. thing to the effect that the exception he made was in relation to the Minister, but that was only after he became annoyed. I conclude with the reflexion that it is not new for Australia to experience a His department censorship, and it is not new for us to see newspapers used for the purposes of propaganda as to the activities of governments during the conduct of a war. I believe that a Department of Information may serve a very reliable purpose The motion picture internally in that it may be a source of authoritative news and impartial in the presentation of facts to the people. It instrumentalities. If the can be, too, a channel through which were to keep such the view of Australia may be conveyed to overseas countries. I conclude by a quotation from John Milton, who, in 1644, wroteGive me liberty to know, to utter, and to [Leave to continue given.] argue freely according to conscience, above all liberty. Those words should be written up as a slogan in the office of every censor acting under the authority of this department. We are discussing a statement of the Minister for Information ( Sir Henry Gullett). After listening to the contributions that have been made In other words, their to this debate, not only by members of the Opposition, but also by some members on the Government side of the House, it would appear that this new department has been wrongly named.",49,Products

233,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [8.40],"It sliould have been termed the department for the suppression of information. Probably a still more suitable name for it would be the United Australia party war propaganda committee. That, at any rate, would be a correct definition of it. The only thing that I can say in favour of the department is that possibly the Minister in charge would be no more usefully employed if he were in charge of any other department. The people undoubtedly regard this new department as a pubiic joke. This is the first occasion, I believe, on which we have been told that a public department should be dependent to a very great extent on voluntary help. The Minister for Information has engaged a bevy of Melbourne society belles to do the work. These women, according to the Minister, are employed in a voluntary capacity, because the nature of the work is such as to make it impracticable to employ persons regularly. So far as I can understand, the only information that the department has disseminated is that contained in speeches of members of the Government. I cannot imagine how work of that kind can possibly become urgent. If there is real work to be done the Government should give it to people to do on a regular basis. If these society belles in Melbourne are anxious to render some service to the Government or the country they should offer themselves to some voluntary organization such as the Red Cross Society. Any work which the Department of Information has to do and which requires the services of girls should be given to girls who are in need of work. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that, so far, the chief concern of this department seems to have been to popularize war. Nothing which is considered to tend towards the prevention, or the hindering, of the Government's war policy receives any consideration whatever from this department. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) raised the question of whether the activities of the department should be discharged as at present or as a branch of the Defence Department. Personally, I believe that the officers of both the Defence Department and the Department of Information are liable to abuse any power given to them. If there is one thing that we should be morecareful about than another at present, it is that the liberties of the country and the right of free speech of the peopleshall be preserved. People should be permitted to express their opinions freely, even though they may happen to be hostile to the Government. We had an illustration recently of the manner in which this department misuses its powers. An industrial dispute occurred, involving some Lascar seamen, who had left their employment in Sydney, not because they were anxious to prevent the Government from proceeding with its war plans, but merely because they thought that, in view of the additional risk they were called upon to take by going to sea, they were entitled to some additional remuneration, and in cases where it was desired to be returned to their home port. When these requests were refused they left their vessels. The Department of Information prevented the publication of information about the dispute. When the Minister for Information was asked some questions on the subject in this House he said the dispute was due, not to unsatisfied demands for an increase of wages, but to the operations of certain sinister influences which were seeking to foment trouble and were hostile to the continued prosecution of the war. The Minister said that he had evidence to this effect in his possession, but when he was asked to make it available to honourable members he evaded the issue. He will, doubtless, continue to evade the issue by meeting all requests to release the information with the reply that "" the matter is still under consideration "". It will, of course, remain under consideration until Parliament goes into recess. 1 shall indicate the extremes to which these gentlemen can go. When I asked the Prime Minister who was responsible for the appointment of the gentlemen, engaged in censorship work, and from whom they were to accept their directions-whethe r directions were to be given to them solely by the Commonwealth authorities-the right honourable gentleman said he would make inquiries. So far, I have not received that information from him. But on this point I am able to give to the House some information which was given member for Bourke said that he had seen to me by a gentleman who, I assume, them.

Although the Censor has determined that the Prime Minister's statement should be censored, the right honourable gentleman himself, so far as I am aware, has not yet withdrawn that statement. Evidently he still believes that his statement is completely in order. I rose merely in order to make a few observations in regard to this department, because I agree with quite a number of honourable members that expenditure in this direction is useless. have been waiting patiently to hear an authoritative statement on behalf of the department as to what is happening overseas. Only to-day, I read a statement in the Argus attributed to Lord Raglan, late of the Grenadier Guards, who was attached to the Department .of Information in England. He said that he was sick and tired of wasting his time. He had been given a few books to read, and was asked if he wanted assistance. He decided to resign, because he realized that the activities of the department were sheer waste. The Minister has called together representatives interests in the different States to gatherings, which one might liken to United ber referred to limousines. Australia party mothers' meetings; at these assemblies he voiced meaningless that they were not limousines phrases, after which all had a cup of tea. Such gatherings were merely so much kind of car. show.

As bers to exercise the greatest vigilance and [18 ] these gentlemen have already stifled the voice of the Prime Minister, we can imagine what action they would take in respect of a private member. Honourable members who believe in democratic government, and in defending the liberties which they allege they enjoy in this country, should realize that those liberties are rapidly being filched from them by this Fascist-minded Government. They should ascertain exactly what is happening in regard to this department. They should insist on the fullest information being given to them. They should not be satisfied with replies of the kind which the Minister has so far attempted to put across in this House, in which he says that requests will receive consideration and that certain statements made by honourable members are untrue. A mere assertion by the Minister that a statement is untrue does not prove that it is not true. To-day, I asked a question with regard to the use of government cars by the volunteer workers to whom I have referred, and the Minister replied that the cars were not being used by those people. If honourable members wish to know the truth of the matter, they should ask for a complete statement in regard of various to it. that. care with regard to this department.

243,Mr Ward,"I urge honourable memthey make inquiries regarding the activities of these particular gentlemen, I think they will agree that the greatest service they can do to the people of Australia is to abolish this department, which is being used merely as a medium for the dissemination of United Australia party war propaganda. It appears to me that this department is divided into two sections, one dealing with censorship, and the other with information. So far as the first section is concerned, certain progress has been made. An organization has been set up, and certain forms of censorship have been applied. Much debate has taken place on that point. Various honourable members have given to the House their knowledge of the application of the censorship, and have dealt with the history of censorship generally. We are aware of the abuses of censorship. .We are mindful also of its threats to freedom of speech. Most honourable members, in the course of their public careers, have experienced the hand of the censor. I have not been immune from experiences of that kind. However, as that aspect of the censorship has been fully dealt with by honourable members, I do not propose to dwell upon it. I intend to make a few observations with regard to the information section of this new department. This branch will experience great difficulty in the distribution of news in competition with the daily newspapers and other publications which have at their disposal world-wide organizations for the collection of news. Newspaper enterprises have such wide ramifications, enjoy so great an influence, and possess such efficient means for the collection of details from various parts of the world that it would be almost impossible for any other organization to compete with them. I do not know whether the Minister hopes to be able to compete with the press, but I scarcely think that that can be the intention of the Government. Indeed, I do not think that it would be possible for the new department to supply to the public information in regard to happenings overseas more quickly than is the case at present. dissemination of news by means of newsThe honourable member for Bourke( Mr papers and the radio, knowledge of current events is conveyed to the public by well-informed commentators, whose specialized knowledge of history, geography and economics enables them to make valuable deductions from happenings in Europe and elsewhere. Therefore, it appears to me that if the department did attempt to compete with the existing facilities it would not be in the race at all. this matter in a practical way, and not expect from this department information available from other sources which it cannot supply. Circumstances have changed greatly since the war of 1914-18. 1 understand that information as to the movements and proposals of countries ruled by dictators is not available in the same degree as it was in . the past. In Germany, for instance, it is not now the custom for those in power to indicate their intentions, as in a democracy the Government informs the parliament of its purpose and obtains its approval before final action is taken. Rather is it found that, under a dictatorship, final decisions are determined by a few persons, and consequently the sources of information which previously existed are not now available. Indeed, in many instances no indication of the Governments intention is given until action has been actually taken. But when something does happen, the agencies which exist for ' the acquiring and the dissemination of news cause the facts to be flashed across the world; news which, a quarter of a century ago, would have been sent by cablegram is now dispatched by the almost instantaneous medium of radio, so that within a few hours of any important event taking place the whole world hears of it. So great has been the advance in the spread of information during the last two decades that even if the Government were to devote all of its energy to this new department, I believe that it would be outdistanced entirely by other agencies. I desire to show in what ways the new",53,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were

248,Mr Beasley,"We should look atBlackburn) said that there was certain work which it might do. The Minister must appreciate that members of the Opposition fear that the department will be used to justify whatever policy the Government decides upon in the conduct of the war. At the moment, the heat and passion which were associated with the previous war have not been engendered to any considerable degree. Certainly, boiling point has not yet been reached. So far, there has been no great agitation, and consequently the differences between the Government and its opponents have not yet fully developed; But we do not know what the future may hold in this connection. Naturally, the Government will seek to justify its policy, but the course followed by it may be entirely wrong iu the view of many persons in the community. The Government may take action of which the Opposition strongly disapproves. alone will prove whether that will be so or not; but the Minister should have regard to the fact that many honourable members on this side of the chamber have vivid recollections of what happened between 1914 and 191S. Some of them suffered a good deal at the hands of the then Government for their courage in expressing views which conflicted with that Government's intentions. Honourable members cannot be expected to have forgotten the sufferings and hardships which they and others endured at that time, and for that reason the Government should not be astonished if they fear that such things may happen again. Now is the time to express such fears in the hope that there will not be a recurrence of former happenings, for what happened before can happen again. I wish now to make some suggestions as to the way in which the department may make information available to various sections of the community. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) 3poke of meetings which had been called in the various States to discuss this subject, and the Minister said that the purpose of the meetings was to arrange the organization whereby information could be made available through the various organizations represented at such gatherings. Certain sections of the community are interested in the war only, or particularly, as it affects them. instance, many trade unionists are concerned with any possible action of the Government in the industrial field which may affect their employment. The new department would render a great service if it supplied full information of the Government's intentions in regard to industry generally. It may be said that it is not desirable for the Government to disclose any detailed intentions in regard to such matters as the building of .ships and aeroplanes, but it appears to me that much good might result if some pronouncement on these and kindred subjects were made, so that the trades which would be called upon to supply the necessary skilled labour could plan accordingly. that better than the press. Time the press sometimes are not sufficiently authoritative to convey conviction. We frequently read of the Government's intentions in certain directions, only to be told later in some official pronouncement that the report is incorrect. Personally, I do not readily accept unauthorized statements which I read in the press, and it is for that reason that I have frequently advocated that pronouncements of Government policy should be made in the Parliament. Should the Government embark on a policy of aircraft construction, skilled labour of various kinds will be necessary. Some time will elapse in obtaining men possessing the requisite skill. The men may be in Australia, but they may he scattered, some in north Queensland, others, perhaps, in Western Australia or Tasmania. If it were known that the Government intended to embark on such a programme, and that certain skilled labour was required, those concerned could plan accordingly, and thereby avoid any attempt that may be made for the dilution of labour to which the trade unions are opposed. Proper planning and organizing would avoid many difficulties. Of my own experience I can speak of the lack of proper planning by the Government in connection with some of its undertakings. I have in mind particularly naval construction and matters affecting the metal trade industries. For Authoritative information on such",54,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were
249,Mr Holloway,No agency could do,55,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were
250,Mr Beasley,"Statement s made inmatters would be of great value to tbe particular sections of tbe community concerned, and would prove of real benefit in the crisis. It may be that the new department will function as a clearing house for information of various kinds. Regular memoranda containing necessary information could be issued to the various departments. During the recent parliamentary recess I found it impossible to obtain from the Department of Commerce definite information appraisements, the storage of wool, the movements of ships and tugs, appointment of staff, and so on.' I could not ascertain even the name of the secretary of the State Wool Committee, his address, or the powers vested in him, nor could I learn by what means representations to that body could be made by persons who desired either to dispose of their products or to obtain information. Probably other honourable members had a like experience, and it may be that in respect of other departments also a similar state of affairs existed. The dissemination of this type of information by the new department would be of great importance, the tremendous powers now vested in the Government by the National Security Act. Almost every day regulations are made by some Minister pursuant to the authority conferred upon him by that statute, which permits certain decisions to be made and matters of policy to be implemented which formerly would have required special legislation by the Parliament. As the result of the exercise of powers which the Government has taken to itself we do not know what problems we are up against until we receive complaints from our constituents. This practice has resulted in dissatisfaction and confusion among the people generally. A matter which might well be considered by the Minister for Information is the co-ordination by his department of information regarding the activities of the various departments, boards and committees established by the Government. Grave dissatisfaction exists in regard to tenders a fair deal in regard to the prices for equipment for governmental purposes, because of the inability of prospective tenderers to secure copies of Mr Beasley. specifications from the local Tender Board. A few weeks ago a Sydney firm was invited to submit a quote for certain telegraphic requirements of the Government. The intimation that a quote was desired reached them for the first time on Saturday, and they were informed that the tender was to be in Melbourne on the following Tuesday. When they applied to the Tender Board for a copy of the specifications, they found that no copy was available, nor was a copy to be had from the Ordnance Branch of the regarding wool Defence Department. But for representations made by me that the time for quoting should be extended for 48 hours the Sydney firm would not have hacT an opportunity to submit a price. This incident gave rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction and created in the mind of this firm an impression that the work was being cornered by people nearer to head-quarters. I have no wish to drag into this discussion the exercise of Melbourne influence, but that was certainly put forward as a reason why the Sydney firm was not given a proper opportunity to submit a price in this instance. Apart from the dissemination of in view of actual war news, the Department of Information could perform a very valuable service, not only to members of Parliament whose duty it is' to serve their constituents as best they can, but also to those interested in government contracts, such as business firms and trade union workers, if complete information regarding all phases of government activities were co-ordinated in the various branches of the department. Eor instance, the department should be able to supply ful l details regarding the marketing of primary products-wool , wheat, hides, skins, beef, lamb and mutton-the control of which now rests almost entirely in the hands of a multiplicity of boards and committees set up by the Government. What chance has the average primary producer interested in dried fruits, butter, hides, skins, or any other commodity to obtain information which would enable him to determine whether or not he is getting at which his commodity is sold, and a fair share of the markets available for its disposal? Instructions could be issued to the heads of all Commonwealth departments to supply the Department of Information with the fullest details of every move, decision and activity of boards or committees operating under government control. For instance, what does the average wool-grower know of the ramifications of the Central Wool Committee? Are we expected to go to the Central Wool Committee in Melbourne or to the State committees to ascertain what is being done in certain directions? able member did so, the Central Wool Committee could not tell him because its members are under an oath of secrecy. be carried so far as it is to-day. That and only government and diplomatic mail is point, however, has still to be argued. be argued successfully. information that these boards and comdisclose certain information because inmittees could supply would be very structions not to do so had come from valuable, and if they were compelled to Great Britain.

Before the department was established it was the practice for the Prime Minister to make statements to the House regarding the international situation; but those statements were only a re-hash of items that had already been published in the press. One means of eliciting information is the asking of questions in the House. To-day I addressed the following question, upon notice, to the Minister for Information:Does lie approve of the action of the censor in opening letters from honorahle members of this House addressed to persons in other parts of the British Empire? The answer given by.the Minister wasPostal censorship is based on regulations are uniform throughout the Empire, exempted therefrom.

Like the statement made by the New South Wales Censor in reply to a question by the honourable member for East Sydney, the Minister suggests that this policy is dictated from the centre of the Empire. It is interesting to note that some busybody, who has no right to do so, is permitted to read a letter sent by a membei of this House to a friend in another dominion. Any member of this House who swears allegiance to His Majesty the King should not have his letters censored. I have been asked if I know of more than one instance in which a member's letter has been censored. I hope I shall never hear of another case. of a letter addressed to a member of the Australian Cabinet being opened by the British censor. source from which the Government got the idea. It may be that the British censor had good reason for doing so. We have been told by the Prime Minister on more than one occasion that the rights of the individual would not be suppressed by any form of censorship unless, in exercising them, he was doing something which may be of value to the enemy. A portion of an article which appeared in a recent issue of Common Cause, the journal of the Coalminers Federation was excised at the direction of the Censor. That, passage merely pointed out that it was necessary to organize in such a way as to bring about, at the conclusion of hostilities a better state of affairs than obknock if it is coming' to them, and there tained after the last war. After representations had been made by the honourable member for East Sydney, the Prime Minister admitted that he did not approve of the action of the Censor in that instance. What action is taken by the Censor with regard to news commentaries broadcast over the air? Night after night statements such as those which were excised from Common Cause are made by the "" Watchman"" and Dr. Louat, of 2GB, Sydney. men need for organization for the peace, but no attempts have been made by the Censor to restrain them. I say that censorship is a very dangerous thing. I am not enamoured of any kind of censorship, though I recognize that it may be necessary to prevent the publication of certain information that might be of real value to the enemy. Once a censorship is established, however, it does not content itself *with the suppression of information of that kind ; it suppresses matter that could very well be published. During the last few days it was frequently reported that the German battleship Deutschland had been sunk. The report has been affirmed and denied half a dozen times, until now we do not know what the truth is. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) surprised me by saying that, even if the report were true, it might be unwise to publish it. Why, I ask, should that be so? The British Government does not hesitate to publish the number of ships that have been sunk by mines and submarines, or to inform the public regarding the ships that have been scuttled by the Germans. Therefore I see no reason why we should not have been told the truth about the Deutschland. I believe that the public should be told the truth; they cannot be told too much. They would be better citizens, and would have a fuller sense of their responsibilities if the authorities took them into their confidence. There is too much secrecy and humbug at the present time. If they were allowed to know the truth, the people would be the better for it, and the Government would be none the worse. I have a great admiration for the people of this country. They can take a is no reason why the Government should try to pamper them. I know something about the censorship that operated in Australia during the period 1914-18. I know that whole columns of the Daily Standard, the Labour newspaper published in Brisbane, were sometimes blacked out by order of the censor. There was not even time to re-print the paper. Some of the matter that was suppressed at that time would make interesting readBoth of these gentleing if it were published now. In the have repeatedly urged the Queensland Parliament, reference was made to certain things that took place at that time, and those references were published in Hansard No. 37. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister,",57,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were
258,Mr Street,I could cite an instance,58,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were
259,Mr Martens,"That may be theand he threatened that any one who re-published those statements would be arrested. The threats were not carried out, but there was tremendous agitation over the matter at the time, and during the disturbance "" B ill y "" was hit on the head with the famous egg at Warwick. There is no need for censorship of that kind. Stupid and prejudiced suppression of opinion achieves no purpose, and merely serves to arouse ill feeling. I am opposed to censorship of any kind, but if the Government has made up its mind that the people are not sufficiently grown up to be entrusted with the whole truth, then the censorship should have only a very limited application. The great bulk of the work done by the censorship department achieves no useful purpose whatsoever. The Minister for In formation ( Sir Henry Gullett) has told us that the work is being done by an honorary staff. He denied the statement by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that certain activities had been carried out at the cost of the department, and the Minister would be well advised to disprove the honourable member's statements if he is able to. If he can show the statement to be false he will have demonstrated that the honourable member for East Sydney has been telling lies, and is a man who is not worth listening to. I do not believe, however, that tlie Minister will be able to disprove the statement. I have not a great deal of confidence in ministerial assertions. For instance, the Postmaster-General answered a recent question of mine in part only, saying that it would be dangerous to give all information. affect the person concerned. that excuse for withholding information, notwithstanding the fact that I had been supplied with it in answer to questions covering the last twelve years. honourable member could show me that he had been supplied with similar information on previous occasions, I would furnish it this time. I should be put to the trouble of writing letters to the Minister to prove the point when he has all the information available in his own department. My complaint is that the Minister allows his department to be run by officials, instead of running it himself. Of course, I know why the information is not being supplied on this occasion. The rent of the old shack has been raised, and there is no other place to which the post office can be removed. I have no patience with being told that it is unwise to supply certain information publicly, but that thfile will be laid on the table and may be perused by honourable members. In nine cases out of ten there is no reason in the wide world why the information should not be published. We have to rely on the public press for information regarding what is taking place overseas, and we are often told that we cannot take too much notice of what appears in the press, the suggestion being that the Government is the sole fount of authoritative information. Then, weeks later, a re-hash of the news that has appeared in the papers over the intervening period is solemnly dished out by the department as something new. That is only wasting time. If this Department of Information is not able to supply us with anything better than this periodical re-hash of neAvspaper stories, there is no justification for its existence at all. If it can supply us with information not available from other sources, well and good; otherwise let the newspapers do the job. Recently, the honourable member for East Sydney asked a question of the Prime Minister, who supplied an answer, and then, later, gave a more lengthy statement on the same subject to the press. The censor, hoAvever, got to work on the statement which had been issued to the press, with the result that it did not appear. What was the sense of that? Surely no one will accuse the Prime Minister of having made public information that Avould be of use to the enemy. It Avould appear that there is some one influencing the censorship who is of more importance even than the Prime Minister -som e one, perhaps, who has been sent here from Great Britain. After listening to the Minister for In formation ( Sir Henry Gullett) I am not satisfied that this neAv department will be used, not to provide information, but to suppress it.

He The Minister does not impress me as a person who is disposed to be fair to the political opponents of the Government, and I am afraid that the department will be used to suppress the opinions of those who differ politically from. the Government. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are regarded in all democracies as things of the utmost importance, and they should be guarded jealously. I am afraid that these organizations which Lave been set up in the capital cities by the Minister to work in conjunction with his department will become propaganda centres for the United Australia party, and that they will be used to suppress the views of honourable members on this side of the House. We have to depend on the press for information regarding the war overseas. Some of the matter that appears in the newspapers is true, and some is not; we have to make up our minds what to accept and what to reject. I believe that the time has arrived when the people of Australia should be treated as adults. There is no reason why news should be suppressed merely because it is bad. The people should be told of the reverses that we suffer in this war just as we are told of successes. I am quite prepared to accept the bad news when it comes, and I know that the majority of the people in Australia are ready to do the same. They will not crack upthey want to know the truth. Frequently, however, statements are published in the newspapers one day and denied the next, so that the public do not know what to believe. There is need for the release, from time to time, of official statements, putting the facts clearly before the people. cuting the war to a successful issue. It That, however, is all that is necessary, and there is certainly no need for a separate department of information. has been called a war of nerves, and the Minister seems to think that it is necessary to protect the nervous systems of the people of Australia. Therefore, he has created an organization which the people do not want, but which will be used by the United Australia party to serve its Mr Mahoney. own ends. I fear that, even at election time, it will not hesitate to suppress the views of opposition candidates. I was in Sydney during the last war, when I heard a man declare, in the course of a public address, that was pulled off the stand, charged, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment because he disobeyed the censorship laws, although the citizens of a democracy are supposed to be entitled to freedom of speech. Who are the stalwarts who are to compose the committee to be set up in Hobart? Tea parties will probably be arranged by the National Federation to hear what the Minister is doing to help win the war. The right to broadcast messages to the people will, perhaps, be extended to members of his own party, but I see no reason why this privilege should not be shared by members of the Labour party and representatives of the trade union movement. anxious to boost the Labour party. Mi-. MAHONEY -It ds bent, of course, on keeping the Labour party out of office. We should fight for freedom of speech. There should be no suggestion that members of the Labour party would convey to the public information likely to be of use to the enemy.

I am in agreement with the Leader of the Opposition that it is desirable to suppress certain information, but I Avish to know why the department is to have a large staff, and why so much money is to be expended by it, because I have no doubt that its funds will be used to play political tricks to the detriment of the Labour party.

He even threatened me with to that question. tion help the enemy? ing information in order to show that the Government was hiding something with regard to its own management. The"" Minister for No Information "" stated recently that the war had not yet begun. If that is the kind of news he proposes to furnish to the people, it is high time his job was handed over to some body else. He is accustomed to writing stories, but the people do not desire his bed-time stories. What they wish to know is the true position, with regard to the war. I have asked for certain information, from the Minister for the Army, and he has dodged behind the censorship. He will do that in order to cover up any mismoney proposed to be used in carrying takes that he makes. But it is the duty of on this new department should be ex-members of this Parliament to preserve the rights of the democracy. I recall the intolerable persecution of members of the Labour movement when the conscription issue was being fought in 1916 and 1917. At that time men were batoned and imprisoned because they dared to oppose conscription. The present Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) was then a great force in the land, and men who spoke freely on behalf of the rights of the people were driven from the streets and cast into prison as though they were felons. batoned by policemen, because I dared to speak against the imposition of conscription. prisonment, although men near and dear to me were fighting overseas to end the brutal suppression of individual liberty. I am afraid that propaganda similar to that resorted to in Germany will be pracmade it clear that it will do nothing to tised in Australia; but the people of this country are prepared to face up to the position. If they are made aware of the unvarnished facts there will be no enemy. Certainly no member of the Opposition will do anything to assist the enemy. No doubt the ""Minister for Propaganda "" will accuse members of the Labour party of being anti-British. He put that tale over before on one violence, because I dared to disagree with him. He said to me, "" I ought to give you a thump under the earhole"". This is the Minister who is to be in charge of the censorship. What chance would I have of fair consideration from a Minister who threatened me in that way when he was a private member ? The Government had better appoint a new Minister, as quickly as possible, because I am afraid that the present occupant of the office will do much to damage the interests of the democracy. He should not be allowed to carry on the powerful organization of which he is in charge, because I am afraid that he will use his position against the working classes.

268,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"Minister for Information ( Sir Henry Gullett) has been entrusted with the development of a department that will have very wide ramifications which we learn are already being unjustly used. Its staff is said to consist largely of honorary workers distributed throughout the big cities of Australia, and, in the opinion of many people, most of these will be supporters of the party to which the Minister belongs. I know that he has invited co-operation; but, in view of the way in which the censorship has been exercised, according to speeches delivered by honourable members, one must be suspicious of the intentions of the Government. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) that the authorities dealing with the censorship should be civilians rather than military men. Our experience in the last war taught us that civilian control is far I do not know whether on the authority preferable to military control. When one learns that a statement amplifying remarks made in this House by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has been censored, one wonders to what extreme the censorship will be carried. Up to the present time we have had no evidence that reasonable restraint will be exercised. The first paragraph of the ministerial statement the aims of this new department and about a dozen further paragraphs deal with what is proposed to be done. The Minister says that it is intended to assemble and distribute information over the widest possible field, and by every available agency, and to keep the mass of the people as enlightened as possible and their spirit firm. I know of no better way in which the spirit of the people can be kept firm than by letting them know the truth. The Government has been unfair to the Parliament, and particularly to the Opposition, because it has not made available a great deal of information that we ought to have had. There are many others who feel as I do. As a member of Parliament, I am frequently asked for information concerning war developments, but I am unable to repeat more than I have read in the newspapers. When Parliament is in session honourable members should be the first people to get official information. should not have to get their news secondcountry is limited, and men will have to hand from the press. Mr Drakeford. Regarding censorship, there should be no restrictions in the nature of a restraint on criticism of the Government itself. The Government should see that the elected representatives of the people and citizens who have given attention to public matters should have the right to express themselves freely and reasonably. I concede that it is possible for such statements to be made as would warrant the laying of a charge., but there is the law to deal with that. If the censorship is operated in such a way that written or spoken views for which the writer or speaker would be responsible can be prevented, the Government will make the public of this Commonwealth uneasy. To cite an example of misleading information, recently it was announcedof the Department of Information -that the munitions establishments in my electorate had received orders from the British Government for the supply of munitions. The newspaper announcement wasFootscray district may expect a boom industrially with the ordering of millions of pounds worth of munitions from Australia by the British Government. First order is for £2,500,000 and munition gives a description of workers will be increased within the next 12 months from 8,000 to 13,000. A large number will be employed locally at the Footscray and Maribyrnong works. On the next day the employment office in Collins-street was besieged by people without any qualifications to engage in munitions work. When that information was made available to the press it should have made clear that the workers who would be needed would be men with experience in the metal trades. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) dealt capably with that aspect to-night, but it is incumbent upon me to impress upon the Government that the trade unions should be consulted and given an opportunity to voice their opinion as to how the provision of war power for skilled work in the munitions industry and those enterprises engaged in the manufacture of aeroplane engines and fusilages should be developed. The number of trained They engineers, fitters and turners in this be trained in the work if our war effort is to be as great as was outlined by the Prime Minister. In order to achieve that effort it will be necessary to draw skilled sit on the cross benches. The Minister men from other industries into the munitions industries. It will not be possible to do that without the co-operation of the trade unions. If the Ministry of Information is to justify its existence it will have to be utilized to make the trade unions feel that they are sharing in the work. co-operation. I do not want the Ministry to interpret what I am saying to mean that I am in favour of the establishment of the Ministry of Information, because I am not. I believe, with other honourable members, that this new department will cost a great deal more than the £22,500 per annum which the Minister for Information estimated, and that its functions could be satisfactorily performed 'by existing departments. In his speech, the Minister indicated that a great deal of the work done by the Ministry of Information will be undertaken by honorary workers. He said that people in various grades of society were giving their services. The Minister would find many deserving women who are seeking for work eminently suitable for employment on the class of work required. Their employment would add to the cost, but, if we are to have this department, we should not be looking for honorary workers who will be willing to do the work in return for the notoriety that they will achieve, and so keep others out of employment. That class of .person could be more usefully employed in doing Red Cross work or other similar war work which, has had the blessing of this Government. It seems that the Department of Information is to be a playground for the people in the higher strata of society, who will do as the Minister wants. That suggests that the department will not altogether be a non-partisan organization. way I feel about it . I speak frankly, and without any desire to be unfair. If the department is to be staffed with labour of that kind it will naturally be under suspicion. The Minister should pay heed to the criticism which has emanated not only from the Opposition, but also from Government supporters and honourable members who said in his speechI t was therefore decided to invite all organized bodies iu the Commonwealth to cooperate in a voluntary capacity with the department in spreading as widely and as fully as possible all. available information having direct and indirect bearing upon the war. That would make for better The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) declared in the House to-day that he, in his capacity as president of the Launceston Musical Comedy Society, received a letter over the signature of the Minister inviting his co-operation. I am a vice-president of the Northern Light Opera Society and also a patron of the Essendon Operatic Society and I have not received any such invitation. I am jealous. member is only the vice-president. I take an active interest in the doings of those societies and I have never heard of either of them having received an invitation similar to that which was sent to the honourable member for Bass. I spoke in jest, but I cannot understand why such an invitation was ever sent out. have responsible members, as the honourable member's own statement proves. it cannot be a serious move when invitations are sent to a comic opera society, especially as the work of this new department is to be directed mainly towards serious propaganda. of those societies may be musical, but they are none the less good citizens. ter suggest that that is the procedure to be followed? tions of all kinds were invited. should see that the mouth-organ bands are not overlooked in developing his plan.

278,Mr Drakeford,"The MinisterHouse of Assembly. That is a condition of affairs that should not be tolerated and is a gross interference with the liberties of responsible public men. Complaints have come to me of the dissatisfaction existing in regard to the treatment of soldiers in camp. If we are to be prevented from ventilating grievances, those grievances will continue and spread. I hope that the Minister will deal with that position. The facts must be faced. It appears that we are to have censorship whether we like it or not, but I suggest that the Minister for Information, who is experienced in matters affecting censorship, should issue instructions that would make impossible the occurrence of such things as were described by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), Professor Nicholson has stated definitely that censorship instructions have been given on an Empire basis. I resent that. We should not accept instructions from any other authority than the Commonwealth G-overnment, whatever party be in power, and those instructions should be made as wide and reasonable as possible. We do not want a repetition of what occurred in 1916 and 1917 when the conscription referenda were held. I hope that the Government will decide after all that the activities with which this new department is to be entrusted can be carried on without the department being continued. I make no personal reflection on the Minister-he is a partisan and so am I-but I hope that he will exercise such a control over the censorship as to give it a liberal outlook and ensure reasonable treatment of those things which the people wish to have made public during this period. That is the only way in which the censorship can be made tolerable. If that policy be followed there will be far less cause for comthe industry is to be continued by way of plaint in the future. When the Minister states that although at the outset he entermade law before the expiration of the tained some doubt as to the amount of assistance which the department would be able to give to the great metropolitan daily newspapers, they are now giving the required amount of space, one realizes that those dailies are, at all events, preplaced a number of returned soldiers on pared to publish whatever information is given to them. Eater the Minister said that 2,500 individual letters of invitation have been issued on his behalf to the bodies which have been mentioned by honourable members to-night and that he has received a gratifying response. The honourable gentleman should have informed honourable members which of the organizations are co-operating. I agree with the suggestion that has been made to-night that reports should be furnished by those bodies so that members of Parliament may know the nature of their activities. Unless that be done, those organizations will be under suspicion. It should be possible, through the agencies which, the Minister states, have already been developed, to obtain from time to time at least a summary of their activities. I trust that, in view of the adverse criticism that has who indicated that been voiced* to-night by members of all parties, and particularly by Government supporters, the Minister, if this department is to continue to operate, will adopt some of the constructive suggestions that have been offered, so that the public may have confidence that this new department is giving substantial and valuable information to the people of Australia. adjourned. WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BIL L 1939. Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.15]. I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is designed to ensure the continuance of the payment of a bounty on fortified wine exported from the Commonwealth. The existing Wine Bounty Act has been in operation since the 1st March, 1935, and expires on the 28th February, 1940, so that if assistance to bounty, it is necessary that this bill be present act. The wine industry of Australia has experienced many difficulties and setbacks in its history. After the last war Commonwealth and State Governments holdings for the purpose of growing wine grapes, and prior to 1924 the industry had been able to dispose in Australia of",63,Henby Gullett Ful L Reports Up Of Neutrals I F The Department Were

281,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie,"most of its production. In 1924, however, it became evident that assistance would have to be given to the industry in order to enable it to dispose of the increased production. The only outlet for the wine appeared to be on overseas markets, and after exhaustive inquiries it was decided, in 1924, to assist the inof this type of wine in Great Britain dustry by way of a bounty on fortified wine exported. The object of the bounty was twofold: First, to enable wine-makers to sell their wine; secondly, to enable grape-growers to obtain a reasonable price for their grapes. The amount of bounty decided upon was 4s. a gallon of wine, but this included an amount of Is. 3d. a gallon which exporters had paid as excise duty on the spirit used in the fortibounty would undoubtedly result in the fication of the Avine, the net amount of bounty being 2s. 9d. a gallon. Since 1924 the Government has continued to pay a bounty on wine exported, but the rate has varied considerably, and has been at a reduced scale. In 1927 the amount of bounty was Is. 9d. a gallon; in the 1934 act a sliding scale of bounty was prescribed. During the first two years of the operation of that act the rate paid was Is. 3d. a gallon. In the succeeding three years a reduction of Id. a gallon each year was provided for, with the result that the rate for 1939 is Is. a gallon. the wine, and also provides each year That is the rate proposed in this bill, with seasonal occupation for a large number provision for the continuance thereof for a further period of five years. Payment of bounty on wine exported undoubtedly has been of material assistance to wine grape-growers and winemakers throughout the Commonwealth. The expansion of the export trade in wine has been considerable. In 1924"" exports were approximately 142,000 gallons. In 1934 the quantity exported was over 2,600,000 gallons, and during the past five years an increase of approximately 500,000 gallons has taken place. In June, 1939, approximately 18,500,000 gallons of fortified wine was held in bond in Ausbralia. The quantity of fortified wine consumed on the domestic market annually is estimated to be about 3,500,000 gallons, and, unless more facilities be provided for the sale of wine in Australia, there does not appear to be much prospect of increasing local consumption in the near future. If the bounty be discontinued, export will practically cease and the large quantities of wine which are at present sold overseas will be thrown on to the local market, with disastrous results. Australian wine marketed in the United Kingdom meets severe competition from wines made in the United Kingdom from imported must. Sales have increased from 3,250,000 gallons in 1934 to 6,000,000 gallons in 1938. The State Governments of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria are materially interested in this industry, as each government has invested large sums of money in irrigation settlements in which wine grape-growing is an important industry. Discontinuance of the ruin of hundreds of returned soldier grape-growers, and would cause the interested State governments to suffer heavy financial losses. The export of fortified wine from Australia has added considerably to Australian credits overseas, the value of exports during the past five years having ranged between £747,000 in 1935 and £920,000 in 1938-39. A large amount of capital is invested in this industry, which employs a considerable number of persons growing the grapes and . manufacturing of grape-pickers, carters and labourers during the vintage period. From 1924 to 1930 the bounty on wine exported was paid from Consolidated Revenue, but in the latter year the burden of financing the industry was partially placed on the industry itself. This was achieved by increasing the excise on fortified spirit by os. a proof gallon, the extra amount thus collected being paid into a trust fund, from which the bounty was to be paid. Provision was also made that, if the amount received from the extra excise collections was at any time insufficient to pay the bounty in full, the deficiency would be made up from Consolidated Revenue. The provisions of the Financial Emergency Act in 1932 limited the sum that could be drawn from Consolidated Revenue in any one financial year to £96,000. The Wine Bounty Act also was amended to provide that, should the money available for distribution as bounty be insufficient to pay the bounty in full, bounty should be paid pro rata. During the last two years the money paid into the trust fund provided sufficient money to pay the bounty, and in the last financial year £193,196 was paid into the trust fund, whereas the amount paid as bounty was £167,872, showing a surplus of £25,324. In this bill provision is made for a contribution from Consolidated Revenue of any amount up to £50,000 in any financial year sliould the money received into the trust fund be not sufficient to meet all claims for bounty. This maximum contribution is considered to be quite adequate, as the indications are that the. amount received into the trust fund from the extra excise collections will meet all than the 31st July next succeeding the demands likely to be made. Under the wine bounty legislation grape-growers have been protected by the fixation of minimum prices for grapes used in the production of wine for export. These prices are fixed each year by the Minister before vintage, and the procedure has been of inestimable value to grape-growers. It has resulted in grapegrowers generally receiving a reasonable price for all grapes produced, despite the fact that the Commonwealth Government has no authority to fix the price of grapes used in the production of wine sold oni the domestic market. makers, generally speaking, have paid for all grapes the prices fixed by the MinMinister for the Army( Mr Street) ister for Trade and Customs since 1927, irrespective of whether such grapes were used for wine to be sold on the domestic market, or exported. There is, however, a feeling of instability owing to the fact that the Commonwealth Government has no power to fix the prices of grapes for use in the domestic market. It is understood, however, that consultations have been held between the various States interested in the wine industry, and that draft legislation is being considered by the States for the purpose of controlling prices and plantings of wine grapes. If prices of grapes in the domestic market and plantings could be controlled, dt would be of immense value to winemakers, as it would, no doubt, protect the value of the huge stocks on hand which, in the main have been produced from grapes paid for at Ministerial prices fixed under wine bounty legislation'. There are some new provisions in the Day No. 2 ""War Activities of the this bill. One is the stipulation for a Fighting Services""? Mr John Lawson. harvesting payment to growers within one month from the delivery of grapes to the winery. Although this is an innovation in wine bounty legislation, I understand that it is a . practice for wine-makers to make advances to growers in order to help them to finance their harvesting operations. In 1934 provision was made requiring payment to be made for grapes within a period of twelve months. If cash were paid by a prescribed time, a discount was allowed off the minimum price. This provision has been incorporated in the bill, but whereas, in the past the first payment for grapes was payable not later date of delivery of the grapes, it is proposed in this bill to make the first payment due on the 30th June. I have dealt with this bill on somewhat general lines but I am prepared to explain any point that may arise when the measure is in committee. adjourned.
