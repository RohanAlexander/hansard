A t the same time the Government are not prepared to place all these engines on the free list. We think that, under the circumstances, a fair compromise would be to make both turbines and high speed engines dutiable at 15 per cent. The definition of high-speed engines which has been supplied to us by an expert is this:A high-spoed engine must be capable of being run continuously for eight hours at a speed ol not less than 400 F.S. per minute, and when filled with its usual means of lubrication must show no signs of its benrings becoming heated so as to interfere with its effectiveness. I ask the committee not to place high-speed -engines upon the free list, because we cannot say to what extent the revenue may be -affected if they do so. has obtained a very fair definition of a high speed engine, and I have here a number of illustrations which will do more than any description to show what complicated machines they are. I do not raise any objection to the minimum number of revolutions pre.scribed, because high-speed engines will work much faster than that, and some of them are capable of being driven at 550 revolutions per minute. Since we have now decided upon a definition, I will follow the Minister in his proposal to impose a duty of 15 per cent, upon both classes of engines, because my sole desire was to place them on .an equal footing. stands in the order of recommittal, we should not be in a position to deal with it in the way we desire.

These exemptions seem to go as far as is necessary except in one respect.

These tools are used in making such machines as the rock drills to which the Minister has referred, and are intended to afford extra facilities to those engaged in an industry which is of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth. The committee are to be asked to place, upon the free list such tools of trade as sausage-stuffers, pork-scorers, sticking-knives, and even threelegged glue pots, and yet the Ministry do not seem favourably disposed towards my request that tools of trade which are of the utmost importance to the engineering industry shall be exempted from duty. The honourable member for-Dalley has made a great song about the firm which he has mentioned having abstained from asking for any special assistance. But there are many other large companies and firms, especially in tlie iron trade, which have not approached any honourable member with a view of obtaining assistance under the Tariff. I am somewhat in the dark as to how far the amendment goes. I understand that most of the tools contemplated by the amendment are already on the free list, and I do not see why we should limit the exemptions to tools driven by any particular motive power. It is desirable that all tools necessary in the construction of engines, iron-work, and machinery should be placed on the free list, and it is the wish of the committee, and of the Government, that they should be exempted; but we should know what we are doing. the honourable member to withdraw the amendment. He can then telegraph for information as to what electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic machine tools are already upon the free list. I believe that most of them are included i u the schedule of exemptions. We can afterwards ascertain whether any of these tools which are not exempt from duty should be added to the free list.

From a free-trade point of view it is just as good as was the speech of the honourable member for Moreton the other evening.

That the following exemption be added:""Saddle-trees."" I am in receipt of information from Queensland that the saddle-trees manufactured in Victoria are not what they are represented I must ask to be. In this connection Mr Wieneke,. who -is one of the principal saddlers within the Commonwealth, writes-I am quite in accord with Mr Johnson that the duty upon saddle-trees should be removed. Could we get a decent article in the colonies it might be different, but I have had the Melbournemade tree, and it is utterly unsuitable for the class of saddle chiefly required in Queensland. WhatI have seen are fit only for cheap saddles and light work, and are generally used about the cities. As a great portion of the population of the colonies make their living in the saddle, and are of the poor class, this duty is a further tax on them.

23,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I moveare not so skilled as are those abroad, but they do not put the same class of workmanship into the locally-made article. A second letter bearing upon this question, which I have received from another constituent, saysI take the liberty of addressing you on a matter which concerns our trade generally, and that is, to use your influence to have saddle-trees placed on the free list when they come to be considered. They are now subject to a duty of 25 per cent. ; previously they came in free in Queensland. No doubt there will be a big fight amongst the Victorian members to help the duty ou, as there are a few made in Victoria. I would point out that the Victorian tree is not nearly as good as the home tree, neither in shape, timber, nor anything else, and it will be a great hardship if we are compelled to use them, which iii some cases we would have to do. Every one must know that an enormous number of saddles are used in the western portion of Queensland. The saddle is an article which is practically the raw material of the bushman. The lives of nine-tenths of the stockmen engaged in the western portion of Queensland frequently depend upon a good saddle. I , therefore, appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs to place saddle-trees upon the free list. shall heartily support the amendment. In this connection I may mention that two or three years ago a saddlery firm commenced business in the district which I represent. Upon my last visit to BathurstI was asked to visit this particular establishment. I did so, and was assured by the head of the firm that in consequence of the duty which had been levied upon saddle-trees and other articles, they had had to dispense with half their employees. Formerly they sold a number of saddles at about £ 2 5s. each. wholesale price at which these saddles were supplied to customers in the western district. Owing, however, to the increased cost of the articles used in the manufacture, this gentleman was compelled to raise prices, with the result that his establishment became overstocked. Even protectionists do not like to see the number of employees reduced. I believe there is one establishment in Victoria where these saddle-trees are made; but surely the whole people of the Commonwealth are not to be taxed in order to keep two or three men employed? It would be better to pay these men their wages, and allow them to walk about idle, rather than inflict such an injustice on people who have sufficient difficulties to contend with. made in Victoria they can be made elsewhere. dle-trees made in Victoria are not up to the standard. The manufacturer to whom I have alluded assures me that it is impossible to turn out an excellent article with the saddle-trees supplied from the A ictorian r establishment. In any case, I believe that even from this one establishment very few saddle-trees are supplied. turns out from 20 to 25 dozen per week. to maintain that production it is proposed to tax the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. been started in Sydney. dustries are able to hold their own without protection. This duty may not appear heavy, but every little taxation'adds to the cost of production, and makes manufacturers less able to turn out an article which will command a trade in the various States. I do not say that the duty on the saddle-trees alone caused all the increase in price; but the taxation on this and other articles required in the saddle-making trade has, as I have already said, had the effect of compelling a manufacturer to reduce the number of his hands. The saddle maker to whom I have specially referred, is a struggling man who went straight from the bench into the trade, without any large capital; and immediately he had formed a little connection, he found himself handicapped with these That is the duties. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -Thanks to great national resources which are not affected by the fiscal question, New South Wales is in a position of which we are all proud. I do not see, however, what bearing that fact has on the manufacture of saddletrees. In the course of my life I have, perhaps, spent more years in the saddle than has any other honourable member of this Parliament, and I ought to know something about saddles. As to the relative prices of local saddles and imported saddles, I know nothing; but on the question of quality, the opponents of this duty are taking the wrong line.

McLEAN -When, two years ago, tlie Victorian Government were about to send a contingent to South Africa, a particular pattern of saddle was asked for, and a committee of the Cabinet, composed of expert horsemen, were appointed to supervise. When the contingent reached South Africa, the saddle-tree made in Victoria received unstinted praise from the Imperial authorities, who, in letters, which I suppose are now in the Defence department, expressed the opinion that these were the best saddles that had been sent to the seat of war. the first contingent Treasurer sent to Africa. 1 MrA . M c LEAN I have not heard anything detrimental to that contingent.

McLEAN -The saddles were made to order here, and it was demonstrated that we could turn out a saddle to any pattern asked for. I have used many locally-made saddles, the trees and every portion of which were as good as could be found in any saddles produced elsewhere. A t any rate, I know that the local saddles are a great improvement on the imported article, and, as an old horseman, I should not like to use the latter to any great extent. That, of course, may be a matter of custom, but I venture to say that in Australia both saddles and horsemen are equal . to those in any part of the world. The honourable member for Gippsland has given us an illustration similar to many -which have been used during the Tariff debate. I shall relate the circumstances under which the saddles referred to by the honourable member were made, after the supply of the saddles for the first contingent had been bungled. in free-trade New South Wales. first contingent were good enough, but were not of the right pattern. mittee of the Victorian Cabinet was appointed to rectify previous errors.

Is that any criterion of what goes on in the ordinary, every-day manufacture of saddles 1 about the saddles of I dare say saddles equal to any in tlie world which the present can be made in Victoria; but the complaint is that the proper material is not used. There is no complaint about the particular saddles which were made in a special way under the direct supervision of experts from the Victorian Cabinet, and it would be almost impossible to get a bad saddle on such conditions. But that is not the sort of saddle which is ordinarily produced, and it is of the ordinary saddle that complaint is made.

I do not run down the Victorianmade saddles ; but if they are the best in the world, as the honourable member for Gippsland says they are, we need not protect their makers by placing a duty upon trees. Honourable members opposite are continually telling us that they can lick creation-that they can make engines and machinery superior to imported engines and machinery, and the best saddles in the world. But when we ask for the admission of imported goods free of duty they say"" If you force our manufacturers to compete on ordinary terms with those of other countries you will k ill our industries."" The honourable member for Macquarie has cited a case in which a saddle-maker's business has been practically ruined through his being forced to buy colonially-made trees in preference to tbe imported trees. trees is continued, he will have to get rid of as many hands as are employed in the whole saddletree-making business in Australia. honourable member for Gippsland, that man ought to be growing fabulously rich ; but if those who buy his saddles prefer imported trees, he cannot refuse to supply them. The other day, when we were discussing a proposal to exempt machinery used in tanneries, the Minister told us, in regard to a particular machine which was made in the Commonwealth, not that it was equal to the imported machine, but that it would dp for. the purpose. Therefore we are to pile on taxation to keep out of the market machinery superior to and more effective than that which can be made here. Thus we see how the principle of protection eats into the heart of progress. The honourable member for Gippsland said that he has spent more years in the saddle than any other man in the Commonwealth. MrA . McLEAN man in the Commonwealth; I said any other man in this Parliament. may be, he has been many years out of the saddle, and the time he spent in it was during a period when all saddles contained English trees, because Australian trees had not begun to be manufactured. No doubt he will admit that the saddles he used in those days were excellent. MrA . McLEAN -They are not to be compared with the saddles that have been obtainable of late years. the best workmen were to be found throughout Australia in nearly every kind of industry. Nowadays, however, those employed in the various factories are merely ""hands,"" and do not go through a complete course of training in saddle-making, or any other industry. ply to England1 every part of the world. The English saddle is not suitable for Australian use, and very few English saddles are used here, except for riding about the streets on a cob. But while the Australian saddle is well made, and is used in every State of the Union, the Australian than the English tree, I should be in favour of using it in preference to the English tree, because it would make the saddle less fatiguing to both the horse and its rider, and would not injure the horse's back. But as the English tree is better than the Australian tree, it must be used, no matter what duty may be charged upon it. I have for many years possessed the patent rights in a saddle-tree; one of the largest houses in this city, and in every big city of the union, were my agents for it, and I obtained royalty upon the trees made. I know, however, that the Australian tree is harder upon the horses than the English tree. If honourable members want to test the truth of my statement they had better ask the opinion of the nearest saddler. know about the effect of the saddle upon the horse ? saddler who has a reputation to lose knows how a saddle will hear upon a horse, accordI did not say any other ing to the weight of the man riding upon it . also tell how different saddle-trees affect horses ? able and learned member ever seen a saddletree ?

54,Mr Henry Willis,"Has the honora great deal of experience in connection with saddle-trees, both as an importer and as the holder of patent rights, and I am of opinion that the English tree should be imported free of duty, so that our manufacturers may have an opportunity to copy it as they copy every good importation. Thus in time, perhaps, if we have a wood as suitable as the English beech, we shall be able to make excellent saddle-trees, and to dispense with the English article. As soon as the Australian saddle-tree is recognised as better than the English saddle-tree, people will cease to import the English article. the whole of the representatives of Queensland united with others to place a duty upon timber; and now we have an honourable member from the same State asking that an article which is constructed for the most part of timber shall also be admitted free of duty. If the amendment is carried, the raw material of tlie colonial manufacturer will be taxed, while the finished article will be admitted free of duty. We were told that the Queensland timber was the best in the world for almost any purpose, and for the benefit of that State we were urged, on this representation, to impose a duty upon imported timber. is used in the manufacture of saddle-trees, and I am quite willing that that timber should be admitted free. saddle-trees should be admitted free, I hope the timber duties will be reconsidered, so that the raw material of the colonial manufacturers may be exempt from duty. We have heard letters read from two small saddlers in Queensland asking that saddle-trees shall be admitted free, but there has been no general demand from the trade. who wrote to me, sends saddles all over the Commonwealth. to the honourable member for Maranoa probably did not vote for h i m I am pretty sure Mr AVieneke did not-bu t they knew that they could work him on the free-trade ticket in regard to this matter. This proposal should not be discussed as a manufacture of metal, because fully 75 per cent, of the material in saddles-trees is wood. J?he honourable member for Gippsland has r pointed out very forcibly that colonial saddle-trees and colonial saddles are as good as any in the world. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to the saddles sent away with the contingents to South Africa, but I would point out that there was no complaint made about the saddle-trees. In regard to the first contingent, the complaints as to their equipment were general, and were not confined to the articles supplied from Victoria. A son of the honourable member for Gippsland went away with tlie first contingent, and he used the same horse and the same saddle for fourteen months. This saddle was constructed upon a colonial complaints regarding the colonial saddles were gross!y exaggerated. The honorable member for Robertson has told us that workmen as a rule are not as good to-day as they were twenty years ago. I do not agree with that. Under the present system of specialization, much finer work can be done right through than was possible many years ago, when one man executed work which is now performed in parts hy, perhaps, a dozen. ' member for Yarra has referred to the saddlers in my electorate who have written to me asking for the exemption of saddletrees. In view of the secrecy of the ballot, it is impossible for me to say whether they voted for me or not, but that is immaterial, because as the representative of the district of MaranoaI am doing my bare duty in studying the interests of the electors there. I told the people in that part of the Commonwealth, when I was submitting myself as a candidate at the federal elections, that I was a free-trader, and they knew perfectly well that I was in favour of admitting free of duty not only saddle-trees, but saddles and everything else, as far as possible. No doubt the Victorian workmen are as good as any in the world, and they can make the best of saddle-trees. I am not finding fault with their work, but with the material that is put into the trees. It is idle to say that the saddle-trees and saddles sent away to South Africa with the first contingent were of superior quality, because we know that the boots and saddles with which the first contingent were equipped were found to be useless upou the arrival of the men in South Africa, and had to be replaced.

""We have already allowed spokes, naves, &c, which are the raw material of the carriagebuilder, to be admitted free, and in common justice we should place tbe saddlers in an equally good position. My view is that if we cannot produce an article out of timber which is grown within tlie Commonwealth, we should admit that timber free.

It is of the utmost importance to stockriders and others that only the very best of material should be used in the manufacture of saddles. I have known horses to suffer from sore backs, resulting from the use of bad saddle-trees. This is one of the most important matters that has been brought before the committee, and feeling that I owe a duty to the saddlery industry, I shall heartily support the amendment. glad that this matter has been brought forward. boundary-riders, and others practically live in the saddle, and as the honourable member for the Gwydir has pointed out, it is a matter of vital importance to them that the best material only shall be used in its manufacture. foundation of the saddle, and if that foundation be defective the saddle will soon become useless. The manufacture of saddle-trees is therefore a very important industry. Only recently we had an instance of the utterly useless saddles which would have been supplied to the troops about to proceed to South Africa had the inferior material used in their manufacture not been detected. That fact indicates the hardship which our stockriders and boundary-riders have had to endure for years. I wish to enable them to secure the best materials, and shall therefore support the amendment. bane) A few honourable members have referred to the duty upon beech, which is the timbeif used in the manufacture of saddle-trees. But I would point out that there is no need to pay 6d. in duty upon imported beech, because there is an illimitable supply of that timber in Queensland. the English beech ? is better, because it is tougher and will last longer. I would further remind honourable members that the saddle-trees which are imported into Australia are not used in England. A t the great horse-show which was held in Dublin, not one saddle-tree was exhibited resembling the pattern common to Australia. The Australian "" tree "" is the result of much alteration and modification of the English article. The Wagga Wagga saddle is celebrated for its lines of beauty and workmanship. So also are the saddles manufactured at Ballarat and Bathurst. I have had a saddle for 22 years, and would not part with it for any saddle which can be manufactured to-day. On the present occasion I shall vote for free trees. not have spoken on this question but for remarks which have been made concerning the saddles supplied to the first contingent sent from Victoria. Personally, I had nothing to do with the selection of those saddles, hut I am acquainted with the majority of the men who used them; and I say that the fault did not lie in the saddles Numbers of our stockriders, themselves, but in the fact that we did not appreciate the work which they would be called upon to do. We were not alone in in our lack of appreciation of the conditions in SouthA f r i c a ; and it was the enormous equipment which the saddle had to carry, The"" saddle-tree"" is the in addition to the man, which caused the trouble. There are no more careless riders, magnificent though they be, than the riders of Australia, who will ride long distances on hot days, and treat their horses in the most cruel and unintelligent fashion. It was this carelessness that was undoubtedly responsible for the greater part of the difficulty which arose in South Africa. dles condemned before they were sent to Africa?",20,Smith I F The Duty On Tree Is Not A Good One I F I T Were Better

109,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I stillover £ 1 per ton. The value of liquid fuel is about 30s. per ton, and as a ton contains about 250 gallons, a duty of I d . per gallon represents a tax of about 66 per cent. Such a duty, I am informed, may stop the importation of liquid fuel. From a newspaper extract I learn that this particular class of fuel is coming largely into use both in England and America. It is stated that some of the ocean steamers can obtain 15,000 tons more lifting power with 2,000 tons of oil than they can secure from 3,000 tons of coal. Some of the steamers of the HamburgAmerican line have latterly been using liquid fuel in preference to coal, and I believe that other companies, such as the Cunard, and AVhite Star Companies, have been subjecting this fuel to an exhaustive trial with a view to seeing whether it is advisable to substitute it for coal, or to use it in conjunction with that commodity. I also understand that the South Australian railways are considering the propriety of using liquid fuel. The Great Eastern Railway company, of England, has recently used liquid fuel in conjunction with coal for the purpose of supplying the motive power for their engines. When this matter was discussed upon a former occasion it was urged that my proposal would unfairly handicap the coal-producers of the continent. honourable and learned member's own statement it has largely taken the place of coal. find as big a market as it enjoyed previously. The price is not affected, and I will show the Treasurer why. I have here an extract from an English newspaper, published on the authority of the representatives of the Cardiff coal-mining interests; and from this it appears that in 1900 there were only 20,000,000 tons of oil turned out, as against 750,000,000 tons of coal and lignite, while there were available for export in producing countries only 5,000,000 tons of oil as against 180,000,000 tons of coal. Though liquid fuel is becoming somewhat popular, the supply conditions ""prevent any injurious competition with coal. In any case we ought not to prevent suggested economies of the kind by a prohibitive duty on coal. ping the importation of these oils. tion of what the duty ought to be, but it has been strongly urged on me that a duty of I d . per ton, or any duty higher than 10 per cent., would considerably restrict, if not stop, the importation of liquid fuel. Solar oil is used in conjunction with coal for making gas, and it appears that a much less expensive plant can be used if the two are combined. I believe it has been found in Dunedin, Sydney, Perth, and Auckland, that a mixture of solar oil and coal produces better and more economical gas with im' proved lighting results. For that reason I think the duty on solar oil-whic h duty is not quite so heavy as that on other oils, owing to the difference in value-ough t to be much lower than is proposed. W it h a view of testing the feeling of the com-' mittee, I move That the amendment be amended by the omission of the figure "" I d . "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" ad valorem 10 per cent."" mittee adopt the proposal of the Government, we shall place on residual oil as high a duty as that imposed on the oils extracted from it . The residual oil is worth about 30s. per ton at the port of shipment, and, I suppose, cannot be landed here under £ 2 5s. per to n ; and a duty of I d . per gallon-whic h is £ 1 per ton-wil l mean about 75 per cent. The duty will practically prevent the introduction of the 011 to this country. One of the great advantages of the use of liquid fuel could No ; the coal can still be found in connection with our suburban railways, on which I think it ought to be brought into use at once in order to put an end to the smoke and dust nuisance. It is not pretended, or even urged, that liquid fuel is likely to take the place of coal. The more we look into the question, the more we find that coal cannot be supplanted in this way. We know, however, that where the cost of carriage inland is very high, it is cheaper to send a ton of. liquid fuel than to send a ton of coal; but liquid fuel cannot be expected to compete with coal in Sydney, or even in Melbourne. If it becomes a question whether a ton of oil or a ton of coal shall be sent inland, the extra heat-giving power of the one becomes a considerable factor in some of the industries carried on in the country. The use of this oil may tend, to a certain extent, to decentralize manufactures which, at present, can be carried on only in large cities or at seaport towns. One of the",26,Pairs

114,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"If the comtendencies of the age is to resist centralization, which, in the opinion of many people, is increasing too rapidly; and if in any way we can equalize matters by reducing the impost on liquid fuel, we ought to do so. The effect of the duty of £ 1 per ton will be to prohibit the use of liquid fuel, and it cannot be right, even from a protectionist point of view, to impose the same duty on this commodity as on naptba, benzoline, and petroleum. It would be advisable in the interests of the Railway departments of States like Western Australia and South Australia-and also in the interests of the railways over a large part of Victoria-to ascertain whether liquid fuel cannot be brought into use. From information which has been afforded to me it would appear that the amount whicli could in this way be saved in the cost of fuel is considerable, and I trust that the Government will see their way to place residual oil on the free list. I do not complain of the duty proposed on the other oils, although from my point of view it is extremely high. agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that there ought to be a difference made between the cheap oils aud the dearer products. Solar oil is produced in New South Wales, but naptha, benzoline, and gasoline are imported, and the duty on the latter, even at I d . per lb., will considerably interfere with certain .industries. A duty of Id. on benzine, for instance, is a very serious charge, as I think I shall show when I quote some figures. This product is used for oil engines, and the Ministry have insisted on encouraging by means of a considerable duty the manufacture of those engines within the Commonwealth. But what is the use of encouraging the manufacture of oil engines when we discourage their use by imposing a heavy duty on the necessary fuel? ""Under the original proposal of 6d. per gallon on benzine, it has been found from actual experience that a' small timber scow, trading on our coasts, and fitted with an oil engine, would have to pay £240 per annum. It can easily be seen that if that £240 be divided by Six, the scow will under tbe present proposal have to pay £40 per year extra for fuel : and that cannot be regarded as an encouragement of the use of oil-engines. If these oil-engines for certain purposes are superior to steam engines, and enable certain trades to compete more successfully with 33 K importations, their use should be encouraged. I am afraid that the amendment. of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, whilst it may be quite right so far as solar and residual oils are concerned, will mean an increase in the duty on some of the other oils named in the schedule. Sir GHORGJS T<JRN ER -It will mean, a T pretty considerable increase on the duty charged on other oils. honourable and learned member should separate his proposal, and move solar and residual oil at 10 per cent., and that the Government might make the other oils free, or accept a lower duty than I d . per gallon, as their use is very important to certain trades. The duty of I d . might be obliterated, or at any rate reduced by one-half. As regards some opposition which has been shown to the use of liquid fuel, it appears to me very absurd, if in certain parts of the Commonwealth this fuel is superior to coal, and enables something to be done that otherwise could not be done in the way of industries or manufactures, that we should attempt to retard progress by prohibiting its use. As the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has said, there need be no great fear as to the effect of the use of this residual oil on the consumption of coal. The honourable and learned member has shown that the production of oil is not sufficient to seriously interfere with the use of coal, and it is only where coal costs over 30s. per ton in Europe that the liquid fuel can successfully compete There are cases in which, with a desire to abolish smoke or to obtain simplicity of firing, liquid fuel is used, although coal could be more cheaply obtained. We have already abandoned the duty on kerosene, which is extracted from the same raw material as are the oils under discussion, and I ask the Ministry, if they decline to remove the duty, to reduce it by at least one-half. ment have not shown much discrimination in proposing to subject these commodities to a uniform duty of i d . per gallon. I understand that the honourable member for South Australia has'adopted the suggestion that a 10 per cent, duty should be placed upon solar and residual oil only, aud I shall support him.

117,Mr Fowler (Perth),"The Governparticularly upon locomotives, is that it will enormously decrease the risk of bush fires. Many of these devastating outbreaks are directly traceable to the burning of coal in locomotives as they travel through the country. In addition to this, the use of some of these oils in gas production will probably tend to considerably cheapen the cost of. the illuminant, and the use of liquid fuel will probably be greatly extended in districts where coal cannot be obtained at a reasonable cost. Therefore, we should impose as low a duty as possible. the Government will stand by their proposal. Residual oil, in which one o£ the largest trusts in the world is interested, is a "" keen competitor, with Australian coal. I am, quite aware that benzine and naptha are used largely in connection with electrical and other improved forms of machinery, and for purposes for which coal is not so well adapted, and I am agreeable that they should be admitted free. On the western coast of America, in the Hawaion Islands, and on the Pacific slope generally, the Newcastle coal trade is feeling the effects of the competition of residual oil. Our coal is subject to a duty of 4s. per ton in all American ports, and yet it is now proposed to allow residual oil to compete with us in our own markets without the payment of any duty whatever. Honourable members on the opposition side of the chamber must recognise that the miners will be called upon to pay a large amount of taxation under the Tariff; and it is to be hoped that they will agree to afford them, a little protection. So far as residual and solar oils are concerned, the Government proposal is a very moderate one. cent, ad valorem. the duty does not amount to even 40 per cent. According to letters with which I have been furnished from Messrs. Chas. Nelson aud Go. of San Francisco, dated 29th March, 1901, residual oil was selling in that city at 90 dollars per barrel. This firm savs .# :Beyond question, the consumption o£ Austramotive power, it was said that horses would lian coal, in the Hawaian Islands, as well as on the Pacific slope, is going to diminish, as oil is cease to be used, but nowadays more rapidly taking its place. Under the Tariff assistance is being given were used before the invention of the steamto industries in which only 50 or a 100 engine. Soi t will be with cool. I contend men are engaged, and surely it is reasonable that the duty upon fuel should be as light as that a small measure of protection should be extended to an industry in which over 10,000 men are employed in one State alone. I cannot understand why an appeal should be made on behalf of a product which is introduced here by one of the largest trusts in the world. We have imposed a duty of 15 per cent, upon all the improved machinery used in the mining industry, and it would not be fair to admit, free of duty, a commodity, which is seriously competing, with coal as a fuel. Mr G. B. EDWAB.DS (South Sydney) The honourable member for Newcastle has spoken very strongly in favour of the coal mining industry, and no exception can be taken to his action. A t the same time. I think that the honourable member's fears regarding the competition of oil as a fuel with coal are not very well founded. It has been shown over and over again that where fears have been entertained that certain commodities would be displaced by others as the result of inventions and developments, the actual results have quite upset all calculations. Personally I think that the useof liquid fuel, so far from resulting in less coal being consumed,, will very probably lead to a still larger consumjition through an extension of industries that would probably not have taken place but for tlie use of oil as a fuel. I believe, further, that furnaces will be devised in which some of the slack, coal which canuot now be profitably utilized, will be consumed in conjunction with liquid fuel. From a protectionist's point of view, the arguments of the honourable member for Newcastle may be sound, but the question for us to consider is whether we should impose a handicap upon an almost infinite variety of enterprises without nay assurance that by so doing we shall confer any ultimate benefit upon tlie coal-miners. No one knows the extent to which, residual oil will ultimately be used, but enough is known in regard to it for us to be able to say that it will in the future play an important part in the work of many of the manufactories which we are so anxious to see established in our midst.

130,Mr Watson,"But one ton of oil isuse of this fuel will open up new avenues for the consumption of coal, and thus assist the coal-mining industry. There are in and near my electorate in New South Wales such large gold and silver mining centres as Cobar, Nymagee, Bobadah, and Mount Hope, all of which, with the exception of Cobar, are 60, 70, or 100 miles from the nearest railway. That distance is too great to allow the crude ore to be sent away, and it is at the present time reduced in waterjacket smelters by the aid of coke. That coke has to be carted verylong distances, and to the mines outside of Cobar, which have not the advantage of railway communication, the freight upon it is practically prohibitive. As a result, mining operations in that locality are conducted upon a very small scale. The use of this oil, however, I should like to withdraw my amendment, would reduce the cost of fuel to these mines, because, whilst its price is higher than that of coal, the freight upon the former would not he nearly so great on Account of its lesser bulk and the ease with which it can be handled. Consequently oil would be used in reducing the ores to a certain stage. These ores, however, have subsequently to be carted to Lithgow for the purpose of undergoing a further reduction, in which process coal is used. An y increase, therefore, in the output of these mines means a corresponding increase in the consumption of coal required for the treatment of their ores. therefore, can do no harm 1 duty prohibits the use of this oil, and has the induced to remove the existing duty on oil going effect of compelling remote mining centres to remain undeveloped, thereby involving a a less consumption of coal, it will work a great deal of harm.

Such a tax. constitutes a considerable addition to my original proposal, and imposes a fairly heavy handicap upon this article as against coal. As evidencing the effect of the duty, I should like to quote from Petroleum, an American publication, of the 11th January of the present year. That journal statesThe interest in petroleum ns a fuel in oresmelting plants is constantly growing, and experiments continue to be reported from various quarters. One of the latest instances is that of the American Smelting and Refining Co. of New York, which has experimented extensively with Beaumont oil at their Perth Amboy, New Jersey, plant with very successful results. The chairman is reported as saying that the company purports substituting oil for other fuels in their If the imposition of a Mexican plants if the Government there can be into Mexico. I should further like to point out what has been the effect of the use of this oil in England. In this connection, the same publication statesThe Great Eastern Company's engine, No. 1885, which draws His Majesty's train between London and Sandringham, uses liquid fuel. This company has several large oil-fire engines running regnlarly; they are amongst the most powerful engines'in the company, and are fitted with Mi'. Jas. Holden's apparatus, which has been adopted by railways in all parts of the world. The product (Borneo oil) has a specific gravity of '9, and a flash-point approximating 200 degrees fahr.', is of uniform consistency, free from water, and without sulphur. The chief advantages of a properly managed oil-fired engine are regular steam generation, wasteless consumption, saving of labour, freedom from dirt, sparks, and smoke, absence of sulphurous fumes, and a lengthening of the life of boilers aud fire-bars.",30,Pairs

M c LEAN (Gippsland) I am informed by those engaged in the silvering trade that the Government proposal does not meet their requirements, as the plates they use for making .glasses and mirrors range in size from 7 to 1.2 superficial feet. The glass introduced for the purpose of glazing large windows is brought here in much larger sizes than 12 feet, and therefore a reduction of the duty as suggested would not interfere with the revenue so far as that class of imports is concerned. worth making any noise about? MrA . McLEAN -AV e have to consider the small industries as well as others, so long as we do not inflict injury upon the community. The glass-silvering industry is no doubt a small one, but we should not try to crush out all our infant industries. By the extension of the Government proposal, in the way suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland, we shall only do evenhanded justice to the glass-silvering industry. The raw material used in that industry is taxed up to the very utmost limit of the protection afforded, and I am assured by those who are engaged in the glassbevelling trade that the loss of o per cent, that is involved in their operations gives an advantage to the foreign manufacturer to that extent over and above the protection that is supposed to be accorded to the industry. I hope the committee will agree to extend the Government proposal. It i.s utterly impossible to satisfy the protectionists of Victoria, and I hope the Treasurer will be firm in adhering to his proposal. The local manufacturers are asking for more than we should be-justified in giving them, and I think that the interests of the community generally will best be safeguarded by limiting the reduction of the duty. the committee will not extend the proposal of the Government. It is very properly proposed to make some concession to the people engaged in the glass-bevelling industry, because' their operations involve the cutting away and loss of a certain proportion of the raw material imported. If the duties as they I know that now stand remain unaltered, those engaged in the industry will have to sustain the loss of the glass that has to be cut away. The Government propose to compensate them for this loss, but now more is being asked for. Upon all glass, in sizes up to 7 superficial feet, the Treasurer proposes to collect a reduced d u t y ; but the glass silverers not only claim this concession, which will extend to glass which is not bevelled, but they ask for an extension of the sizes up to 12 superficial feet. Those who are engaged in glass, bevelling say that the concession of the Government is sufficient, but the glass silverers require an additional advantage, to which they have no claim. There is no waste in"" connection with silvering, as the whole of the glass can be used, whereas, in bevelling, t some waste is unavoidable. silvering, because the glass has to be cut to certain sizes for use in mirrors. ported in the sizes required to suit the purposes of tbe trade. I think the committee will go a reasonable distance towards meeting the requirements of those engaged in the local industries by adopting the Government proposal. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -There is one aspect of this matter which has not yet been mentioned, that is, that the glass imported in plates over 12 feet in size is of more value than glass in plates of smaller sizes, and the 10s. duty upon the higher quality of glass would not represent a higher ad valorem impost than would 5s. upon the lower quality. Therefore, the reduction of the duty to 5s. per 100 superficial feet upon plates up to 12 superficial feet in size would tend to equalize the ad valorem impost upon the higher and lower qualities. at the remarks of the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. If there were no plate-glass industry in A ic-r toria, he would apparently be willing to reduce the duty, but he appears to be so prejudiced against A^ictorian industries that he is willing to go to the extent of penalizing them. If we insert the word "" twelve"" in place of the word "" seven,"" we shall be doing what is fair, and will not considerably affect the revenue. I believe that plates exceeding 12 superficial feet should pay a higher duty than 5s., but that plates not exceeding 12 superficial feet should pay a ' reduced duty.",33,Pairs

167,Mr Tudor (Yarra),"I am surprisedhad something to do with the alteration of the basis of the duty upon plate-glass, though nothing to do with the fixing of the rate. My attention has since been called to the fact that injustice has been done by the rate fixed by the committee. As I was unwilling to accept the representations of the firms who communicated with me without making further inquiries on my own part, I made such inquiries, with the result that I discovered that a duty of 10s. per 100 superficial feet is equivalent to a duty of 20 per cent, ac? valorem on sizes under 4 -feet; to 19 per cent, ad valorem on sizes between 4 and 7 feet; and to 16 per cent. ad vcdorem on sizes between 7 and 12 feet. There was no doubt an injustice done in regard to the bevelling sizes up to 7 feet, because the duty was higher on the raw material tha n on the finished article. The silvering size is from 7 to 12 feet, and the rate upon that size is about 16 per cent, ad valorem, while upon the finished article it is 20 per cent. Therefore, if the local manufacturer has to cut to shape in those sizes, he may be at a disadvantage. shape, he is under some disadvantage. I think that a duty of 7s. 6d. would be a fair compromise between os. and 10s. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I find that a duty of 10s. per 100 superficial feet is equivalent to a duty of 15 per cent, ao? valorem on the raw material. I should like to know how the right honourable member for Tasmania, can, as a free-trader, justify that? It is all very well for some honourable members to say that there is nothing much in the silvering trade, but I am assured that it is a very important part of the glass industry, and almost equals the bevelling trade. I can only attribute the Treasurer's omission to make tbe necessary concession in his amended proposal to want of information, and I therefore move That the amendment he amended by the omission of the word ""seven"" with a view to the insertion in lieu thereof of the word ""twelve."" honourable gentleman that a vote would be mind meeting honourable members by inserting a new line, fixing the duty on sizes between 7 and 12 feet at 7s. 6d. per 100 superficial feet. ment.

178,Mr Fuller (Illawarra),"In view of the Minister for Defencei f he gave the assurance referred to, and if so,"" whether he intends to stand by it? for Defence) -No such assurance was given by me. Speaking from memory, I am not aware that I have had any communication with Colonel Oldershaw, or with his branch of the National Rifle Association. The only person with whom I remember to have communicated is Colonel Davis, the secretary to the National Rifle Association. He was informed that the Government intended to place the sum of £2,000 upon the Estimates to meet the expense of sending a rifle team to Bisley, but that no expenditure should be incurred until the sanction of Parliament had been obtained. He was told that at the beginning, and received a second intimation to the same effect. I am quite certain, therefore, that there has been no misunderstanding whatever between the Government and the Natioual Rifle Association, as represented by its secretary, Colonel Davis. I can only imagine that the branch association in Sydwas anticipated, and the Government acney has received some communication from the secretary of the National Association, in Parliament has absolutely refused to prowhich probably he expressed the opinion that the vote would be agreed to. The Government merely undertook to place a sum of money for the purpose upon the Estimates, at the same time distinctly intiadvisable, as a popular measure, to send mating upon two occasions that no expenditure was to be incurred until the decision of Parliament should be made known. like to add that the Victorian Association met on Friday evening last, when, owing to the doubt which existed regarding the action which this House would take, it was resolved not to choose the team. I would point out to the Minister, however, that in order to render themselves eligible on the score of marksmanship for inclusion in the team, every competitor had to pay 10s., and I should like to know if the Minister will consider the advisability of refunding this money. the Prime Minister last evening whether he was prepared to place upon the Estimates a sum of money for defraying the cost of sending a team to participate in the Bisley competition, I received the reply that the adoption of such a course would result only in a waste of time on the part of this House. I understand that some sort of a promise was made that this team should be sent home, and, personally, I should like to see it despatched. I would, therefore, ask whether in the event of private citizens subscribing half of the expenses of the team the Government are prepared to contribute the remaining moiety? Such a course of action would remove the faintest suspicion that any breach of faith has been committed. External Affairs) -The honourable member for Kooyong need not entertain any suspicion that a breach of faith has been committed. On the very same afternoon that the Cabinet dealt with this matter, it was reported in the press that a sum of £2,000 was to be placed upon the supplementary Estimates in connection with the proposed visit of a rifle team to England. No promise was made to send a team home without the authorization of Parliament. An opportunity, however, occurred in connection with the Coronation Bill for bringing this matter forward at an earlier stage than cordingly adopted that course. Seeing that vide any money to send such a body to England, I shall not go behind that decision and grant financial assistance by way of a £ \ for ill subsidy. If it is deemed this team home, there are public-spirited and well-to-do citizens amongst us who can defray its cost with Very much more ease than any Government can obtain money from this Parliament-and I am not saying that in any uncomplimentary sense. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.5 p.m.",35,Adjournment Rifle Team For Bisley
