A deputation of Papuan officers, who were at the time on leave in Australia, waited upon the Minister in A p r i l, 1023, and asked for a reclassification of the Papuan Service by an officer of tlie Commonwealth Public Service.

Prior to the war, the Government had put in hand certain engineering services, and in 1921 it appointed an advisory committee which drew up a scheme of works necessary to enable the Seat of Government to be transferred as early as possible. The scheme was based generally on Mr Griffin's design, but many of the larger works involved therein were postponed indefinitely for financial reasons, provisional services being meantime arranged to meet present requirements. tember, the honourable member for In d i",14,Uniform Railway Gauge

ATE Works and Railways) [3.18] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth PublicWorks.Committee Act .1013-21, tlie following work bo referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, for its investigation and report thereon, viz.:-Establishmen t of the Royal Australian Air Force Station (No. 2), at Eichmond, New South Wales. The scheme prepared by the Air Board for the aerial defence of the Commonwealth includes the establishment of an air force station in thc vicinity of Sydney. Richmond has been chosen as the most suitable locality for such a station, which in time of war would be a base for the operation of air units defending from attack by air and sea the important commercial and strategic centres of the Sydney and Newcastle areas. The advantage of this particular site, apart from its accessibility and suitability for flying purposes, is that, while in effective working range of Sydney and within striking naval bombardment, ancl consequent disorganization. It is, also, within convenient distance of Sydney for the raising and training of personnel in'peace time. The proposal provides for the establishment over a period of five years of a nucleus of units comprising squadrons for fighting, single-seaters for light bombing and for co-operation with miliposes. In addition, administrative units, sueh as wing head-quarters and stores park, will be provided. The proposed site is close to the Clarendon railway station, on the Richmond line, about 40 miles inland from Sydney. The area, comprising 175 acres, was originally used by the New South Wales Government for a flying training school, and, together with existing hangars, store, workshops, &c, was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1923, at a cost of £9,318. The buildings to be proceeded with include wing headquarters, hangars, stores buildings, cottages, barracks, messing and recreation accommodation for the permanent officers, hutting, &c, for the Citizen Force trainees. The type of construction will be wooden framing and walls, with iron guardroom, which will be of brick. The existing hangars and workshop will be repaired and improved, and the officers' and caretakers' quarters taken over, but now occupying another site in the vicinity, will be removed and re-erected to conform with the general scheme. The total estimated cost of the scheme, including accessory engineering services, but excluding the cost of acquisition of the property, is £177,400. I lay upon thc table papers and plans respecting this proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee of Ways and Means: to1.

OrderedThat Sr. Earle Page and Mr Bruce do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. read a first time. surer) [3.26] -(B y leave)I move That the bill be now read a second time. The necessity for this B ill arises ourof a recent judgment by the High Court in what is known as the Dakyniple case. In that case the appellant had sold a lease of his pastoral property, and the Commissioner of Taxation had demanded, undev the Income Tax Assessment Act 19151921, payment of income tax upon the part of the total amount received by the vendor which represented the value of his leasehold estate in the property. Mr Dalrymple claimed that he could not be taxed on the amount in question because (1) he was entitled by the law to deduct from the total sale price the amount received by him for all the assets sold, including the lease itself, and that these deductions absorbed the whole of the sale price, and left no taxable balance; and (2) that the proceeds of the sale of a lease represented a realization of capital, and, as such, taxation of the proceeds is contrary to the principles of income taxation. The High Court upheld the appeal on the first ground stated by the taxpayer, and did not give any judgment as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the tax. The judgment of the court means that, as regards all assessments issued under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1921 to vendors of leases, the taxpayer was legally enticed to deduct the amount received for the lease as representing the value of an asset sold. There was, therefore, no tax payable in any of those cases, and the obvious intention of Parliament to collect. tax on such amounts was reduced to a nullity . Honourable members w ill be in terested to learn why the tax was imposed Assessment Act 1915 was passed by Parliament, it forbade the allowance of any deduction in respect of the depreciation of a leasehold estate, but it granted to recoup the amount of any fine, premium, or foregift, or consideration of that nature, which a lessee might have paid to the owner of a property for the purpose of securing a lease. That deduction was allowed because another section provided that the person who received the fine, &c., should be taxed upon the amount he received in each year under that heading. No deduction was then allowable of the sinking f u n d required to recoup any ainount paid by a purchaser of n lease for its transfer or assignment to him by an existing lessee. The Government of the day acceded to numerous requests to extend the law to the latter amounts, but in doing so it stipulated that the vendor ct the lease should pay tax on the profit bp received upon the transfer or assignment of his lease. The law was amended accordingly. Briefly stated, then, the tax was only imposed upon a vendor of a lease because the purchaser was allowod a deduction of an a n r j a l proportion of his purchase prior-. The words "" or an amount for the assignment or transfer of a lease of premises or machinery used for the production of income "" were inserted in section 20 of the principal act. A t the same time additional words were inserted in section 14 d, which defines what is included in income. That section provides that the income of any person shall in clude^Money derived by way of royalty or bonuses, and premiums, fines or foregifts or consideration in the nature of premiums, fines or foregifts demanded and given in connection witli leasehold estates. To that the following words were added:And the amount of any payment received by a lessee upon the assignment or transfer of a lease after deducting therefromThe part, (if any), which, in the opinion of the Commissioner is properly attributable to the transfer of any assets belonging to the lessee. The judgment of the High Courti n the Dalrymple case does not in any way affect tlie deduction allowable to a purchaser of a lease. It merely excludes from taxation",16,Lessee Taxbill

Thirteen persons applied for transmission of their appeals to the court and will benefit by this provision. If the judgment of the court were accepted, and applied to all past assessments, it would be essential to amend the law to discontinue the deduction allowed to the purchaser. very simple for any person so minded to enter into fictitious arrangements all his income would be absorbed by the deduction allowable to a purchaser. Government be reasonable to discontinue the allowance of the deduction to the purchaser, and it consequently proposes to continue the imposition of the tax. The bill before the House provides for the imposition of a tax on the profits on the transfer or assignment of leases, separately from the imposition of the income tax. This course has been taken dity 55 of the Constitution cessfully challenged. Assessment what come, while this bill deals with another class of receipts which it is considered desirable should be taxed. Clause2 introduces a new metliod of assessing the amount of tax payable.

Under certain conditions, cases in which hardship is alleged may be submitted to that board, and upon ii: solely rests the responsibility of deciding whether or not there shall be aaiy remission of taxation.

For a number of years the general public were more or less unawareof the existence of the Hardship Board, and the board had so little work to do that the three members who constituted it were able to handle all the business effectively and expeditiously; but the position now is that so many applications have been made to it that it is quite unable to cope with them. A number of taxation agents have specialized in preparing cases to submit to it , and the Government considers that the members of the Appeal Board, though not in their capacity as such, could give valuable assistance to the Hardship Board. Appeal Board is not an overworked body, for it has had to deal w i th only 80 cases in the last two years. posal is that individual members of the Appeal Board shall investigate cases submitted to the Hardship Board, hear personal testimony from the taxpayers when that is deemed to be necessary, and submit a report to the board. A member of the Appeal Board could interview the taxpayers concerned in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, or Hobart, which would result in economy and expedition in dealing with cases, and submit reports to the Hardship Board. That board alone would say whether or not taxation should be remitted. The members of the A p peal Board will not be asked to do this work for the Hardship Board as members of the Appeal Board; it w ill be a separate duty.

Sub-clause 1 of this clause makes the bill retrospective regarding assessments for 1922-3 on the following points:-(1 ) The manner in which live stock shall be brought to account in a taxpayer's income returns for all years, and the exercise by the taxpayers of a choice between (a) market values and cost; (b) inclusion or exclusion of natural increase; and (c) minimum and maximum values of the cost of natural increase. The leason for the amendment is that, although it was thought last year that Parliament made the election irrevocable, some taxpayers did not think so. They desire an opportunity of again making the election, and the amendment will permit them to do so. Paragraph g exempts the dividends or bonuses paid by companies out of profits on the sale of assets which were not acquired for the purposes of re-sale at a profit. The Government has drawn up a new definition of what are termed "" capital assets."" Take the case of a warehouse which is sold. The profit on the sale is not taxable to a company or its shareholders if the company distributes it , and the Government desires that provision to be made retrospective. The taxation on breeding live stock, when sold in the ordinary course of business, is taken back to 1922, because last year in certain been taken into account in any way. The clause provides for the disallowance of (a) Bates and taxes paid by one person on behalf of another, and (b) Double deduction for war-time profits tax. Further, liquidators are made liable to pay tax assessed to a company in liquidation. The non-retrospective provisions relate first to the exemption of profits from gold mining, and, secondly, to bonus shares paid out of profits which, under the acts of 1922-3, were not taxable. There are very few of these cases in which the revenue will suffer, and it is thought that the amount involved is not large. Thirdly, these provisions apply to distributions of profit which the Commissioner may deem distributable under section 21 of the act. There is no attempt to make the new method of calculating depreciation deduction retrospective. [3.58] -With what the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) said yeslegislation, I entirely agree. I thought that he put his case most temperately, and with the essence of fairness. I desire to draw attention to the uncertainty which prevails as the result of legislation which operates back for several years. The Government has the advantage of excellent expert advice when bills are prepared and laid before Parliament. It not only has legal advice, but also has the assistance of taxation experts. If , by the acceptance of this advice, every one it is hoped to catch is not caught-and , of course, the object of such legislation is to catch people-it is clearly unjust that an attempt should be made to catch them by retrospective legislation. If people, who should be taxed have escaped, then by all means let us tighten up the act, but do not make the legislation retroactive. A taxpayer should only have to pay the sum of money which he is legally obliged to pay under the laws of the land as they stand. What inducement can there be to any man to go to the trouble and expense of finding out whether he is legally liable to pay tax, if , after he has done so, an amending measure is passed which makes him wrong where previously he would have been right? The result w ill be that taxpayers will pay the tax for which they are assessed, and w ill not go cases live stock have not into the question whether they are liable for it or not. They w ill understand that if they do they may have to pay it as the result of retrospective legislation; and they will have a distinct feeling of injustice.",21,Second Reading

54,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Boothby)Coming, to the section itself, I direct attention to a provision which illustrates the injustice of this kind of legislation. The Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) did not refer to the matter in the course of his remarks, but I direct the attention of the committee to clause 12, which was passed yesterday, and the effect of which it is now proposed, under clause 15, to make retrospective to the year beginning 1st July. 1922. Section 59 of the original act, which is amended by clause 12 of this bill, refers to a liquidator, and provides that 1 (1.) Where a company is heing wound up tlie liquidator of the company shall give notice to tlic Commissioner within fourteen days after the approval of the shareholders for the winding up has been given, or the order for tlie winding up has been made, and shall set aside such sum out of the assets of the company as appears to thc Commissioner to be sufficient to provide for any income tax that becomes payable. The alteration of that section which the committee made yesterday by passing clause 12 of this b ill substitutes for the words ""becomes payable,"" the words "" then is or w ill thereafter become payable."" Sub-section 2 of section 59 of the original act provides that(2.) A liquidator who fails to give notice to the Commissioner, or fails to provide for the payment of the tax as required by this section shall be personally liable for any income tax that becomes payable in respect of the company.

It is his duty to distribute the assets of the company, and if he has done so, it is suggested that he should be liable to be held personally responsible by a subsequent enactment. I know of no liquidator placed in such a position, but I am dealing w it h the merits of the provision as it stands in this bill . It seems to me that it may cause gross injustice to men who have acted perfectly legally, and within their rights. It may be that the Commissioner of Taxation has had trouble with a liquidator in the past, but it 's the duty of Parliament to hold the scales of justice evenly between the Commissioner ""and the taxpayer. I am not saying that it is not desirable that section 59 of the original act should be tightened up for the future. The committee has agreed that that should be done by passing clause 12 of this b ill , but I am opposing the making of the operation of the amendments retrospective, so as possibly to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to catch some liquidator who, acting f u l l y within his rights under the law, has refused to agree w it h him on this point, and has properly distributed the assets of a company of which he was liquidator.

I have been amazed at the industry by which the honourable member for Y a r ra has obtained a thorough grip of this subject, as shown by his second-reading speech and subsequently. It is only righ t that the Government should place the facts f u l l y before the committee, so' that honourable members may have some estimate of the revenue lost to .the Commonwealth because of the doubtful expedients resorted to by certain companies. The law should be tightened up to make such expedients impossible. Two or three bills have been introduced in which the principle of retrospective collection of taxation applies. These bills are really parts of one measure. In previous years Parliament has determined in its wisdom that such bills shall be discussed on the second reading as one bill. this case, because one bill involves the principle of taxation on capital. The principle of retrospective collection of taxation was involved in the Dalrymple case. That case was before the courts for some time. The highest court finally decided that the principle involved was repugnant to law. admitted that decision by considerably lessening the 'application of that principle in the collection of taxation. The Government has admitted that the law was wrong in principle, but it is now introducing an amendment which will validate the principle, but modify considerably the effects of its application. This is an admission that previously burdens were placed upon taxpayers unjustly and illegally. When the policy of the Government was first enunciated by the Prime Minister, he stated very definitely that all lessees who were interested in the Dalrymple case -and many had paid their assessments under protest and the money had been held by the Taxation Department for months-and had started to contest the law, would be exempt. In behalf of certain taxpayers, I obtained an assurance from the Government and informed them that because their objection was before the Commissioner they would be exempt, but that those who had not objected would be made liable, by retrospective legislation of a modified character. Now the Government is providing that those who had not actually and literally commenced litigation, before the 30th June, shall be affected by this retrospective proposal. This w ill give a very bad impression, and it looks to me very like a trick. When the validity of a taxation law is in question, every taxpayer concerned does not incur the enormous expense of individually moving the courts; often by arrangement, a test case is stated, and many of the persons affected agree to share the legal costs. That plan was adopted by some of the taxpayers interested in the Dalrymple case; they decided to abide'by the decision of the court, but, because many of them had not actually started litigation, they will be taxable under this bill. In effect, the Government is by this means legalizing an impost which the H i gh Court declared to be repugnant to law. If the tax was unjust or unreasonable, the immunity from liability should be made retrospective to the date upon which the It could not be done in law first operated. I ask the committee to consider this proposal very carefully. We should not agree to retrospective I am aware of that. legislation which involves unjust treatment and serious consequences to many taxpayers. surer [4.37] -The honourable member for the application of this amendment to liquidators. Section 59 provides that when a company is being wound up the liquidator shall give notice to the Commissioner, within fourteen days, that an order for the winding-up of the company has been made, and shall set aside a sum considered by the Commissioner sufficient to meet any income taxation that was payable by the company. A liquidator who complied with that requirement will have no liability under this provision, but one who failed to obey the law w ill become personally liable for the tax due from the company. In regard to the war-time profits tax, there is no intention that the amended provision shall be applied, as the honourable member suggested, to disputes between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. We are simply making it impossible for the war-time profits tax deduction to be made twice. A t the present time that tax is applied to the year in which the profit was actually made, and the assessments are made on that basis.

Debate resumed from 25th September (vide page 4796), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. bill has been viewed from various aspects, and it is my intention to draw attention to some points of view that have not yet received attention. In doing so, I hope that I shall not be charged with looking at the matter from the parochial view-point. It is easy for those who have a special interest in public works in a particular place to appeal to other honourable members to take a broad national view, but all such proposals as this must be considered on their merits, with special regard to their probable benefit to Australia. They must also be considered in connection with the system ' of federation under which we live. I fully recognize, as I am sure that other honourable members do-althoug h they may experience difficulty in giving application to the prin-. ciple in some eases-that it is necessary to spend in particular parts of Australia money that is contributed by the people of the whole Commonwealth. That happens every day. When we build a post office in Sydney, or construct waterworks ou the river Murray, we engage in a national work and pay for it with money provided by 'the citizens of the whole Commonwealth. The mere fact that a Under the existing law, it is proposed work is to be constructed in Sydney, or on the river Murray, is not necessarily an objection to it . We must look at the merits, the character, and the object of the work. I shall not occupy time by discussing the desirability of unifying the railway gauges of Australia. There is a general, if not a universal, agreement that unification is eminently desirable. We differ only as to the time, the means, and the method of accomplishing the work. The history of the Australian railway systems in relation to the unity of gauge is one of most unfortunate misunderstanding and state jealousies. In the beginning, Victoria and New South Wales agreed to construct their railways with the same gauge, but, for some reason, that was not done. I do not desire to introduce into this discussion any of the old misunderstandings and unfortunate jealousies which have retarded the solution of this problem for so many years. The first important point I make is that this Parliament should not run the risk of incurring further similar misunderstandings in the futuro. 1 fear, sir, that the agreement upon which this bill rests, and the principles to which it seeks to give effect, w ill encourage and foment misunderstandings, and .that, s although the bill is brought forward as an instalment of unification, unless some changes are made in the agreement which it seeks to adopt, we can anticipate, almost with certainty, further misunderstandings and misapprehensions. Surelyi t is our duty to do everything in our power to prevent the adoption of a scheme which will be open to that objection. The bill rests upon an unfortunate suggestion that the people of Victoria, South Australia, ancl Western Australia made an agreement whose obligations they are not f u l filling. The Prime Minis.ter. in moving",27,Paiks
76,Dr. Eaele Page (Cowper,Trea,28,Bruce
77,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [4.57],"Th ethe second reading of the measure, said that it was proposed that the Commonwealth should pay towards the cost of the work certain sums on behalf of those three states, namely, for Victoria, £819,000; for South Australia, £267,000; and for Western Australia, £177,000. The Commonwealth has no authority to purport to pay any money on behalf of those states upon the assumption that they are not carrying out an agreement made with them. Such a foundation for the bill does not augur well for the future unity of the states in effecting the unifition where no lines existed? cation of their railway gauges. The preamble of the bill recites that at a confersay that no question of unification could ence of Commonwealth and state ministers held in Melbourne in July, 1920, it was resolved that a commission of railway experts should be appointed to consider and report upon three things: first, the unification of the railway gauges of Australia; secondly, the gauge it was desirable to adopt; and thirdly, the cost of conversion. It further recites that the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the various states agreed to abide by the decision of the commission, and that the parties agreed that one-fifth of the total cost of conversion should be bome by the Commonwealth, and that the. remaining four-fifths should be apportioned among the five states on the mainland on a population basis. It goes on to state that the railway commission made certain recommendations with regard to the unification of the from Grafton to Kyogle is no more a unigauges to which it is desired to give partial effect. Let us look for a few moments at the terms of reference to the commission. It was authorized, in the first place, to report upon the unifia project, under the guise of unification, cation of our railway gauges. What does * I suggest that it means the unification of the gauges of railways already constructed, I make this point, not in a technical and that it is quite an improper extension of the meaning of the phrase to say that it embraces the construction of entirely new railway lines. the bringing of existing railway lines of different gauges to a single gauge, and that is all. The terms of reference gave the commission no authority to recommend the construction of a new line. I do not say that the commission acted wrongly or improperly in making the sugMr Latham. gestion that a new line was desirable from a railway point of view. by either the Commonwealth or the states to its having done so. the construction of this line may be very desirable from a railway point of view, but I point out that the states did not agree to be bound by any recommendation made by the commission as to the building of new lines. arise. Such a question can only arise where there are two linos of different gauges. The term "" unification "" does not include the relaying and regrading of existing lines of the accepted gauge, yet it is proposed, in this bill, that money shall be spent on relaying and regrading the line from Grafton to Kyogle, which is a 4 f t . 8$ in. gauge line. That may be a desirable railway project, but it is not in tiny sense of the word a unification work. work. the honourable member. The unification proposal does not affect any existing 4 f t . 8$ in. line. Those lines must be left to the state which built them to maintain. Thc relaying and regrading of the line fication project than would be the improvement of the Albury to Sydney line, or the regrading and relaying of the Sydney to Moss Vale line.

The suggestion that they are not standing by an agreement which they entered into, and that therefore the Commonwealth Government intends to pay out money on their behalf cannot justly be maintained.",28,Bruce

The bill has in contemplation the construction of three works. The first is the relaying and regrading of the existing 4-ft. 8£-in. line from Grafton to Kyogle. I have already pointed out that this cannot be considered a unification work. The second work involved in the achievement of the ultimate object of the bill is the building of a bridge over the Clarence River. That work is to be done by the New South Wales Government, so we are. told, at a very roughly estimated cost of £1,000,000. building of the bridge is not provided for in the agreement,, and, if the New South Wales Government has agreed to construct it , surely it is only reasonable that its construction should be made a condition of the agreement. that the bridge should be constructed by New South Wales is, in itself, an admission which makes it difficult to regard this whole project as an Australian enterprise and part of the unification scheme. The Prime Minister, in his second-reading speech, said that the Commonwealth Government took the view that, as New South Wales would inevitably have to build the bridge to continue its own railway line, it should bear the cost of it . Surely the same reasoning must apply to the line itself. The bridge is the most important part of the line, and, if thc cost of building it is agreed to he a responsibility of New South Wales, it would appear to be clear that that state should also bear the cost of extending the line. The third work which the bill has in contemplation is the building of a new line from Kyogle to South Brisbane. is no part of the unification project. It will be observed that the agreement that four-fifths of the cost of unification shall be paid by the mainland states was made by Cabinet Ministers, but it has no legal sanction. legally binding agreement, it would not [198] be necessary to introduce legislation of this description, and to provide fo i the Commonwealth Government paying money on behalf of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, for the states which were parties to it would be obliged to pay their share of the expense involved. Such action Seeing that in each of the three states I have mentioned, a change of government has occurred since the conference of 1920 was held, would it not be desirable for the Government to endeavour to make a new agreement with all the states for the complete unification of our railways instead of setting out on the work with a partial and unsatisfactory instalment, such as this must be considered to be. Another aspect of the case which is not unimportant merits the careful consideration of this Parliament, and in drawing attention to it , I again express the hope that I shall not arouse interstate jealousy. When this work is completed the unification of the New South Wales railways w ill The be complete, and no f u it h er expenditure of money need be incurred there. The railways of Queensland will also be of a uniform gauge in so far as interstate traffic is concerned. ""Nothing at all will have been done in the The admission other states towards unification, and that simply because 4 f t . 84 in . happens to have been chosen as the standard gauge for unification purposes! If this work is done in New South Wales, so that she has within her own borders a unified system, and work is done in Queensland, so that Brisbane is linked up with the only other capital with which she is connected by railway with a line of the standard gauge, what is there to compel those states to contribute their share of four-fifths of the sum to be spent on a general unification scheme? All the work remaining to be done would a have to be carried out in the other states. Accepting the estimate of the cost of a complete unification of railway gauges as £56,000,000, four-fifths of that amount, or about £45,000,000, would be the cost of the work to the six states, and the share of New South Wales would be about I .submit that that one-third, or, say, between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000. What inducement would there be for New South Wales, if not under a binding agreement, to pay that sum for expenditure in the other states? The figures are still large, if the If it were a estimate of the cost of the smaller scheme -£21.600,000-is adopted. It may be said that New South Wales would, of carrying out that work?

The cost will depend on the route followed, the character of the soil, the quantity of rock met with, the extent of sidings and embankments, the grades, and other particulars. In section 13 of the Public Works Committee Act a. very definite procedure is laid down in these terms(1.) No public work of any kind whatsoever (except such works as have already been authorized by Parliament, or which are authorized during the present session, and except works for the naval or military defence of the Commonwealth exempted by Order in Council from thc operation of the act) the estimated cost of completing which exceeds Twenty-five thousand pounds, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, repair, reconstruction, extension, or a new work, shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in tliis section provided. (2.) Every such proposed work shall in the first place be submitted and explained in the House of Representatives by a Minister of State, in this section referred to as ""the Minister "". (3.) The explanation shall comprise an estimate of the cost of the work when completed, I suggest that that means an estimate by our own ofiicers, and not by a royal commission together with such plans and specifications or other descriptions as the Minister deems proper, together with the prescribed reports on the probable cost of construction and maintenance, and estimates of the probable revenue (if any) to be derived therefrom, such estimates, plans, specifications, descriptions and rebv the Commonwealth Public Works Comports to be authenticated or verified in the prescribed manner. Can anybody regard the sketch-map. showing a black line, as an estimate, a proper plan, specification, or report? If the House authorizes the construction of the line without data, it will be acting in the dark, and it will be setting aside the precautions which Parliament itself adopted iu order to secure that public moneys should not be expended without careful scrutiny of the proposals for expenditure. Section 15 of the Public Works Committee Act further provides(4.) Upon motion made in the usual manner by the Minister or by any member of the House of Representatives the proposed works shall be referred to the committee for their report thereon. Then the committee has to make its report, and the report must be placed before the House. There is in the act no definition of "" p u b l ic w o r k "" . It may be said that this is not a public work because the Commonwealth is not carrying it out; that it is to be done, if honourable members please, by a body called the Railway Council. That Railway Council is to have complete control of the expenditure. There is involved in this proposal a surrender by this Parliament of control over expenditure which, I think, is without precedent in regard to so large an amount. Does the intervention of the Railway Councili n the expenditure of £3,500,000 of Commonwealth money absolve this House of its responsibility for seeing that there are proper plans, surveys, estimates, and reports supplied? I submit that it does not. Eveni f it should be contended that a "" public work "" must be a work definitely carried out by the Commonwealth, I submit that the principles of the Public Works Committee Act plainly apply to this case. This Parliament would be f a i l in g in its duty if , out of hand, it authorized the expenditure of. so large a sum of money as £3,500.000 by such a body as the Railway Council, when in the case of expenditure by the Commonwealth itself exceeding £25,000, it requires a scrutiny of estimates, plans, and so for t h by members of this House and by another place. I move That, all the words after the word "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill be withdrawn in order that tlie procedure prescribed mittee Act 191.3-1921 be followed."" My object in submitting this amendment is that in regard to this large expenditure of money, ordinary-no t extraordinaryand commonplace precautions shall be observed, and further that the lapse of an interval shall be secured during which the Government w ill be able to go into the matter, not only with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, but also with those of thc other states, and endeavour to arrive at an agreement for the unification of gauges which w ill be a real agreement, possible of completion in instalments. In that period of delay it w ill also be possible for the Commonwealth, if it fails to obtain a general agreement at this stage among all the states, at least to have the agreement referred to in this bill amended by the incorporation in it of the very definite provision that, as this line is being put forward as the beginning of the unification of the Australian railway gauges, New South Wales and Queensland w ill see the whole work of the unification of gauges carried through. I submit that nothing in the way of unification of gauges should be done in any one state unless that state has definitely and clearly bound itself to unification of the Australian railway gauges generally. I find it difficult to believe that a majorit y of honourable members w ill vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) requiring the bill to be withdrawn. I have always listened with particular pleasure to the honourable member, because his contributions to debates in this chamber invariably broaden them and l if t them to a higher level. I would not suggest for a moment that the honourable member has in this matter hearkened to the still small voice of parochialism. representative of a very fortunate state. The people of Victoria are fortunate in many ways; indeed, in some respects they have been rather spoiled. I say that in no unfriendly spirit. They have a network of railways such as no other state possesses; they have waterways and other means of transport in which the larger states of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia are lacking. think sometimes that these advantages cause a tendency to parochialism. It is generally admitted that if we are to develop our country properly, and are to be in a position to defend ourselves, should the occasion for defence unfortunately arise, we must standardize our railway gauges. In times of drought a railway system which would enable us, if necessary, to transport live-stock from Brisbane to Fremantle, would be of inestimable value. By such a system trade aud commerce would also benefit to a very great extent. As showing the necessity for thc unification of gauges, I may mention that, in one month at Albury, as many as 834 truck-loads of f r u it and vegetables were transferred from one line to the other, and in another month 2,765 tons of f r u it had to be transferred from one line to the other at the same place. A very great deal of that f r u it was brought from Brisbane, and it therefore had already been transferred at Wallangarra. I am sure that honourable members are agreed that the bringing about of a uniform gauge should be treated by this Housei n a broad way as a national matter. Australia is not the first country which has had to face this problem. Great Britain and the United States of America havo had to deal with it . In the United States of America railways were built originally without regard to the requirements of the future . I think there were seven different railway gauges in Americai n the early eighties, and it was at about that time that the unification of the gauges of the main lines was brought about. As the Prime Minister mentioned in the course of his speech in moving the second reading of the b ill , unification of gauge was carried out over 13,000 miles of main line in the United States of America. It may be said that the unification of gauges in the United States of America had much to do with bringing the states together, bringing the north more closely in touch He is a distinguished with the south and the west with the east, making the states really united, and enabling the people to realize that they were one great nation. In Great Britain the same problem had to be faced, and I think it was the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) who quoted from a, report, which I have here, a statement by Mr Edward Simms, secretary to the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, I who, at the request of the then Minister for Works and Railways( Sir Littleton Groom), furnished a report on the unification of the gauges. He pointed out that Great Britain had to face the same problem; that as far back as 1846 the question of unifyin g the gauges of railways was causing concern to the authorities; and it was between the years 1870 and 1872 that it was dealt with. In this connection, the defence point of view has to be considered. I think it was again the honourable member for Capricornia who quoted from Lord Kitchener's report of the 7th July, 1910, on the defence of Australia his opinion that the existing railways in the Commonwealth, because of the lack of uniformity of gauge, were not advantageous from a defence point of view, but rather the reverse, and might even be of considerable value to an enemy which had temporary command of the sea. A t a meeting of a war military",31,Bruce
86,Mr D. Cameron (Brisbane) [5.35].,"railway council held in November, 1914, it was resolved that}A military service transporting troops and munitions tliat, under existing conditions, took ti-3 days, oould, if the gauges were unified to if t . 8-i inches, be accomplished in 23 days, or a saving of 40 days. The Oommonwealth Eailways Commissioner said, in 1920H appears to the to be unnecessary to estimate for, or consider at present, the adoption of a uniform gauge throughout Australia. Thc gauges of the existing lines, which run from the distributing centres, would naturally remain n-s they are for many years to come, even if tlic adoption of a uniform gauge was immediately decided on, and it would be necessary to consider at the outset thc provision .of a 'Uniform gauge connecting the capitals.* He recommended various ways in which this might be accomplished. recommendation was that Kyogle and Brisbane should be connected with a railway on the 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge. His second recommendation, was the building of a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge line from Albury to Melbourne. was the building of a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line from H a y to Port Augusta, via Crystal Creek, and with a connection with Adelaide, via Morgan, ancl he then proposed thc altering of the gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perthf r o m 3 f t . 6 in . to 4 f t . 8-J in . pointed in 1921 to report on the adoption nf a uniform railway gauge made careful inquiry, and brought in a unanimous recommendation that the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge should be the standard gauge for "" Australia. that the first steps taken should be the linking up of the capital cities by the provision of uniform gauge lines, and the conversion of the broad gauge lines of Victoria and South Australia. The Commonwealth and State Governments considered the royal commission's report in 1021 and 1922, and eventually agreed to the adoption of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge as the standard gauge. The present Government has, I think wisely, decided that immediate action should be confined to the building of lines which would open up new country, for m part of the general scheme of conversion, and have a f a i r prospect of earning interest within a reasonable period. The railway at present under consideration is the 'first step in the general scheme of conversion to the standard gauge. It would be quite absurd to claim that the proposed line w ill he of any great strategical value from a defence point of view, but it is quite certain that every developmental railway which opens up country suitable for closer settlement, and which, consequently, helps to increase our population, must be of immense value, and must do much to solve the problem of our national defence. W it h our present population, I do not think this country would be justified in building railways purely for strategic purposes. The proposed railway w ill save 100 miles in the journey between Sydney and Brisbane, and w ill considerably shorten the time occupied in travelling between those capitals. An y His first scheme which w ill result in bringing the capital cities of the Commonwealth closer together must be considered of national importance. The honourable member for Kooyong has expressed the opinion that the people of Queensland and New SouthH is t h i r d recommendation Wales should be called upon to give a definite undertaking that they will support the entire scheme for the unification of the gauges of bur railways. The Queensland Premier, .when the agreement referred to in this b ill was before the Queensland Parliament recently, stated The royal commission apthat the people of that state are prepared to accept their share of the burden of complete unification of gauge from Brisbane to Fremantle. I have personally no doubt that they w ill be prepared to do so, and that this applies also to The commission recommended the people of New South Wales. The people of Queensland recognize that the task of unifying the gauges must be faced, and thc longer it is delayed the greater w ill be the expense. They realize that the adoption of a u n if o rm gauge w ill be an excellent thing from thc Australian and national point of view. The proposed line will open up large fertile areas, and will provide means of transport forfarming districts which are at present most inadequately served. It will be of in estimable value for the transport of starving stock and fodder in times of drought. For all these reasons it may be said that the construction of this line appeals only to the people of Queensland and New South Wales, but I believe that it w ill appeal to the people of Australia generally as the first step towards carrying out a work which must be undertaken, aud which the longer it is delayed will involve greater expense. trust that the amendment will not be agreed to. usually greatly appreciate the speeches delivered in this chamber by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham),, but to-day even his best friends would not give him credit for discussing this proposal in the manner to be expected from one of his standing in the community. His criticism, boiled down, was that if the bill were passed there would be a likelihood of misunderstanding between the states, that the Commonwealth was assuming a right to pay certain moneys on behalf of the other states, that unification was never intended to include the building of new lines, and that if the whole scheme of unification were not undertaken the line from Grafton to South Brisbane should not be constructed. I : i other words, he contended that if we were unable to do every part, we should do'nothing. honourable member's remarks, and what I have said was certainly a part, if not the whole, of his argument. The purpose of ihe bill is to ratify the agreement made between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of Queensland nnd New South Wales. there are 23,911 miles of railway in Australia, there is a break of gauge in every state. The Commonwealth controls 1,733 miles of railway in its own territory, and including the Oodnadatta line. length of railways in New South Wales is 5,318 miles; in Victoria, 4.333 miles; in South Australia, 2,373 miles; in Western Australia, 3,555 miles; in Tasmania, 663 miles; and in Queensland, which state has what is generally regarded as the finest system of railways in Australia, 5,905 miles. In Queensland there are no fewer than four trunk lines, with numerous branch lines running from coastal ports into the interior. We have the Cairns to Forsyth line of 263 miles, the Townsville to Cloncurry line of 481 miles, the Rockhampton to Longreach line of 428 miles, and the Brisbane to Cunnamulla line of 604 miles. In addition, there is a coast line running from Brisbane to Cairns of about 900 miles. Although the gauge is 3 f t . 6 in., the record of railway accidents will bear favorable I comparison with that of any other state. In past years the state governments were short-sighted in not building lines to provide for the interchange of rolling-stock. During the last twenty years the residents of the Northern Rivers District of New South Wales have agitated for railway connection with Brisbane. The New South Wales Government has consistently refused to provide those people with a few miles of railway to enable their produce to find its natural market. It has repeatedly been said, that the unification of the railways of Austi'alia would involve a gigantic expenditure, but the Prime Minister has pointed out that the longer this matter is delayed the greater will be the cost. A royal commission was appointed in 1920 to inquire into this problem. It submitted a scheme estimated to cost £21,600,000. It was definitely stated at that time that the scheme besides providing for a 4-ft. S^-in. gauge included the construction of new lines, the alteration of existing lines, the erection of bridges, the provision of tunnels, and the adjustment of rolling-stock. I ask representatives of states other than New South Wales and Queensland to view this line, not from the stand-point of the benefit to be derived by Queensland and New South Wales by its construction, but with the definite idea Although of unifying the railway gauges of Australia-. The following complete scheme was proposed by the commission:(ft) A 4-ft. 8}-in. gauge railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, linking with the existing The railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. (b) A 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge railway from Port Augusta to Adelaide (part conversion). (c) Conversion of the whole of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge' line of South Australia and Victoria (including the conversion of the 3-ft. 6-in. line between Terowie and Peterborough, in South Australia). (d) A 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge railway linking Sydney and South Brisbane, via Macksville, Kyogle, and Richmond Gap. Tlie estimate for this scheme is £21,600,000, made up as follows:£ (a) Alterations to existing railways and structures . . 9,012,000 (b) Any new lines necessary . . 6,873,000 (c) Adjustments of rolling stock 5,715,000 Total .. . . 21,600,000",33,Bruce

89,Mr Mackay,"I made a note of the. A f t e r considering the difficulty of financing this huge undertaking, and the extraordinary interference w i th trade that would result from it , the Commonwealth Government decided to submit an alternative proposal. It is common knowledge that it is not the faul t of the Commonwealth, the New South ""Wales, or the Queensland Government that the alternative scheme has not been carried out. In addition to the scheme before the House, the Commonwealth Government proposed to construct a railway from Port Augusta to Hay, a distance of about 500 miles, at an estimated cost of £4,500,000. next step was the extension of the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, giving communication over a distance of 3,040 miles, and shortening the distance between Brisbane and Perth by 448 miles, equal to about 36 hours' travelling. This alternative scheme is a practical attempt to deal with this great national work. by reason of its value from a defence point of view. for Kooyong did not at any time discuss that phase. Wimmera( Mr Stewart), when Minister for Works and Bailways, strongly stressed the importance, for defence purposes, of the alternative scheme now suggested. When speaking before a conference of representatives of the states last year, he referred to the fact that the military advisers of the Commonwealth, in advocating this scheme, had made the following suggestions: The construction of some line between Port Augusta and the cast, which will avoid Adelaide and Melbourne. A railway line in the Murray basin through Morgan, northward, cutting out Adelaide. He also said that only a few days previous the military advisers of the Commonwealth had furnished him with the following opinion: At thc present time the transcontinental railway, through shortage of standard-gauge rolling-stock, is of but limited military value. A connection with the New South Wales system, which would allow the transfer of rolling-stock, £819,000 for Victoria is exclusive of that would be of distinct value. The junction of tlie transcontinental system with the 4-ft. S-J-in. system of New South Wales may, from several points of view, be said to give a definite and desirable military advantage. Mr Stewart then referred to a report f u r nished to him by the Inspector-General of Military Forces, in which he made the following comments on the necessity for quick transport of material ; I consider it my duty to again draw attention to the serious situation which, in the event of her troops being mobilized for the defence of her own shores, will confront Australia through the lack of suitable railway communications, and a uniform railway gauge. Recent conferences inaugurated by the Prime Minister have acknowledged thc ultimate necessity of a uniform gauge on commercial and industrial grounds, but do not appear to have fully realized its vital necessity in the interest of the safety of the Commonwealth. Another advantage of this proposal is The that it would largely overcome the existing break of gauges without interfering with the working of the present railway systems. I u support of this, I would mention that in 1923, at Wallangarra, situated on the border of Queensland and New South Wales, there were transhipped 102,147 tons of goods, 250,000 head of live-stock, and 99,109 passengers. There is no very great difficulty in transhipping It is a national scheme passengers, but there is a real difficulty and heavy expense occasioned in tranThe honourable member shipping goods and live-stock. Queensland sends a large quantity of f r u it to the The honourable member for southern states, and each month 30,000 cases of f r u it from that state are handled. The proposal before the House is to standardize the present railway front Grafton to Kyogle, a distance of 85 miles, at an estimated cost of £800,000; to construct a line of 27 miles from Kyogle to the Queensland border, at an estimated cost of £850,000; and to construct a line of 70 miles from the Queensland border to Brisbane, at an estimated cost of £1,250,000. Tn addition, there is an estimated expenditure of £600,000 for the alteration of rolling-stock. The total expenditure in Queensland will be £1,843,000. and in New South Wale? £1,657,000'. The liability of the states, excluding Tasmania, allotted on a per cajrita basis, after deducting £700,000, representing one-fifth contribution by the Commonwealth, is-Ne w South Wales. £1,127,000; Victoria, ' £ 8 1 9 , 0 0 0 ; and Queensland, £410.000. state's contribution to the one-fifth share of the Commonwealth. would apply to the figures for the other states. Queensland indirectly contributes to the expenditure of the Murray River scheme, and to the grants to Tasmania and Western Australia.",35,Bruce
90,Mr Maxwell,The amount of,36,Bruce
91,Mr Mackay,"The same remarkAustralia is £267,000, Western Australia £177,000, making a total of £3,500,000. When the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Works and Railways( Mr of the attitude taken by the Victorian GovernStewart) met the representatives of the states in conference they submitted an alternative scheme, which included the railways from Grafton to South Brisbane, Hay to Port Augusta, and also, I believe, Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. As the states of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have refused to agree to the proposal now before us, the Commonwealth Government has promised to advance the proportion those states are liable to provide until such time as they agree to participate in the general unification scheme. It will stand to the credit of tlie Bruce-Page government that it took some definite action to bring about the conversion of a part of the railway systems of Australia to a standard gauge. The Grafton to South Brisbane line will open up some of the best lands in Australia, and the fact that it will dovetail with the general scheme of unification is another commendable feature. It is unfortunate that there should be a difference of opinion in regard to the proposal for no other reason than that the first step towards unification is being taken in the northern states. when the whole scheme of unification is carried out Queensland will carry a very heavy obligation in respect of expenditure, the greater portion of which will occur in other states. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) said a lot about the undertakings which thc states should give before the scheme is proceeded with. I particularly direct his attention to the remarks of the Premier of Queensland ( Mr Theodore), who, speaking in the Legislative Assembly ou the South Brisbane to Kyogle Railway Agreement Bill, saidTliere is one other point that I think ought to be mentioned in justice to the whole question'of the uniform gauge, and that is that this is necessarily only the first step towards a uniform gauge in .Australia. We must not think that Queensland is getting a wonderfully good bargain out of it , and that we are adoptthink that any honourable members will ing it simply because we are getting a good bargain. Wc have entered wholeheartedly into the question of contributing towards a solution of the uniform-gauge problem, and Queensland was one of the few states at the Premiers' Conwas made by any Commonwealth Governference which were willing to adopt the whole scheme. In a later portion of his speech Mr Theodore saidQueensland was quite prepared to come into the whole scheme, but difficulties arose because ment and later by the South Australian Government. They were the two states which practically frustrated the carrying into operation the decision of the royal commission. So that tliere should be no misunderstanding, Mr Theodore again impressed upon members of the Legislative Assembly the nature of the contract when he saidWe are committing ourselves with our eyes open to further obligations than the £410,000 whicli is involved in tliis agreement when the other states come in and express their willingness to go on with the larger scheme of linking up the trunk lines. Our obligations then w ill be higher than the amount just mentioned, but, in any event are estimated not to exceed £2,000,000 or £2,800,000 Those statements by Mr Theodore show definitely that the people of Queensland understand the arrangement to which they are being committed. In contradiction of some of the statements made by the honourable member for KooyongI submit to the House these details of the apportionment of the unification expenditure, together with the estimated cost of the work to be carried out in each state:State. Quota of Cost of work As a matter of fact, Expenditure. in each State. N.S.W. .. £7,094,388 . . £1,657,000 Vic. 4,939,349 . . 8,324,000 Qld. 2,535,868 . 1,848,000 S.A. 1,632,292 . 4,674,000 WA. 1,078,103 . . 5,030,000 Cth. 4,320,000 .. , 67,000 Total. £21,600,000 £21,600,000 It will be seen that from a financial point of view the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales ancl Queensland will receive by far the worse of the deal. It is regrettable that Sir Henry Barwell, when Premier of South Australia, should have proved himself to be a ""little Australian "" by refusing to even participate in the discussion of this national work, merely because he was of the opinion that the Commonwealth had unduly delayed the commencement of the north-south railway. If they are quite candid, I do not contend that it is an urgent project. As a matter of fact, there is a difference of opinion as to whether a definite promise",36,Bruce

I make no complaint of that expenditure, having had an opportunity recently of inspecting some of the work that has been done. 1 think the scheme is highly commendable, and I am sure that the people of Queensland do not object, in the interests of all Australia, to contributing towards the cost. They are also bearing a proportion of the annual loss of £1,500,000 on the Oodnadatta railway. I do not believe in introducing these little side issues, but when they are introduced it is fair to remember that every state can find some ground for selfish complaint. should be discussed on its merits: aud I ask the House to recognize that New South Wales and Queensland will pay as their quota of the cost of unification a sum exceeding the value of the work that, will be carried out within their borders. The other states should welcome the carrying out of the Grafton to South Brisbane x-ailway as the first instalment of a general scheme of unification of railway gauges, which is undoubtedly a great national However, work. Having regard to South AusAlthoughI believe in the unification of interstate railways, I am not at present in favour of the unification of intra-state lands within its borders lines, because the country cannot afford the expense. The speech of the honorrepresentatives of that state able member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) contained much matter that calls for As far back serious consideration by this Parliament before it embarks on a scheme for the unification of interstate railways. This Parliament should first definitely and finally approve of the unification of the three sections of railway that have been referred to. If the Grafton to South Brisbane project is to be the first section to be converted let that be definitely stated in the bill, and let all the states alike be legally committed to it : If that is done, the argument we have had to-day w ill The honourable member for not recur. I believe the Government would be wise to re-draft the bill in that way. Sof a r as the proposal now before I certainly withdraw it . us is concerned, Queensland and New South Wales will be the only states to I remind those honparticipate in unification. The obligation should be equally binding upon all states, and honourable members of this Parliament should vote for a composite scheme for the standardization of the whole of the interstate railways fro m Fremantle to Brisbane. I believe that even the honourable member for Kooyong is agreeable to the unification of the interstate railway gauges. I would be prepared to vote in favour of a scheme of unification that extended from Fremantle to Brisbane. 1 congratulate the Government on the bill. It w ill stand to the credit of the Government f b r all time that it is the first Government of the Commonwealth to deal with the problem of the unificaThe bill tion of the railway gauges. The problem is of great importance to Australia, and should have been dealt with long ago.

Tie division list on the secondleading will show, apart from a few honourable members who have apparently been bludgeoned by the press of their states, those who have the necessary breadth of view and those who have not. I cannot imagine that any one who has had experience of our railways in peace time, to say nothing of war time, and who realizes the .enormous losses that result from the want of unification, will oppose the bill. In 1920, I was chairman of the Rural Industries Board of New South Wales, which was distributing large quantities of fodder to farmers who were in difficultiesas a result of the drought arid the war. The board purchased large quantities of fodder in Victoria and"" South Australia, but was unable to get it transported to New South Wales. Every siding between Melbourne and Wodonga was filled with trucks of fodder; but the congestion at Albury was such that the fodder ' could not be transhipped. A new siding was built, and electric light was installed so that work could be carried on both day and night. The farmers were losing money, and working stock was dying for want of the fodder that had already been purchased iu the southern markets. Such conditions may recur in the future. One fact that was stressed by the honourable member for Kooyong showed that he was not conversant with the facts. He correctly stated that no survey had been made of the route, and he suggested that it was, therefore, impossible to have even nn approximate idea of the cost of the line. He has evidently not had so much experience as I have had of the railway surveyors of' this country. Australian railway engineers are among the finest in the world. wherever they go as authorities on railway construction. They have had a wide experience in building railways in new country. Sixteen years ago I was in the Philippine Islands, and there a lot of railway construction work was being done under Australian engineers. who were in charge of railway construction work in China, and the engineers who were building the line from Capetown to Cairo, were Australians. Our engineers have had experience of building lines through country similar to that between Grafton Mr Manning. and South Brisbane, and it is only necessary for them to drive over the country in order to form an approximate estimate of what the line will cost. In New South Walesi t used to be the practice to have a careful survey and estimate made of the cost of all proposed lines, but it was found that the officers of the department were so accurate that the survey could be dispensed with. Thousands of pounds have in that way been saved to the state. After going through the country the engineers can form an estimate that is quite near enough for all practical purposes. ber name a railway that was built without a survey? Wyalong to Cargellico. I could mention a number of others that are now in course of construction that were not surveyed until after their construction had been recommended by the Public Works Committee. When the war broke out there was no railway from British East Africa, to the German territory in Africa. That line was built over a distance of 380 miles in less than a year; the country was not surveyed, two big rivers were bridged, and the whole of the work was carried out by the engineers going ahead and forming an estimate. A line such as that proposed, in the bill is in a different class from the proposals ordinarily submitted to the Public Works Committee. It is a national line, and it must be constructed whether it will pay or not. Recently the House gave a decided vote in favour of the railway from Yass to Canberra, the construction of which was not recommended by the Public Works1 Committee. The House would be justiThey are recognized fied, if it thought fit, in authorizing the construction of this railway without reference to the Public Works Committee. Another matter mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong was the bridge at Grafton. If he will look at the plan he will see that the bridge will serve not The men only this line, but two existing lines inNew South Wales. Even if this line is not built, the bridge will have to be built by the state. cost? what it will cost. Grafton is largely ou",38,Bruce

That is an example of the economic loss of the break of gauge. Another statement made by the honourable member for Kooyong was that this line is the only part of the work of unification that interests New South Wales. Again he is wrong in fact. It is of in finitely more importance to New South Wales to have a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge from Wodonga to Melbourne than from Kyogle to South Brisbane. the only part of the unification scheme that is in New South Wales. New South Wales had looked at it from that point of view, it would not have consented to the agreement. paid New South Wales to build the small part of the line iu that state better than to bear its share of the whole cost of the unification scheme.

The press has given a great deal of publicity to this matter during a This year over 2,000,000 number of years. I do not object to the influence of the press, nor question it3 right to criticize public projects of this nature. A Melbourne .newspaper has lately issued instructions to certain honourable members of this Parliament as to the attitude they must adopt on this bill, and it has directed them to be in their places when the vote is taken in order that they may vote against tlie measure; but I have a few press quotations which I submit are as authoritative as those which have appeared in that newspaper. I quote the following from I said that this line was the Melbourne Argus of 18th February, 1922: The question of the unification of the railadmit that.

106,Mr Manning,"upon any state, should be considered. To look at the proposal from the point of view of the immediate present, or of the early future, would be narrow-minded. If a uniform railway gauge would hasten the development of the Commonwealth, then the prospect of spending even so large a sum as £-21,000,000 should not stand in the way. The fact that we have railways implies that those railways should be complete and efficient. They certainly are not complete nor efficient now, seeing tliat through traffic cannot be carried on. Mr Hughes has asserted that if our losses of stock in one drought year could be averted, the amount saved would almost pay for the whole scheme of unification. probably overstated the case, but great losses have been caused in lean years because it has been impossible to transport speedily fodder from Victoria into the drought-stricken areas of New South Wales. It has been urged by the Victorian Railways Standing Committee, and other opponents of the scheme, that the times are unpropitious for involving the Commonwealtli in such huge expenditure. But the times will not become any more propitious by delay. If the'work had been commenced 40 years ago, when Sydney and Melbourne were joined by railway, we would have been better off, to-day. timidity, it be delayed for 40 .years more, the cost w ill be ten times greater than it would be to-day. Australia is not the only country which has had to face this problem"" It has been faced and overcome by Great Britain and America. There was probably opposition to the proposal in those countries, just as there is opposition here to-day; but the people of England or America would laugh at the suggestion that the pioneers who wrought the change acted unwisely. If wo have thc courage and vision to follow their bold example, the opposition now being manifested will probably inppi.ro similar derision a generation hence. The uniform gauge is not, however, a mere whim of Mr Hughes. It s advocates include experts of world-wide experience, members of the Federal Ministry, and the Premiers of all the states. proceeding with the work immediately is based on the ground that the cost is prohibitive in the present condition of the money market. But there is nothing to hope for by waiting. The money market may become easier a few years hence; but there would then be more conversion work to do, and the apparent benefit would thus disappear. The mobility essential to the economical and speedy handling of produce, and any plan which will give that mobility than has apparently been given to it by the Victorian Railways Standing Committee. is contemplated to increase greatly on irrigated areas in Victoria; and if it were possible to send soft fruits Brisbane without intermediate prosperity of -the growers would be greatly enhanced, and the value of the land considerablv increased. to-day and unloaded in New York, more than 3,000 miles away, the refrigerated cars not being opened in the interval. Mr Manning. possible but for the uniform gauge. Goods pass between Canada and the United States as easily as between Melbourne and Ballarat. America realized long ago that a uniform gauge meant reduced working expenses and an enormous saving in maintenance. Australia might as well learn the same lesson now as later. The only issue is whether a commencement should be made now or postponed. The longer the work is delayed the greater will be tlie difficulties and the liigher the ultimate cost. Some strong arguments were used in an a r t i c l e in the M e l b o u r n e A g e on the 2 0 t h HeJ a n u a r y , 1922, in f a v o u r of proceeding i m m e d i a t e l y w it h the u n if i c a t i o n of our gauges. I quote the f o l l o w in g from it : The failure of the Conference with the Premiers to make any progress in the plans for the unification of the Australian railway systems w ill greatly disappoint the public, which had been led to believe that this great national undertaking was at length to be proceededwith. It w ill amaze the people of Victoria to learn that the attitude of their representative was mainly responsible for the unhappy fate of If , through' the project. Have the people of Victoria ever expressed themselves in any other fashion but strongly in favour of the earliest possible commencement of the work of unifying the railway systems? In common with the people of the other states, the Victorian public recognizes that a uniform railway gauge over the wliole continent is essential for the future industrial development of Australia; that the job must be tackled, and that the longer it is postponed the more difficult and more costly does it become. 'Twenty-five years ago the cost of the whole undertaking w""as estimated at £3,000,000. Ten years ago it could have been accomplished for £20,000.000 less than the estimate to-day. Every year that the break of gauge is perpetuated adds millions to the ultimate cost of Whatever objection there is to the essential conversion. The Premier of Victoria has been a party to obtaining the indefinite postponement of the undertaking on exactly the same arguments as have secured its postponement' on every other occasion. The present is not the right time to tackle tlic problem. The present is never the time of railway rolling-stock is to tackle anything that involves trouble and difficulties. The argument that it would be unwise to merits more weighty consideration proceed with the work at the present stage because the cost of material is inflated and It labour charges would be high is mere baldersettlement dash. The undertaking is one of huge proportions, to Sydney and and there is so much to be worked out and handling, the arranged that, even with the utmost despatch from now on, it would probably be twelve months or more before spade would be put to Fruit is ""packed"" in California ground. The states are not asked to plank down the money immediately to meet the cost of the That would not be undertaking. As the work would be spread over many years, so would the financing, and if a slump is to come in tlie value of money the states would .be just as likely to benefit from it by getting the preliminary work in hand immediately as by waiting upon problematic events. Next year and tlie year after there will be plenty of fresh difficulties in the way of starting the undertaking to provide such provincialson with excuses and arguments for fresh postponements. Mi'. Lawson's attitude towards the unification of the railway gauge is not the attitude of the people of Victoria. attitude, of a nerveless Administration and a lazy officialdom. I could also quote from a vigorous article which appeared in the Age on the 26th June, 1922, hut I think I have quoted suflicicnt to show the great importance of proceeding w i th the unification of. our gauges Avithout further delay. reply to the argument that we cannot afford to go on w i th the work at present is that we cannot afford not to go on with it. If Australia had this and other railways built, such as one crossing the Barklay Camooweal with Bourke, the north-south line, and the Hay to Port Augusta or BrokenH ill Augusta lines, it would be in an infinitely better position to carry the burden of debt it would then have than it is at the present time to meet its liabilities, because the increased development would lead to national prosperity. time has come, not for postponement of the work of unification of the railway gauges, but for action. If the bill is regarded from the right point of view, it will be passed without delay. respect to honourable members, I suggest that many of the speeches on this measure have been beside the mark. Probably three-fourths of the arguments used have been in favour of unification, but that is not the matter at issue. I suppose that every honourable member is in favour of the unification of our railway gauges, and I am even prepared to say that the construction of this particular line is the first part of a general unification plan which might justly be carried out; but when I come to look at the b ill , I feel compelled to ask myself whether the building of the proposed line w ill contribute in any degree to the attainment «f the general scheme. We should examine the measure and the agreement attached to it , to see whether they will carry out its avowed purpose. Having considered all the facts and circumstances, I am driven to the conclusion that the bill w ill have the opposite effect. Instead of promoting the continental scheme, it w ill delay it , and increase the difficulties in future negotiations. "" We have been told a good many times that the It ds only the subject should he considered from a broad national stand-point, but I am beginning to suspect those who use that phrase, for it is often employed with particular emphasis by honourable members who wish to applaud some purely local project. The able and thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Kooyong My( Mr Latham) is one which must have given every honourable member cause to think. city in every case. Tableland and connecting gest that any honourable member lacks capacity to appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong, and is to Port unable to approve of his irresistible logic. The proposal under consideration, instead of helping on a broad national enterprise, is rather calculated to delay it . The original agreement of 1920 was 'entered into between the Commonwealth and the The states, and it has been wrongly referred to as . tlie real basis of the scheme. That agreement, however, f u r nished an example of those extraordinary, aud I may say arbitrary, methods of personal administration which were W it h all iu vogue at that time in Australia, and the people clearly in dicated at the last election that governments should revert to constitutional methods of administration. The agreement was supposed to bind the states as a whole, but it apparently contained no provision that the terms of the agreement should be submitted to and approved by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth or the states. The agreement was entered into by half a dozen men, who professed to represent the whole of Australia, and it was simply one to give effect to the recommendations of the royal commission. The only mistake, if I may say so, that the honourable member for Kooyong made was to refer to the preamble of the bill",40,Bruce

So that, in addition to the capital It was admitted wealth is to incur, and the annual intheir portion by the various states. When we apeak of taking money out of the Commonwealth purse it must be remembered that it' is not a separate purse, and that the money comes out of the pockets of the people in the different states. only playing with words to say that the citizens' of the different states are not finding the money. It will be seen that a heavy charge will rest upon them for the completion of one piece of the work of the unification of gauges. It has been suggested that if this proposal is agreed to there will be no inducement for New South Wales and Queensland to bear their share in the cost of completing the unification scheme when it is brought forward. In reply to the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning), I say (hat in advancing this argument I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) took the"" same view of the matter as I do myself. He had no intention whatever of specifically reflecting upon the citizens of New South Wales and Queensland. I do not suppose that they differ in character in any way from the citizens of the other states, and it will scarcely be denied that in their own interests they would act in the way which has been suggested if an opportunity were afforded them to do so. otherwise. bound by any definite promise or undertaking. There is nothing in this bill to bind Queensland and New South Walesi n any way whatever tofulfil their part of the general unification of gauge scheme when it is brought forward. What is the real position ? We find that New South Wales and Queensland will, under this b ill, obtain the completion of a work to cost £3,500,000 for an expenditure on their part of £1,500,000. Let us see what would bo the position if the general unification of gauge scheme were carried to completion. On the same basis of payment, according to population, if the complete scheme, were carried out this would be the result, according to the information supplied to me this afternoon by the Prime Minister: In Western Australia the cost of work carried out in the state would be £5,030,000; the quota paid by the state would be £1,078,000. tralia the cost of work in the state would be £4,674,000, whilst the quota paid by the state would be £1,632,000. In Victoria the cost of the work in the state would be £8,324,000, and the quota paid by Victoria would be £4,939,000. In New South Wales the cost of work in the It ie state would be £1,657,000, whilst its quota would be £7,094,000. In Queensland the cost of work in that state would be £1,848,000, whilst its quota would be £2,535,000. For the Commonwealth the cost of the work done would be £67,000, and the Commonwealth's quota would be £4,320,000. In . the face of these figures it will, I think, be admitted that if the unification of gauge scheme is completed there will be a very strong temptation for Queensland and New South Wales to findreasons why the work should not be carried any further than is proposed by this bill. Those states are, under the bill, to have £3,500,000 worth of work done for them for an expenditure by them of £1,500,000, whereas under the general unification scheme they would have £3,400,000 worth of work done for them and would have to pay £9,000,000. Australia and Western Australia squeak like a lot of stuck pigs. honourable member suggest that when the railway proposed under this bill is conN o t being bound to do structed, and a proposal is brought forward by the poorer states for the completion of the unification of gauge scheme, the people of New South Wales are not going to squeak ?

There is nothing in this bill to indicate that if this particular further will be done in the matter of the unification of gauges. ter said that this particular proposal is one of the recommendations commission. right honourable that there was' a series of recommendations by the commission. honourable gentleman suggested, he did not say so in definite terms, that the Western Australian sections of the scheme were recommended by the commission in that order. whether the phrase he used meant It is a most unfortunate the matter, and is not in accord with the report of the royal commission. railway is not the subject of a separate recommendation is just part of one big scheme. not contemplated by the commission it should be considered in any way at all apart from the rest of its scheme. members of the royal commission were indeed very wise from a political point of view, and wiser perhaps than are some members of this House. They probably foresaw many of the difficulties would arise in the way I have suggested, and they said distinctly that the work of the unification of the gauges could be commenced simultaneously states. part of the work to be carried out in Queensland, and that other works the first to be carried out in other states. If honourable members will refer, not only to the report of the commission, but. also to the map attached to it, they will find that the order in which the work is to be carried out is set down. into first, secpnd. and third stages, and so on. They will also find that portions of the line in Western South Australia, and this particular line, Mr Mann. forward. In most of the are linked together to be simultaneously built. It is therefore incorrect to say that it was the recommendation of Austhe royal commission that this particular line is the one which should be first conIt structed. Personally, I think it would be most improper tliat this House, without any guarantee whatever that the wholescheme of unification is to be The argument apcarried out, should consent to the work proposed in the bill. There has that been seme talk about the unification of gauges being held up because of conditions attached toi t , to which line is built, anything some of the states object. In the answers which I received to-day from the Prime The Prime MinisMinister, South Australia has come in for special criticism on this account. South of the royal Australia did not, apparently, object to It would appear from the the schema as laid down by the royal comgentleman's statement mission. There was nothing in the answers to my question to indicate that. The right although The objection was only that the present is net considered an opportune time for Kyogle, South Australian, and the carrying out of the work, and South Australia desired delay on that account. There are very good reasons for considerI particularly asked him ing that the time is not opportune that. for going on with this scheme. Do honway of putting orable members forget the tremendous stress under which we have been This during the last ten years, and the repeated financial difficulties with which we. by the commission.

Eager as they may be It was to see the scheme of unification of gauges that completed, do they consider that the present is a time to add an additional liaThe bility of nearly £22,000,000 to our already overwhelming debtl to a lot more than that. I am taking the estimate that has alreadybeen given. The honourable member for Kooyong pointed out that we have no in all of the recent estimates of cost. We do not know They said that this was the first what; the proposed line will cost. There are no surveys, no details, and no reports were upon which to base a reliable opinion. We aro asked to give a blank cheque to three officials to do practically what they like with it . That is a monstrous proposal to submit to any Parliament. We must deal with the estimates of cost that It is divided have been submitted, and I again ask honourable members whether they consider it a reasonable thiug to propose at this Australia and time to add another £22,000,000 to our alreadv overwhelming debt? W it h in the next twelve or fifteen months we shall be-",44,Bruce
120,Mr Gbegoby,The cost will amount,45,Bruce
121,Which Mr Mann,"No doubt it will, butsomething like £72,000,000 of loan money, at probably increased interest rates. Are we to still further increase the difficulties with which the Commonwealth will be faced in financing its ordinary war liabilities ? D i d not the Commonwealth and State Governments admit the difficulty of the present position when they found it necessary to come to an agreement for the limitation of borrowing? Under agreement with the states, the Commonwealth has issued a loan of about £10,000,000, so that the money market may be favorable when the large Commonwealth conversions have to be made. On top of that, the Government now proposes to expend £3,500,000 on the construction of a line from Grafton to South Brisbane. Honourable members know perfectly well that this is a conservative estimate. When the railway is completed there is every likelihood of the expenditure being £5,000,000. plaints have been made by various states that because of limiting their borrowing at the request of the Commonwealth, some of their big developmental schemes have had to be considerably curtailed. If the proposed expenditure of £3,500,000 were used to construct large developmental schemes, increased wealth and population might result. One reason for constructing this railway was that it would run through very picturesque country! We are not justified in spending this amount at a time when the money market is admittedly stringent. justified in building the east-west railway during war time. that because of the slack methods adopted in building that line, it cost probably twice as much as it should have cost. Surely that should be an object lesson to us. I am anxious to see the unification scheme completed, but it is hopeless to expect it in the immediate future. We shall defeat the object of the scheme by attempting to carry it out piecemeal. Since the original agreement was made, governments and conditions have changed. It is time for fresh light and thought to be introduced into this scheme. It should be referred back to the state governments. It is not right for this Parliament to practically bind the states for all time to certain payments without eVen consulting prepared to accept the obligation. I am not considering this matter from a parochial or narrow point of view. If the states were bound to a definite scheme, I should be quite prepared to say that the line from Grafton to Brisbane should be the first, and probably the Kalgoorlie to Fremantle section the last to be built. I have not lost all sense of proportion. Let the line be built where it would do the most, good and serve the greatest number of people. But first the states must bind themselves to complete the whole scheme. It would be foolish to construct a small section of line in New South Wales and Queensland, and to give facilities to those two states without those states accepting this obligation. Theb ill should not be rushed through this House without honourable members having f u l l information at their disposal. I am not against the unificaComtion scheme, but before this section of it is constructed, further inquiries should be made. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kooyong. I hope all honourable members will support his proposal, which at least is wise and cautious, and is certainly not narrow and small as represented by some honourable members. We should consider the whole scheme, which we all hope will at some time be fulfilled , rather than confine our views to state interests. listened with interest to the debate on this b ill . It is extraordinary that those No more than we were honourable members who support the bill have asked other honourable members to take a broad national view, even though It is common knowledge they themselves are speaking solely i u the interests of their own states or electorates. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), when speaking the other night, referred to the benefit that this railway would confer upon his electorate, and he then entreated honourable members to view it as a national undertaking. Other honourable members have spoken in the same strain. Generally speaking, they have stated that this is part of a scheme to unify the railway gauges of Australia. This railway, if constructed, would serve the interests only of New South Wales and Queensland. Its construction is not now essential, and if proceeded with, the expense should be borne by those two. states. Some years ago an",45,Bruce

There still remains a gap of 20 miles to be served by railway, which the New South Wales Government has failed to construct.

I refer him to the following article, which appeared in the Age of the 22nd September: Under the pretence of commencing the unification of gauges on existing railways, the Bruce-Page Government is about to build an entirely new railway that, in the case of some of thc States, may lead to disastrous consequences. An examination of the history of the Kyoglc-Brisbane Railway Bill and the 'Grafton regrading proposal leads inevitably to that conclusion. Victoria has to be on its guard against an unusual kind of political joba job, too, proposed by men who are supposed to be representatives of this State, and to give special in New South Wales and Queensland by attention to its interests. If the bill dealt with the general unification of railway gauges in Australia. I should vote for it .

It is the duty of every South Australian representative to adopt the attitude that I am taking, and to use his best efforts to bring about the construction of that line. by the royal commission on the unification of gauges were adopted by this Parliament in September, 1921, three years ago. The Northern Territory Acceptance Act was passed in 1910, fourQueensland constructed a teen years ago. Honourable members representing New South Wales and Queensland have repeatedly asked members representing the other states not to take a parochial view of this proposition. I remind them that when the proposal to expend moneys on certain works at Canberra was before this House, I voted for it , because the agreement with the State of New South Wales warranted that expenditure. Honourable members heard the information with which the Minister for Works and Railways furnished me to-day regarding the capital expenditure at Canberra. Notwithstanding those heavy dis bursements by the Commonwealth, the representatives nf New South Wales ask that the Pederal Treasury shall be further burdened by the construction of a costly railway to benefit that state. The Melbourne Tieraid, in a leading ' article on 22nd September, saidBut it is charged against the Bruce-Page Government that' the national aspect of this railway proposal is only a pretence, that tliere is no real intention, because the Government knows quite well that it cannot find the means, to proceed to any useful extent with the unification of gauges, that the whole business is nothing but a dodge to catch votes making the people of other States contribute to the cost of their local railway undertakings. Circumstances certainly give colour to the charges. The unification of gauges is an important undertaking that must be squarely tackled as soon as feasible. But no one seriously suggests that in our present financial position, and in the condition of the local and foreign money markets, it is an immediate practical possibility. The Commonwealtli Government itself shows how little it thinks of the likelihood by continuing to construct new railways with varying gauges. There is no evidence, in any comprehensive plan, that the profession of making the Kyogle railway the first instalment of a great national undertaking to solve thc break of gauge difficulty is sincere. In the absence of such evidence it No . The Commonwealth is not unreasonable that thc taxpayers in the States which will get no benefit from the new line should ask why they should be made to Territory from South Australia, contribute to providing local railway facilities in Queensland and New South Wales.

New parties spring up and do not hesitate to admit frankly that their object is to obtain a position where they hold the balance of power, and to gain their ends by a species o£ political blackmail.

I have been wondering whether the railway is portion of the "" blackmail"" which the Prime Minister referred. have copies of newspapers published a long way from Victoria which see a relationship statement made by the right gentleman. members of the Country party who support the Nationalists in the composite government quo. vernment offer that the South Australian section of railway to be converted would be undertaken first ? was made; at any rate, the subject is worthy of investigation. The supporters of this project have asked us to take a broad national view of the bill, but 1 think the lionorable member for Perth( Mr Mann) was right in saying that the main question to be considered is whether the time is opportune for the carrying out of this scheme. As one of the representatives of a state that has a grievance against the Commonwealth, I am opposed to any expenditure upon railway construction that will delay the commencement of the north-south line. that the Commonwealth is able to expend on railway construction should be applied to that overdue line, and the general scheme for the unification of gauges throughout the Commonwealth should be referred to a conference of Premiers. This bill will render the State of South Australia liable for a proportion of a large capital expenditure. The Barwell Government adopted a scheme for the conversion of the western railway system from the 3-ft. 6-in. to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, in respect of which the present State Government is committed to an expenditure of £3,000,000. W it h that heavy financial burden to bear, the state cannot afford to incur a further liability for the construction of the Grafton to South Brisbane railway. Although Sir Henry Barwell was opposed to the general scheme for the unification of railway gauges, it does not follow that the same view is taken by the present South Aus^ tralian Ministry; but, havingbeen committed by its predecessor to a work in volving au expenditure of £3,000,000, it should not be asked to contribute towards the cost of railway development i u New was about to say that South Wales and Queensland.

A t the risk of being condemned as parochial by the representatives of New South Wales and Queensland, I say that until the I believe that promise Commonwealth honours its compact with South Australia regarding the north-south line, I shall not support any proposal for the construction of other railways by the Commonwealth. I shall vote for the amendment as the best available alternative to the bill, in the hope that we may be able to avoid committing the Commonwealth to a haphazard scheme for the building of a small length of local railway on the pretence that it is the first section of a general scheme for the unification of railway gauges. A u y money -Usually I find myself so much in accord with the views which the honourable member for Perth presents with such, lucidity, that I feel relieved of the responsibility of speaking on subjects to which he has addressed himself, but on this occasion I am very reluctantly compelled to take a stand diametrically opposed to his.

Labour Government one of the blackmailers to which the honourable member referred ? ment of Queensland is shrewd enough lo take advantage of everything that is offered for the benefit of its state. If it can get the Queensland representatives in this Parliament to cause the Government to build at the expense of the general taxpayer, a line which will be of advantage to Queensland, it cannot be blamed for so doing: but honourable members generally are here to see that the fair thing is done.

We ought to be doing something to make the Northern Territory less of a losing proposition than it is. We should be considering the building of the north-south railway rather than the Grafton to South Brisbane line. South Australia has waited patiently for the Commonwealth Government to honour its compact, and I have endeavoured time after time to get the Prime Minister to make a statement regarding the Government's intention in that matter.

That work should be done before the Kyogle to Brisbane line is commenced. The Commonwealth Government built the east-west line, which, although beneficial to Western Australia and South Australia, was also beneficial to Sydney, conditionally on the Western Australian Government reconstructing the Kalgoorlie to Fremantle line on the uniform gauge. That has not been done. If the people of New South Wales could get the H a y to Port Augusta line built they would let the people of Victoria and South Australia "" go hang.""

Pirie. to go on to Port Augusta. Something serious must be wrong to lead the South Australian Government to continue building 5-ft. 3-in. gauge lines when it is commonly agreed to be very necessary that we should unify our gauges. ""When the Parliaments of Australia are ready to consider the interests of the general taxpayers, and throw off the shackles of state rights, mistakes of that kind will not be made, and we shall not be engaged in acrimonious debates on proposals of this kind. The political aspect of this proposed line is more important to some honourable members than any other aspect of it. I have no doubt that if this bill is passed the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) will go back to his constituents and tell them of the greur. light he made for it. If the bill is agreed to, and I suppose the Government his the numbers to carry the day, the honourable member should be able to retain his hold on his electorate for the next ten or twelve years. put my finger on the right spot. The honourable member's broad national outlook is limited to Murwillumbah and thc country surrounding it. He and some other honourable members have discussed this measure from the unification of gauges point of view with their tongue in their cheek. In my opinion, political expediency is the reason for the introduction of the measure. If the Government had an earnest desire to unify our railway gauges it would honour the compact which was made with South Australia years ago, and build a line from Oodnadatta to Darwin. The Prime Minister knows that it was suggested not so long ago by the present Attorney General of South Australia, that legal .opinion should be taken about the position of the various governments respecting the agreement to build the north-south line. In fact it was even suggested that the South Australian Government should go to law on the matter. I certainly, think that a writ of habeas corpus should be issued calling upon the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) to produce the body of the north-south railway. In his speech on this measure, the Prime Minister said that he was confident that if the Government took this first step towards unification the people would see that it was sincere, but before I shall believe that it is sincere I shall need some assurance that it intends, in the near future, to put in hand the building of the Oodnadatta to Darwin line. The previous Government when extending the line from Katherine to Bitter Springs, laid sleepers that would take a 4-ft. 8^-in. line, but that is all that has been done. My opposition to this measure is not to be taken as opposition to the building of developmental railway lines in Australia, for I believe that there is very little country in the Commonwealth which does not merit railway facilities. I object to the bill for the reason that I consider that the various states of the Commonwealth are not being fairly treated. South Australia is attempting ito make her railwavs more efficient by broadening her gauges; but if the Prime Minister would ""take hold of the problem of the unification of our railway gauges as he could do, he could prevent money from being wasted in building additional 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railways, and ses that any extensions or reconstructions of existing lines in any of the states were on the uniform gauge of 4 f t . in.

Unless given good reasons why I should change my views, I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). A t present the arguments of the honourable member appear to me to be unanswerable. This is a b ill To approve anil provide for the carrying out of an agreement entered into between tlie Commonwealtli of Australia and the states of New South Wales and Queensland respecting the construction of a railway of standard gauge between Kyogle and South. Brisbane, and the re-grading and re-laying of the railway between Grafton and Kyogle and to authorize the raising and expending of moneys for the purposes of the agreement. The first thing that strikes me is that the purpose of the bill as set out in the preamble makes no reference to the state of Victoria, of which I , by the grace of God, am a citizen and a taxpayer. If one only read the preamble, which is supposed to explain the bill to some extent, he would be justified in viewing the proposal with the detached and judicial air of a totally disinterested person, but from clause 9 of its portentous schedule the following particulars are to be gleaned: 1. Tlie Cost of the said works shall in the first instance he from time to time provided by the Commonwealth out of moneys legally available for that purpose. 2. Of the money provided by the Commonwealth as aforesaid{«<} four-fifths (hereinafter called the quota of the states) shall be deemed to be provided on behalf of the said five states collectively; and [b) one-fifth shall be deemed to be provided on behalf of the Commonwealth. 3. New South Wales and Queensland shall in amounts and at times and in manner hereinafter set forth re-imbursc to the Commonwealth the amounts respectively attributable to them of thc said quota of the states. That statement not only affects my view of the bill as a whole, but, if the expression is parliamentary, discovers "" the nigger in the wood-pile."" This bill is one calculated to bring a sense of elation to all members. stance, it must necessarily be a source of delight to those who see in it machinery for getting something for nothing. That is human nature the world over. It must bring a truer and greater measure of delight to those who, in a spirit of pure altruism, delight in giving something to their neighbour for which they have received nothing in return. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) rightly pointed 'out, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson), that in the case of the north-south railway there was a quid pro quoa definite contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth arid the State of South Australia under which the construction of the line was promised to that state. There is a condition known to naturalists as protective coloration. Certain insects, reptiles, birds, and animals acquire the colour of their surroundings, and especially of surrounding foliage, as a protection against their natural enemies. This phenomenon also occurs in the political world. Members of Parliament are known to be affected by the views of their constituents and their local geographical conditions; sometimes unconsciously and sometimes consciously. Possiblyi t is to be found in other walks of life as well, but the exacting duties which we have to perform under the searching light of public criticism, and, more often than not, under the incubus of public reproach, makes this protective agency more necessary in politics than perhaps in any other walk of life . It is seen in the expression of the views of honourable members in regard to this bill. There is another principle which is not so well known to naturalists, but which is quite well known to politicians, and a very curious convulsion is created in the political world when the principle of protective coloration comes into violent contact with the equally important and almost irresistible principle of broad national spirit. When we have these two working in conflict, we have brought about a political chaos which results in the honourable member for Boothby( Mr. Duncan-Hughes) and myself voting on the same side, and other similarly unlikely incidents occur. For instance, a victi m of this convulsion is seen in the honourable member for Brisbane( MrD . Cameron). This amiable honourable member does not speak often, but when Fori n -",53,Bruce
173,Mr Brennan (Batman) [9.51],"he does he is listened to with pleasure and attention. This afternoon he came owtof course, so he told us, on broad national grounds-as a whole-hearted supporter of this bill. Wc might naturally think that he was animated by a broad national spirit, and there was nothing of protective coloration in his attitude until we found that the proposed railway is going to run right into his electorate. Then we began to consider which of the two great principles to which I have referred have dominated the honourable member. i-i in into my electorate. walking distance of it. to it that the point is hardly worth discussion. Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) says quite truly that it will run to within comfortable walking distance of the honourable member's electorate, and when we are dealing with the unification of the railway gauges of Australia, I suggest that a mistake to the extent measured by a comfortable walking distance, in the distance to be covered by this railway, cannot be cavilled at as a serious inaccuracy on my part. Breadth of vision is the appeal which was made to us by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning). It is a curious coincidence that the honourable member who appeals to us for breadth of vision should be a taxpayer of New South Wales, who is to be given something for nothing under this bill. would be improper for me to attribute to the honourable member any other motive for support of the bill than consideration of the matter in a broad national spirit. The honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson), the representative of another New South Wales constituency, says that this railway will be so obviously to thc advantage of all citizens of Australia that he can hardly understand how any citizen of Australia can do other than give it his whole-hearted support. I interjected-whic h was disorderly-and now repeat more in order, that the same argument might be iised to a greater or less degree in regard to almost all the railof public funds for indigent poets. If ways in the great mother State of New South Wales. It would be very unfortunate for Victoriai f New South Wales had no railways. It would also be unfortunate for Victoriai f Queensland had no railways; or if there were no transcontinental railway and no railways in Western Australia. Still, honourable members must not forget that we are not yet a unified Commonwealth. This so called parochialism is not merely a sentimental matter. There is the practical fact to be remembered that we are taxpayers of different sovereign states, aud from that point of view we are bound, whether under the principle of protective . coloration or the principle of a broad national spirit, to express the view which seems to represent fair play to the particular state of which we are taxpaying citizens.

It bears that fact upon its face. Nowherei n the bill or in the long, loosely-drawn schedule attached to it , is one word binding the states that are to benefit by this proposal, to any subsequent well-considered scheme of unification for Australia.

The time is ripefor another nonorable members to record a decided opinion upon the principle underlying the bill, the method of its iutrcdtiction, the object it has in view, the influences at work in having it tabled in this chamber, and the obvious injiistice that it wil l work upon the other states of the Commonwealth if it is passed. However, in the meantime, it w ill serve my purpose to vote for the amendment. It is curious that bills of this kind-and they are becoming very common with the present National Government are introduced with a long and apologetic preamble. There is, as the Prime Minister knows perfectly well, a French phrase-qu is'exexpensive cuse, s'accuse-whic h alleges that people railway, designed to benefit, who excuse themselves accuse themselves. This phrase always occurs to my mind when a long preamble of explanation and excuse is made by the Government in introducing a short b ill .

I am quite The Government should not ask the House to accept the responsibility for this loosely-drawn agreement, especially in the absence of f u l l information regarding the ultimate liability of the work. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) made a very incisive, plain, condemnatory speech, and there has not been an attempt ou the part of the Government toanswer it . When the bill was submitted to the House last week I examined the agreement carefully, and found, to my utter surprise, that there was no binding provision in it to make New South Wales and Queensland responsible for their pro rata contributions for the complete unification scheme.

184,Mr Foster (Wakefield) [10.24],"stances-havin g due regard to my responsibility to the people of this country -vot e for this expenditure without adequate provision being made to safeguard the complete scheme of unification. We have nothing definite as to the cost of the proposed railway. We should at least have a certificate supplied by a Railways Commissioner, on behalf of the Government, giving the approximate cost of the line. This Parliament had a bitter experience when the construction of the eastwest railway was undertaken. Before that work was commenced the Commonwealth Government summoned to its aid and sought the advice of the chief engineers of no fewer than three states of the Commonwealth. Proper and reliable estimates were given. The Government subsequently undertook to construct the railway with heavier rails and to alter materially the whole character of the line, but estimates of the work were not available until the railway was completed. This was the biggest scandal in railway construction that Australia had experienced. constructed a reliable estimate of the cost should be obtained. that the estimate of £3,500,000 is only approximate, and that a portion of the proposed route has not yet been surveyed. asked to vote millions of pounds for this proposal. It is about time that the people of this country insisted on a proper aud specialized administration of the Railway Department of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government charged the states with lack of appreciation of their responsibilities in regard to the unification of railway gauges. I remind tlie Prime Minister that the states have had a bitter experience in recent years. A t thc end of the war they wore left with depleted resources, and railways that had been starved. U p to the present moment they have not recovered the leeway, and the best experts in their employ-me n infinitely more competent than the Commonwealth employs-de clare that whilst the unification of gauges is advisable, under existing conditions it is better in the interests of everybody to attend to the pressing needs of the established systems, and undertake essential developments that w ill give immediate returns. I believe that every state in tlie Commonwealth, when building new r a i lways, makes provision in connection with bridges and culverts for a possible standardization of the gauges in the near future . The Commonwealth Government evidently is very desirous of spending money upon the construction of railways that should be built by the states in terested. If there is one department that requires overhauling, it is the Commonwealth Railway Department, and if there is one Government that needs expert advice to guide it in railway matters, it is that of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has caught this railway construction fever from his predecessors, and for a loug time has been anxious to make the transcontinental railway more attractive by carrying out a high-sounding project to make it continuous from Premantlo to Brisbane-fro m the east coast to the west coast. That would be a very desirable scheme if Australia could afford the expense; but consider for a moment what it would mean. Three trains a week are run on the east-west railway, and each train cannot accomBefore this proposed railway is modate more than 90 passengers. South Australia has to run three trains a week It has been said at a loss to handle the transcontinental traffic, although the 270 passengers could be accommodated i u one ordinary train . Because tliere is a break of gauge at Port Yet this Parliament is loosely Augusta, the Government desires to continue the standard gauge, believing, apparently, that people who have been cramped in a railway carriage for three days cannot carry their luggage across a station platform to enter another t r a in . has As a matter of fact, the walk and exercise are a positive benefit to them. The Prime Minister said that, in order to increase the present traffic of 270 passengers per week, it was proposed to build a railway to RedH ill . Years ago, the South Australian Public Works Committee investigated a proposal to build that line, and found that it would show an annual loss of £135,000. If this extension is to make the transcontinental railway more attractive, the attraction w ill certainly not be felt by the taxpayers. The proposed Grafton to South Brisbane r a i lway is only one portion of the complete scheme put forward by the Commonwealth. The other parts are the sections from Grafton to Hay, and from H a y to Port Augusta. Recently the Melbourne Aae published a statement by Mr Kernot, the Victorian Chief Engineerf o r Railway Construction, one of the most eminent constructing engineers in Australia. In criticizing the Commonwealth's scheme, he pointed out that, under an agreement between New South Wales and Victoria, which should have been made 30 years ago. Victoria is extending its railway across rhe Murray River into New South Wales. The host of the Riverina coun-' try, on the northern side of the river, w ill states, to carry a handful of passengers, be served by lines that are now in course of construction, and there w ill be nothing left for the Grafton to Port Augusta line but a stretch of dry and second-rate pastoral country, over which the maximum traffic of 270 passengers per will be carried. fact, probably 200 be booked for Adelaide or Melbourne, and only 70 will be left to be carried over that enormous length of line to the eastern seaboard. The statements made by Mr Keriiot should be investigated. A new railway running through even good pastoral countiy is not profitable at the outset, but God help the Government that builds a line through second-rate pastoral country ! submit this'line to the National caucus? so I would have obtained some expert opinion about it very quickly, and would have given it to the public and the Parliament. In submitting a proposal like this without essential safeguards, the Government is not treating this Parliament fairly. The House should insist upon those safeguards being provided before itgives approval to this section of the general unification scheme. I kuow something of this proposal, because I was in office when the report upon the unification of gauges was received from the experts who had been brought from Great Britain and America, and when it was first submitted to the Premiers' Conference. I admit readily that for the amount of money to be expended the railway from Grafton to South Brisbane will yield a better result than will any other portion of the complete unification scheme recommended by the experts. It will also remove one of the breaks of gauge-that will be a blessing-and with proper consultation and advice from experts, the other break of gauge at Port Augustacould be removed by a line which, instead of making an annual loss of £135,000, would make no loss at all. This hit-or-miss policy which the Government is submitting will be disastrous. It is a disgrace to the Parliament, and the sooner there is an investigation, aud this sort of administration terminates, the better for everybody. While the Commonwealth is ready to add to the nonpaying railways by building new lines through the dry country of the northern for fourteen years it has failed to recognize its responsibilities to honour a solemn agreement with South Australia to develop the great Northern Territory. By its neglect the Commonwealth has been week postponing development in that direction. As a matter of If about £1,500,000 had been spent ten or twelve years ago in extending the of them will Oodnadatta line northwards, tremendous development, whicli would have astonished the people of Australia, would already have taken place. An outlet would have been provided for prime fat cattle that would have been a godsend to people in the metropolitan areas during periods of drought when they were starving for meat, and buying inadequate supplies at famine prices. The House would be justified in giving a week's consideration to this b ill . I should'be glad to see this portion of the complete unification scheme tackled, but I cannot conceive how any Government, can ask honourable members to vote for this proposal u n t i l by act of Parliament the obligation is placed upon the states of New South Wales and Queensland to contribute their quota towards the complete scheme even though it be not carried out for the next 20 or 30 years. I say, frankly, that there is no chance of its being completed for 50 years, but the liability of those two states should be indisputably established, so that when the complete scheme is undertaken the honouring of their responsibility will not be left to the whims of changing Governments. In the absence of information that we ought to have, I have no option but to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong. It is a f a i r amendment. We want solid, reliable information. There would be nothing improper in referring this work to the Public Works Committee, although the railway will not be constructed by the Commonwealth. will participate in the construction of it .",57,Bruce

I see my own state sacrificed so that a railway can be built in New South Wales in the interests of the coalition Government. The bill makes a doormat of South Australia. As the proposed railway in the Northern Territory, which had an agreement, behind it, was referred to the Public Works Committee, this railway, to construct which the Government is not bound by an agreement, should also be referred to that committee. there any hurry to deal with this matter ? Tho hurry is because the Government is afraid that the political pact will break down. in danger, and for that reason the bill is being pushed tlirough the House. also oppose the bill for the reasons stated by the honourable member for Kooyong. There is nothing in the bill to bind New South Wales or Queensland to finish the job of unifying the gauges. It is a loose, haphazard bill, and I cannot support it. am opposed to the bill for the reason that, although we are told that the railway will cost, approximately, £3,500,000, wo have no definite data before us. The interest on the assumed cost of construction will amount to £210,000 per annum. There should be a permanent survey of the proposed line, and the cost, roughly £11,000 for Queensland, and £5,000 for New South Wales, should be borne by those states. That would enable us to know exactly where the line is to go. careful estimate of the cost of compensating owners of the land through which the line will pass. We should be furnished with particulars as to the material required for the permanent way, such as rails, sleepers, points, and crossings, and the necessary earthworks, bridges, and culverts; in fact, all the surveying, engineering, and general charges. I require all those particulars to be submitted before I record my vote. At the present time honourable members have practically no data before them; they are asked to support a theoretical proposition. I have never heard of such a proposal being submitted to a Parliament. If honourable members were directors of a company, and agreed to the building of a railway under these conditions, they would be hounded out of their positions. The shareholders in this instance are the people of Australia, and it is incumbent upon the House to know exactly how every penny of the people's money is to be spent. I point out that the agreement does not make the states responsible for their share in the cost of the work. Thc bill is not creditable to the Government, and honourable members should not be asked to vote on it in the absence of the data that should be furnished Why is to enable them to come to a proper determination. We do not know what the rolling-stock will cost, or what the loss will be. The whole of the work Thc Treasurer says the pact, is is to be handed over to a railway council, which will be able to spend money as it I wishes. Once the bill is passed, Parliament will have no control over the expenditure. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has stated that the Government will, of course, have to find the money, and we all know that once a work of this nature is commenced it will have to be completed. I shall vote for the amendment. have been many reasons advanced as to why this proposal should be regarded from a broad national stand-point. I am reminded of an incident at the opening of the Coolgardie water scheme. The weather was hot, and the public houses were doing a good business. At one of the many functions held in connection with the event, the late Sir George Reid made a fine speech, in the course of which There should also be prepared a he said that he had never heard so much talk about water, and had never seen so little of it drunk.

As a keen business man, would the Prime Minister invest his money in such a project on such flimsy estimates? Dr. the most reproductive works in Australia. through electorates which the Treasurer and three other supporters of the Government represent. Mr Alex. Smith, in delivering an address in which he gave the history of railway gauges in Australia, saidIn the "" fifties"" far-seeing advisers of the colonics, who had a near acquaintance with the merits of the gauge controversy, decided, upon the broader """"Irish,"" or 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. The colonics of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia endorsed the choice, and made it the standard-in Now South Wales by Act of Parliament. Possibly an even wider gauge might have been recommended had rolling-stock of wider gauge been a market article. Victoria and South Australia abode loyally by the contract and commenced construction. Then New South Wales changed its policy, its engineer, and its gauge,.and the unique opportunity for obtaining uniformity was wilfully thrown away. Since then various other gauges have been introduced on the plea of their suitability for cheap pioneer development. That claim-temporar y expediency-is the only valid reason for their introduction. That was quoted when we discussed the gauge of the east-west railway in 1911. The report is of the first meeting held by the engineers of the three states-South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. On the motion of the New South Wales delegate, it was agreed that the gauge for Australia should be 5 f t . 3 in . Immediately after the conference, Victoria set out to construct a line of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. the same. There was, however, in New South Wales a change of engineers, and with it a change of policy and of gauge. That is the reason for the present lack of uniformity. Queensland established a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and has carried out considerable development with railways on that gauge. For the most part, the Westtern Australian railways are of the same gauge as those of Queensland. It is of no use for us now to cry over spilt milk, but that change of policy on the part of New South Wales caused the great trouble I do not intend to of the gauges from which Australia is suffering to-day. Nor does it help us now to say that either gauge is better than the other. The 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge was decided upon because that was the gauge of the first locomotive made by George Stephenson. B r it a in adopted the gauge of Stephenson, and as Americai n the firstBritain, her gauge also became 4 f t . 8Jin. The railways of Ireland are of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, while the main lines of India have a gauge of 5 f t . 6 in . Mr Harriman, one of the greatest of American engineers, said that if he had his way the gauge would be 6 feet. The amendment by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham) is a desirable one. In New South Wales, Victoria, and other states, the various Railways Standing Committees, after taking evidence and in specting alternative routes, have frequently recommended the construction of railways along routes entirely different from those in the proposals referred to them. Numbers of proposals for developmental and strategic railways have been made from time to time. I have here the report on a proposed strategic railway made in August, 1915, by MrA . Combes, nn engineer of repute, who was engaged by the then Ministerf o r Home Affairs totry to devise a scheme whereby railways could be constructed that would be of both a strategic and developmental nature. He had w i th h i m plans showing the railways of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland. In the first paragraph of his report he saidAn alternative scheme to that recently investigated by the writer for connecting the east-west railway with the New South Wales system and Brisbane, has been proposed or suggested by the New South Wales authorities.

In the Melbourne Argus of the l l t h May, 1915, it is stated:-""The New South Wales Ministry, whicli was responsible for the latter jjroposal, showed that only 194 miles of construction would be necessary, apart from what the states were committed to, and leaving out the loop to Melbourne; while Mr Fisher's proposal involved the building of 1,020 miles of new lines."" Parkes is a railway junction with line3 running north, south, east, and west, connecting with other railways.

I should like to know of what use this proposed short line of railway from Grafton to South Brisbane would be in the defence of Australia. It it quite true, as the Prime Minister has said, that it is only a commencement of the general scheme of unification. This line, if constructed, would certainly serve one of the most productive parts of Australia. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), whose opinion as Chairman of the Public Works Committee, is of great value, r j ^ t e d out that we have little or no information regarding this big project, upon which it is proposed to expend £3,500,000.

I thought that the Prime Minister would have shown sympathy for the honourable member for Swan( Mr a sane view of Australian projects. A l Gregory), who asked for the adjournment of the debate a little while ago,and I am quite sure that, but for tbe lateness of the hour, that honourable member would have had a great deal more to say in opposition to the proposal. ample evidence of political engineering in connection with this bill, but up to the present we have had no evidence of engineering knowledge having been availed of by the Government in the presentation of the scheme. I dislike adopting tactics to delay public business. If this bill were urgent, and if the Government perly, stating exactly how it expected to obtain the necessary money, the probabilities are that the House would have voted the money quite readily. But whilst I am a member of this HouseI shall insist upon my right to obtain information. On more than one occasion this insistence has placed me in the black (books of my own party. Even when the ILabour Government had a majority, both ""here and in another place, I was "" game"" -enoughI say this without boasting-to keep our own Government up all night in opposition to some of its own proposals. If necessary I shall do the same again. In matters that aro essential members of the Labour party are united, but in regard to non-essentials we have complete freedom for the expression of individual opinions. This bill, as a non-party measure, should be discussed from the Australian point of view. I have nothing to say against New South Wales or Queensland. I have spent many pleasant hours in both states, and I deny any suggestion of parqchialism in my attitude towards this proposal; but I insist on the fullest information being furnished to this House before I vote for the bill. References have been made to what some honourable members term the narrowness of the Victorian view in regard to Australian affairs. What would have been the position to-day of the Riverina country in New South Wales but for the developmental schemes of the Victorian Government? And what would have been the position of North Queensland, and of the Western Australian gold-fields but for enterprising Victorians who blazed the trail ? This state, though small in area compared with the other mainland ' states, is more thoroughly developed, and its people are prepared at all times to take ready the people of the Commonwealth have a huge interest bill to meet. This proposal will add another £250,000 to the load. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech,stated that the first real There is discussion on the unification of railway gauges took place in 1921. The right honourable gentleman is very much behind the times Every one knows that the construction of the east-west railway on the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge really fixed the standard .gauge for Australia. The' honourable member for Lang will bear me out in this statement. He must remember the dishad presented it procussion that took place on the measure providing for that line. I again urge the Government to allow this proposal to be inquired into by the Public Works Committee, a body representative of all parties in both branches of the legislature. It is a very competent committee, well equipped to conduct an inquiry, and make a recommendation to this House. Valuable evidence could be obtained from the engineers-in-chief of the New South Wales and Queensland railways, and members of the committee themselves could traverse the route. I agree with the honourable member for Swan in his criticism of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Macquarie that the engineering difficulties could be ascertained by a superficial examination of the route. The honourable member for Macquarie said that an engineer only needed to walk over portion of the country to decide what the line would cost. If he had to pay for the line out of his own pocket he would not be satisfied with that kind of estimate, but would require a careful scrutiny to be made of every detail. The Government should try to be as business like as a private firm. An agreement was reached to construct the north-south railway line, and was ratified'by Act of Parliament. Notwithstanding that, the Government directed the Publio Works Committee to inquire into the cost of",66,Earlepage I T W I L L Be One Of Instance Obtained Her Locomotives F R O M
226,Mr Brennan,In any case are we to,67,Earlepage I T W I L L Be One Of Instance Obtained Her Locomotives F R O M
227,Mr Fenton,"It would appear thatconstruction of that railway. Tho committee' made inquiries' both : t thesouth and at the north end. If it was essentialin' that case that the committee should hold an inquiry, how much more essential is inquiry in this instance? We should be informed -whether the railway -will follow the route of the 3-ft. 6-in. line. Some of the excavations and tunnel]ings of the existing line should be serviceable for the new line. Information should be supplied on that matter before honourable members, are asked to vote on the bill. Eighteen months or two years ago an agreement was made between New South Wales and Victoria to construct Victorian railways, on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, into the Riverina. That agreement was evidence of the breaking down of the parochial spirit that formerly existed between those two states. Victorians always said that they had no feoling against their New South Wales brothers, but there .always seemed to be jealousy on the part of the people of New South Wales. There was a time when the capital of Victoria was the biggest city in Australia, and so long as that condition continued, Sydney was jealous. Tho credit for developing the Riverinabelongs to Victoria, and the sentiment of the people in the Riverina is Victorian. The natural port for that part of Australia is Melbourne. The state authorities, at any rate, are of opinion that for many years to come the railway gauge in Victoria will be 5 f t . 3 in., and in New South Wales4 f t . 8J in. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Biley) displayed his broadmindedness by saying that he was in favour of almost immediately unifying the gauge between Sydney and Melbourne. What good would a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge railway between Albury and Melbourne be to Victoria, with 5-ft. 3-in. lines running into it? An ex-member of the present Government has had a lot to do with certain railway proposals that are in the air. The line from Hay to Port Augusta will almost touch his electorate. Reference to the map of New South Wales and South Australia shows that one can travel in a westerly direction to Trida, whioh is the nearest station to BrokenH ill , on the 4-ft. 8$-i'n. gauge. From there to Broken Hill, and from Broken Hill toPort Augusta, seems to me to be covered There are mountains, creeks, and rivers all along the proposed route from Hay to Port Augusta. That will necessitate the construction of bridges and culverts. country. Thursday, 2nd October. ter, however, will agree that good country and bad roads generally go together. In good country the greatest difficulty iB experienced inroad and railway construction. The line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie did not present much difficulty. It was a straight run, and an ordinarily good ganger could have constructed it without instruction or supervision. Appearances point to the fact that the Prime Minister intends to give us some information with regard to the proposal. That would not have heen obtained but for the vigorous onslaught of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). His contentions, arc absolutely unanswerable. He made about half a dozen, points that fairly riddled the measure. Although the Prime Minister has summoned to his aid the engineer for Commonwealth railways, and has in hia possesskm information that' has been given lo him by officers who ought to know the facts in relation' to this matter, he cannot at this stage supply the House with the information' that could be obtained if an inquiry were held by the Publie Works Committee. That committee selects its witnesses very wisely. The engineering chiefs in New South Wales and Queensland, and the men who made the preliminary survey, will be able to furnish first-hand information. The committee, I take it, would go over the route in company with officers who would be in a position to advise it at every stage of the journey. Most valuable data nnuld be collected. The practice of that committee is different from the practice observed by the. Public Accounts Committee. The latter hears practically the whole of its evidence in camera, and all that it submits to Parliament is a report based upon that evidence. Honourable members not only have the benefit of a well-considered report by the Public a shorter distance than is Works Committee, but they can also perby the other proposal. use the evidence that has been given before it..

I have sat at the feet of this financial Gamaliel, and from him I have learned many thingsjhat have been valuable to me.; but, by his interjections, I am led to think' that after all he is not the great financial expert that he claims to be. I could never absolutely lose confidence in the honourable member, but I must, confess that he has shaken my confidence a little by his rash statement that a proposal to expend .£3,500,000 needs no inquiry. Clause4 of the bill, whioh gives thejiower to borrow, is a very vital one. When thc Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) sat in the corner opposite as a private member, he was continually endeavouring to switch on the light to see thc way in which public funds wcro being expended. I do not know whether his filament lamp now refuses bo function, cr whether he has burst thc globe; but he no longer engages in that unpleasant occupation, and it devolves upon others to switch the light on the actions, not of those whom he formerly condemned, but of himself Clause4 provides'Che Treasurer may, from time to time, under the provisions of thc Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1018, or under the provisions of any aut authorizing the issue of treasury bills, borrow moneys not exceeding in the whole support the' measure because I detlie sum of £3,500,000, together with such fursire to see the scheme for the unither sum as is necessary to meet discount and the expenses of borrowing.

I regret that the representatives of Western Australia are not in agreement on the measure. It has been said that no proper agreement has been drawn up, but I am inclined to think in any case that those honourable members who have spoken against the bill would have taken up the same attitude if the agreement they seem to require had been provided. I fication of the railway gauges of Australia put into'effect. A lot of comment has been offered on the delay in transferring, the Seat of Government to Canberra. I contend that it is far more important far this Parliament to do away with the. objectionable breaks of gauge in new capital.

Because of that, I supported the proposal fo.r the establishment of the Pederal Capital at Canberra. undertaking every item of work was investigated, and thus a guide was afforded to honourable members. appear that in connection with this proposal influences are at work of which we have no definite knowledge, hut it may be that they will yet he revealed.

From unofficial information which has been received, I understand that thc construction of this new line would not assist in placing more than 2,000 persons on the land. to New South Wales only. rect, it is a serious condemnation of the Government that has brought forward this proposal. It is evident that there is a conflict of opinion regarding this matter. That being so, I feel that the Government has not acted fairly towards honorahle members in withholding from them information with which they should be supplied concerning thiB proposal. If the line from Alice Springs were constructed it would tap some of the richest Proposals for other pastoral country in Austraha. Tho benefit to be derived from the developmentof the mineral resources of the Northern Territory would justify the construction of the north-south line, and it should certainly take preference of the proposal before the House, which is to serve private more than public interests.

251,Mr Bruce (Flindersr,"Prime Minissions since .this Government came into office I have frankly declared that the Government recognizes its obligation to build the north-south line. During the last few weeks negotiations have been proceeding with the Government of South Australia with a view to taking definite action, and I anticipate making an announcement within the next few days respecting the policy of the Commonwealth Government. The building of the north-south railway does not come into the discussion at a l l . The bill concerns the unification of gauges, and I suggest to honourable members that they should not be influenced by the introduction of other matters into this debate. There is an interesting history attached to the proposed line from Kyogle to South Brisbane. Its construction was approved by the people in every one of the states. But confusion of thought regarding the attito-day the people of Victoria are totally opposed to the railway, and arguments have been adduced to show that it would be a mistake to build it , that it is unnecessary, and would be useless when completed. the press of Victoria contended that the building of this line was imperative, and that the Victorian Premier and his M in isters were lacking in statesmanship in not consenting to its construction. The same attitude was apparent in the other states. A change of opinion has arisen. A t a conference last year between the Commonwealth and the states, it was found impossible to proceed with the general unification scheme laid' down by the royal commission that inquired into this project. An alternative scheme was submitted to the conference providing for the immediate const-ruction of a line from Port Augusta to Hay. The construction of railways from Brisbane to Kyogle, from Hay to Port Augusta, and from Kalgoorlie to Perth would have provided a transcontinental line from east to west, and would have been the first step towards the unification of the gauges, without in emphasize to the House that there was terfering in any way with the general scheme laid down by the royal commission for the unification of the whole of the lines. The proposal to build aline from Port Augustat o Hay was considered by the conference, but it was not possible to arrive at unanimity regarding it . The Oommonwealth Government, not having been able to secure the concurrence of the states, did not proceed with its suggestion to build that line; it concentrated upon -the proposals embodied in the royal commission's report, and now advocates, as a first instalment of the general unification scheme, the construction of a line' from Grafton to Brisbane -That project is in no way related to the Hay to Port Augusta line.. The people of Victoria and South Australia have a contrary impression, which they ore allowing to blind their judgment as to the merits of this line. The Hay to Port Augusta line can be built only if the Commonwealth Government again brings it forward as a work to be'undertaken, and at the present time there is no indication of that. The royal commission recommended two alternative schemes, one involving a cost of £21,600,000, and the other a cost of£57,200,000. There seems to be gome tude of the states towards that report. The states adopted the commission's recommendation, that the standard gauge should be 4 f t . 8J in . The Commonwealth Governmenb desired that they Yeti t is not two years since should adopt the rest of the report and proceed to carry it into effect. No finality was reached in thei form of a signed document, but there was not at the conference any. shadow of difference of opinion between the Commonwealth and the states, or between the Commonwealth and any individual stp-te, as to the adoption and carrying out of the commission's recommendations.' The only difference of opinion was as to when effect should' be given to it . The Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia desired to proceed immediately with the first steps necessary to give effect to the £21,600,000 scheme. The States of Victoria and South Australia said that the time was not ripe for undertaking such a work. They referred to the high cost of labour and material, and raised many other objections; but I wish to unanimity regarding the adoption of tbe scheme and its ultimate completion. Similarly, in regard to the proposal to build a railway from Grafton to South Brisbane, every state, through its representatives, approved of the construction of the line. Upon that point also the only difference was as to the 'date on which the work should be undertaken. That was the state of affairs after the conference in November, 1921, and in January, 1922. A t the 1923 conference a different, situation arose. Not having found it possible to press on with the general scheme, the Commonwealth .Government suggested, as an alternative, the construction of a line from Hay to Port Augusta. That was not accepted by the conference, and we fell back on our . original proposal. Deemingi t imperative that a commencement with the unification of gauges should be made, the Commonwealth representatives sought to get approval of the construction of the first section from Grafton to South Brisbane. There were two reasons why that section of the general unification scheme was chosen as the first to be undertaken, namely, (1) that it was given priority in the recommendation of the. royal commission, and (2) that it would open up new country, would offer a prospect oi earning within a reasonable time interest on the capital invested, and was preferable to the mere.eonversion of an existing line to the standard gauge, thereby adding to the capital charges to be biwrae by that line; The Commonwealth entered' into negotiations with the two states that were willing to proceed with this first section of thei unification scheme, and the result is the agreement now before the House. Honourable members, should understand that the representatives' of Western Australia were desirous that the scheme should be proceeded with at 1 onee. in November, 1921, January, 1922, or 1923, did they 'express any opposition to ib; on the contrary, they were as enthusiastically in favour of it as were the representatives of any other state. Some honourable members have suggested that the proposal now before the House is not properly part of a unification scheme. They admitted' that the royal commission had mentioned it ; bub, in order bo dissociate ib from bhe general scheme, they suggested that this recommendation was not part of the commission's legitimate functions. Indeed, the honourable member for' Kooyong went so far as to analyze the meaning of the word ""unification,"" and endeavoured to convince the House that the term could not be held to include a new line. right; hut having regard to the report of the royal commission, he was not. have' been right.,, although I found his reasoning difficult tofollow; hut it is perfectly obvious that practically he was hopelessly wrong. The royal commission has always been known as the Unification of Railway Gauges Royal Commission. Possibly that was a misnomer-althoug h I do not think it was-bu t amongst the dutiesdelegated to the commission in the terms of reference were:(3) To ascertain.which would be the estimated cost of unifying the gauges of main trunk lines' and all lines, including and showing separately-(a ) alterations of existing railways and structures; and .(b) any new lines that are necessary. Quite distinctly, new lines were included in the terms of reference. The commission, in its report, did refer to the new lines that were necessary, and, amongst them was that from Kyogle to: South Brisbane. The estimated cost of £2.1,600,000 represented-alteration s to existing railways and structures, £9,012,000; any new lines necessary, £6,873,000; adjustments, to rolling-stock, £5,715,000. Having regard to these facts, I suggest to the House that there is nothing in the contention of the honourable member for Kooyong that the Grafton' toSouth Brisbane railway, being a new line, was outside the scope of the royal commission, and cannot form part of a general unification scheme. It is, I think, clear that the recommendation, of the royal commission with regard -At none of the conferences to new lines wasproperly made, because' the-, express terms ef reference show that the indication of new limes waa necessary for a proper unification, scheme.. The next' point upon which the scheme has been challenged! is thab: a wrong principle has been introduced: by tbe Commonwealth in undertaking to. bear more than one-fifth of the proposed expenditure. Ib has been-urged that the. Commonwealth should nothavo undertaken responsibility for the expenditure of the states thab did nob join in with thei proposal. That point, I think,' has been wrongly baken. I am perfectly certain, and I bhink ewery other honorahle gentleman in this House is also certain, that eventually all the states will come into the unification scheme. There are. two reasons why bhis was the proper way to deal' with the proposal. In the first place, unless the. Governmenb had takenup this attitude, it would have been-, impossible' to proceed with any scheme for the unifies-",71,Earlepage I T W I L L Be One Of Instance Obtained Her Locomotives F R O M

It has also been which, at present, are not parties to the suggested that what the Government has proposal.

262,Mr Fosteb,"But we are carrying notposal to refer the scheme to the' Public Works Committee of this Parliament is not a reasonable way of dealing with a problem of this sort. The Commonwealth is entering into an arrangement with two of the states to carry out a certain work, and wo should make provision for the creation of a body or council on which the Commonwealth and the states would have adequate representation. The agreement provides for this, and I think it is a reasonable arrangement which should work quite satisfactorily in exactly the same way as the control of the Murray River works is operating at the present time. It has beeu suggested that the States of New South Wales and Queensland will benefit very substantially under this agreement, and it is urged that they should he bound in the agi'eement to cooperate with the other states in further works that may be carried out. Queensland and New South Wales are the two Btates that have shown their good faith in this matter, and have proclaimed .that they are prepared to co-operate in providing a uniform railway gauge for the whole of Australia. The fear has been expressed that they will participate in the construction of the railway proposed in the bill, and, having taken all they can get, will have nothing to do with further unification proposals. It has been said that this railway is the only unification work that will need to be done in New South Wales, and that New South Wales will not be heard of again in connection with unification. I remind honourable members that out of the total of £21,600,000 estimated by thc Uniform Gauge Commission as the cost of unifying the gauges, the quota to be borne by New South Wales was £7,094,000. The work to he done in that state is represented hy only £1,657,000, and yet at every conference on this Bubjeot, -New South Wales has 'been prepared to enter into an agreement with all the other states to unify the gauges. The obvious reason is that the New South Wales Government appreciates the fact that if the New South Wales gauge of 4 ft. 8$ in. is made uniform throughout Australia, that state, as well as the other states, will benefit. South Wales is that its 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge establishment of a uniform gauge, or lines run through such difficult country prompting the general interests of the. that conversion to a different gauge would be very costly. 4 f t . 8-J in. was decided upon on the recommendation of the Uniform Gauge Commission, and all .the states agreed to it. when the east-west railway was made to the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge. the expenditure on future works will have to he determined when all the .states can be brought into line. Now that the Commonwealth and two states have shown' that they are in earnest, I hope it will be possible to get all the states to come into line. If that is not possible we shall have to continue in the piece-meal way is whioh we have started. The recommendations of the commission include lines from Port Augusta to Adelaide and from Kalgoorlie to Perth. The Commonwealth Government indicated , to the states last year that in its opinion those two lines must be proceeded with. An endeavour will be made to reach an agreement to proceed with those lines, and, with that object in view, the Government is prepared to discuss the matter with representatives of the Btates. If it cannot make an agreement with all the states, it will proceed in conjunction with any of the states that are agreeable to co-operate. lia ready to agree now? Australia not come in? report of the conference held in May of last year will see that Western Australia was very anxious to come into the agreement, but hesitated on the brink. I have no doubt that that state will join with the Commonwealth and the other states, in due season. I want to make it. quite clear that the Government regards the establishment of a uniform gauge as of paramount importance to Australia.

I think that the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham) might be accepted, for the reason that it must be recognized that this bill grants to New South Wales and Queensland something that the other states hold only in anticipation. It would be an assurance to the other states that New South Wales and Queensland, It .rests with although they are now to receive the benefit of the first part of the unification scheme, will honorably stand by their compact when the time comes for similar works to be conducted in the other states.

I hope the committee will take a reasonable view of this scheme; but most of the honourable members representing South Australia and Victoria are doing everything in their power to prevent effect being given to it . -This is a question of ordinary business. There is no agreement amongst the states in regard to the practical part of the scheme, viz., the carrying out of the unification of gauges. I admit that the proposal before the committee is not a bad commencement, but honourable members owe a responsibility to all the states and the people of the Commonwealth, and have no right to pass the bill without ensuring by a solemn agreement that the states which will derive the first benefits to be derived from the unification policy will accept their share of the liability for the scheme recommended by the royal commission. Why. should they not agree to do that? ever been asked for previously? ask the Prime Minister to deny the correctness of the contention of the honourable member for Kooyong that New South Wales and Queensland might comply with their portion of this agreement, and be free of any legal obligation to make their pro rata contribution to the cost of the completed scheme. those states will give the necessary assurance now. ment asks is that those states shall enter into such a binding agreement, and if that is not done the whole scheme of unification will be jeopardized. a.m.]-This agreement has been approved by the Queensland Parliament, and the amendment is, in effect, a proposal to remit the question back to that Parliament. honourable member for Parkes spoke of a compact. Can the honourable member receive the support of produce any evidence of it in black and white ? The honourable member knows that there is no such agreement. Can South Australian representatives be blamed for demanding that these conditions be stated in black and white, knowing as they do that the Commonwealth has repeatedly consulted legal authorities with a view to evading the agreement made with South Australia in regard to the construction of the north-south line? Having that knowledge, we ask that nothing in connection with the unification of gauges be left to chance. If New South Wales and Queensland are to have the first plums of the scheme, they should give au undertaking that they will assist the other states to get their share in turn. I cannot understand why the Prime Minister will not accept the amendment. statement of the honourable member for Richmond, if allowed to pass unchallenged, may leave the impression that what is now being sought by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) has been already approved by the Queensland Parliament. said that the agreement has been ratified by the Queensland Parliament. with the amendment before the committee ? It is absurd to argue that, because Queensland has not already given an undertaking, we should not ask for one. I hope that the Prime Minister will either accept the amendment or postpone further consideration of the bill. The representatives of Queensland and New South Wales are taking advantage of their representatives of superiority in numbers in order to get the bill passed. If they are as strong in their sense of honour and fair dealing as they prtifess to be, and believe that the undertaking which we are seeking will be granted, why do they refuse to accept an amendment to have the undertaking stated in black and white ?

The fact, as stated by the. honourable member for Boothby, that such an outcry is being made about this matter is ample warrant for the request. The work cannot be undertaken at once. The Government must make the necessary arrangements to raise the money. Surely there is ample time within which to consult the Parliaments of the states concerned and get their consent to the agreement. I have no wish to ' ' stone-wall"" the measure, but we must take this opportunity to impress on the Government, and on those members who are supporting the bill, to be careful how they use their strength in this Parliament. There has been nothing said to suggest that ""Western Australia is unwilling to take its part in the general unification scheme. It has been stated that this proposal is a commencement.
