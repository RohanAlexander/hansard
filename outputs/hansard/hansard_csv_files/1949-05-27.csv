As the honourable member for Eawkner is doubtless aware, the Australian Parliament has ratified the agreement subject to it also being ratified by the governments of the United Kingdom and the TJnited States of America. Neither of those governments has yet ratified it, but information that I have received from the United States of America indicates that a proposal for ratification will shortly be placed before the United States Congress. Until the agreement is ratified hy the United Kingdom and the United States of America, I am afraid that there is not any useful information that I can give the honourable member. Commerce and Agriculture say whether a quantity of frozen crayfish tails, which had been processed at Geraldton, Western Australia, was condemned by the Gommonwealth health inspector, Mr arranging for inspections to he undertaken Dow? Were the condemned crayfish subsequently despatched to the United States of America, on the advice of the fisheries inspector in Perth, on Pioneer Glen, which recently unloaded its cargo in New York? I i the answers to those questions are in the affirmative, will the Minister explain why the export permit was issued? Is it a fact that a shipper subsequently sent overseas a quantity of frozen crayfish tails that had not been inspected by the Department of Health? adequately to the questions that have been asked by the honourable gentleman, it is necessary for me to explain that in regard to some commodities, particularly meat intended for export, the Australian Government maintains its own expert inspectorial staff. In regard to other commodities, in order to minimize expense, use is made of the inspectorial sershall make vices that are maintained by State governments. That practice has been followed in Western Australia in connection with The Interthe inspection of crayfish tails. The Government of Western Australia has made available to the Commownealth for inspection purposes State health officers and fisheries officers. With regard to the incidents to which the honourable gentleman has referred, Inspector Dow is, a State government officer in the sense that he is employed by the. State Government, but he has been seconded to the Commonwealth for inspectional duties. He condemned a consignment of crayfish that was destined for the United Statea of America. The owner of the crayfish appealed to Inspector Dow's senior officer, an officer of the Western Australia Fisheries Department. That officer, also acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, allowed the appeal and permitted the crayfish tails to be exported. The export of crayfish tails to the United States of America is a valuable source of dollar earnings. The Australian Government is, therefore, anxious that the tails should arrive in the United States of America in first-class condition. For some time we have been conscious of the fact that there is no public servant in Australia who is really well versed in this kind of inspectional work. The Government is now under the supervision of the Commonwealth Chief Veterinary Officer and hi9 staff, assisted by personnel who are experienced in the freezing and conditioning of products of this type. The necessary regulations are now in draft form. It is hoped that by adopting this procedure complaints of the kind that have been made by the honourable member for Wannon will be eliminated. The majority of the complaints that have been received regarding these inspectional services are concerned with the severity and not the laxity of the inspections. The Government considers it desirable that only the best tails should go to the United Staf JS of America.",10,Internationa L Trade Organization

The quotas to the various States were fixed according to the quantities used during a base year before the war. It was not considered that a distribution on a population basis would be the correct method because a State like New South Wales, in which there are many large pastoral properties to be fenced, needs more wire netting than is needed in a more closely settled State like Victoria. I think I have answered the honourable member's question fully, but if he wants any further mformation I shall try to supply it. ter wihether the Government recently issued a licence to the Government of New South Wales to import railway steel from Japan? If so, is the right honourable gentleman aware that the United Kingdom is experiencing great difficulty in balancing its budget and is seeking all the export trade that it can procure? Is he not aware that the steel industry in Great Britain is now producing at its peak ? There are too many "" awares"" in the honourable member's question which should be put in a different form. Minister seems to have forgotten these things. The honourable member must conform to the Standing Orders when asking a question. bound since 1928 to extend trade preference to Great Britain, why did the Prime Minister approve of the importation of steel from Japan, because Australian production is insufficient to meet our own requirements, instead of seeing that the Government of New South Wales, like that of Victoria, purchased its steel requirements from Great Britain? honourable member that there is no aspect of the importation of steel or the possibilities of obtaining it on which I am not fully informed. With the Minister for Trade and Customs, wno issues import licences, I , personally, approved the importation of steel rods from Japan for the purpose of making dog spikes for the New South Wales railways. Supplier of steel that can be made available by Great Britain at present have been surveyed item by item. When I was recently ""in the United KingdomI arranged for an officer of my department io confer with representatives of the British Board of Trade in order to ascertain the maximum quantity of steel of all kinds heing produced in that oountry that could be made available to Australia. I think that the maximum quantity that could be made available to us last year was, approximately, 3,000 tons. The British Board of I ask the Prime MinisTrade was exporting steel to Scandinavian and other countries under trade agreements which enabled Great Britain to obtain essential supplies of othej materials. After a detailed survey of the kind I have indicated had been made by the British Board of Trade in conjunction with. British steel manufacturers, we were informed that an increased quantity wonld be made available to us this year. We can take all the steel that the United Kingdom can supply to us, but on the figures submitted to us recently Great Britain can supply only 5,000 tons in addition to the 3,000 tons which we received from that country last year. The British authorities hope that they may be able to increase the supply still further, but they cannot give any guarantee that the increase will exceed 5,000 tons. I also arranged for a survey to be made of the availability of structural steel and steel rails in France. Indeed, a complete survey of the steel position has been made in all western European countries with the exception of Belgium. Belgium was omitted from the survey solely because it is a hard currency country, for the products of which payments have to be made in gold. Because there is a shortage of hard currency, it is not possible to obtain from Belgium what we would like to get from that, country. We have a very favorable trade balance with Belgium, but. unfortunately, the United Kingdom is not in that position.

Under that scheme, large numbers of students are at present receiving living allowances and other assistance from the Australian Government. The scheme was inaugurated during the war under the defence powers of the Commonwealth and I understand that it will conclude ahout the end of 1051.

53,Mr Gullett (Henty) [11.10],"I purposes that they have in view. Forhave increased from £246,000,000 to £690,000,000, thefiguresdo not mean that the average savings account has increased proportionately. Obviously the number of depositors has increased very much in recent years. More people are in employment, and the population has grown. In. fact, if we consult the statistics we find that the average savings account in 1939 was £60, whereas to-day it is £105. In other words, the average account has heen increased by 70 per cent., not by 150 per cent., which is the proportion of the increase of total savings. Let us consider what this 70 per cent, increase is really worth to the investor. As an example, I refer to the increase of the cost of a house that has occurred over the last ten years. In 1939, as we can see by opening any oue of the daily newspapers of that year, one could buy a timbered house in any of the great cities, complete with plumbing and other services and including land and fences, for between £500 and £650. I hope that no one will challenge that, because I have a long list of newspaper cuttings from issues of the Sydney Morning Herald ten years ago that will substantiate my statement. But only a few days ago, honourable members were informed that houses, similar in design but inferior in quality and exclusive of land and fences, were heing erected not far from here at a cost of £1,750 each. In other words, the cost of home-building has increased by approximately 200 per cent., and the people's savings have increased by only 70 per cent. Therefore, it is clear that the average holder of a savings bank account is further away from owning his home in this Government's ""golden age"" than he was ten years ago. As with housing, the price of every item in daily use has substantially increased. In 1939, a man could huy a very good suit for £8, but to-day, a similar suit costs ahout £25. (Some honourable members opposite appear to disagree with, that statement. Will they deny that the cost of a suit has risen as I have indicated ? Yesterday, the honorahle memher for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) referred to the greatly increased cost of shoes. Before the war, we could purchase shoes for 10s., 12s. 6d. and 15s. a pair. To-day, however, similar shoes cost between 25s. Mr Gullett. and 35s. a pair. In other words, the cost of footwear has increased by approximately 200 per cent, during the last ten years, but the people's savings have increased by only 70 per cent. Let us now consider the cost of food, particularly vegetables. I claim to have some knowledge of this subject, because it was my duty to report the prices of vegetables for about two years for the Melbourne Herald. In those days, the housewife could huy peas and beans for 2d. or 3d. per lb. To-day, she pays two or three times as much for those vegetables. into the honorahle member's soul? not a laughing matter. The honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) knows something about this subject, because he has told us a pathetic story about his experiences when he has shopped with a little string bag. I expect to have his sympathy in this matter. The high cost of the necessaries of life is most serious for the people who are struggling to pay their household bills. WhatI have said so far in this speech leads to the point that, despite the vaunted increase of national savings, the standard of living is lower than it was in 1939. People who are struggling to make ends meet derive no comfort from being told that the national savings are at a record high level. If the fact that they are at a record high level is related to the policy of this Government, as honorahle memhers opposite claim, then so is the fact that the value of the people's money is dwindling the responsibility of the Government. What are the causes o£ the decline in money values and the growing inflation that the Government is not checking? Indeed, there is every mdication that the present period of inflation will continue until a disastrous sudden reduction of prices causes an economic collapse. The inflation that we are now experiencing has two principal causes. The first, and more important in my opinion, is the load of taxation in this top-heavy economy to which the Labour Government is committed. The high taxes that the public have to pay are sapping the productive capacity of the country to an enormous degree. One of the greatest",17,Chiflet
54,Mr Beazley,Did the cabbages enter,18,Chiflet
55,Mr Gullett,"-The high prices arefactors in rising costs is the expense of this Government's socialist schemes. In other words, extravagant governmental expenditure is the cause of high taxes, and, aa I shall show, expenditure, so far from being reduced, is actually increasing. At present, the requirements of the Government absorb one-third of the total national income. That is one important reason why foodstuffs and goods are so dear. The other factor, and honourable members might as well face it, is that this Government has introduced a condition of affairs in which, unfortunately, two meu do what 19 normally the work of one man. ""While that situation continues, prices cannot be reduced. I shall now deal with the amount, of money, equal to one-third of the national income, which the Government has diverted from productive purposes. I refer to the matter because an examination of the Commonwealth Statistician's figures discloses that 30 per cent, of our national income is absorbed in governmental expenditure. Since 1942-43, Commonwealth revenue and expenditure have increased hy 72 per cent. We hear a good deal of talk at the present time ahout reduction of taxes. If any honourable member opposite honestly believes that there has been a reduction of taxation, let him answer a simple question. Is the total amount that the Government expends from year to year increasing or decreasing? We all know perfectly well that taxation is increasing and will continue to increase. Why? Is the Government spending more, or less, money? increased to meet increased governmental expenditure? government expenditure has increased and will continue to increase, and that taxation must inevitably increase still further. I admit that certain reductions of direct taxation have been made, although we notice that there has been no falling off of the aggregate receipts from direct taxation. However, the reduction of what we might term "" indirect taxation "" has been negligible. The truth is that to-day the cost of government is heing defrayed in large part from the proceeds of indirect taxation, which must be borne hy every man, woman and child in the community from the cradle to the grave. Let us consider for a moment the procedure, in the daily life of an average member of the community. In the morning he gets out of bed and has a shave. He has had to pay sales tax on the shaving soap and the razor blade which he uses. Then he dresses for his day's work. He has had to pay sales tax on every item of apparel that he wears. He sits down to breakfast and eats, in all probability, a couple of eggs. He has had to pay more for those eggs as his contribution towards the additional charges involved in maintaining the Australian Egg Board, which exercises a monopoly over the distribution of eggs. Similarly, if he eats meat and certain other commodities he has had to pay something additional for the officious meddling of the various boards which control the marketing of foodstuffs. Perhaps he has a slice of toast. He has had to pay more for the bread from which the toast is made because of the action of the Labour Government which sold our wheat at cut prices to the socialist administrations of New Zealand and the TJnited Kingdom. The unfortunate local consumers have to pay more for' our flour in order to subsidize the wheat industry. If the man drives into town he pays tax on the petrol consumed by his vehicle. If he has a smoke on the way he had to pay through the nose for it because of the extremely, high duties imposed on tohacco. Theni f he has children and they go to school the books in their school-bags have all Does taxation have to he had to he purchased at additional cost because of sales tax. In short, whatever Every one knows that an individual does he finds that it entails the payment of a toll to the Chifley Government. One-third of the earnings of the entire community finds its way to the Government, which squanders it in a manner with which we are all only too familiar. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to speak of taxation in mere generalizations. I invite them to consider the effect of taxation on specific items such as those which I have mentioned. Let us consider also the effect of high taxation on the national housing problem. The cost of providing housing accommodation has increased enormously, and the enormous increase is due principally to two factors. The first is the tax levied on pay-rolls and on companies. Let no one imagine that those taxes are actually borne by the employers who cornpile the pay-rolls or by the companies which manufacture or sell goods. We all know very well that the price of goods and services is fixed by the vendors to provide for all incidental costs, including 40-hour week and those who advocate an taxes. In the long run the purchaser or consumer actually bears the burden of the tax because he has to pay increased prices. Every piece of roofing material, every tap, every board and even every brick that goes into the erection of a dwellingonly four hours' pay. If they are suffihouse is loaded with tax. The second factor in the excessive cost of house conthey receive 40 hours' pay. If we introstruction is the operation of the 40-hour week, the fact that a bricklayer will lay only 300 bricks a day, the application of dargs to output, and various other go-slow devices. How can the operation of such a policy have any other effect than to increase the cost of home construction? Surely it is the responsibility of the present Government, which regards itself as a "" workers' government"" and as representative of the people, to go to the trade unions and the workers of the country and tell them quite frankly that their policies have made it impossible for the average worker to earn sufficient money to purchase a home. So far from doing anything of the kind, honourable memhers opposite actively associate themselves with proposals to reduce working hours, and now one frequently hears from them proposals for reducing even the present abbreviated working week to 30 hours. We frequently see press photographs of honortimber, which had to he squared and able members opposite marching in processions on May Day and other occasions in support of trade union demands for a further reduction of working hours. I am not one who is hopelessly opposed to a 40-hour week. On the contrary, I contend that, if some of the assurances given to the Arbitration Court by the trade union representatives during the hearing of the last application for reduced working hours had been honoured, production need not have suffered as it has done. If the workers had been advised and encouraged by their trade union leaders and the Australian Labour party to work Mr Gullett. during those 40 hours, production need not have declined, and the introduction of the 40-hour week might have been a good thing. But no one can deny that the attitude adopted by the trade unions and their members since the 40-hour week was introduced has resulted in a sorry decline of production. I remind those who seek to defend the even shorter working week, that many of the working people in the countries which lie to the north of Australia wovk only four hours a day. The point of my reminder is that those people receive ciently fortunate to work 40 hours a week duce a 30-hour working week in Australia it is abundantly clear that the living standard of the people of this country, particularly of the workers themselves, will be reduced to little better than that of coolies. I suggest to honourable members opposite who persist in advocating a further reduction of working hours that they take a day off and visit a country area, as I frequently do to remind myself of the efficacy of honest of the majority work and what Australia owes to earlier generations of workers. Let them visit any part of Australia where land has been cleared and they will form some idea of the hard work which had to he done to produce the wealth that established this nation. In any cleared area one can see evidence of the millions of trees and stumps which had to be felled and grubbed. Tens of thousands of posthales had to be dug to erect the hundreds of miles of wire fences that we see. The posts themselves were hewn from felled holed. The immense areas of settled land throughout Australia could never have been cleared if there had been a 40-hour working week. Surely we must all realize that if we want to maintain the standards of living that have been established in this country we must strive to maintain a good standard of output. The continued functioning of the 40-hour working week demands an even more intensive effort to maintain proper production. I turn now to the remarks made hy the Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard), who stated that a record number of houses was being built throughout Australia. That may be so, but I remind the Minister that certain other housing records are also heing established. In the first place, there is a record number of people waiting for houses, and, in the next place, people are waiting, and will continue to wait, a record time for the construction of those houses. It is small comfort indeed to those people to he told that a record number of houses is being built, because they know that they have no hope of getting a house within a reasonable time, f am directing my remarks particularly to the housing situation, because that is undoubtedly the most important matter in Australia to-day. Ever since Labour has heen in office, its attitude towards the desperate housing shortage has heen characterized by smug inertia. Large numbers of migrants are heing brought to Australia, at considerable expense to the taxpayers. These migrants are good, had and indifferent, hut we are compelled, because of our internal economy, to bring them here. were built there might he more children horn in Australia. It has been truly said that the best migrant that we can have is an Australian child. Further, the immigration scheme itself is threatened hy the housing shortage. We have heard already whispers of attacks upon the scheme. Recently the Minister for External Territories ( Mr talk of the success of the Government's Ward) said that it would he impossible for us to continue to bring to Australia people from otber countries while many thousands of Australians are without houses. I do not agree with the Minister, but I never do. In my opinion, the honorahle gentleman's attack upon the immigration scheme was a despicable one. If there he a contemptible political action, it is that of a Minister who is only too pleased to retain his ministerial office until the last possible moment, hut who, in order to gain a little cheap publicity, criticizes a policy that is heing pursued by the government of which he is a memher. If the Minister for External Territories disagrees with the Government's migration policy, let him_ resign. If he did so, his action would certainly not tion? Honorahle memhers on this side be regretted by honourable members on this side of the House. It is a pity that more members of the Government are not drawn from the rising generation in this country. If they were, the Government might know a little more than it does know ahout the housing problem that confronts our young people. It is regrettable that more members of the Government are not closely in touch with Australian ex-servicemen. The Minister for Repatriation, who is supposed to have some knowledge of ex-servicemen's problems, has spoken of the Government's housing record. The other day a returned ex-serviceman, a splendid soldier whom I know very well, came to see me. Immediately following his discharge from the forces in 1945, he applied, as he was entitled to do, for a housing commission house or a war service home. He is in good employment. He has three children and another child is expected shortly. He is living with his wife and family in one room in a four-roomed house. Of the other three rooms, one is occupied by his brother-in-law, who is also a returned serviceman with a wife and three If more houses children, and another by the man's father and mother. A ll these people share the kitchen and a lean-to bathroom. That is a terrible state of affairs. If any members of the Australian community deserve well of their country, it is our ex-servicemen. Thousands' of them are living under appalling conditions, but honourable gentlemen opposite have the audacity to housing scheme. The Government is apparently unaware that its first responsibility to the returned servicemen of this country is to provide houses for them. Let the honourable memher for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) disagree with that statement if he likes to do so. Our ex-servicemen cannot get houses because the go-slow policy in the huilding industry ia tolerated hy this Government. memhers opposite do about it? quick to accept responsibility for everything in this country that is favorable to it. Why does it not accept responsibility for the unfavorable aspects of the situaof the Houae have told the Government",18,Chiflet

57,Mr Gullett,"The Government iawhat they -would do. It is well known that building is heing delayed by Communist-inspired strikes. The honourable memher for Wilmot shakes his head. It is well known that in Victoria the building trade unions are in the hands of the Communists, who attempt to keep Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees out of the building trades and prevent migrants from entering the industry. Memhers of the Opposition have indicated repeatedly what they would do to deal with the situation, but the Government has taken no notice of what they have said. Because of the go-slow policy in the huilding industry, Australian ex-servicemen will not get houses for years, and even if they could secure them, they would never he able to own them because huilding costs have increased so greatly owing to our extravagant national economy. There is no sign of the housingposition improving. Why does the Government not tackle the problem as it should he tackled ? A national director of housing should he appointed. That director should be a top-line executive with the experience of a man such as Mr Essington Lewis, a great servant of this country, who is accustomed, to handling masses of men and various industrial undertakings for the good of the country. Let the Government bring to Australia people who will work here as builders and ensure that when they arrive the huilding trade anions will accept them as members, which they will not do in many instances at the present time. House construction is being delayed hy the shortage of coal for hauling timber, for feeding furnaces in the iron and steel foundries and for other purposes. Let the Government bring to Australia migrants who are prepared to work in the coal mines and thus help to increase coal production. Let the Government ensure that the terms under which such migrants are brought here are such that they will be acceptable to Aussmug inertia and that there is a record tralian miners. The Government should attract migrants of that type and disconto-day. Let us look at this charge tinue bringing to Australia persons who, because they have plenty of money, are able, upon arrival, to obtain a house by paying a price that no Australian can afford to pay, thus forcing the price of -houses to a level that is beyond the Mr Gullett. reach of the average Australian. That is all that I have to say upon this subject. I hope that houorable members opposite do not now feel quite as satisned as they have felt with the state of our economy. appreciate the concern of the honourable memher for Henty( Mr Gullett) for the people of this country who have not yet managed to obtain a house, but I challenge the honourable gentleman to substantiate his charge that the whole blame for the present housing shortage lies upon the shoulders of the Government. If the Opposition parties had formed the Government of Australia during the last two years they would not have secured the construction of more houses for the people than have in fact heen constructed. The work would not have proceeded faster than it has done. AlthoughI sympathize with many of the sentiments that have been expressed hy the honourable member for Henty, I do not want the Australian people to believe that the only members of this Parliament who are concerned about the welfare of returned servicemen and the homeless people of Australia are honourable members opposite. That is far from the truth. Honorahle members ou the Government side of the House come from the rank and file of the Australian people. Many of us have families and many of us are returned servicemen. Nevertheless, it is said repeatedly in this chamber by honorahle members opposite that the only people who are concerned about the welfare of returned servicemen and the homeless people of Australia are themselves. Such statements are unfair and unjust. I deny that the Government is not concerned about the welfare of these unfortunate people. The honorahle member for Henty has said that the Government has exhibited a number of people waiting for houses of smug inertia. A few days ago the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) qroted figures to show that the average mnuber of homes built in Australia in the ten years up till 1940 was 27,000. Yet last year alone we built 49,000 homes in Australia. When",21,Chiflet
58,Mr Dtjthie (Wilmot) [11.37],"II say "" w e "" I refer to the Government, private enterprise and individual homebuilders. That is the answer to the charge of smug inertia. Any one who travels around the country to-<lay will see houses being huilt in towns' where formerly a new home had not heen huilt for as long as 50 years. I say that without fear of contradiction in regard to Tasmania, where my electorate covers an area of ahout 13,500 square miles, which is about half the area of that island. In my electorate homes are heing built in small towns where, I say, there has not been a new home built for many years. In some towns two or three homes are in course of construction at the same time. Let honourable members multiply that by all the little towns in all the country districts of Australia, and they will realize that we have a new order of new homes. Before the war the unfortunate people in country districts were all doing their best to congregate in the cities, at a much faster' rate than is the case to-day, because of the shockingly low prices that they were receiving for primary products. Because of their absolute poverty most of the people of Australia could not afford homes for themselves. It is all very well for the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) to tell us those heart breaking and sad stories that he has given the House to-day. I could talk for an hour ahout the heart breaking stories of 1939 and 1940, when people did not have the money to huy homes or, indeed, any hope of ever buying homes. In those days we had in this country bag towns, kerosene tin towns, communities of huts and sheds built almost entirely of kerosene tins flattened out, bags sewn together, and even hark. There were such towns on the Murray Eiver at SwanH ill and Shepparton, in Victoria, and in other parts of Australia. Those bag towns were populated by hundreds of people. Why were there not great, streaming head-lines ahout those conditions? No one seemed to he concerned about them. But the story is different to-day, in that a man now can order a home in the knowledge that he will he able to pay for it. He can approach a builder with some degree of confidence in his ability to pay for the home that he wants to have built. Before the war people had no hope of doing that, and because of the general poverty housing materials were piling up in' the timber yards of Australia, and saw-mills and brickyards were closed down in hundreds. Brickyards were closed down by Liberal governments, particularly in New South Wales. New brickyards are now opening up all over the country. Timber production has never heen higher in our history. In Tasmania, where we have stands of hardwood, Huon piue and blackwood, we have achieved marvellous timber production. There are saw-mills scattered throughout the timber areas where before the war there was nothing but the timber itself. We are doing our best to encourage the operators of those saw-mills to get machinery and saws. It is difficulty to obtain this equipment because so much of it is required all at once. To speak of the "" smug inertia"" of the Government is to give a complete misrepresentation of its interest in the problem of housing. There is another aspect of the matter. When the war broke out there was a housing lag of 250,000 houses in Australia, according to a survey then made During the war we had to stop homebuilding. While home-building was discontinued the demand for homes was still growing. Then we come to this remarkable factor. During the six years of the war there were 492,000 marriages in Australia. Most of those were of Australian returned men who married Australian girls. Most of these men, thank God, came back from their service overseas and there was created almost overnight, through their discharge from the forces, a demand for more than 400.000 homes in addition to the lag of 250,000 left over from before the war. Consideration of thesefigureswill give honorahle members, if they look at the matter fairly and rationally, some conception of the immensity of the task that confronted this Government and would have confronted any government that happened to be in office at the end of the war. The honorahle memher for Henty also said that it was a pity that some honourable members on the Government side did not belong to the rising generation. He said that we were not in touch with the rising generation, and that if ""we were we would appreciate the difficulties faced by the younger menibers of the community. What does he think that we on this side of the House are? Metliuselahs? There are as many young men on this side of the Eousc as on the other, and probably more on this side who have young children. Since the honourable member has levelled this unjust charge at us I shall speak of my own experience. I had to leave the Methodist ministry when I was endorsed as candidate for the seat that I now represent in this Parliament. I had to leave a home, with everything provided, and move with my wife and two children into two rooms, where we stayed for a period of three months. Then we had to move into one room for a period of seven months in 1946. Yet the honourable member had the audacity to suggest that none of us on this side of the House has had experience of housing difficulties. My family later had to move out of that room and live for three months in another house before we had a chance to buy a home for ourselves. The charges that tlie honourable inember has levelled are political propaganda. They are without any sense of proportion or fairness. He implied that we on this side of the House are not in touch with the rising generation. Of course we are! Many of us have played football and cricket, and we now attend sporting matches. We are interested in the rising generation and desire to help young people. We have them come to our offices seeking assistance, and they write to us. I can say quite frankly that all my colleagues on this side of the House are doing their utmost to help the rising generation with home problems. I shall give honourable members an illustration of that. Honourable members have probably heard of the Peter Lalor Home Building whose 1,100 members are ex-servicemen. The society is building a new suburb called Thomastown on the outskirts of Melbourne. I have heen assisting this society since it was first established, although I do not represent a Victorian electorate. But I happen to he interested in home-building and in the welfare of returned soldiers. The society asked me whether I could help it to obtain cement, from tlie factory at Railton, Tasmania, Sir. Duthie. that produces, thousands of tons of cement annually which goes to the southern States, and also to the guided weapons range. The society tried to obtain a bigger allocation of cement, but Mr Warner, the Liberal Minister for Housing in Victoria, who is himself interested financially in home-building, refused the application, although the members of the society are all ex-servicemen. They claim that their efforts to provide themselves with homes are being sabotaged by the Victorian Liberal Government. I took the matter up with the cement company in Tasmania; hut was told that it was not allowed to supply cement directly to groups in Victoria. Everything had to go through the State Housing Department there. Therefore, I could not help any further, and that is where the matter stands to-day. Yet, the honourable member for Henty complained of what he called this Government's "" smug inertia "" in the matter of housing. That was an unfair charge, utterly without basis, and it reflected little credit on the man who made it. The honourable memher for Henty said that high taxation was crippling industry and retarding production. We have been listening to that story for the last four years, despite the fact that direct taxation has been reduced by £160,000,000, and indirect taxation by £30,000,000. more per head now than ever before? ahle memher to name any country where taxes are not high to-day. All governmeuts have to find money for reconstruction, and money cannot be got out of thin air. Do honourable memhers opposite suggest that the Government should use Society, bank credit to finance its operations? The honorahle member for Henty asks the Government to increase pension payments by £15,000,000 a year, hut almost in the same breath he says that taxation should be reduced. He cannot have it both ways, and he ought to make up his mind what he does want. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), despite his remarkable knowledge of finance, is not Mandrake.

He is paying more in indirect The honourable member for Wimmera taxation now than he would have paid in tried to make out that a power could be all forms of taxation before the war. even indirect taxation has been reduced by £30,000,000. If taxes must be paid, I listened to him carefully. it is only right that those who receive the greatest incomes should contribute the sure that what I have said will be horne most. Yesterday, the honourable member out hy the official report of hi9 speech. for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) said that 1 have discussed this matter with men the Government had asked the people who claim to be lawyers. for permission to write into the Constitution authority for the Commonwealth to control prices, rents and charges. That was all right, but he then went on to say and some are Labour supporters, and they that, if the people had given their all agreed that it would not be possible, consent, the power would be permanently under the Constitution, to give the Comin the Constitution and would be more monwealth control over prices for a or less permanently exercised.

74,Mr Duthie,"Some are Liberalsover 1,600 new businesses have been opened since the cessation of hostilities. A similar change has occurred in the other States, but I know at first hand the conditions existing iu Tasmania. In that State new businesses have heen opened in many towns in shops which, in 1940, were absolutely abandoned, the structures having heen allowed to fall into disrepair, the counters and shelves being covered with dust. Since the war ended those premises have heen renovated and new businesses have heen set up in them. Yet, the honourable member for Wimmera has the audacity to say that no one is opening up new businesses or going on the land. That statement is completely untrue. It is refuted by the fact that'in most country towns throughout the Commonwealth and in the larger cities one would require a microscope to find one empty shop where, in 1940, rows of empty shops were to he seen. In Tasmania, applications are constantly heing made to set up new businesses and establish dairy-farms. The number of such applications, apart from the settlement of ex-service personnel on the land, is constantly increasing. In this country to-day the movement is hack to the land. That movement may not be as rapid as we should like, hut in 1940 the movement was in the opposite direction. During the depression years 20,000 primary producers walked off their farms, and, when the recent war broke out, those farms were still deserted because settlers had heen broken by the financial institutions. Now, the movement is hack to the land, and the Government has the responsibility of accelerating that trend, because it is in the interests of our ecoindustrial techique, particularly in mass nomy to arrest the drift of population to the cities. Without man-power control it is difficult for any government to States of America could slip into a depresarrest that drift. However, the Opposition parties would reimpose man-power control for totally different reasons. we would reimpose man-power control. parties constantly criticize the Government because sufficient workers are not available to meet the needs of certain industries. They ask how any government can carry out a programme of industrial development unless it directs man-power, and they really believe in their hearts that only by the exercise of such control can sufficient labour be made available to industries which to-day are seriously short of man-power. However, control over man-power has lapsed; it has been discarded. Yet, the Opposition parties contend that the Government must make sufficient labour available to industries which are in need of man-power. The fact, of course, is that under present conditions every worker can choose his own employment. Accordingly, many men prefer to be employed in industries where the conditions of labour are better and healther than are those in our heavier industries. That is not the fault of the Government. If the Opposition parties were in office they would attempt to reimpose man-power control in order to transfer workers from non-essential to essential industries. However, in the absence of such control, the Government cannot prevent workers from choosing their emiJoyment. leaping ahead in the United States of America where there is no man-power control ? country is not leaping ahead. During the war, normal civilian production was continued in the United States of America with the result that vast stocks of civilian goods were amassed. Those goods were put on the world markets after the cessation of hostilities. That is one reason why the United States of America to-day is able to export so much. In addition, its production, has outstripped that of any other country. Nevertheless, the United sion much more quickly than could any other country because much of its economy is not soundly based. To-day, there are nearly 4,000,000 workers unemployed in the United States of America and the Government of that country is gravely concerned about inflation. Therefore, I do not admit that the American economy is healthy. Nearly all of the savings of the great .mass of the American people have been eaten up in the purchase of goods at prices which have risen rapidly",25,Chiflet

I should much prefer to live in Australia than in the United States of America in spite of all the talk we hear ahout the great wealth of that great country and the soundness of its economy. The Opposition parties never cease to talk about socialism. They dream about it; they have it for breakfast, dinner and tea. When they are not speaking about socialism and nationalization they talk ahout communism, and they have harped on those subjects so much that the average citizen might well he suspected of looking for a Communist under the bed, or in the wardrobe, before he retires. In this respect the Opposition parties are merely indulging in political propaganda. Their catchcries remind one of Hitler's technique when he was in power in Germany. They do not define the terms they use when they talk in that strain, but simply attempt to mislead the people. They say, in effect, that this Government is trying to control everything, that it is implementing a socialistic plan. But what activities in this country does the Australian Government completely control? General's Department, aerodromes, a limited mileage of railways, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, research farms, highways giving access to aerodromes, the Navy, Army, AIT Force, defence establishments and munitions factories. I ask honorahle memhers opposite to name any other activity which is completely controlled and directed hy the Australian Government. shipping? Government does not completely control dustry. It can establish its own iron and shipping. I emphasize that the powers steel works, but it cannot nationalize the of the Commonwealth are limited under iron and steel industry.

Any Commonwealth Government which desires to exercise powers not conferred upon it under the Constitution can ohtain them only by reference of such powers to it hy the States or hy endorsement of its proposals by the people at a referendum. I shall show how wild and misleading is the Opposition's statement that the Government is attempting to control everything as part of the implementation of a socialistic plan. We have no power to legislate for the nationalization or socialization of activities other than those specifically stated in the Constitution. Banking and insurance are included in the matters in respect of which the Commonwealth may legislate. nationalize them. It controls the Postmastergives to the Commonwealth power to legislate in respect of banking, other than State banking. The honorahle memher for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) mayplace his own interpretation on those words. If it so desires, the Australian Government can establish its own hospitals, hut it cannot nationalize hospitals; it can appoint its own doctors hut it cannot nationalize medicine; it can establish its own airlines-indeed , it has already done so-hu t it cannot nationalize air services; it can establish its own shipnationalize shipping.

The gentleman whom I defeated at the last election is even now telling the people of Tasmania, as a Senate candidate, that we shall take over their motor cars, their businesses and farms, and everything else they possess. That is completely untrue. The people have the limiting provisions of the Constitution to protect them. Other favourite statements of Opposition members are "" Leave it to private enterprise "", and "" We must have free enterprise"". We agree with them provided that private enterprise does not merge into monopoly and monopoly does not merge into combines. We believe in communal control of certain things, that monopolies are bad and that combiues are worse. the banking monopoly and how that would work. experience of banking monopoly under the control of private enterprise'. When Mr E. G. Casey, the president of the Liberal party, visited Tasmania a few months ago, he is reported in the pressand I am sure the press would not misreport a Liberal speaker-to have saidFree enterprise had to be regelated in the interests of the people. It will be impossible, parties to which honourable members oppoIn these complicated days, to get back to completely free enterprise. What an amazing statement to be made by a Liberal spokesman when day after day we have to listen to Opposition members lauding private enterprise and condemning this Government for operating a railway or carrying on the activities of the Post Office! When honourable memhers on this side of the House say that private enterprise should he regulated-and I mean regulated and not abolished-in the interests of the people, we are immediately dubbed as "" Commos "", socialists and disrupters of the country. Yet, without comment hy honourable memhers opposite, Mr Casey is permittedto say to the people of Tasmania that free enterprise must be regulated in the interests of the people and that it will he impossible to get back to completely free enterprise. Notwithstanding those sentiments, Mr Casey, apparently, still remains a good Liberal. If stabilized prices represent socialism the farmers want more of it. If good roads mean socialism the people want more of it. If good medical and air services mean socialism, the people want more of it. If , by establishing our own shipping line, we can improve the shipping services on the coastline of Australia, so much the better. Yet these are the improvements that honourable members opposite call socialism. The municipal councils of Australia have their electricity plants and their tramways, their control of roads, parks and gardens and water supplies, which are in common daily use in cities and towns, and no criticism is made of the exercise of their powers in those fields, hut honourable members opposite criticize us if we endeavour to control any of these activities on a Commonwealth basis. They call such control socialism. Yet that is what the people want. What private enterprise could undertake such a huge project as a Snowy River waters scheme? Only governments are able to provide for future generations the power, water and other facilities that will be required to meet the growing needs of the country. All of this talk about socialism is loaded; it is pure political propaganda. Many members of the site belong have been responsible for the establishment of socialistic enterprise in this country. I instance the Premier of South Australia, Mr Playford. Yet bonorable memhers opposite dare to vilify us from the public platform for what we are doing, terming us socialists or Communists. Their vilification will not delude the people. member a socialist? of society in which the many are not exploited for the benefit of the few. The honourable member may call that ideal what he likes.

86,Mr Duthie,"I believe in an ordera Christian social order. The methods by which the Labour movement hopes to bring about a Christian social order may not coincide with those of honourable members opposite. The churches and the -Christian people of this country are fighting for a Christian social order. If we introduce legislation that will help to make that Christian social order a reality, we shall only do our duty as believers in such an order of society. Honovable members opposite may call such an order of society by any term they choose. I prefer to call what I am fightinsr for in the Labour movement a Christian social order. Finally, I propose to deal with the increase that has taken place in the volume of production of Australian products. Butter production has greatly increased within the last few months. The total production of butter for the five months ended the 30th November last amounted to 67,331 tons, compared with 64,130 tons for the corresponding period of 1947, and 56,298 tons in 1946. Whole milk production was 19,800,000 gallons more than for the corresponding period of 1947. The production of cheese has also increased. output of tractors, agricultural implements and barbed wire has also greatly increased since 1938-39. There has also been a. great increase in home-building activities. In 1932 3,000 homes were built in Australia. In 1939 the number mcreased to 23,000, and in 1948 to 48,000. Road construction and maintenance in this country is a vital matter. At present, approximately £2,000,000 a year allocated from the petrol tax is distributed to local governing authorities for expenditure on outback roads. The system was introduced hy the Labour Government. I consider, however, that the allocation will have to be increased, owing to the increasing number of heavy vehicles that are using country roads for the haulage of gravel, wood, produce, timber, and heavy mechanical equipment for large works projects such as the Tasmanian hydro-electric schemes. Primary production and decentralization of industry are entirely dependent upon good roads which are necessary also for the development and defence of our inland areas. The Government will have to give greater consideration to the road problem and a similar obligation rests upon the State governments. I should like to see the road problem declared a national emergency. I have several suggestions to make about methods of overcoming our road maintenance and construction difficulties. First, road construction and repairs should have high priority for money, man-power and materials. An .increased allocation from the petrol tax should be made available to local governing authorities. Thia grant should he in keeping with the urgency of the problem, and steps should be taken to ensure that the local governing authorities expend the mouey to the best advantage. Encouragement should be given to the importation of essential road-making machinery, and more steel should be allocated to Australian manufacturers of this equipment. An important contribution to the solution of the problem could be made hy the formation of road construction and repair gangs of immigrant workers to operate in defined areas. These gangs should be financed by the Commonwealth Government, equipped with modern machinery purchased by the States out of The their petrol tax allocations, and lent to local governing authorities. This system would be of great benefit to local councils which at present find the maintenance of roads beyond their capabilities. With these mobile gangs, financed by the Commonwealth out of the petrol tax, road maintenance and repair work could he carried out more efficiently and more expeditiously. [Extension of time granted.] There should also be a definite plan for more co-operation between neighbouring councils, and between the public works departments of the various States and local governing authorities, with a view to cutting costs and speeding repairs. At present, each council has its own few pieces of machinery and limited man-power resources. It would be much better if say three councils combined their equipment and labour into one unit. I believe also that there is room for more co-operation between the public works authorities and the local governing bodies in the use. of heavy machinery which the councils themselves cannot afford. Every assistance should he given to the new bitumen factory in Victoria. Not much, has been said ahout this matter but it is vital. I do not know how far the project has advanced, but I understand that the factory is being built, or is to be built, near Melbourne. Hitherto, we have had to import bitumen. Its production in this country will save dollars and provide the sealing material which is so essential for roads carrying heavy traffic. Sealing is the ultimate solution to our road problem. In the long run, sealed roads are cheaper than unsealed ones. Later perhaps it may be necessary to concrete some of our main thoroughfares. I make those suggestions in a sincere effort to assist in the solution of a problem with which all of us, Government and Opposition members alike, are concerned. This is uot a matter for party politics. It is a national problem, and should be tackled as such. As I have said, the road problem should he declared a national emergency and tackled immediately by the use of funds allocated from the petrol tax. That would be of tremendous assistance in outback areas particularly. petrol tax does the houorable member believe should be allocated for road work? yielding approximately £17,000,000 a year. Last year, £7,500,000 was allocated for road work. The rest was paid into Consolidated Eevenue. I believe that the allocation for road work should be increased by £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 at least for a start. the money received from-the tax? fair. We must he reasonable. by an anti-Labour government during the depression years as a revenue tax. fair to say that all the money should he allocated to the States. I shall not delay the House much longer. I appreciate the extension of time that I have heen granted to complete my remarks on this subject. I emphasize that we shall never solve any of our problems, hy petty bickering, and indulging in personalities. Unfair and unjust criticism of the Government by the Opposition can serve no usef ul purpose. Wild irrational statements only mislead and confuse the people. We must make a united attack upon our problems. Only by co-operation can we overcome our housing difficulties, the steel shortage, and the under-production of galvanized iron and other essential commodities. The Opposition's accusations of insincerity on the part of the Government are completely unjust. I like to give credit where credit is due, and when Opposition members make suggestions to the Government, I do not doubt their sincerity. Working together, we can get out of our difficulties. They are great, but, fortunately, not so great as those of many other countries. Disgruntled Australians should go to some other couutry. They would very soon be back again. Australia is still the best country in the world, and we are proud of it. We members of Parliament should get together, forsaking bitterness and political prejudice. If we were to do that we could solve most of our difficulties within a reasonable time. adjourned.
