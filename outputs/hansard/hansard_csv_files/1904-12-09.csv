15,Mr Frazer Asked The Minister Of De,"able member's questions are as follow:1. It is not true that the military authorities refuse to gazette the promotion. 2. Instructions were given a short time ago that this officer should be granted his promotion, and it is intended that the necessary order shall be submitted at the next meeting of the Executive. That for the rest of the session, when necessary, the Standing Orders be suspended so as to allow the remaining stages of any Bills, after their second reading, to be taken without delay. Debate resumed from 21st October (vide Downs, although supporting the Bill, pracpage 5969) on motion by Sir WILLIAM tically indicated the failure of the Canadian LYNEThat the Bill be now read a second time. to the debates upon the measure, and I though the iron bonus has been in utterly fail to see the force of the arguoperation in Canada since, 1 thinlc, ments which have been used by the honor1884, it was first intended to cover able member for Eden-Monaro and others a period of only seven or eight who are supporting it. I object to the meayears. In other words, it was considered sure, first, because, being associated with that the total demand in the home markets the Tariff, it is certain that it will practiwould be met within that period. T'h« callyfixthe import duties upon iron, and beproduction of iron from local ores is, howcause it is a declared part of the policy of ever, so small that no other conclusion can the advocates of the Bill that the protection be arrived at than that the bonus system has granted under the Tariff shall be conentirely failed to accomplish its object. In tinued after the bonus perir/3 has expired. Canada the local price of iron is actually The imposition of these duties will have the higher than the export price. In fact, the effect of increasing the price of raw iron to a iron-masters of the United Kingdom, rather very large extent, and will therefore hamper than those of Canada, benefit from the production, because, as has been admitted, Canadian iron enters very largely into the raw material deal of the surplus not required for of a great number of industries. Once it is local purposes is dumped down in the granted, however, the bonus is certain to be United Kingdom at prices lower than those continued. Upon that point I need do no ruling in the Dominion. I forget the exact more than refer to the fact t'hat at the prefigures, but I think that close upon 125,000 sent time an agitation is being carried on tons of Canadian iron was dumped down in with a view to give permanence to the sugar the United Kingdom during the year bebonuses. If we can judge from the history fore last. The honourable member for of the iron industry in America, protection, Eden-Monaro also mentioned that of the either direct or indirect, leads to tremendous completed furnaces in Canada upon the fluctuations in production.

If the bonuses are once policy of encouragement upon what it is granted there is certain to be a demand for now proposed to launch us is not required. their increase. Canada started in 1884 with a bonus of $2 per ton upon raw iron. This was increased in 1899 to $3 per ton. What has been the result ? According to a blue book published by order of the House of Commons during the last few months, Mr Llewellyn Smith, a member of the Board of Trade, statesBut, although the bonus is on a higher scale in the case of pig iron made from native ores, the pig iron produced in Canada from Canadian ore is much less than that produced from imported ores, and the greater part of the Canadian ore is exported. That indicates the failure of the bonus system, because the greater part of the iron manufactured in Canada is produced from other than native ores.

18,Mr Glynn (Angas),"I have listened had been produced from native ores. A lIt has been stated by Mr Sandford that iron can be locally produced from native ores at a cost of about 35s. per ton, which, I think, is about half the import price. That shows that the local manufacturer will have the benefit of substantial natural protection. If we have, all the natural advantages claimed by the supporters of the Bill, in the shape of large ore deposits, ample coal supplies, and other requisites, the industry should not require any special protection such as that now contemplated. It must be remembered that our local markets are particularly limited. I am not quite sure as to the quantity of iron consumed in the Commonwealth, but I understand that it amounts to about 35,000 tons per annum, one-third of which quantity is required by the States Governments. Therefore, if we gave a bonus for the manufacture of iron, we should enable those engaged in the industry to impose a stiff tax upon the States Governments as consumers. Then, again, I contend that our ore bodies are not sufficiently concentrated, and that in America, and, in fact, everywhere else, such conditions have been found to considerably discount the chances of success. It has been shown that the amount of forded by the establishment of the industry will be comparatively small. In America, in connection with the Duquesne blast furnaces, Pittsburg, less than 500 men are^ employed, although the output is about"" 750,000 tons annually. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to the tremendous development which has taken place in the iron production of America, and by inference alleged that this was due to the policy which had been adopted of protecting the industry. His comparative statistics, however, possess very little value, seeing that he starts with the year 1867, because we know that in America production was at a minimum from 1861 to 1865. But the moment that the war ended, industry received a tremendous impetus, in which, of course, the iron industry participated. 1865, the world's demand for iron as a raw material has largely increased. This to a great extent accounts for the American development. The production of the world at the present time is about 50,000,000 tons annually. the demand will increase in Australia. we do not require to foster the industry by means of a bonus, because of the natural demand for the raw material. Without any change in the fiscal conditions in America, production has enormously increased within the past thirty or forty years. This fact has been due to the greatly increased demand for iron in various directions-for example, in the ship-building line. The ironclad and the steel-bound vessel have been substituted for the old "" wooden walls."" Then, again, the local demand for iron in America is greater than that in any other country. We all know that in that country iron enters very largely into house construction. It forms the skeleton frame of a great many of the buildings there. Then, again, the bridges in the United States are mostly construcfed of iron. I repeat that the local demand has developed sufficiently during the past thirty or forty years to account for the great increase in iron production in America. At the same time, we must recollect that as far back as 1826 the iron industry there enjoyed a protection of 100 per cent. This duty continued to operate for many years, but, despite its aid, the industry remained in its infancy until about 1865, thus indicating that it is not protection employment that will be afwhich is responsible for its great development. In the United Kingdom, no protection has been afforded to the iron industry, which, however, has fairly well maintained its petition. In i860, the production in the United States amounted to only 821,000 tons, whereas it is now nearly 18,000,000 tons. The German production in i860, was 519,000 tons, but the production in the United Kingdom in that year wa& 3,800,000 tons. ' So that, comparative increases are no test of the efficacy of pro.tection as against free-trade. But the production in the United Kingdom did not stop at 3,800,000 torts. It also took advantage of the increased demand, due to the causes which I have mentioned , so that we find 1 that whilst the United States produced nearly 18,000,000 tons of iron in 1902-3, the United Kingdom produced 8,680.000 From about tons, thus indicating no decay of the industry in the mother country. United States is the greater. the enormous deposits of the United States with those of the United Kingdom. The latter annually imports about 60,000 tons of Swedish ore for special purposes. It also imports ductile iron from Canada, much to the benefit of the manufactures of the",13,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
19,Mr Hutchison,That fact argues that,14,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
20,Mr Glynn,It is an argument that,14,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
21,Mr Chanter,The production of the,14,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
22,Mr Glynn,"But we ^cannot compareUnited Kingdom, because the products of this iron are so much cheaper. The effect of .this dumping has been to enable the ironfounders of the United Kingdom to successfully compete against Germany for contracts in Copenhagen and several other places. The production in Germany is about 8,5:18,000 tons per annum. As a matter of fact, the production per head in the United Kingdom is about equal to that of America, which, after all, is the true basis of comparison. In 1902-3, the production per head in the United States was C23, in the United Kingdom it was""o'2i, in Germany-wher e the industry is stiffly protected-it was only o""i5, and in Russiawhere it is also protected'-it was C02. I do not think that I need elaborate my argument any further. I have shown that under free-trade conditions, the iron industry has flourished. Consequently, if we possess tremendous deposits of iron and' coal, the protection of coal against the imported article is sufficient to permit of the development of those deposits. If the industry has not been established, it is not because of the absence of a bo.nu'3. I claim that it would establish a bad principle to give such a tremendous bonus to private individuals. In the first place, the benefit thus conferred must to a large extent be monopolized by a few, and, in the second, the incidental benefits will be confined practically to one or two States, which possess the greatest deposits of ore, and in which the conditions for successful production are known to exist. I am firmly of opinion that unless .there is competition from outside, the local producers who receive the bonus will be able to mulct the State as an entity by charging increased prices. For these reasons, I shall vote against .the Bill. to support the second reading of this measure, and my only regret is that it cannot be immediately passed through Committee, so that it might become law as soon as possible. I cannot understand the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Angas. He has affirmed that the establishment of the iron industry will not afford a very large amount of employment. I do not propose to auote any statistics in that connection. I merely wish to view the matter from a broad stand-point. I would ask the honourable member if he _ is not aware that the importations of iron into the Commonwealth last year were valued at about j£8,ooo,ooo? value of manufactured articles. When we reflect that last year about ,£8,000,000 were expended by the Commonwealth in the purchase of manufactured articles, of which iron and steel form the base, it is clear that the local production of iron would afford a very large measure of employment. The honourable and learned member also affirms that the industry requires no bonus to assist its establishment. Nature has endowed almost every State in Australia with large deposits of iron ore, and yet thousands of men are out of employment. The honourable and learned member for Angas has referred to New South Wales. Does he not know that several attempts to manufacture iron and steel from native ore have been made in that State? What was the result ? The moment the attempt was made a combination of importers was established for the purpose of crushing the industry. In New South Wales, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been expended in an endeavour to develop the iron industry. The article produced there is acknowledged to be equal to any produced in the world. The honourable and learned member for Angas is opposed to the encouragement of this industry either by bonus, or by way of a fair protective duty. I would point out to him that the natural demand to which he referred has always been present. Yet year after year, we find that no successful attempt has been made to establish the industry, and to provide employment to a large number of artisans and mechanics. To my mind this Bill should not receive opposition even from the free-trade section of this House, seeing that it provides that no bonus shall be payable until a certain article has actually been produced. It will thus be seen that the money which it is proposed.to expend by way of bonus cannot be misapplied, as has been the case in some of the States. Those who embark upon the undertaking will have to incur an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds before they can produce the necessary pig-iron to enable them to obtain the modest bonus of 12s. per ton. These bonuses are to extend over a period of only five years, and the total amount to be paid in any one year is not! to exceed j£5o,ooo. started in the same way.",14,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

These preliminaries, however, came to a sudden termination, because it was seen that there was a hesitancy on the part of a section of the Parliament to give those interested a guarantee that the money which they proposed to invest in this way would not ibe entirely lost. That is the position which we have to face today. The honourable and learned member for Angas quoted certain statistics, from which he endeavoured to show that the United Kingdom had held its own with other parts of the world in the manufacture of iron and steel. I am at a loss to know where he obtained' his information. That which I have obtained is quite the reverse. The United Kingdom, instead of holding its own with other countries in the production of iron and steel, has fallen behind. matter of comparative production, but not in the aggregate. position of the industry in the United Kingdom, as compared with that of Germany and the United States of America. in those countries had increased. I gave the figures relating to the production in the United Kingdom and the United States of ^^Ift 61*1 Oft mission, I need not pursue this line of argument further than to ask why the industry in Germany and the United States of America has made such wonderf u l progress as compared with that made by it in the United Kingdom? On the one hand, we find England' under free-trade retrogressing, whilst, on the other, the United States of America and Germany, as the result of a protective policy, are rapidly forging ahead. I think it has been held by the greatest writers on the-subject that the prosperity of a nation depends upon the utilization of its own native productions. It has been shown again and again that the iron and steel industry offers the widest field for employment. involves not merely the extraction of the coal and iron from the soil, but numerous In the Blue Mountains, branches of manufacture which give employment to thousands of people, and are productive of much wealth. We have all the raw material in the Commonwealth, and it remains for us only to devise some means Capital was to to give it a commercial value. Would any one have the temerity to say that if we could manufacture only one-half of the imports of iron, and steel into Australiawhich would represent a value of ""Between ^3,000,000 and ,£4,000.000 per annumit would not be advantageous to the capitalist, the worker, and the people generally ? Would it not result in the building up of kindred industries? The honourable ancl learned member for Angas has referred to the importation of iron for bridge building purposes. We all know that it is used in these and many other directions, and surely we ought to devise some means to encourage its local manufacture, if only for the benefit of our people. I am anxious that this Bill shouicl be passed as soon as possible, and therefore shall not detain the House any further. I believe that the Bill will be attended with the most beneficial results-that it will lead to the establishment of an industry which will provide I know that it has in the employment for hundreds of persons now. seeking work in vain, and bear favorable comparison with the pastoral, I am speaking of the agricultural, ancl other industries in the community as a producer of wealth and a means of employment. I am satisfied that once established, it would become, if not I admitted that the output the leading, at all events one of the leading, -industries of Australia. Although the session has extendejd over In view of that, admany months, I am sorry to say that nothing has been done by us to encourage the utilization of the native products of Australia, and to give direct employment to the many thousands of unemployed in the Commonwealth. In the closing days of the session we have now an opportunity to do something that will lead to the opening up of a wide field of employment. The honourable and learned member for Angas objects to the introduction of a bonus system in this way, ' because he says Ave do not know what it would lead to. He has referred to the fact that Canada, having granted a bonus for the encouragement of the iron and steel industry, was subsequently called upon to It largely increase it. But because Canada, in increasing the bonus, has done something",16,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

38,Mr Hutchison (Hindmarsh),"which, in his opinion, is not in the best interests of the country that is no reason why he should say that we should be likely to do the same. I am satisfied that the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada would not have increased the bonus unless it thought it would be to the advantage of the country, and I am equally satisfied that if some future Parliament of Australia decided to continue or increase the bonuses proposed in this Bill, it would have equally good grounds for doing so. I do not think, however, that it would be necessary, in our case, to grant any increase. The honourable and learned member for Angas urged that if iron could be produced so much cheaper in the Commonwealth than in other parts of "" the world, there ought to be sufficient natural protection to encourage its local manufacture. But the capitalists who are prepared, under reasonable'conditions, to put their money into a venture of this kind, require some protection at the outset, because they know that the importers would combine and make a determined effort to crush them at the inception of their operations. They would do their utmost, even at the risk'of sustaining enormous losses, to cripple the industry in its infancy. We have to give those who are ready to take up this work an opportunity to fight against such a combination on something like equal terms. The system which this Bill proposes is frequently resorted to in other lands. member for Angas asserted that the granting of had led to dumping. ways been the cry of free-traders that very little dumping .takes place, but now, because it suits the honourable member's purpose to adopt a different view, he asserts that the introduction of this system would have, that result. If the granting of bonuses has proved beneficial in other cases, why should we not adopt the system to secure the establishment of the iron and steel industrv in Australia ? We have beer, told by the' honourable member for Riverina that ,£8,000,000 worth of manufactured iron and steel goods is yearly imported into the Commonwealth, and T hold that triers is no reason why we should not manufacture all these goods for ourselves. If we did so it would certainly be to the material advantage of our producers. We know that they do not reap the advantage of the cheaply produced articles of the old country. Mr Hutchison. Only the other day I was informed that a machine used by our farmers, which has been sold here for ,£37, now, because of a combination, costs ,£45. If we gave manufacturers sufficient encouragement to erect plant in Australia to make such machinery, I am satisfied that our people would be able to get their implements at a cheaper rate than they do now. The honourable arid learned member for Angas told us that the Australian demand is a limited one, and yet he gave figures showing that the output of the world hadi increased from 15,000,000 to 50,000,000 tons. Undoubtedly our requirements are at the present time limited, but when the iron industry is established here they will have become much larger than they are now. No one will deny that that industry is the basis of all manufacturing industries, and would give a vast amount of employment. I shall not enter into a detailed discussion on the subject, however, because I am anxious to see the Bill pushed through. The members of the party to which I belong, and I myself, are strongly in favour of the nationalization of the iron industry, but if we are unable to carry a clause which would provide for that, I shall be prepared to allow the industry to be conducted by private enterprise. It has been objected that if the industry is .conducted by private enterprise, a monopoly will be created, because it will not be possible to establish more than one or two iron works in the The honourable and learned Commonwealth. My answer to that is, that if it becomes a monopoly, it a bonus in Canada will be the easiest thing in the It has alworld to provide for the taking over of it by the Government on reasonable terms. In my opinion, the Commonwealth will not suffer, andi our producers will not suffer, by the granting of the proposed bonus. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Riverina, there is an abundant supply of coal in Australia, and iron ore is to be found in all the States. South Australia possesses what has been proved to be the finest ore in the Commonwealth, in unlimited quantities, although she has no coal. In course of time, however, that ore will either be smelted locally or will be sent for smelting to other parts of the Commonwealth where there is coal. It will be a reflection on this Housei f , after such a wasted session, we allow Parliament to be prorogued without doing something, not only for our workers, but also for our unemployed. The honourable and learned member for Angas has pointed out that during war time an extraordinary impetus has been given to the iron industry of the United States, but that afterwards a reaction has set in which has caused the employees engaged in it to suffer. That must occur in connection with every country affected by war. We, however, need not fear, either that our iron industry will receive an impetus from such a cause, or that there will be a consequent dismissal of employees during a subsequent period of depression. to add to what has already been said the expression of my earnest hope that we shall be allowed to bring this matter to a conclusion. I feel that the Tariff which was passed by the lastParliament will not be anything like complete until a measure such as this has been enacted. Indeed, it was anticipated when division VIA . was agreed to that a measure of this kind would follow almost immediately. To my mind, the arguments which have been adduced against the granting of bonuses have not been altogether fair, because the worse results of the bonus system have been put before the House as though they were the ordinary and only results. In Victoria we have an object lesson in this matter of which the House might well take notice. There was a time in our history when we were in depths of depression such as we had never previously reached. we were dragged out of them through the operation of a bonus. There is not the slightest doubt that the butter.bonus, which was instituted by the Hon. J. L . Dow, was the main factor in assisting Victoria to successfully combat the terrible financial difficulties which we had then to face. Some honourable' members have referred to that bonus by way of reproach, because of certain revelations which have recently been made concerning the channels into which part of it flowed. But those revelations do not affect either the principle or the result; they only show that had the bonus in all cases been paid to the right persons, the beneficial result would have been far greater. Notwithstanding the improper diversion of money which Parliament intended to benefit a particular class, that class and the community generally have benefited inestimably from the operation of the bonus. butter industry. and I that once a bonus is granted the Government must keep on spoon-feeding the industry, that in the case of the Victorian butter industry no bonus has been paid for many years past, but the industry is able to stand alone, notwithstanding the very improper proceedings of many connected with the butter export trade In discussing a matter of this kind Ave should not pick out particular cases of abuse, but should rely on proper administration for the right conduct of the system Ave adopt. I feel sure that Ave have no need to fear a repetition of unfortunate occurrences such as those Avhich in Victoria have done so much to damage AvhatI regard 'as often a necessary policy for the establishment of a neAv industry. In common Avith those who have preceded me, I desire that Ave shall deal Avith the measure as rapidly as possible, and, although under other circumstances, I Avould speak at greater length, I feel that the interests which Ave have at heart will be best served by brevity. Canada has been cited as a country Avhich has found it necessary to increase her bonuses, notwithstanding the fact that they were accompanied by a substantial import duty. The results of the Canadian bonus system, however, should give us the highest anticipations for the success of the iron industry in Australia. Although at first it Avas found But necessary to increase the bonuses, they have been gradually decreasing, there having been recently a reduction of is. 3d., and, probably at no distant date, the granting of bonuses will entirely cease. The honourable member for Hindmarsh alluded to the fact that, although Ave have been in session for nine months continuously, and have Avorked assiduously and honestly, A\'e have not been able to accomplish any legislation to give the employment which is so much needed by our people, and I Avould urge upon.trie House the fact that the passing of this measure will open up aA'enues of employment, Avhich will gi\ e Avork r to a large number of men Avho are at present Avithout it. In addition to the iron industry itself, there will be a number of subsidiary industries which wiN employ thousands of men. It has been anticipated that 3,000 men AA'ill find employment Avithin two years and a half in connection with the iron industry itself, but that is no criterion of the number which will find It established the employment in connection Avith other industries if Ave provide for the rapid, and, I would remind those who have said steel in Australia.

By securing an efficient and regular supply of iron,we shall beretaining in their employment, the workers who are now here, and' shall be finding employment for others, while, if a European war should arise, we shall be able to keep our industries going without intermission. the Bill was before the last Parliament, I strenuously opposed it , and although I do not think it necessary to repeat now the arguments which I advanced then, my opinion as to the inadvisability of employing public funds to build up a monopoly in the iron industry has in no way changed. The honourable member for Laanecoorie spoke of ihe Victorian butter bonus as on all fours with the proposed bonus for the production of iron, but there are many points of difference In the first place, the butter bonuses granted in Victoria and South Australia were given, not for the production, but for the export of butter, market having been already complied with. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the butter industry were such as to preclude any possibility of a monopoly. The conditions of the iron industry, however, are such that the establishment of a monopoly is inevitable. It is not suggested that there could be any competition except from outside. There is not room in the Comtnonwe'alth for) more' than oine smelting works, and therefore those who establish the industry must exercise control over the whole iron production of Australia. I do not desire to aid in bringing about such a condition of affairs. I intend, however, to vote for the second reading of the measure in the hope that honourable members will agree to offer a bonus to any State that may be willing to undertake the establishment of the industry. Failing that, we must impose conditions which will enable a State, or the Commonwealth, at any time, to take over the industry. My attitude toA l l that is wards the Bill at a later stage will be determined by the shape which it assumes in We must reCommittee. made in the Bill for the State taking over the industry. not be retained in the measure. I do not think there is much chance of passing the my mind, no time should be Bil l this session, but it is certainly due to those honourable members who have taken such a keen interest in it that the fullest opportunity should be presented for discussion. vote for the second reading of the B ill , because I think that its principle is consistent with the policy we have adopted for the Commonwealth. The great American humourist, Mark Twain, has said that a hair-splitting nicety of creed is necessary for the salvation of some souls, and I think that we are rather inclined to hair-splitting when we discuss in the abstract such a question as that now before us. WhilstI call myself a free-trader, I believe with John StuartM ill , that it may be well in a new country to encourage industry by the granting of bonuses or bounties. orable member knows that Cobden said that the expression of that idea had undone all the good that he had ever -been able to accomplish ? said that John StuartM ill recanted to a the requirements of the home certain extent, but I have not been able to find any record of his recantation.

I refer to spending certain sums of money under such circumstances that they will yield no direct return, but will probablv confer indirect benefits upon us, which will m,ore than compensate us for the outlay.

The honourable member for Angas took the contrary view; but I would point, out that in Carnegie's works in the United States, no less than 168,000 workmen are employed.

There is a much easier method of protecting the interests of tbe public.

I couldi not imagine that any capitalists would be willing to invest, perhaps, ^£1,000,000, as has been stated in connection with one company, in such an undertaking as that contemplated unless they were fully assured that they would find a profitable outlet for their products. Further, our remoteness from the centres of iron production and manufacture would place us at a great disadvantage in the event of our supplies from abroad being interrupted by the outbreak of war. We might not be able to procure sufficient iron for the manufacture of the munitions of war necessary for our defence. Therefore, I think that it is highly desirable tliat we should be self-sustaining in I obtained my figures direct that regard.

If they had taken any such action, r 1 should have condemned them in terms similar to those I am now employing. One would judge from the debate that all the evidence collected was in favour of the proposal in the Bill. But what are the facts? The advocates of the measure have not dared to refer to .the report of the Bonus Commission. Is there any evidence in that report that there was anything like unanimity on the part of those honorablp members who were deputed tospeciallv investigate this question? bers were appointed to that Commission. They collected a considerable mass of evidence, which they carefully sifted, and they were equally divided upon the question of whether it was wise to offer this bonus. What is called the dissentient report states: We, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through Parliament of the Bill for the payment of bonuses by the Federal Government for the establishment of the iron industry within the Commonwealth. That report is signed by W. M. Hughes, Samuel Winter Cooke, J. W'.' Kirwan, Geo. W. Fuller, J. Chris. Watson, and Joseph Cook. It proceeds :We recognise that the Commonwealth possesses the House is asked, at the eleventh hour, to vast deposits of iron ore of high grade, coal, & c , for iron works.

Furthermore, to the control of a private imember involving we believe it would be a considerable advantage an initial expenditure of something like ta have the industry in operation in a flourishing ,£350,000. condition, and on a propeT basis.

Among the most important paragraphs in bonus system, are identical with those which the report are the following: One of the witnesses, Mr Sandford, managsame reasons are constantly ur""ed in regard ing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, New Scuth Wales, stated that he had made an agreeto a protective policy. ment with an English syndicate to spend thirty-five years' experience of protection, ^250,000 in extending the Lithgow works if the cannot do without it. Bill passecl. In answer to another question, Mr Sandford said that to make pig-iron he wanted a plant involving an expenditure of from ,£100,000 upon salt? tn ^125,000. This estimate is less than half the sum proposed to be paid in bonuses. They addThe Canadian experience is not encouraging. the payment of a bonus. What has been The bonus system for iron production was first the result of the bonus system in Canada? Subsequently a Bill was passed, in 1897, further continuing the system. Another Bill was carried in 1899 providing for the diminution of the bounties by a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid. Nearly all the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would be useless unless followed by a duty. Experience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the F ill , but that further Government aid will be sought. The evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. Mr Sandford said he could produce Twelve mempig-iron at Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight (to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favourably with any imported pig-iron . Other witnesses, who, however, had 1 less experience than Mr Sandford, doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But, .pn the supposition of his having made an under estimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as compared with the imported commodity. No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the' Bill. Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of ironworks in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. Yet in the face of a report of that character Experience of the operation never foresee where it will end. In CanBill provides for the payment of ada, for example, the original intention was that the arguments which were then adduced in support of the introduction of the have been advanced in this House.

60,Mr Poynton,They had no chance,22,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
61,Mr Watkins,What about the duty,22,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
62,Mr Poynton,"Thos e engaged in theI n 1883, the Parliament of the Dominion passed an Act offering a bounty of $1.50 per ton for the production of pig-iron. In 1889, that bounty was reduced to $1 per ton; but in 1892 another Act was passed increasing the bounty to $2 per ton, and providing that it should terminate in 1897. The parties concerned, however, took good care to secure themselves before that time expired. In 1894 they secured the passing of anAct providing for the payment of bounties of $2 per ton on pig-iron, $2 per! ton on puddled bars, and $2 per ton on steel billets made from Canadian pig. This Act was to remain in operation for five years; but without waiting for that period to elapse, the Dominion Parliament, in 1897, repealed the Act; increased the bounties to $3 per ton on steel ingots made of not less than 50 per cent. Canadian pig, and made other changes. bounties were given to encourage the manufacture of pig-iron from local ore, but the manufacturers found that it suited their purpose to use ore obtained from parts beyond the Dominion, and they were then successful in securing the passing of an Act providing for the payment of bounties of $3 per ton on steel ingots of not less than 50 per ceint. of Canadian pig, $3 per ton on puddled bars, $3 per ton on pig-iron, and $2 per ton on the proportion made from foreign ore. In 1898 another Act was passed declaring that the provisions of this measure should be retrospective, and come into force as from 1897. Yet, in the face of such evidence, we are asked to believe that the amounts set out in this Bil l represent the whole expenditure which the Commonwealth will be asked to sanction. Do honourable members believe that? If we pass legislation of this character, what will when the Tariff Bill was under considerabe the next step ? We shall be told that we have expended £[324,000 to establish the iron industry, strength of our action certain persons have been induced to invest their capital in that enterprise. We shall be assured that they cannot continue operations, and that unless they are granted further assistance the works will have to be closed, as a result of which hundreds 'of men will be thrown out of employment. I venture to predict that that statement will be made in this House before many years have passed. To-dav we are called upon to consider not merelv the expenditure of £[250,000 upon pig-iron made from Australian ore, puddled bar iron made from Australian pig-iron, and steel made from Australian pig-iron. We have to consider whether, having been parties to the establishment of this industry, we shall not be obliged to continue hand-feeding it to the extent that has been found necessary elsewhere. Judging by the indifference displayed by honourable members, one would think that this was a matter of no importance-that we were here not as the custodians of the public purse, but merely to vote large sums of money for the benefit of private individuals. A Commission, was appointed to deal with this question, and although we are told by them that they did not seek any evidence in opposition to the scheme, their inquiries resulted in the report I have quoted. It would be an absolute calamity to pass this B ill , and I think it is a matter for regret, that we should even be asked to deal with such a measure. Let From 1883 until 1897 me now refer briefly to some of the other articles, the local manufacture of which it is proposed to encourage by means of the bonus system. TheB i ll proposes that a bonus shall be paid for the local manufacture of wire-netting, and at a certain date a duty is also to be imposed to encourage the industry. A similar course is to be followed in regard to the articles mentioned in the other divisions of the B ill . What will this mean to our primary producers? I represent a large number of farmers, who find it necessary to protect their crops by the use of wire-netting. There are vast wheat-growing areas in South Australia, where, in the absence of wire-netting fences, it would be impossible to protect the crops from the ravages of rabbits and other vermin. Yet it is proposed to increase the duty on an article which is so largely used in this way. A similar proposition was made tion, and I was one of those who strenuously opposed it. Farmers and pastoralists and that upon the are already put to an additional expenditure of at least ad. per acre-in respect of the great bulk of the wheat areas of South Australia-by having to provide wire-netting for the protection of their crops, and I fail to see how any honourable member could support a proposal that must result in the price of the commodity being increased. Prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, there was a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton on barbed wire and wire netting imported into Victoria; but it did not result in the establishment of a sound local industry. In New South Wales, where there was no duty imposed on either of these articles, a wire-netting manufactory was satisfactorily established. mission, in a summary of the imported materials which would be affected by the passing of this Bill, show that ,£70,000 worth of wire-netting was, on the average, annually imported into the Commonwealth during the five years ending 31st December, 1902, whilst the value of barbed wire annually imported during the same period was ,£60,000. These are two of the articles, the local production of which is to be encouraged at a future date by means'of Customs duties. In the face of open competition, factories for the making of wire netting were successfully established in New South Wales, whilst in Victoria, with a heavy import duty on barbed wire, it was only possible to establish a manufactory employing some twenty-nine who 28s. 3d. per week. achieve this magnificent result, those who use barbed wire in Victoria were called upon to bear the burden of a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton. We are now asked to give men a bonus for manufacturing which they have been able to produce in Australia without any protection whatever. It is idle for honourable members who support this measure to say that the imposition of a duty on any article does not increase its price to the consumer. That is a fallacy which I successfully exposed during the Tariff debate. the figures for twelve months, the difference between ihe price of barbed wire and wire netting in Victoria, where there was a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton, and in New South Wales, where the articles were on the free list, was within 5s. of the amount of .the duty. that the public were deceived in regard to the gauge of wire they were using; that a ton of imported wire, gauge 12, went one mile twenty-nine chains further than did a ton of the local article, which was also sold as gauge 12. In the face of all these facts we are asked to crown a profitless session by pledging the Commonwealth to an undertaking that at the outset would involve an expenditure of ,£350,000. fore we see the end of the we shall in all. probability pended more like £[3,500,000 than the £[350,000 which we are now asked to vote. How many honourable members would have the courage to refuse to vote for the continuation of the bonus, or to oppose a heavy duty to encourage the industry once it had been started? The present proposal is Mr Poynton. The Comone of the results of the unsatisfactory state of parties in this House. It would have been a thousand times better if a dissolution had taken place long ago, and had resulted in the return of parties in such a way as to allow the Government of the day to have something like reasonable control over public business. I shall not say that it is a scandal, because it would be out of order to do so, but the fact that a measure involving an expenditure of .£350,000 has been handed over to a private member of this House reflects no credit on the Government. I do not say this with any desire to be discourteous to the honourable member for Hume, who, as the result of a mere accident, happens to be in charge of the B ill to-day. The Bill was handed over to a hands, Government supporter, as one of those sops received an average wage of which are usually distributed when a GoIn order to vernment depends fpr its existence on one vote. It goes very close to what would be in other places called something that I would be out of order in suggesting in this House. Let me now place before honorthat able members some figures, showing the amount distributed by way of bonuses for the manufacture of iron and steel in Canada. The figures are as follows: 1884, $44,000; 1885, $38,000; 1886, $39,000; 1887, $59,000; 1888, $33,000; 1889, $37,000; 1890, $25,000; 1891, $20,000; 1892, $30,000; 1893, $93,000-a . big inI showed that, taking crease; 1894, $125,000; 1895, $63,000; 1898, $165,000; 1899, $187,000; in 1900, $238,000; in 1901, $351,000; in 1902, $693,000; and in 1903,$670,000, making a total of $3,087,833.

Whatever may be our opinions upon the proposal, we all regret his inability to be present on this occasion to take an active part in the work which he has initiated, and to which he has devoted so much talent and ability. Next to him, the honourable member for Hume, who brought the Bill before this Parliament, is entitled to praise, because he has shown a considerable amount of interest in the matter, and has endeavoured to obtain a conclusion in regard to it. I wish, however, lo enter my strong protest against the passing of the measure. I believe that it is in contravention of the best traditions of the Bribonuses. If we introduce a system under tish Constitution that a measure of this kind should be in the hands of a private member. British communities that measures of large importance, affecting the people generally, and especially those having to do with the Taising, and expenditure of public money, should be brought before Parliament by Ministers, with the concurrence of the Executive of the day. The fact that the Executive is not responsible for this measure is, to my mind, a strong reason why we should reject it. In support of that contention, I would instance what took place in New South Wales in regard to the Payment of Members Bill. When that measure was first introduced into the arena of politics, it was taken in hand by Mr Traill, a private member, who did what may be termed the pioneering work in connection with the movement. The Premier of the clay, however-that great constitutional authority, Hie late Sir Henry Parkes-re fused to allow the subject to be dealt with by a private member. He was personally opposed to payment of members, but to get over the difficulty allowed a member of his Cabinet to introduce the Bill, and the then Postmaster-General brought it forward as a semi-Government measure. passed through the Legislative Assembly by a substantial majoritv. and rejected by the Council. Then Sir Henry Parkes said, "" AlthoughI am opposed to the principles of the Bill, I recognise that it is the desire of the representatives of the people that it shall be passed."" He immediately made the measure a Government Bill, and returned it to the Council, with the f u l l' weight of his sanction, and it was passed into law -He laid down the constitutional principle that no measure imposing taxation or providing for expenditure should be. submitted to honourable members unless it had the authority of the Executive behind it. I protest against the departure that has been made from those sound constitutional lines. The Bill proposes to take out of the pockets of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth £[324,000 for the purpose of providing bonuses for certain iprtivalte individuals. Under our financial conditions, which involve the necessity of handing over to the States Governments three-quarters of the revenue raised through the Customs, we shall be obliged to burden the taxpayers to an enormous extent, in order to enable us to provide the funds necessary to pay these which any private individual can come to the House and ask for the expenditure of It is generally recognised in large sums of money, we shall expose the, community to the risk of great injury, and I therefore wish to enter my strongest protest against the manner in which the Bill has been brought before us. I have no personal feeling against the honourable member who is in charge of the Bill. When the Government refused to take it up he was quite within his rights in endeavouring to do his best to place it upon the Statutebook. On a former occasion I said that I was not averse to granting assistance to the iron industry, and I certainly prefer the more direct method of paying bonuses to that of affording protection by means of Customs duties. Bonuses involve the payment of a definite sum, and the benefits which they confer are readily ascertainable, whereas under a protective system it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the public are deriving advantage. I admit that the iron industry deserves special consideration at the hands of this Parliament and of the States Parliaments. We use iron products perhaps to a greater extent than any other community in proportion to population. There is another important It was aspect of this question, which to my mind is worthy of consideration. The States Governments are consumers of iron to a very large degree. We have nationalized our railways; all our highways are under Government control, and die States have to enter upon the construction of large and expensive bridges. The telegraph and tele-",25,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
75,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"If there isphone systems are also in the hands of the Government, and other public works in which large quantities of ironwork are used, have to be undertaken. In most other countries these enterprizes are left to private individuals. The States Governments, as a matter of fact, absorb fully one-third of the iron imported into the Commonwealth, and I therefore contend that the proposed ironworks should be under direct State management. If the States Governments can manage such large under-' takings safely be trusted to carry on the manufacture of iron. Therefore, I am prepared to pass a measure of this kind, if provision is made for placing the industry under State control. It is necessary to provide the most effective safeguards when grants are made to private individuals in the manner contemplated by the Bill. I am led to this conclusion by the study of the bonus system in Canada. The Dominion has to a greater degree than any other country built up her industries by means of bonuses. The construction of railways and the opening up of means of communication by canals has been carried out by private enterprise, assisted by large subsidies from the Government. The Dominion Government have paid £[40,000,000, the Provincial Governments £[6,600,000, and the Municipal Governments £[360,000 to private companies in order to encourage the development of industries, and to provide means of communication. This money has been spent under direct Government control. The people of Canada, however, have not the same assets that we have to show for the expenditure of money upon public works. ' In addition to these money grants, the Government have handed over 50,000,000 acres of their territory to private companies in consideration of their carrying out large public works. One of the industries which the Canadian Government have endeavoured to encourage and place upon a sound basis is the iron industry. The first bonuses were granted in 1883. They were intended to operate only for a short period, but the system has been in existence for over twenty years, and there does not seem to be the slightest disposition to bring it to an end. In fact the pressure brought to bear upon the Legislature is in the direction of extending and increasing it. In 1884, the first year during which the bonus was in operation, 44,000 dollars were paid by way of bonus for the 'production of iron. In 1891, owing to the depression which was then prevalent in the Dominion, the grant fell to 20,000 dollars, but in 1901 increased activity took place, and greater opposition was shown to the American companies, and bonuses amounting to 351,000 dollars were paid. Last year, when we were considering this question, we were informed by cable that a large syndicate had been formed to further develop the iron industry in Canada. That syndicate had a capital of £[3,600,000 and was to be subsidized by a grant of as our railways, they may £[1,000,000 on behalf of the Canadian Government. These facts bear out the contention of the honourable and learned member for Angas, that in committing ourselves to a Bill of this character, we cannot possibly measure our future liabilitie's. I have no desire to offer any factious opposition to this measure. I have already shown the extent to which Canadian industries have been assisted by the payment of bonuses. A writer in the Economist of 3rd May, 1902, deals with this aspect of the question. He says:It is scarcely necessary to say that a good deal of corruption in Dominion, provincial, and municipal affairs is engendered by this system. ' The subsidy is almost always "" m i l k e d "" by the politicians who grant it, whilst the contractor, whose profit comes from construction, and sometimes, too, by handling the bonds, takes care of those in and out of Parliament who may be disposed to question the wisdom of developing the country in this fashion. It is only right to add, however, that the best men on both sides of politics would like to see the whole business abandoned. Unfortunately, the promoters and contractors have made a great many people believe that subsidies are necessary to enable us to keep step in material advancement with the United States, an argument which every ,census shows to be fallacious, and which, at best, is merely saying that it is right to do evil that good may come. I enter my protest against legislation of this character. In Committee, I shall endeavour to secure the allocation of this grant to the States Governments. Failing that, I reserve to myself the right to take a hostile stand towards the Bill at a later stage.' Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume) -In introducing this measure on the 23rd March, I made rather a lengthy speech, and quoted many statistics. I intended upon this oca casion to reply at length to many speeches which have since been made, and particularly to some which were delivered this morning. But, in view of the short period of time at our disposal, I think that I shall best be consulting the interests of the measure, if I condense my remarks as much as possible. I wish especially to refer to one or two matters which were touched upon by the honourable member for Grey, who denounced the bonus system as it has been applied to the industry in America and Canada, and particularly the latter country. But I should like honourable members to recollect that, even if a considerable sum of money has been expended in developing the production of iron in those countries, the result has been to establish a gigantic industry. The iron industry at Pittsburg is the largest in the world; but it could never have attained its present proportions had it not been for the assistance rendered by the Government by way of bonus, and a protective duty. It is true that in Canada, during the last twelve or eighteen months, it has been found necessary to prevent the gradual reduction of the bonus; but it should be remembered I5ETUKN showing the Ijrroim into the Commonwealth during the years 1899-1903, inclusive, of IROX and STEEL in all forms, manufactured or unmanufactured.

Sir William Lyne. that that country is still only supplying itself with the iron it requires for machinery and other purposes. The iron industry there has become a great industry, which is giving employment to a large number of artisans. In Australia, I venture to say that if the industry could be started, irrespective of whether it costs us little or much-the result would be to the advantage of the community, not only from the point of view of wealth, but from the stand-point of the employment which it would offer. I hold in my hand a return which I obtained from the Customs Department some time ago-and which should therefore be reliable-showin g the value of the imports of iron into Australia since 1899. I am inclined to think that thefigureswhich it contains will startle some honourable members. The return, which is a lengthy one, is complete in every respect.

I must deprecate the condition into which the Committee has fallen. The amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is certainly not an amendment of principle. All that he has said in support, of it was advanced by him on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and I would remind him that there are other clauses on which he might reasonably take action to defeat the principle to which he is so strongly opposed. It seems to me to be a gross waste of time to be considering amendments of the short title of the Bill. It merely serves to show that in these beyond the second-reading stage, and I do the last hours of the session the Committee and the House generally is not in a proper frame of mind to deal with such important legislation. piomise was made that the Bill should not be taken beyond the second-reading stage would be fully justified in moving that prowith those who take exception to the gress be reported; for undoubtedly the Prime Minister informed the House yesterday that it was intended only to secure the second reading of the Bill, and not to pass it through the Committee stage. If a motion to report progress were moved, I should support it, notwithstanding that I voted for the second reading of the Bill. I think that we have done as much as we can during this session, so far as the consideration in these circumstances we have not had an of this measure is concerned, and that it is undesirable that the time of the Committee should be wasted in discussing amendments on which no question of principle is involved. I admire the outspokenness of the honourable member for New England, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa; but, as they had a full opportunity during the .second-reading debate to express the strong views which they 'hold on this question, they have no right to block the consideration of the measure by means of dilatory motions. It is open to either of them to move that progress be reported, and why should we waste time, as we have been doing, when we might dispose of the business for this afternoon, and return to our homes ? the honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Werriwa to refrain from moving inconsequential amendments, which serve only to make this House look ridiculous in the eyes of the people. There are other clauses dealing with important questions of principle, on which they might rightly take action, if they desired to do so; but they certainly ought nor to persist in their present line of conduct, which is calculated to make themselves the laughing stock of the whole community. That the Chairman do now leave the Cfiair, report progress, and ask leave to sit again. It would be idle to continue this debate, in view of the temper of the Committee.

191,Mr Salmo N (Laanecoorie),"I desireBILL. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland-Minister of Trade and Customs) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. ThisB ill has been sent to us from the Senate,where it was carefully considered. It is framed upon the lines of the Merchandise Marks Act which was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1887. That Act has, on several occasions, formed the subject of inquiry by Committees of the House of Commons, but no important alterations have been recommended or made, with the exception that Customs entries have been included among trade descriptions. I might point out that legislation upon the lines of this Act has been adopted in almost every portion of the British Empire, including all the Australian States except Queensland. The administration in the States has not, however, been uniform, and the object of the Bill is to consolidate the legislation, and to bring it under a central administration for the whole Commonwealth. eminently practical and useful character. It is very simple in terms, and, so far as I can see, it contains very little of a contentious nature. The measure does not make it imperative that every manufacturer or importer, or other person having goods to sell, shall' mark his goods. Perfect liberty is given to sell goods without any distinctive trade mark or description of any kind, but the Bill requires that if goods are marked in any way they must be truthfully described. The marks must not be misleading with regard to the quality of the goods, the materials from which they are manufactured, their place of origin, or in any other respect. For instance, under this legislation, it would not be legal for any person to mark as "" woollen,"" goods which in reality contain, as is often the case, 40 or 50 per cent, of cotton. Further, it would not be legal to mark reels of cotton as containing 100 yards, when in reality they contain only seventy or eighty yards. The same thing applies to the place of origin of goods. For instance, it would not be competent for any person to import goods having a brand upon them which would induce the public to believe that they were made in Sydney or Melbourne, even though they might have been made in a town bearing the same name in' some other country. It is not sufficient MARK S that the marks shall be truthful in that respect, but they must not be misleading. If goods imported from abroad are marked with the name borne by some town in the Commonwealth they must also bear the name of the country in which the place of manufacture is situated. Clause4 is very important, inasmuch as it contains definitions which considerably extend the application of the provisions of the Bill. Two kinds of trade marks are referred to. That is, any trade mark registered within any portion of the Commonwealth, or in the mother country, and also any trade mark that is used, but not registered. It is quite common for manufacturers to use distinctive marks which are not registered, but are well known. These' are protected by the provisions of the Bill to the same extent as if they were registered. TheB ill provides that persons making use of a false trade description shall'be liable to a penalty. "" Trade description "" is defined as any description, statement, indication, or suggestion, direct or indirect, which is misleading or untrue in any respect in regard to the goods to which it is applied or made. The Bill is of an Further, a Customs entry is also made a ""trade description,"" and an incorrect description of goods in such entry would render a person liable under the Bill. Clause5 applies entirely to the forgery of registered trade marks, which, as explained before, mean marks which are legally registered under any Act. Clauses6 and 7 relate to the manner in which a mark shall be deemed to be applied, and it may be remarked that, according to the decisions given under the English Act, a person who invoices goods under an incorrect designation, Or mark, is taken to have applied the same. Clause8 apples to the false use of trade marks. The next clause is an important one, inasmuch as it makes it penal to use any trade mark in an improper way, or to apply any false description to any goods, and throws the burden of proving innocence upon the person who applies the mark or description. Clause 10 deals with persons who may not themselves have actually committed an offence under the preceding clause, but who may sell or expose for sale, or have in their possession for sale, or for the purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which a false description has been applied. Clause 1.1 relates to the importation of goods with false marks. Clause 12 is a new one, and applies the ' same conditions to exports as are applied under That provision is intended to prevent any manufacturer or owner of goods from exporting goods under any false trade mark or misleading description as to their character or quality. In fact, it is exactly the same provision that is applicable under existing legislation to imports. which has a false brand upon the box? apply to any false description of any commodity exported. The object of the clause is to protect the honest manufacturer, the honest trader, and also the consuming public, either here or abroad. It is hoped that its effect will be to establish a reputation for Australian products, and prevent the damage of Australian trade by unscrupulous persons. posed to make it worth w hile to be honest? r ders any person, or any accessory, even when the act is committed outside Australia, liable to a penalty. Clause 14 is another of the most important provisions in the B ill. Its object is to prevent a person from using the name of a manufactory or producing place within the Commonwealth, or within the British Empire, with the object of misleading. goods to which a false trade description has been applied, and goods bearing the name of a place situated in Australia without qualification, or foreign-made goods with a British name upon them, without similar qualification. emphasizes this, by prohibiting use of any name which is similar to the Australian name of a place unless there is_ complete evidence as to the country in which such place is situated. The next clause applies in the same way to places in the British Dominions. Clause 17 enables all the powers of the Customs officers ancl Customs Act to be applied to imported goods referred to in clause 14. Clause 18 enables the Customs, when there is no evidence that the importer has been in any way concerned in the illegality, to deliver up the goods imported, and clause 19 contains a similar provision in regard to goods exported. These provisions are intended to protect an innocent person from punishment for an unintentional error. PartI V . of the Bill refers to legal proceedings, and is in harmony with legislation which already prevails both in England' and the 13 D 2 different States. Consequently, it does not existing legislation to imports. call for any special comment. Clause 35 is of importance, inasmuch as it provides that when goods are sold with a trade description, the vendor shall be deemed to give a warranty that the goods are as described, unless he voluntarily, and in writing at the time of the sale, expresses otherwise to the vendee. It is a moat important provision. Clause 36 provides for making regulations for giving effect to It will the various provisions of the Bill. I do not think that there is much of a contentious nature in this measure; it is a very useful and practical one, and I trust that the House will allow it to pass its second reading without undue delay. it is necessary for me to 'say much in regard to this Bill, except that I am heartily in sympathy with its object. The only doubt which I entertain is, whether our powers under the Constitution are comprehensive enough to allow of efficient treatment of a subject of this character. There is an element of doubt as to whether we are empowered to legislate to the f u l l extent in regard to false descriptions of goods as distinct from trade marks, as they are conventionally understood. Another question may arise as to how far we are justified in attempting to deal with It classes as prohibited goods all false descriptions of goods manufactured in one State, which it is not attempted to export from that State. However, I am inclined to go as far as the Constitution will allow us to go in that direction. I think that the public throughout the ComClause 15 further monwealth are not only in favour of this the kind of legislation, but that they would welcome any attempt to comprehensively deal with the subject in a measure which would minimize, if not to prevent absolutely, the troubles which have arisen in this connection. There is no doubt that, in regard to importedand in a lesser degree in regard to some classes of manufactured goodsa great deal of misrepresentation exists. Some of it has been of an innocent character, but some of it has exercised a very detrimental effect upon the purchaser. I feel sure that everybody will welcome this legislation, and I trust that the Bill will be placed upon the statute-book this session. wish to express my pleasure that the Government, even at this late stage of the session, have given the House an",37,Personal Explanation

The measure has been hung up for several months, and I should have been glad if we had been afforded opportunity of dealing with it. aware that other business has had to take precedence of it; but I do not know that we have not wasted time in discussing measures which it was never intended should be passed-time devoted to a consideration of' this The remarks which were made yesterday concerning another measure might very reasonably be applied to this. It is another instance of the wisdom and necessity of the public conscience being applied in some way as an antidote to the commercial immorality of the present day. Anybody who has read-and I suppose most honourable members have done so-the .extent to which fraud has crept into the ordinary affairs of commercial life, must be surprised that the confiding public, which pays an honest price for what it conceives to be honest goods, has had foisted upon it from time to time goods which are not in any sense what they are described to be. In nearly all instances, it is the poorest class of the community who suffer most, because its members have to purchase the cheapest goods. The individual who can afford to pay top prices for everything generally escapes, although I am not sure that he is altogether free from this evil. But the poorer man, who has to carefully study the expenditure of every penny, suffers considerably by .such practices as this Bill is intended, in some degree at least, to cure. Some time ago I had the privilege of conversing with a gentleman who, during the past two years, has been engaged in commercial pursuits. a commercial occupation late in life, he expressed astonishment that in almost every department of the business in which he is engaged, he met with fraud and misrepresentation. He said, "" The commercial life of this city is hollow and rotten from top to bottom. I had no idea, when I entered this business, that I should find so much fraud and pretence."" perhaps, 'have observed in an newspaper upon this subject, to read. discount a good deal of what is published in the English press concerning any class in Australia, because as a rule its reflections are cast upon the political party with which I am associated, and the particular Mr Corf enter. section of the community to which' I belong. But it occasionally happens that it is impartial in its condemnation. Hence an earlier I find the following passage in the MorningI am Post, which, as honourable members are aware, is a Conservative journal:Fraud and trickery of the meanest and most despicable kind permeate the -commercial life of the country, and this re-acts in turn upon those which might fairly have been representatives in national and municipal instiBill. tutions who are elected by the votes of these disreputable citizens. That journal comes to the conclusion that where corruption exists in commercial life it must also exist in political life. I hope that that is not true. Indeed, I believe that the passing of this Bill will, at least, afford evidence that we are desirous of 1 putting down these evil practices. The Pall Mall Gazette, in writing upon the same question, says:At one time in England we were accustomed to look for commercial brigandage and acts of dishonesty that would disgrace the scum of.Whitechapel among those Armenian merchants who carried on the Levant trade with England. Today, we are sorry to state, the Armenian is outstripped by the Melbourne British Customs thief. It is humiliating to think that Australia is peopled by the British race. Fortunately for society, the working classes and the farmers are taking a deeper interest in the political life .of the country. Although no party has lived through more abuse than the Labour Party, still it 'contains and has for supporters in the country, the cnly stable elements in society. Their ideals are purity of public and municipal life. The Minister who has introduced this Bill is a farmer's representative. The revelations which have recently been made, not through the fault of the farmers, but through the fault of those who have had dealings with them, show that our export tradeHaving entered upon particularly the Victorian butter export trade-ha s suffered a good deal, and may suffer much more as the result of fraudulent practice. I am particularly pleased that this Bill is designed in some degree to prevent a continuation of that practice. Evidence has been forthcoming that even in the export of butter the practice of fraud has crept in to such an extent that after a farmer has supplied a first-class Honourable members may, article to the agent, it has been taken out of English the box, and an inferior article substisome statements bearing tuted. Honourable members scarcely need which I propose to be reminded that such practices must I am quite prepared to exercise a bad effect upon our trade, and they certainly should not be permitted to continue. There is another point to which I must briefly allude. I am pleased that the Bil l contains provision not only against fraud on the part of manufacturers and importers, not only to encourage honesty in this class, but to give the public an opportunity to judge whether goods offered for sale have been (manufactured or produced under favorable conditions of labour. In asking for protection for the manufacturer and the importer the Government cannot very well refuse to demand similar assistance to the wage earners engaged in producing their wares. The introduction of what is known as the trades union label is justifiable on every ground, and I trust that that, part of the Bill which deals with the question, as well as the rest of the meacontentious provision. sure, will have the unqualified support not only of the Government but of the whole House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn. the Prime Minister might well indicate what business he intends to take on Tuesday next. I suggest for his consideration that it might be possible to deal not only with the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill, but with the Trade Marks Bill. The rieht honourable gentleman said that, if possible, he would deal with the measure if. there were no likelihood of a long debate. tentious provision in it. of the Trade Marks Bill is a. somewhat contentious one, but. it is quite possible that honourable members would agree to come to a vote upon it without any lengthy debate. I think it is very improbable-althoug h I speak, of course, with some reservation upon the matter-that we shall be able to reap the full advantages of the international union with regard to patents laws generally until our trade marks legislation is put on' the same footing with our general patent law. If that be so, it is highly desirable that a Trade Marks Bill, as complex rnentary to the Commonwealth Patent Act, should be passed during the present session instead of its consideration being delayed until the secona session of the Parliament. Until such a measure shall have been passed our inventors must be deprived of the advantage of the seven months' protection which would accrue to them under the International Patent Union. referring to the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill or the other ?

The point I have just mentioned constitutes an additional reason why some effort should be made to pass that measure .before the session closes. to take a vote upon it without any lengthy debate. members might be absent, and I do not think the Bill should be dealt with unless the contentious provision referred to is dropped. should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will endeavour to set apart some time next week for the consideration of the motion relating tp Old-age Pensions, and one or two other matters in the list of private members' business ? the state of business in another place, it is probable that this House may sit a little longer than is at present anticipated. In that event, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister would have any objection to bring the message from the Senate with reference to the tobacco monopoly under the heading of Government business, and to allow us to devote any spare hour that we mav have to its consideration.

I should also like to give some time to the further consideration of the Manufacturers Encouragement Bill in Committee, if there is any chance of OUT .doing useful work in that direction. A'certain Division has been included in the Trade Marks Bill, -which is entirely foreign to an ordinary measure relating to trade marks. view of the Government.

But that is one thing to which honourable members are not prepared to consent, even in regard to matters on which they do not entertain strong convictions. Those who .had a strong objection to the part of the Bill to which I have referred would, at this last Stage of the session, when there is not a full opportunity to consider contentious matters, certainly decline to take a vote without discussion, and the consideration of the matter might, therefore,, lead to only a waste of time. That would seem, judging from to-day's proceedings, to be the position with reference to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. The time to pass any measure is now so limited that it almost offers a premium to honourable members to throw difficulties in the way of the passing of measures to which they have very strong objection. I am anxious to make the best use of the time left at our disposal, and I should like to give prominence to the Preferential Trade debate. I wish to make some observations in reply to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I should like to ask the House, so far as I can see at present, to deal on Tuesday with the Sea Carriage of Goods Bill, and also lo advance the debate on the motion relating to Preferential Trade another stage.
