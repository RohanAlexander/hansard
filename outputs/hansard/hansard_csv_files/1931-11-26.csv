8,Mr Sctjllin (Yarra,"Prime Ministhis time of depression it is not desirable that the country should be in the turmoil of a general election for a long period; and, secondly, that to extend the date of the election beyond the 19th December would be to carry the campaign over the Christmas and New Year holidays, probably to the 9th or the 16th January, thereby interfering with the Christmas trade. In the interests of Australia generally-au d that should be our first consideration-th c Government has made what it considers to be the best arrangement. The time allowed is practically the same as for the last general election campaign. It will not be possible to have the same dates for the issue of the writs and the receiving of nominations for the Senate as for the House of Representatives, although the polling day will be the same, because in some States the law requires notice for the issue of writs. In Soutli Australia the period is nine clays, and in Western Australia and Tasmania seven days; in the other States there is no time limit. The issue of writs for the Senate is in the hands of the State Governors. In New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland the respective electoral dates for the Senate will be the same as for the House of Representatives. Western Australia and Tasmania, provided the necessary proclamations can be issued to-day, as the Government has requested, the writs for the Senate will be issued ou the 3rd December, and nominations will .be receivable until the 10th December, while in South Australia the respective dates will be the 5th and the 12th December. In all States the'polling day for both Houses will be the 19th December. The dates tentatively tet down for the Senate may be altered, should advice be received that in any State the message from the Governor General to the State Governor has uot been received in time to permit of the writ being issued to-day. We shall not meet again in this -hamber before Christmas, and when the new Parliament assembles we may not all be members of it. Whatever our political differences, I feel, Mr Speaker, that all honourable members would desire me to express their appreciation of the way in ilr. Scullin. which you have presided over this Parliament for the past two years. your impartiality has ever been doubted by any honourable member iu any part of the House. It may be that at times your ruling has been disagreed with, but that has been duo not to any doubt a3 to your impartiality, but to an honest' difference of opinion. I do not think that any honourable member questions your capacity for the important and onerous duties falling to your lot as presiding oflicer. The Chairman of Committees also has laboured long, especially during the discussion on the tariff, and has given his rulings impartially, in accordance with the Standing Orders. He has been industrious and assiduous in the performance of his duties. Prom time to time he has been ably assisted by willing Temporary Chairmen, drawn from both sidus of tlie House. Although on many occasions Parliament has expressed its appreciation of the work of the Clerks of the House, I feel that we should again express our gratitude for their unfailing courtesy, marked ability, and impartiality in the performIn ance of their duties. The same may be said of Hansard-tlia t faithful band of men who record more than faithfully the utterances of honourable members. To the staff generally-th o attendants, messengers, and others who wait upon us and make our work congenial-as well as to the staff of the library for their efficient and enthusiastic assistance, we tender our thanks. Last, but not least, I mention the officers of the various administrative departments who have been in attendance many long ancl weary hours while the debates have been in progress, and have been most helpful to all of us. We are fortunate in that in the members of the Public Service we have men who will work. as loyally for one Government as for another, and I feel sure that there is not one private member who has gone to them for assistance and been refused it. I speak with some knowledge of the Federal Public Service -and I have no reason to doubt that the same is true of the Public Services of",13,Adjournment Election Dates Valedictory
9,Mr Scullin,"I do not think that the States-whe n I say that it is au efficient, loyal body of officers. To honourable members generally, whatever my wishes for them politically may be, I extend the best wishes for a happy Christmas and a better New Year than we have experienced for some time. behalf of the members of the Opposition I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, and express to you, sir, our appreciation of the ability, the impartiality, the firmness and the courage which you have invariably displayed during your occupancy of the eminent position of Speaker. I also desire to thank the Chairman of Committees, and those honourable members who have acted as Temporary Chairmen, for their able services. No honourable member can cavil at tlie way in which those gentlemen have presided over the proceedings of this chamber. To the Clerk, the Clerk Assistants, and other officials of the House, I express the thanks of honourable members for the high quality of the service that they have rendered, while to the departmental heads and other officers mentioned by the Prime Minister we are also grateful. We know that these officers are entirely impartial in their service, that party does not enter into their consideration; and that they are loyal to the Government that is in power, and to the Commonwealth which they serve with such marked ability. I agree with the Prime Minister that we owe more thanks to Hansard than to anybody else. In regard to honourable members generally, I echo the remarks of thc Prime Minister. WhateverI and my colleagues may desire politically, I say quite conscientiously that,'personally, no honourable member in this House deserves other than the best wishes from his fellow members for a happy Christmas and New Year. Politically, we are entering upon what may be termed a close season for fellowship, but before it begins we exchange cordial good wishes, which I and my colleagues extend also to the people of the Commonwealth. Ur. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [5.28] On behalf of members of the Country party I desire to express appreciation of the manner in which you, Mr Speaker, have presided over the affairs of this chamber during the past two years. I endorse the remarks of those who have preceded me as to your impartiality, your courage, and the able way in which you have carried out the important duties of your high office. I congratulate you, sir, on the study that you have applied to parliamentary practice and to precedents, in thc endeavour to preserve due order during our deliberations. My colleagues and I have not always agreed with your rulings, but the approaching festive season precludes a reference to anything of a contentious nature. I also congratulate the Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen for the excellent work that they have performed during their period of office. My colleagues and I regret exceedingly that, the accident that occurred to the Chairman of Committees some few years ago, unfortunately, made him slightly deaf on this side, which was occasionally noticeable during the term of this Parliament. I particularly desire to express the appreciation of members of the Country party for the capable manner in which the Clerk, his assistant, and those who are engaged in transcribing our speeches -the members of the Hansard department-hav e carried out their diuius. We have laboured consistently and earnestly during the past two years, perhaps with a result that is not very apparent. However, that does not detract from the endeavours of those officers. We hope that they, and honourable members generally, may spend a very happy Christmas. I express the wish that the New Year will be a pleasant one, not only for honourable members and those associated with this Parliament, including departmental officers, but for the people of Australia as a whole, and particularly for tliose who are at present out of work and destitute. cordially in the felicitations that have been expressed.

We are on the eve of an election which has been precipitated by party jealousy and discord. Yesterday the Opposition were able to ensnare those supporters of the Lang plan known as the Beasley group, and use them to serve their purpose. It has been claimed that Parliament ia being dissolved as the result of a challenge that was thrown out by the Prime Minister, and with the desire to call the bluff of the Beasley group. That is merely an excuse. electors in the near future, the issue will not be the dispute between the Langites and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) about how certain money should be distributed. There is no suggestion that the Government manipulated the distribution of money for relief work in my electorate. Only recently I was in Adelaide and saw a queue stretched from the post office right along King William-street, consisting of men whose presence there was a protest against and a refutation of the statement that they did not want to work, but desired to live on the dole. They gave the lie direct to that insinuation. What is this Parliament offering to those unfortunate people for the months to come? There has not been any proposal that the hours of labour should be shortened to provide a better distribution of the work that is available. I hope earnestly that at the forthcoming election we shall be able to throttle the financial oligarchy that has refused to do the job before it. Men have worked themselves out of jobs, simply because saturation point has been reached. There are not sufficient jobs available for Yates), who will, I hope, be returned at those who seek employment; the position must be readjusted. That will be the elecmajority, for having mentioned the tion issue in my constituency. I stand for a fair and reasonable living for every human being in the community.

We are really going to the country not on that issue, but on an issue which involves the provision of ways and means for the finding of work for nearly a half of a million people in a country opulent with wealth. We have heard on other occasions that our national income has fallen by £200,000,000, but on this occasion no oue has drawn attention to the fact that since that statement was made our national income has risen by £100,000,000, nor has attention been directed to the fact that unemployment has not decreased in proportion to When I face my the increase in the national wealth. I endorse the felicitous remarks that have been made; but I also have some consideration for the poor devils in this community to whom this Christmas will be the worse in their experience. I hope that they will never have another of the same kind. -Having served more years in parliamentary life than any other honourable member in this House, I take this opportunity of asking whether it is not possible to make Parliament a much better machine than it is at pz'esent. I have not occupied much of the time of this Parliament in the making of speeches, for I have realized that my chief and his party have faced great difficulties, and I have, therefore, kept quiet. I do not know whether I have been right or wrong in so doing. For 39 years I was very closely associated with the unemployed of this country; but when a man reaches the age of 77 years, he feels that the burden of this work should_ be left to younger men. I thank, the honorahle member for Adelaide( Mr the coming election with a very large plight of these unfortunate people. Of you, Mr Speaker, I wish to say that I have been a keen admirer. I loved you, as one man may love another, when I first met you, and we have become firm friends. No Speaker, in my experience,",15,Honourable Membebs Hear Hear
12,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.36].,"has held the scales more evenly than you. In fact, few have even approachedyour standard in that respect. Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen have all done their work splendidly. I have always admired the men who record our speeches, and on many occasions I have had to thank them for furnishing a better report of my speeches than was deserved. I think most honourable members could say that. Of the other officials of the House, whether messengers or highly paid servants, I wish to say that no body of men could have been more loyal or dutiful, irrespective of whichever political party happened to be in power. But machine that it should be? I unhesiput a man in his place there to do his tatingly answer "" No."" There is a revulwork.

It would make available only time. All private memhers should be attached to public departments. We The have twelve Ministers and Assistant Ministers. I believe that it would be wise to divide the number of private members of Parliament evenly among the departments they administer, and oblige every member of the Senate and the House of Bepresentatives to give six hours' service a day for five days a week in the department to which he is attached. This would be of help to the departments. It would be a good thing, too, if the example of the former Prime Minister, Mr S. M . Bruce, were followed. When that right honourable gentleman became Prime Minister, he withdrew his attention from the soft goods is Parliament the splendid business in which he was interested, and 1.

What good, in God's name, would that do? In Great Britain the Government provides every week 15s. for every woman, and 17s. for every man out of work. I come now to a consideration of Australia House. Oan any one defend the expenditure of £1,000,000 on that building and the land on which it stands? And for what? God only knows; I do not know myself. I have been in England three times, and I never met a man who could give any sound reason why we should go on maintaining that institution. It has cost over £1,000,000 to maintain since it was built. We are shortly to have an election. Why could we not place before the electors, by way of referendum, one single question, asking whether or not they favoured the continuation of Australia House. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) has on the notice paper a motion for the abandonment-of Canberra, which is a financial ulcer, draining the resources of Australia; the world. yet the people have no opportunity to put an end to it. No opportunity is provided for the discussion of that niotion, because the rights of private members have been taken away from them. There is also my motion on the noticehonorable member is a master, he enpaper regarding thc institution of the initiative, the referendum and the recall. Of this I speak with all reverence, as if I were indeed in the presence of my Maker. created anything His equal. He never allowed any created thing to make itself His equal. Why should the citizens of Australia, whose creature this Parliament is, be compelled to accept Parliament as something greater than themselves? On one day in three years they control Parliament, and on that day only. every day in the year. to my constituents for the last 42 years thc right to drag me out of Parliament at one day's notice, provided a demand, signed by ono over half the number who voted for me, is served upon me. we ever have the referendum, initiative and recall, there will be no need for these absurd elections. A member Dr. Moloney. could keep his place in the House only if he were of good behaviour, and honoured the pledges he made to his constituents. The constantly recurring expense of elections would be avoided. I strongly object, to the rights of private members being filched from them. Private members from all parts of the House have tabled motions in thc vain hope that they would be afforded an opportunity of speaking to them. I intend to ask the electors from the platform not to vote for any candidate unless he will give his constituents the power to recall him in the event of his not honouring his pledges. I shall say to the electors that they, the creators of Parliament, should have the power to control Parliament. When the people have that power they will not allow any Government, whether Labour, Nationalist, Country or Liberal, to leave 400,000 men, women and childrenin need of food and shelter in a continent that grows moVe food in proportion to its population than any other continent in I should not have spoken were it not for one or two statements made by the honorstatements which I cannot allow to go unchallenged.

Instead of shedding crocodile tears over the lot of thc unemployed, the honourable member for Adelaide would have done better had he, during the last two years, used his influence and his vote to induce the Government to do something to relieve unemployment. It is in bad taste for the honourable member, now that everything is in the melting pot, to try to make an issue out of the unemployment problem. I take it that honourable members will put their platform before the electors in due course. The members of the group to which I belong will not be backward in doing so, and we have a very definite policy for the soludone so at this stage of the proceedings. tion of the unemployment problem. We will state that policy clearly and unequivocally, so that, all who hear or read it will be able to understand it. Our policy statement will not be loaded with a superfluous verbiage which might he made to mean anything. There will be about it no ambiguity behind which we can shelter when asked to stand by our pledges. The honourable member for Adelaide endeavoured, I think, to create the impression that the members of the group to which I belong were in some way lacking in sympathy with the unemployed. If we had been able to see any hope that the Government would do something to relieve the distress and want from which so many thousands of citizens are suffering, we would have been prepared to condone even some measure of maladministration in order that it might carry out its policy. It was because for two years we had had from the Government nothing but vacillation and exhibitions of hopeless ineptitude that we decided to take the step we did, being quite indifferent whether the Government remained, in office or not. matters little to the unemployed whether the present Government remains in office, or the Opposition is returned. will have a bitter experience. from the bitter experience of the last two years.

AVe are anxious that our opinions shall be known throughout the country. ""We are not asking for any privilege which is not extended to any other party.

It is of great satisfaction to this Parliament to know that its presiding officer has its respect and entire confidence, ancl, furthermore, that he upholds the highest traditions of British parliamentary institutions. I express my indebtedness to the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant, and the members of the reporting staff for the consideration that they have shown to me. I have not been sufficiently long in Parliament to feel quite comfortable in carrying out the duty that is imposed upon me, and I should be lacking in recognition of the help I have received if I failed to express my great indebtedness to those who have assisted me. To honourable members opposite, in particular, I give my good wishes. I admire them for the part that they have played in the public life of this country. I differ from them, but I believe that our differences are useful to the community, because they permit this great nation to make the best choice between candidates for the well-being of the country. I hope that they will have a happy and prosperous Christmas, in which their constituents will share. I hope, too, that my constituents will be bappy and prosperous, and that they may think their happiness and prosperity are associated Parliament. [6.2] I wish to join with other honourable members in paying my tribute to you, Mr Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, and the officers of the House. My object in rising is to impress upon the Government the great necessity, in view of the fact that we are to have a rush election, for allowing all parties the freedom of the air. At election time, and particularly during a record short campaign, the people of Australia want to know more than they do at any other time about the issues that have to be determined, and if there is any undue restriction upon the use. of the air, it will be very unfair to them and to the parties which will suffer as a result of foolish interference with the liberty that belongs watching the admirable manto all political parties. I am not speakin which you have preing with any knowledge of what may be the Government's intention, but in view of the fact that this will be the last opportunity that honourable members on this side of the House will have of placing their views before the Government on this important subject, I earnestly hope, and I think, that all honourable members on this side will join with me, that the Government will be as generous as possible to all parties, and not take up thc stand that only its supporters, and say, the official opposition, shall have the right to address the people over the air through the A class broadcasting stations. During the recent election in Great Britain practically the whole of the publicity, and all the policy speeches were put to the people over the air. It has now become the recognized practice in all countries that have established well organized broadcasting systems, to allow the utmost freedom, not only to political parties, but also to candidates, in placing their views before the electors. This country has not reached the stage at which candidates can expect to be given that privilege, but we certainly can expect that any party",19,Honourable Membebs Hear Hear

In the coming election we shall have practically three weeks' campaign, which will make it utterly impossible for country members to travel throughout their electorates and personally place their views before their constituents. It will he comparatively simple for the representatives of metropolitan constituencies to get into contact with their electorates.

The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and his associates must feel gratified to know that their action has deprived the waterside workers of this country of privileges which the present Government gained for them. They entered into a combination with the Opposition which madethat possible, ancl I feel that it is only right that we should remind them that what has happened is clue to their action. -With profound gratitude, I acknowledge the most generous references that have been made to the service which I have rendered during my 'occupancy of the Speakership. It is with intense satisfaction that, at the conclusion of my term of oflice, I have heard the expressions of confidence aud goodwill of honourable members of all parties. this Parliament' there have been moments of agitation and periods of strain, and I am proud that honourable members have been, kind enough to say that I have worthily upheld the tradition of the high office which I have occupied for two years. I thank them for their assistance at all times, and their compliance with my requests from the chair. My period of office has been one of the most delightful experiences of my life.
