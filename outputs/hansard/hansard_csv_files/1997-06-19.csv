I do so because I was struck yesterday by what I believed was the total and utter disinterest displayed by the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) when he got up to answer some of the questions raised by us on this side of the House. He responded quite clearly and, I believe, quite precisely to all of the matters raised by myself and my colleagues in the debate surrounding his health portfolio, but he studiously avoided responding to any of my comments regarding the pitiful amount of money the government has now set aside for the national drugs strategy in this budget. The minister also refused to comment on the growing amount of calls for a national drug summit. In relation to the national drug strategy, I will not shrink from admitting that the program has had a real reduction in budgetary support almost every year since it was initiated by the Hawke Labor government in 1985. It is a disappointment and I do not deny that. What concerns me, however, is that at a time when Australia is awash with drugs, or more precisely when it is sinking under the weight of the drug trade, particularly heroin, we can little afford further cuts to the national drug strategy. It displays a total and utter disregard for our current predicament. It is either that, or it is because this government is simply blase or unaware of the scale of the drug emergency which our country now faces. Reducing the funding for the national drug strategy to $33 million, as indicated here in the appropriation bills, when close to $4 billion is taken in by government in excise and taxes on tobacco and alcohol-something I brought up again yesterday-is really a contemptuous joke. To quote the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), the Minister for Health's learned medical colleague, it is completely 'tokenistic'.",118,Slorc Each Time A Cameraman Appeared Where Action Must Be Taken To Secure The
335,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 9.45 A.m.,,121,Representatives Main Committee
336,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (9.45 A.m.),"I will be brief. I would like to return to a subject5900 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 It makes me want to tear my hair out when I see that, in the past fortnight, three more people have died of drug overdoses on the streets of my community. As I said yesterday, kids of 11 and 12 are now shooting up in our car parks, our public toilets and our back alleyways, yet this government is allocating $1 billion to what I can only describe as whistles and balloons for our federation celebrations and only $33 million to help save people from the ravages of drugs, both legal and illegal. It is an absolute disgrace. I believe that while the Minister for Health was ducking the government's commitment to the national drugs strategy, he was also studiously avoiding responding to calls I made during the debate in detail for a national drugs summit; calls, I might add, which have been made with increased urgency not only by myself but also by various other individuals and organisations around this country. By other individuals and groups, I mean the directors of public prosecutions of New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria; the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australian College of Physicians and various members of this House, on both sides of the parliament, I might add. I must admit I was quite shocked when I read in the Australian yesterday that a spokesperson for the Minister for Health responded to the Australian Medical Association's call for a national drug summit by saying such a meeting would be nothing but a 'talkfest' and would achieve 'zilch'. I believe that is disgraceful arrogance from the minister's office. The minister may want to have a chat to his spokesperson about 'talkfests'. While people are dying from drug related deaths at record levels, not just in Cabramatta, but all over Australia. I said yesterday during this debate that something like 1,182 people died in 1995the government has no problems spending that $40 million on the ultimate in talkfests, the constitutional convention. Meanwhile, our Minister for Health and our Prime Minister( Mr Howard) cannot see fit to providing the impetus to solving our nation's terrible drug tragedy by convening a national summit. They just cannot see how a national summit would provide national consensus, would plot new directions and would produce new strategies to deal with this drug problem. I say to the minister that I do not make this request for petty political purposes. I do not make this request in order to make him or the government look bad. I make this request because I am sick of seeing kids in my area and young adults throughout south-western Sydney destroying their lives and the lives of their families because of heroin abuse. The nation's current drug policies have failed. They are not about to get better. I put it again to the Minister for Health that discussing the recent evaluation of the national drug strategy at the Australasian Police Ministers Council and the Australian Health Ministers Conference in July this year will at best lead to change of the most marginal variety. We need dramatic change. The only way we are going to achieve that dramatic change on a national level, with national consensus, is via a national drug summit. The onus is now on the Minister for Health and particularly on the Prime Minister to swallow their misgivings and to take this step. I want to make it clear again that I am not saying that Australia's drug problem began on 2 March last year. I am not apportioning blame in regard to why Australia is currently being swamped by heroin-heroin of a level of purity never seen before in this country. WhatI am saying is that the coalition is in government now, and now is the time we need action. I repeat: the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister must act. It is not going to come about from the measly $33 million allocated to drug education in this budget. Thursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5901 consideration in detail we often tend to look at the economic side of government department spending, but I think we need to look at the human side as well. I want to speak about a letter I received from the Coburg Carers Association, from Mr Robert Laherty, who had been asked to write to the state government by members of his group because his committee had dealt with what they referred to as 'the usual complaints' the association heard: ... regarding lack of support facilities, home help cut to once a month, the abolition of almost all respite care, no respite care for carers at all, and the cut back in almost every aspect nf assistance for peap. caring for loved ones at home. He goes on to say: The Federal Government has certainly not helped our situation with the new nursing home ""entrance fees"" which has caused enormous fear and trauma to our older members tending to the needs of their lifetime partners, along with rises in prescription charges and a certain lack of awareness of our problemsHe also says: What we are concerned with is a lack of services at our public hospitals due to staff shortages and a curtailing of services offered by them due to the actions of your government. Referring to the Premier of Victoria, Mr Laherty goes on to say: On 26/1 0/96, you were featured on the front of our morning paper with the promise of millions of dollars for people in the position of carers. Our questions are these: when are we going to see any of it???? We don't want you to send us any glossy brochures telling us what you are going to do ...... We want to see what you are actually doing. We don't want to hear about committees and inquiries.... We want to know what if any new programs have begun? If so in what area???? Will councils be given access to this money for services to us?? .. What are you doing? Has any of the money been spent yet? ..... If so on what? Our council home help has been slashed to once a month. Two hours once a month is an absolute disgrace. Do not tell us it is local government business ... Your government devastated our local government with commissioners and cost cutting ... We spend our lives trying to provide love and all the basic human needs to our loved ones. We love them, wash them, feed them and try to treat them with dignity and respect. He concludes by saying: Your government policies and cost cutting are making our lives a complete and utter misery. That is the perspective of the Coburg Carers Association. We have heard the expression about uncaring people that they would 'sell their mothers to earn a dollar' . But what we have here, in the aged care changes, is the proposal that we should sell our mothers' homes in order to save the Howard government a dollar. You could be excused for thinking that this was an episode out of that wonderful series Mother and Son where the spineless son, Robert, endlessly worms his way out of his responsibility to his aged and confu-ed mother. In recent times we have seen concerns expressed by the Australian Catholic Health Care Association where they labelled the minister's latest proposal of a $5 a day subsidy for financially disadvantaged residents a 'cruel joke' . We have had Aged Care Australia urging the government to delay passage of its aged care legislation until there has been a full disclosure of critical information and additional funding for the proposals. In the electorate of Wills, the impact of this, which could possibly lead to closure by church and community groups of their nursing home beds, would be disastrous. There are currently about 380 beds available in Wills, of which 15 per cent are operated by church and community",121,Representatives Main Committee
337,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9.51 A.m. ),"In consideration of estimates and5902 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 groups. That number needs to increase as the population ages, but it needs to increase in an affordable way. In Wills, 14.3 per cent of the population is aged 65 or older. This is well above the average. Among 148 federal electorates, Wills ranks 30th in terms of aged population. At the same time, the electorate of Wills is not an affluent electorate: average median income there is $33,000-odd, considerably less than the national average. In Wills, there are hostel and nursing home operations confronted with that scenario of an older than average population with a growing need for facilities; yet the minister is seeking to off-load that government responsibility on to the community. I believe it will have a very adverse affect on nursing home standards in Wills and that, indeed, the aged care changes will diminish and threaten the already stressed standards in terms of aged care that we have in our area. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Social Security Proposed expenditure-$1,584,755,000-agreed to.

Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs Proposed expenditure-$2,400,635,000. express some concern about the cut in funding for labour market programs. In doing that, I would like to contrast the attitude of the previous Labor government with the attitude of the coalition government in its response to the high unemployment with which both governments were confronted. The Labor government's response to unemployment was to introduce a program of job creation and training under the Working Nation program. They attacked the problem in two ways by setting a number of targets. Firstly, they had a program of creating some 500,000 jobs in the last term of the Labor government. In fact, they exceeded that program by creating over 700,000 jobs in that period. The second target that the government set itself was to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. I believe that that government showed some character. It was prepared to put its reputation on the line by making those two commitments to reducing unemployment. By doing that, of course, there was more possibility that unemployment would be reduced. However, the current government has failed to do this. It has failed to set targets of any description in relation to reducing unemployment-other than, of course, cutting $1.8 billion from labour market programs, which is my basic concern in this presentation. But they have also asked the Australian people to be patient. First we were told that the reforms to the workplace reform legislation and the unfair dismissal legislation were going to create jobs. I recall very vividly, in the debate over last year's budget, coalition member after coalition member speaking in relation to the unfair dismissal provisions, as if that were going to be a cure-all for all our problems. Now we quite clearly see that the unfair dismissal legislation has been changed, yet there has been no alteration other than, in fact, an increase in unemployment. The Australian people have been asked to be patient and they are still waiting.",123,Representatives Main Committee
338,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (9.57 A.m.),"In speaking on this aspect of expenditure, IThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5903 We are now being asked to wait a little longer for a range of government policies to be introduced, including the GST, before the Australian people can expect any fall in unemployment. I think the danger that we all face is that we could see an improvement in the economy in many ways but a further decrease in unemployment. In other words, we could have a jobless recovery. I think this is very much a probability under this current government's policies, where it is not prepared to target job creation in many ways. In fact, all the indications are that unemployment is likely to grow during the remaining term of this government. Let me give you a few examples. A further 16,500 public service jobs will be lost in 1997-98. The defence efficiency review will mean a loss of a further 8,000 jobs, including many in regional Australia. There is restructuring in the private sector, in Telstra, Bums Philp and CSR. With BHP, we will see some 2,500 jobs disappear with no apparent concern or action by this current government. Employment in the manufacturing industry, which has been a great employer of Australians for many years, is now extremely t1at. We are expecting further cutbacks in banking and in the financial sector. Mr Paul Orton, the New South Wales based policy manager for the Australian Business Chamber, has been quoted in the press recently as saying that most investment 'means reducing rather than increasing jobs'. I emphasise: it means a reduction rather than an increase in jobs. I certainly do not believe the government is focused enough on job creation in this budget. I think a lot more finance could have been made available to help community based organisations and other organisations create jobs. The fact is that Australia's unemployed people just simply cannot wait any longer. They need relief now, not in a year or in two years. Last week's labour force figures showed a loss of 40,300 jobs in one month. (Time expired) I have major concerns with the government's direction on the issues. I refer specifically to what I regard as a non-solution to the question of creating jobs and the issue of work for the dole, which is not a real solution to the question of unemployment. I believe that youth unemployment is a major problem in Australia. But what is required is a budget strategy that is aimed at creating real jobs rather than pointing the finger, especially at the young unemployed on the basis that they are to be blamed for being unemployed, and coming up with policy options which are aimed at punishing young unemployed and their parents. I refer not just to the issues covered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs-namely, the dole diary and work for the dole-but also to the announcements this week about the youth allowance, which was worked out by agreement between DEETYA and the Department of Social Security. I regard it as highly unacceptable to basically rip away unemployment relief from people who are 18 to 20 years of age. I find it strange that we live in a civilised country such as Australia where we can vote at 18 years of age and, if necessary, join the Armed Forces and fight for Australia to defend our strong democratic system, yet at the same time the government suggests that we are dependent on our parents for relief if they earn more than $41,500 as a household, and that therefore it is up to our parents to support us if we are 18 to 20 years of age and unemployed. I think the real problem is that the government does not understand the depth of concern and despair out in the Australian community on the all-important issues of jobs and job security. Speaking about the question of work for the dole, in order to reinforce this issue, I think I should refer in passing to the performance of the new Howard government. I suppose",124,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.03 A.m.),"In speaking to this particular matter,5904 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 I should emphasise that it is no longer a new government. In fact, it is 15 months old. One would ordinarily suggest that that is probably half the lifetime of a normal parliamentary term. I can already refer today, on a regular basis, to discussions becoming if anything the order of the day from the government about the potential next election and talk of double dissolutions. People are even thinking about the next election, which is an indication that the government is in power, it is considered as the government of the day and the Australian community now expect results rather than rhetoric. The Australian community is getting concerned about the lack of performance of the government, after 15 months, on the question of jobs. They do not see work for the dole as a solution to real jobs for our young unemployed. They are concerned, for example, that the number of jobs has only risen by 86,800 in the first 15 months. Perhaps an even bigger worry to them is the fact that the number of full-time jobs has actually fallen by 700 in this period. The number of male full-time jobs has fallen by 9,900, the number of people unemployed has risen by 39,000, and the unemployment rate has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent. Last but not least, the youth unemployment rate-surprisingly, because the Prime Minister said he would be judged on this issue at the end of his first term-has risen from 27.4 per cent to 27.5 per cent. That takes me to the question of the youth allowance, which is very much an issue for debate out in the public domain at the moment. Not only is it about taking away from young unemployed their entitlement to benefits, but it is also about hiding the unemployed. That is one of the real thrusts about it. They have all of a sudden realised that they are not producing the goods with respect to access to real jobs, so we now have changes to the definition of part-time and full-time work and the introduction of a new youth allowance which is all about hiding-from the Department of Social Security's point of view-the number of young unemployed. It is about time the government faced up to the fact that work for the dole is not a real solution to unemployment. Two days on and five days off does not do a lot for a young person's dignity. What their parents are saying is that they want five days on and two days off. They actually want a definite proposal which requires their young people to front up to a reasonable labour market program with an emphasis on training and a commitment to work; one that really works and achieves the discipline of work. (Time expired) aspects of the 1997-98 budget in the portfolio of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and then discuss in some detail the areas where I do not think this budget goes far enough. The increase in funding for schools is to be commended, as is this government's focus on improving literacy standards for Australian school children. The government's national literacy and numeracy plan is to be commended-my literacy is not too good at the moment, I will stretch my mouth a bit-because getting these basics right is one of the most important roles of our education system. however, whether the emphasis should be on the testing of literacy and numeracy rather than on improved teaching of these skills in the earliest years of schooling. I think that is where the emphasis should be, rather than later when perhaps the opportunity to maximise that training is well and truly lost.",125,Represent Atives Main Committee

341,Mr Abbott,"You are a television journalist, not a print journalist.",126,Representatives Main Committee
342,Mr Andren,"That is right. I have not done my mouth stretching exercises yet. I question,Thursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5905 I am most concerned about the increased emphasis on non-public school funding which threatens to widen the educational gap between the haves and the have-nots. I say that as a parent quite happy to pay $120,000, or thereabouts, after-tax dollars to educate my kids at a non-government school. Maybe 'happy' is not the word; perhaps 'willing' is a better word. I do believe that there is an unfair emphasis on supporting the non-public sector in education, which will prove detrimental to those who do not enjoy the ability or the privilege to educate their kids. We are going to see that percolating up of opportunity, as we have seen with income distribution, to the top 20 per cent of the population, as has been the case in many overseas developed countries, particularly America and other places. We have a working poor and an educationally impoverished section of the community as well. Looking at HECS and Austudy, the more flexible arrangement for the up-front payment of HECS and recognition of the increased cost incurred by rural families in sending their children away to study are both commendable steps in the right direction, though I question whether the Austudy changes go far enough. But I will deal with Austudy a touch later. With regard to apprenticeships and traineeships, the $265 miIIion dedicated to creating 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships is welcome, recognising the needs of young people to make the transition from school to work, as well as upskiIIing the work force in that program. In particular, the establishment of a one-stop apprenticeship and trainee shop, like that presently being set up or trialled in Orange through the efforts and the guidance of Email, is very welcome. It should reduce the complexity of the process for both employers and prospective trainees and apprentices. But we are not generating jobs at the end of the day to soak up those people once they are trained and those privileged enough, the cream, who wilI be able to access those programs. Those who are not the cream of the unemployed wilI certainly stiIl miss out. I am not necessarily supporting the workplace programs, that the former government had because I think that, apart from some like Skillshare, they were too short and they did not offer much long-term hope. I think that we have got to be far more creative in the programs. Work for the dole is only a pittance; it is only a token effort to address the unemployment amongst our youth. I warn of the German experience where a country with the best trained work force in the world has unemployment around 12.75 per cent at last count. There the increasing trend is for trainees and apprentices to join the dole queues once they complete their qualification. It is okay to train our young people, but we also have to create real jobs to meet their understandable expectations of continued employment. Although we have reasonable economic growth and low interest rates at the moment, the job market for young people, especialIy, is extremely tight and, in fact, in regional areas, non-existent for some. All the signs are that it will not improve quickly. I want to go on and comment that community support programs to provide special assistance tailored to the needs of severely disadvantaged job seekers are commendable. (Time expired) dole and, in doing so, indicate that we believe that, unfortunately for the young unemployed in Australia, it is nothing more than poll driven tokenism. In that context I believe that on the issue of jobs, though you would really question the commitment, the government is in panic mode and clutching at straws. I suppose if you were really concerned about the issue of jobs",126,Representatives Main Committee
343,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.13 A.m.),"I return to the issue of work for the5906 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 at the moment, you would be visiting somewhere, such as Newcastle in New South Wales, rather than Lords to watch the cricket. On the issue of work for the dole, the Premier of Victoria was correct when, on 14 March, he described it in the Melbourne Age in condemning it as 'crazy and irrelevant for the 2 I st century'. It is not often that I identify with the Premier of Victoria. I know that he is a very good friend-if anything, a mate-of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. But I think he understands that if you are really concerned about getting young people back to work, then you have got to be willing to invest in creating opportunities for young people. I must say that the young people I meet with on a regular basis in many regions around Australia raise their concerns, from the department's point of view, about many types of issues. Firstly, they are rather concerned about the fact that this government, through its departmental activities, has actually reduced access to labour market training opportunities. The fact that in its recent budget it did not restore the cuts made to labour market programs that were announced last August represents a huge setback in the minds of those young people and, dare I say, their parents. They then refer to the increasing university fees and the requirement to pay back HECS debts sooner. They take the view that, yes, they are prepared to put their heads down and try their best, but the government should not be putting barriers in the way of creating educational and training opportunities, on the basis of which they desire to pursue real job opportunities. They then referred to the overall lack of a budget strategy and the fact that they would have thought the Treasurer's speech on budget night would have referred to the question of jobs and a jobs target as a number one priority. They said that when they actually read the speech they could only find the question of unemployment mentioned on one occasion. They then raised with me, from the department's point of view, the fact that prior to the budget-in actual fact, in the week prior to the budget-the Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury had said that, if you really want a capacity to reduce unemployment in Australia, you have to achieve an economic growth rate of four per cent or more. What surprised them was that on budget night they only found a suggested growth rate of the order of 3.75 per cent. So, they really want an explanation from the government. If that is the target or the projection on the question of economic growth, they want an explanation today of where the jobs are going to come from. People at arms-length from the governmentthe Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury-said that you have to achieve four per cent growth or more actually to reduce the level of unemployment. I think it is important today that the ministerial secretary actually outlines where those jobs are going to come from and how a projected growth rate of 3.75 per cent, which is less than that suggested to reduce unemployment by the Reserve Bank and the Treasury, will actually produce the jobs. It is also important to start to identify the regions and the industries in which those jobs are going to come. I raise that because we have finally realised to some extent that, as the Australian said on 14 June, there is a real jobs crisis. Its headline on the first page was 'Jobs crisis knocks out another 40,300'. I know we had the 43-bean explanation from the minister on that day-as Mike Gordon, writing in the Australian, referred to-but I do not know how 43 beans equate to 40,300 additional unemployed in one month. This is what worries young people: the fact that 40,300 disappeared in one month. That is the most recent outcome of the performance of this government on the question of jobs. That is why they ask how it can be said that work Thursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5907 for the dole is going to lead to real jobs, when they see more than 40,000 jobs disappear in one month. What worries them even more is that, of those 40,000 plus jobs, 23,000 jobs-not an insignificant figure for one month-were full-time jobs, and yet the government says that it is making progress on the question of reducing unemployment. When you go to the question of the overall budget strategy-and that is why I raise this matter today-there are now 57,400 fewer full-time jobs in Australia. (Time expired) reduction in funding for labour market programs, and I want to expand on my concerns about the high unemployment that we have in this country. High unemployment, of course, is creating a feeling of insecurity in those people who are unemployed and also in people who are currently in jobs, who want to know how long they will remain in employment. This lack of confidence simply means that the Australian people do not believe that the government, which has now been in power for 15 months, has the answers to our country's economic problems. I believe the government has wasted a golden opportunity. It won the 1996 election by a large majority, and all new governments, irrespective of their majority or their political persuasion, enjoy a honeymoon period in which the people who have elected them are prepared to give them a go. However, I believe that this government has lost the opportunity to build confidence in the community. They have failed. I believe the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) lives in the past and that he has no answers for the problems of the future. After being in power for some 15 months, the government now has a policy vacuum in the area of employment. Of course, this policy vacuum is being filled by simple solution theories, as advocated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I refer to the headline that appeared in the Australian yesterday and which emphasised the lack of confidence that is out there. It read, 'Double blow dashes job hopes'. I will quote a couple of extracts from that article. It begins: Long-term unemployment has leapt 16 per cent over the past 12 months and the jobless rate rose to twice the national average in some blackspots, highlighting the jobs crisis facing the community and the Howard government. A further quote says that the opposition spokesman for employment, Martin Ferguson, has said: ... the trend number of long-term jobseekers-the figure calculated by smoothing out the monthly fluctuations-had reached its highest level in two years. Also in trend terms, the number of long-term unemployed has risen steadily to account for 30 per cent of the total number out of work. The article finishes up by saying: In Newcastle and the Hunter region-where the impending closure of BHP's steelmaking operations will see around 2500 jobs lost by 1999-the jobless rate was 11-12 per cent last month, representing 27,400 people out of work. The other point that I would like to make while speaking on this issue is that the new British government does seem to have some answers to this problem. Their answers are very similar to what the Australian Labor party is suggesting on this occasion. IfI could read another extract from the Australian of 18 June: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has said the key aims of New Labour's employment strategy are to give young and long-term unemployed people new opportunities, help single parents back to work and provide lifelong educational opportunities to help everyone to acquire new skills. Mr Brown promised 250,000 young unemployed people subsidised jobs through a tax rebate of £60 ($135)",127,Representatives Main Committee

Each of these options for work will offer day-release education or training leading to a qualification. Britain's long-term unemployed-those out of work for two years or more-will be subsidised into work through a £7S a week rebate for employers. This will create real jobs with real employers, not make-believe jobs run by some well meaning charitable organisations or community groups. These are real jobs with real employers. The other point is that the emphasis in the UK is quite clearly on training. That is not here in the current government's work for the dole program. The day-release education, as advocated in the UK example, but also the training-(Time expired) everybody is missing the point in this debate. While the former government, the current government and governments all around the world are thrashing around for an answer to the unemployment situation, we just have to realise that downsizing, rationalisation, privatisation, technology replacing jobs and the fact that there are no manual jobs out there any more means that we have to find a new definition for work. We have to find what meaningful occupations we can put a lot of these people into in the years ahead because we just cannot provide employment in the traditional sense. We keep bashing our heads against the wall accusing each other of lacking any sort of vision in this area. We have to sit down and work out how we are going to soak up these people and whether we can work out jobs programs that are meaningful. They will be part-time. They might be two days a week ad infinitum. They might be grafted onto other public programs, but we cannot look at the traditional way of providing jobs as we have done in the past. I will reserve judgment on the government's radical changes to the provision of employment services through the PEPEs and so on. I am sceptical of how the new competitive arrangements will work in regional areas like mine where there are only limited employers looking for young people and where I do not envisage there will be the same level of competition as in the nonrural electorates. As well, this market-driven system will mean that the brokers will target only the cream of the unemployed for their programs, for only they will deliver the bounty on offer at the end of the day. Of course, with the new youth allowance, families with 16and 17-year-old kids cannot afford to keep them. They too will miss out on these training opportunities. Believe me, they will be out on the streets in regional towns and we will have an increase in delinquency. There could also-and I would hate to support the comment necessarily that Senator Kernot made-be more youth suicides because of this hopelessness that is out there. I know members of the coalition are concerned about this aspect of the youth allowance. I would ask the government to have a good, hard look at it again because it is going to leave many youths outside the safety net. We cannot just graft our youth back onto the family. It is simplistic nonsense to talk about this wonderful family concept as the answer. It is not the answer. We have dysfunctional families out there and we have got to take cognisance of that fact. Concerning Austudy, to gauge the nature of public sentiment regarding the operation of AustudyI will quote some constituent letters which the parliamentary secretary should be interested in. This one says: Austudy is a nightmare. You need an accountant to fill it in, but if you can't afford one of these you are penalised because you put the wrong answers in the wrong boxes.",129,Representatives Main Committee

Another says: I fail to see how a family who qualifies for a low income rebate on tax does not qualify for Austudy. Do any of you live hand to mouth by day? Try it. You are institutionalising a system which will leave people no other option than to try to cheat it. That says it all, and to think that this same test will now be applied across the board in the youth allowance. This test is going to occur despite rulings by at least one member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal stating that the test is doomed to failure unless its whole structure is changed. The test is far too complicated for the average person to comprehend. The reliance on estimates of future expenditure is ridiculous. It does not allow for the fluctuating nature of income derived from many rural farms and small businesses. The benchmark in many cases does not line up fairly with PAYE equivalent incomes. The phone service is inadequate, and while I am sure it has caught some of the smarties that it was meant to, the evidence I have seen-and we have done heaps of surveys in my electorate conducted by my youth officer who has put so much time and effort into this-is that in some cases it has also discriminated against the very people it was designed to protect. Finally, the government, in its desperation to cut funding outlays, has severely hurt Charles Sturt University in my electorate, and others, with cuts to the Commonwealth industry placement scheme. We all know what the Wood royal commission found about police training and so on. Charles Sturt has 3,000 students. It has lost $10 million in support. It must be restored, not patched up as the government is trying to do with it, it must be restored because this is the sort of study that Charles Sturt is now involved in that is vital to the community. (Time expired) by the member for Calare( Mr Andren). I think there is a capacity to create jobs, and I am talking about real full-time jobs. It is not to suggest that we should not be proud of our record, irrespective of who is in government, on the creation of part-time jobs because part-time jobs suit the circumstances of some households and individuals or family units. However, it really comes back to the overall budget strategy and your capacity to create real jobs. By way of comparison I want to refer to this government's performance in its first 15 months compared to the performance of the Hawke Labor government in its first 15 months. I indicate for the record that in the Labor government's first 15 months, after March 1983, we cut the legacy of 10 per cent unemployment left to us by the then Treasurer and current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to 8.9 per cent. As the Prime Minister said on the 7.30 Report last Thursday, he has been left with a big ship to tum around on the unemployment front. He appealed for patience and understanding. We also had a big ship to tum around in 1983 in our first 15 months because there was double digit unemployment. We made inroads into unemployment, we reduced it to 8.9 per cent in that first 15 months because we had a strategy that was about economic growth and the creation of jobs. Strangely, in the first 15 months of this government, not only has youth unemployment not fallen, unemployment itself has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent.",130,Representatives Main Committee
346,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.28 A.m.),"I want to pick up on an issue raised5910 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 i take the view that what we want to see from the department-and unfortunately I question the current budget strategy-is an overall strategy that has a focus on decent labour market programs and the creation of local infrastructure opportunities that can gainfully employ people, especially some of the long-term unemployed, but also goes to the question of economic growth. I refer to the fact that we are concerned-and we are looking for the ministerial secretary or apprentice minister's explanation today-as to how an expected growth rate of 3.75 per cent is actually going to produce those jobs. I hope to see him as the minister one day. I understand he has his eyes on the job of the Minister for Schools and Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), but he wants to be in cabinet, unlike the minister. I go to the need to actually restore expenditure on labour market programs but, perhaps more importantly, I also want to deal with the question of the fall-off in growth in apprenticeships and traineeships. At Senate estimates last week it was confirmed that there has been a fall of about 1,000 apprenticeships in the last year. That is despite all the hype about the new modem Australian apprenticeship scheme. I also found it surprising that the growth in traineeships has fallen from 117 per cent in Labor's last year to just 32 per cent in the first 12 months of the Howard government. I suppose that really goes to the question of whether or not you are prepared to restore expenditure on funding for apprenticeships. In a recent press release titled 'Funding for new apprenticeships' the Minister for Schools and Vocational Education and Training sought to portray the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98. That is grossly misleading, but I understand that, from time to time, the minister likes to fudge the figures. He has a record for that. He was well known for doing that in some of his academic writings prior to coming into the parliament. to that very issue. I think you will find them interesting, from a ministerial secretary's point of view. I found them interesting. On the question of funding for vocational education and training, the real facts are that funding has been cut, not increased: $14.3 million will be cut from vocational education and training and $72 million will be cut from vocational education and training grants to the states, to add to the $183 million cut in last year's budget. It is a real problem that the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996-97, despite the government's so called publicity about MAA TS and new apprenticeships, and the growth in traineeships fell from that achieved in the last 12 months of the Labor Party compared to the first 12 months of the Howard government. It comes back to opportunities and whether or not you are prepared to invest in those opportunities. (Time expired) I want to say something about the work for the dole program. I would like to put it in the context that certainly we cannot say that it will not do any good-it may well do some good in some areas-but we believe it is a second-rate program. I believe it is a lazy program where very little thought was put into constructing it in the first place. One of the really great concerns I have about the work for the dole program is that it does not contain any provision for training, nor does it contain any provision for recognition of the skills that may be obtained during the short period of time that these people will be in employment. A number of people have looked at this particular problem, in particular, Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorf Foundation, who recognises that the people who work for the dole will be",131,Representatives Main Committee

These people may well work for a month or a shorter period of time, they may move on to another job or may be unemployed for a while. They may then get into employment but in a different area to where they were before. But as they move through this range of part-time work, they are not acquiring any recognition of the skills that they will probably attain during this period of employment. This is a great weakness in this program. I appeal to the government to look very closely at recognising the skills that people acquire during this period of training. They should be certified so that, as they move through their working life, they can take these qualifications with them. They should have a certificate which says that they have worked for X period of time in this particular type of work and that they acquired certain skills while doing it. If that weakness in the program is rectified, the unemployed people who go into this program will benefit greatly. I have concerns about other areas of the work for the dole program. It appears to me that the government is taking a fairly pessimistic view of employment growth. I do not think it would have introduced this type of program if it felt that unemployment levels were going to drop. I believe that the government does not have any programs or plans to overcome unemployment. It appears that this scheme was introduced very hastily. It was introduced by the minister through a very short statement. There were many other problems confronting the government at the time. People could be excused for saying that this was a smokescreen to take attention away from some of the government's other problems. Coming from a trade union background, I am concerned about the people who work for the dole. This program will be award free. Their rights will not be protected while they are working. They will not come under the recognised workers compensation provisions, although I understand that there may be some insurance that will protect them if they are injured. Members on this side of the House are concerned that people who work for the dole will not be covered by an appropriate industrial award. Once again, this contrasts very distinctly with the programs of the previous Labor government. People who worked in labour market programs were covered by an appropriate industrial award. I believe this is an attack on the awards system that has protected working class people in this country for many years. Quite clearly, this government is trying to weaken the trade union movement and it is trying to weaken award coverage. Whether it is intended or not in the work for the dole proposal, this is certainly what is happening. Interestingly, many employer organisations are saying that this program will not make people job ready. For a start, it is for a short period of time-only two days a week-and so people will not be conditioned to arrive at work on time, do a good day's work, go home and then come back the next day, and do that on a continuing basis. If people who have been out of work for a period of -ime are going to get job ready, they need to have continuation of employment. They do not need spasmodic periods, where they work for two days one week and two days the next. I believe that the government is considering the possibility of bringing that all together so that people will work for a full week or for a fortnight, and then maybe have a period of time off.

I touch on the question of work for the dole, which will apply, for example, to 18to 20year-olds. I have a question for the government: if I am a 19-year-old and, on the basis of the announcement going to the issue of youth allowance, based on my parents' household income I am not entitled to unemployment benefits, is there a guarantee that, if I am required to work on a compulsory basis, as suggested by the government, will I receive a payment for that compulsory requirement to participate in the work for the dole program? I also raise what I find a strange proposition. I refer in passing to the Green Corps. The Green Corps is very small when compared with the old LEAP program. The majority of participants in Green Corps to date have actually had jobs or been in full-time education. I find it strange that at the end of their program they are entitled to an additional allowance of $500 to go on to a further training opportunity. Why isn't a similar allowance available, for example, to people who will be compulsorily required to work for the dole? Work for the dole is not going to go to some people who have been fortunate enough in the past to have had jobs or been engaged in full-time training or education opportunities. Surely those participants should be encouraged at the end of a compulsory requirement to undertake work for the dole to a grant of, say, $500-similar to Green Corps-to go on to a training opportunity. I say that because, whilst I have serious problems with the question of work for the dole, the value of some of the labour market programs such as LEAP was that that actually gave the young person the opportunity to work themselves out from a personal point of view and to come to terms with their lack of discipline in work and some of the personal difficulties that they had. The time was used by them to actually work out what they wanted to do in the future, such as a traineeship or an apprenticeship. In that context, it is very valuable that they be given some additional assistance or encouragement to go on and take up an alternative training opportunity. We are putting aside the question of the value or otherwise of work for the dole and raising what we should be doing for those people who are going to have the stigma of saying to an employer, 'Yes, I am a graduate of work for the dole; two days on, five days off. But would you please put that aside because I really want to do something with my life.' The explanation I am looking for from the government is of when we will get some additional encouragement for those people to actually get some financial assistance to go on to alternative training opportunities. I say that because I think youth unemployment is a major problem. I am vitally concerned with the fact that, after 15 months of this government, not only have they not made a dent in youth unemployment, but youth unemployment has risen in Australia. More importantly, we are getting suburbs and regions of very high youth unemployment. In fact, the national capital, that the Prime Minister has turned his back on as not being good enough as the centre of government any more, is an area of high youth unemployment. Those people out there in the suburbs of Canberra are looking for more than work for the dole and a Green Corps program that largely benefits people in terms of full-time jobs or training opportunities. I say in conclusion that we have got major concerns with the performance of this department but not in isolation. It goes to the whole budget strategy of this government. Unless we get a higher level of economic growth we are not going to make a huge impact on reducing unemployment in Australia. The truth of the matter is that the reduction in interest rates to Thursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5913 date, and there have been four reductions, are not a vote of confidence with respect to the performance of this government. I suppose the Reserve Bank is doing what this government has failed to do. They are trying to stimulate some investment and encouragement out there. They have finally realised that they should not just be concerned about building on our achievements from the point of view of breaking the back of inflation. They have come to terms with the fact that the Treasurer is wrong to focus just on the question of the rate of inflation and they must be vitally concerned with the issue of unemployment. We have an alltime high. We have also a deterioration I might say in terms of long-term unemployment. We need a regional strategy to help those people. (Time expired) Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.39 a.m.)-I would like to thank all members who participated in the debate this morning because I think that it has been more constructive than these debates sometimes are. Perhaps this is the nature of the committee stage of debate. I do have a few comments to make. Naturally, all members on this side of the House share the concern of all members on that side of the House about the unemployment problem. It is, as the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has frequently said both before and after the election, the most serious problem that Australia faces. I am prepared to attribute good faith to members opposite and I hope members opposite are prepared to attribute good faith to members of the government on this subject. Naturally, as a member of the government I am concerned that after 15 months the unemployment problem is not appreciably better than it was at the time of the election. I am concerned, as members opposite are concerned-we are all concerned. The Prime Minister is concerned. One of the reasons the Prime Minister is in England is to talk to the British Prime Minister and then later when he goes to America to the American President about their options for tackling this very problem. One thing does slightly disappoint me about members opposite. They are quite properly drawing attention to the fact that after 15 months of this government the situation is not markedly different, at least in terms of the statistics, but after 13 years of their government, where were we at? In the 13 years of the recent Labor government, unemployment never dropped below six per cent and averaged over eight per cent. Their government presided over a great deal of restructuring in the private sector and public sector, all of which resulted in job losses. Full-time jobs only rose by 7,000 between 1991 and 1996, at the same time as the former government ran up government debt of $75 billion. WhatI would like from members opposite is a little bit more fair-mindedness and appreciation that the level of unemployment is a difficulty, tragedy and disaster that many governments in many countries are grappling with. There are no magic wands, there are no quick fixes. If there were magic wands and quick fixes, does anyone think that they wouldn't have been applied long before now? Briefly, the government's strategy to reduce unemployment has four basic elements. First of all, we want to make the overall economy more buoyant and the very considerable interest rate reductions that we have seen are at the heart of that strategy. Surely we should get some credit at least for putting in place fiscal conditions that made it easier for the Reserve Bank to allow those reductions. Labour market flexibility is very important. I want to stress that this government is not about reducing wages, this government is about increasing wages. What we want to see is the ability",133,Representatives Main Committee
351,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment,5914 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 of workers to work more productively and the ability of workers and managers to work productively together so that businesses are more productive. Better training and better education are a very important part of the government's strategy. I will touch on that in a few moments when I respond to some of the comments of the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson) about apprenticeships. Finally, there are some important structural changes that we are putting in place. Work for the dole is an important structural change because we are trying to establish the principle that people ought to be prepared to give something back in return for the support that society gives them. I appreciate the comments of members opposite that the work for the dole scheme does not involve anything like the formal training that many of the former government's labour market programs involved. But the fact is that members opposite did not oppose the work for the dole scheme when it went through the House. I really think that great indignation from them is slightly phoney, given that they did not oppose it when it went through the House. The youth allowance changes are also a very important part of changing the culture of this nation. What we are saying with our changes to the benefit situation for people aged 16 to 18 is that they really should be in education or training. (Time expired) raised by the ministerial secretary. In passing, I might refer to the Reuter's poll of this week. It touches on the question of interest rates and suggests there is about a 60 per cent view that there will be a further half per cent reduction in interest rates. It really relates to whether or not it represents confidence in the government's strategy to date, because this is what this poll says. Thursday's May labour force data shocked the economic forecasting community. The typical economist now sees a 60 per cent probability of the Reserve Bank effecting another interest rate cut, compared to 35 per cent a couple of weeks ago. That really is made in the context of the unemployment problem that this government has created. I was also looking for an explanation from the government about whether or not the department was really comprehensively consulted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the recent announcement going to the immigration intake. What surprises and concerns me is that at a time when the government is trying to argue to the Australian community that it has reduced the migration intake because of the high level of unemployment, in its first 15 months it has in fact increased independent skilled migration by 50 per cent. As we all appreciate, that independent skilled migration group is the untargeted and not matched group with skills and labour market shortages. I raise that because at the same time the government has slashed $269 million from vocational and industry training programs and more than $2 billion out of jobs programs. I really think it is important that there are ongoing and regular discussions between this department and the department of immigration on matching the skilled requirements of this great nation and the migration intake. What concerns me is that at the time that we have increased the independent skilled migration, the untargeted and not matched program, by 50 per cent, we have got a cut in government employment in these first two budgets of 28,000 jobs, many of which are in regional Australia. There are 8,000 Defence jobs to go. I suggest that jobs will also go as a result of the program of competitive tendering of information",135,Representatives Main Committee
352,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.49 A.m.),"I want to take up a couple of questionsThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5915 technology. There are 700 meat inspectors jobs to go as a result of the AQIS decisions of this budget. Then we have potential job losses of 12,000 as a result of changes to pharmaceuticals. This is an important process currently under way in this chamber. It is important that we raise questions and queries with a view to trying to get a better understanding of the issues and also to make suggestions about how current programs can be improved. That is why I raised the question of whether, in considering work for the dole-and we moved a series of amendments to improve it, which is not acknowledged by the government today, because we seriously questioned the value of that proposal-another proposal could be considered for a training grant of $500 at the end of work for the dole, similar to that received by people who participate and graduate from the Green Corps. When you are out there arguing that and, considering the issue of unemployment, that you also base your immigration intake on that now, what comprehensive discussions did or did not occur and what were the issues that were put forward by this department with respect to influencing the government's decision on immigration and the argument that it has been reduced because of the high level of unemployment and the deterioration in employment in Australia as a result of the first 15 months of this government's performance? That is vitally important, because from a bottom line point of view the real problem is that the budget hardly talks about the issue of jobs. It is mentioned once in the speech by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello). There is no real job target, as ACCI suggested this week, of six per cent. All the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) can talk about is a cup of Nescafe and being patient. The 43-bean solution is inadequate. People are concerned about the loss of 40,300 jobs in one month. We want explanations, not pie in the sky statements that the government is concerned about unemployment, at the same time that it says that people ought to be patient and that 18to 20-year-olds should no longer be entitled to unemployment relief if their parents have a household income of $41,500. I would like to see the apprentice minister ring up kids, including kids who are 18 to 20 years of age, and deny them unemployment relief, because I tell you what, he would have a few troubles at home. It is hard enough to negotiate with your kids about pocket money at the moment, let alone saying to l8-to 20-year-olds that they are not entitled to unemployment relief because mum and dad have to bring up a couple more kids.

Believe me, if we have that length of time and if we have the same results, we will certainly deserve to be expelled from government. To get back to the youth allowance proposal, we are saying that 16to 18-year-olds, unless there are some extraordinary circumstances, should be in full-time education or training. The problem with the former government's policy was that it had young Australians sitting in the pinball parlours and the video parlours of our inner cities. I do not pretend for a moment that that is what members opposite intended, but that was what their policy allowed and that is what our policy is going to prevent. The other problem with the former government's policy was that the former government's policy gave people an economic incentive to go out of education and onto unemployment benefits. By equalising the conditions under which people get this allowance, we are ensuring that there is no disincentive to study. Surely that is a good thing.

Please do not interrupt when he is speaking. If you want to have five minutes, save it, and come in later. The parliamentary secretary will be heard in silence. member for Batman raised was the Green Corps. He made the observation that only 50 per cent, or thereabouts, of the Green Corps participants so far were formerly unemployed, and that is true. I do not regard that as a problem because there is a difference between the Green Corps and labour market programs. Green Corps is not a labour market program; Green Corps is a youth environmental program. He is really, I think, comparing an apple with an orange. Green Corps is a different program, and I have got to say that it is an excellent program. So far, people who have been involved with the Green Corps and were previously involved with program such as LEAP, believe that Green Corps has taken the LEAP experience and built on it to produce a much better program. The whole point about Green Corps is that everyone who is in a Green Corps team is a volunteer, whereas, the people who were in LEAP were essentially conscripts, and that has produced a very different temper and ethos amongst the participants. The honourable member for Batman wanted to know about consultation between the immigration department and the department of employment over changes to the skilled migration rate. As far as I am aware, the normal consultations that go on between departments on these matters did go on. I do not see that there is a problem with bringing people into this country as independent skilled migrants because the fact is they are supposed to come in under that category only if there is work for them. Obviously, if there is work for people, there is no reason that they should not be brought in. In concluding these comments prompted by the contribution of the honourable member of Batman, let me just say again that I think there is a real problem today when we have members opposite running around increasing the gloom and despair felt by some people in Australia. These are difficult times for many Australians. No-one pretends otherwise. We have not entered an economic nirvana, just as we were not in an economic nirvana for the 13 years of the former government. But the fact is that every time we have outrageous and patently ridiculous statements from people like the honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham), it makes the problem worse. If their feeling for Australia was practical as well as theoretical, their contribution would be a lot more constructive than the sort of loud-mouthed effort that we have got from them today.

358,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.59 A.m.),"I think that I should take up the obvious self-deceptionThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5917 government is that it has some form of policy mortgage on the idea that young Australians should seek to better their educational opportunities rather than to be placed on unemployment benefits. The reality is that the period when Australia saw the greatest growth in participation at secondary and tertiary education was during the last 13 years of a Labor government. Before that period, participation rates nationally were below any international comparisons. We had literally thousands of our best and brightest people unable to go past year 10 in their educationthem to go on into higher education, into post-secondary education through the technical and further education system and the universities. What the former government did was to radically transform the pattern of youth education in this country. A great majority of young people now complete year 12 education, and the participation levels through tertiary and post-secondary education have massively increased. But there will still be those who complete their education at year 10. There is no way that this nation is going to have a system whereby all Australians will benefit from participating in education past year 10. That is the reality. A failure to provide any employment opportunities for those people is the charge we sheet home to this government. In the past, when it was in opposition, the government criticised us for putting in place labour market programs which had a significant training component, saying that that was shifting people from the unemployment market and into 'mickey mouse' schemes, as it described them, in order to take them out of the unemployment statistics. But those so-called mickey mouse schemes all had elements of training to increase people's employability and job readiness. What this government is now doing is putting in place an economic regime that simply says, 'We will park you in the education system which is already bursting at the seams, notwithstanding that there is no discernible benefit that you will achieve and that there is certainly a disbenefit to the overall participation rates of those who would go on into tertiary and secondary education, because they could have got some benefit from it. We will park in the system all you people for whom that system will contribute no benefit at all, and that is the only way that you are going to receive any support from this government.' To the extent that they shift people who are genuinely seeking employment across from the job search task into fruitless educational endeavour, they will take people off the unemployment lists. This is a way of disguising long-term and short-term unemployment amongst Australia's youth. For an opposition that had said that national unemployment amongst youth was a disgrace, what they are doing now in government is avoiding any responsibility whatsoever. What are they going to say? My colleague the member for Franklin( Mr Quick) made the point that, in Tasmania, there are going to be some 700 people who will now go into the already bulging high schools, in circumstances where there is nothing to give them any net advantage-simply because that will be their only way of gaining any income support. This is an outrageous and wrong approach. The other point I would make about the independent category in migration is that Parliamentary Secretary Abbott simply misunderstands. There is no requirement for an independent applicant to demonstrate any employment need in this country whatsoever. The rest of the labour market programs require that; and what we have said is that the independent",138,Representatives Main Committee

(Time expired) has been spoken by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs( Mr Abbott), because the facts speak for themselves. The former Labor government had a proud history over 13 years. The retention rate in schools doubled from over 30 per cent to over 70 per cent by the time our period in government was finished. The former Whitlam government's performance in higher education, in creating opportunities for those who did not have the money, was second to none. That is why I joined the Labor Party. I was one of 10 children. I got my university education, courtesy of the vision of the Whitlam Labor government, which opened up the universities. It is the role of government to create opportunities. What we have seen in just over 13 months of this government is that this is a government for the rich. It is not about creating opportunities. This is a government that leaves people to their own devices and says, 'Oh, governments should not be involved in the marketplace,' but then it imposes its morality on the public. That is what you have got in store for the 16to 18-year olds. That is your view of the family-your view of the path that they should take. The previous Labor government was a government that did not divide the communities, that had a safety net. Thatcher and Major were subsequently rejected in Great Britain. At a time when Mother England has rejected the Tories, the colonies have embraced them. At a time when America has rejected Reagan and Bush, poor old Australia has embraced the Tories. Why? Because after 13 years, they forgot what it was like to be under a Tory government. But we know what a Howard government will be like. What was John Howard's record in his period in the Fraser government as Treasurer in relation to this area? In relation to unemployment, it left us with unemployment at over 10 per cent. That is what we were left with. Our period in government created opportunities in a changing work force in a changing society. The problem with your Prime Minister and your government is that you hark back to the old days. That is what we find offensive about this budget and these proposals. The old days have gone forever. You are not going to make people 'comfortable and relaxed' in relation to this budget and what you have brought down. What you have done is betray the young people, on whose misery you piggybacked into government, offering them hope. That is what this part of the budget is. It is a betrayal of what you promised these people. You will be judged on your record. After just over 13 months, you do not deserve re-election. This is a policy that is backward looking, that is insular looking and one that does not recognise the changes in our society that have occurred. The Lyons Forum is controlling this government. Your former adviser, where is he? The one who made the changes to Abstudy, where is he? You picked up his changes. He drafted your policy on Abstudy and what did you do? You picked it up and ran with it and where is he now? On the staff of the member for Oxley( Mrs Hanson). You criticise the member for Oxley, but what you do is ride on her coat-tails. She is your creation. She is your leader's creation. The policies that you implement in this area are policies that she would embrace and endorse.

I think the real problem is that he does not understand at the moment the biggest problem the Australian community confronts is the issue of getting jobs for those who are unemployed and those who lack a sense of job security in their lives. Green Corps might be all right in a time of high unemployment. The issue today is getting jobs for the unemployed. The issue today is not taking unemployment benefits off 18to 20year-olds; it is actually creating real jobs. He says, 'Yes, they are volunteers.' It is strange that you reward volunteers with a training levy of $500 but you say to the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, that all we can offer for you is work for the dole. Some of us cut our teeth opposing the coalition government's approach to compulsion with respect to conscription in Vietnam. We were not going to be thrown in as cannon fodder for Vietnam, nor are we going to accept in this day and age that young unemployed people ought to cop the stigma of work for the dole with no hope at the end of that compulsory program. Those programs that we pursued, such as LEAP, were especially important for regional Australia. I think the parliamentary secretary owes this chamber an explanation as to why unemployment in 77 per cent of rural and regional Australia is worse off as a result of the performance of this government in its first 12 months. Those communities embraced and supported decent labour market programs, such as New Work Opportunities and LEAP, but I suppose he needs to be reminded how desperate it is out there. He ought to start talking to his coalition mates in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, the people who cover the areas of Lismore, Coffs Harbour, Taree, Tweed Heads, Grafton and Port Macquarie, because unemployment in that region this week is 14.5 per cent. The national average is 8.8 per cent, and the government says, 'Be patient.'

As I was saying, in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales there are 3,000 more unemployed people today than in March 1996. SoI understand why there was that rude interruption by the parliamentary secretary when I was referring to these vital figures. Let us go to the black spots of Victoria; the government likes to talk about black spots. Rural and regional unemployment in Victoria is now at 11.2 per cent. 'Be patient: have a cup of Nescafe.' That is the minister's view about the issue of unemployment today. Let us go to the Gippsland region. We know the minister does not like to spend a lot of time in Gippsland; he finds it more attractive to stay in East Melbourne. What is the unemployment rate in the Gippsland region? It is 12.9 per cent compared to March 1996 when it was 9.2 per cent. IfI were him I would find East Melbourne more attractive too, rather than being accountable for the deterioration in employment. Now let us go to the central highlands and the Wimmera. The unemployment rate there is 9.8 per cent compared to 7.9 per cent in March of 1996. In the Barwon and western district region-Gee long, Hamilton and Portland-it is 12.9 per cent compared to 8.4 per cent in March of 1996. I think the parliamentary secretary owes this chamber an explanation. Why have we got higher regional unemployment? (Time expired) Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.14 a.m.)-I do intend to try to give explanations to as much as is capable of explanation in the various accusations and interjections from those members opposite. One important issue that the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson) raised earlier was this whole question of apprenticeships and traineeships. I am advised by the department that apprentice and trainee commencements were 67,900 in 1994-95,85,100 in 1995-96 and are estimated to have been 94,500 in 1996-97. I should also draw to the attention of the member for Batman the advice I have received from the department that in this government's budgets for 1996-97 and 1997-98 Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training totals $1.354 billion, compared with an expenditure of only $1.2 billion when the Labor Party was in government. These figures, I am advised, show that the government has increased its allocation on vocational education and training by $144 million, or almost 12 per cent. I now wish to return to some of the more general comments that the member for Batman and other members opposite have made. As I have said, there is no easy answer to the unemployment problem. The socialistic answers of the 1970s failed. The ultra-market solutions that were tried by the former government in the 1980s were disappointingly slow to work. Obviously, what the new government is moving towards is, if you like, a new paradigm which builds on the strengths of the market but which does not expect it to do everything. The question that I really should pose to the member for Batman and other members opposite is: what is the Labor Party's answer to these problems? Over 13 years, as I said, unemployment averaged over eight per cent. So, plainly, the answers opposite were not so brilliant. The member for Batman seems to be suggesting that we should resurrect Working Nation, with all its $2 billion a year expense. Is the shadow Treasurer ( Mr Gareth Evans) going to provide the member for Batman with $2 billion? Can the member for Batman guarantee that should he be whisked magically onto the government benches, that he would have an extra $2 billion to spend on this?

What are the answers that the member for Batman has? So far, the only answer that the member for Batman has come up with is the idea of job sharing. Job sharing was described as a ludicrous and nonsensical solution by his colleague-and, I dare say friend, the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner), his rival for the leadership of the national left faction. So plainly there are just no answers on the other side of the House. Mr Martin Ferguson-I am on the national left, am I? contribution of the member for Banks( Mr Melham). He accused the government of going back to the old days. Of course, it was the member for Melbourne who accused many members opposite of wanting to go waltzing down memory lane, hand in hand with Pauline Hanson. It was the member for Banks who talked about the former government bringing the nation together and not dividing communities. Even the member for Banks surely must find the great healing figure, slightly ludicrous. Let us face it, the former Prime Minister was the man who regularly denounced people in this very building as unrepresentative swill, and so on. than can be said formember for Banks and I will continue these comments in a moment. In particular, I want to comment on his remark that the policy that the government has adopted on Abstudy is in some way the creation of my former adviser. My former adviser had no policy role whatsoever and has had absolutely nothing to do with any policy proposals since we came to government-but I will continue this in a moment. (Time expired) relation to unemployment is: give us more time. Unemployment has gone from 8.5 per cent when we left office to 8.8 per cent now and the government says: give us more time. Given that when John Howard was Treasurer, he left us with unemployment at 10 per cent, does that mean that the electorate ought to give him time to bring unemployment up from 8.5 through 8.8 to 10 per cent? Plainly, the government has no answers in relation to unemployment. They have said 'Give us our industrial relations legislation.' They have said, 'Let us cut the budget. Let us implement all the reforms that we want to do.' Then they look around and say, 'Oh dear, unemployment has gone up. What are we going to do about it now? Are we going to introduce a GST?' It is always, 'Give us our agenda and then something will happen in relation to unemployment.' In fact, they have no answers in relation to unemployment. It is particularly severe in regional areas, with 12.9 per cent in Gippsland and 12.9 per cent in other areas of rural Victoria. The thing that I particularly want to put before the committee in consideration in detail is the future of the skillshares. I and other members have received correspondence from skillshares about where they will be left in this brave new employment services market world. The National Skillshare Association has pointed out: ... in the event that the government does not provide the advance payments we are seeking, the great majority of our more than 350 community organisation members will not be in a position to submit tenders for this important element of the new market.

We think it not unreasonable that the Government should set conditions for initial operation of the new market which recognise the particular and special circumstances of not-for-profit organisations and which give them a reasonable chance to adapt to the competitive environment the Government intends to create. We have had correspondence from the National Skillshare Association to the minister which says: Our own analysis of the financial parameters for providing employment assistance services under the terms set out in the Exposure Draft make it clear that even the most optimistic assumptions about client flows and outcomes achieved will still see organisations facing significant negative cash flows in the early stages of the operation of the market. They go on to say: It is entirely unreasonable for the government or the department to expect that the good citizens who comprise the Boards and Management Committees of sponsor organisations should expose themselves to the significant additional burdens and personal financial risks associated with borrowing funds so they can continue ... Similarly, Mr Deputy Speaker, we had correspondence from the Maylands skillshare. This is a Western Australian skillshare but it reflects the situation found by skillshares in my electorate and in other parts of the country that were set up by non-profit organisations. Maylands was set up by the Royal Western Australian Institute for the Blind. They point out that after February 1998 they will experience negative cash flows for at least three months until payments for the employment services provided are made. They say that, having had to operate as not-for-profit organisations, skillshares do not have any cash reserves, let alone substantial ones. It is little surprise against that background that the Royal Western Australian Institute for the Blind has made the decision that it is unable to underwrite the temporary negative cash flow-at this stage estimated to be in the range of $45,000 to $70,000-and this leads to a scenario of the pin being pulled on Maylands skillshare. As they point out, it will be repeated with many skillshare organisations all around Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I and a number of other members of parliament have also received correspondence from the north-east employment project where they have talked about Dr David Kemp's plan to spend $200 million on school based employment programs. They pose this question: is there any way in which Dr Kemp might be persuaded that effective, efficient notforprofit organisations already exist, at least in Victoria, to do exactly the job for which he proposes reinventing the wheel? That is exactly right. The abandonment of the CES-or the carve-up of the CES-in my view will lead to a disaster in terms of employment placement at the very time this community can least afford it. (Time expired) Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.24 a.m.)-I take up the member's point about skillshare. The government has a great deal of respect for the skillshare sector and my understanding is that negotiations are taking place between the skillshare sector and the department on the sorts of transitional issues that he raised.

I have to say that I regarded that as an act of treachery. I regarded that as an act of betrayal of me, of the local Liberal Party which gave him an enormous amount of support as the preselected candidate for Manly, and of a great many citizens of Manly who had reposed their trust and confidence in him. Mr Martin Ferguson-Was he in your faction? not-he would have been in the other faction. It was, if you like, as a way of handing an olive branch to others that he entered my office. in silence. phone calls. It became apparent that he had made dozens of phone calls on a departmental mobile phone, going back to late last year, to the member for Oxley and to David Ettridge. Obviously, these had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with his duties as my staff member. They had absolutely nothing to do with his role in helping to liaise between the department and me. I wrote two letters to the departmental secretary seeking the investigation of those phone calls and seeking the recovery of any costs that were incurred that were not properly attributable to his work for me. I believe that those investigations are continuing. Not long after he left my office, I was contacted by David Thomas, a former employee of the member for Oxley, who let me know that while my former staffer was employed by me he had attended some functions which again had absolutely nothing to do with his employment by me or his work in liaising with the department, but had everything to do with the moonlighting he had been doing for the member for Oxley. I have also written to the Department of Administrative Services seeking an investigation of one trip and one section of another trip, because again I am absolutely determined to ensure that no costs will be incurred by the taxpayers for activities which helped to enable my former staffer to assist the member for Oxley. Obviously, the behaviour of my former staffer is hugely embarrassing for me and for the local Liberal Party, but it is also a real problem for the member for Oxley. The member for Oxley has taken onto her staff someone with so little sense of propriety, someone with so little sense of discretion about the use of government resources that he was prepared to use those government resources quite freely in ways which had nothing to do with his work for me as the member for Warringah, nothing to do with his work for the electors of Warringah, and nothing whatsoever to do with his work for the department. In fact, information provided by David Thomas suggests that not only did he do this when he was working for me but now that he is working for the member for Oxley, even though he is employed by her in her capacity as an independent member of parliament, he is working full-time on the establishment of the One Nation Party. This strikes me as being at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of the provisions under which independent members get an extra staff entitlement. There are some very serious issues for the member for Oxley here. She preaches restraint in the use of government funds, but it is hard to see that it is being practised.

The truth is that you inject large numbers of people into an education system where they know they are going to get no benefit, save that that is their only means of having income support and the only way in which their families can sustain their children with any form of commitment. The unemployment circumstances are such that they cannot find employment and this government is going to refuse them the opportunities to seek employment and to improve their employability through labour market programs or access to unemployment benefits. If you force those unwilling participants into an already overcrowded state education system, then people will naturally say that that will degrade that state education system. They will not be going into private education because they do not have the means. The only sector of the education system they will be able to access is the already overcrowded and underfunded state education system. That will then carry the baggage of unwilling participants. Teachers will be baby-sitting large numbers of people who will be getting no benefit and whose parents know they are getting no benefit. Those who wish to participate to gain benefit out of the education system will increasingly have to choose to fund their children's education in the private sector. As well as the natural damage that is occurring to Australia's families, we will get the pressure that this will place on family breakdown and the consequences it will mean for the impoverishment of many families who will not wish to force their children into this stupid position. As well as that, we will find that it will degrade the state education systems around Australia. Years 11 and 12 will be carrying unwilling, unwelcome participants. They will be therefore unattractive to people who have the funds to escape from those systems. They will move into the private education system. Increasingly, we get a two-tier system of education where you get quality education only if you pay for it. Of course, that is being matched with a funding regime that increasingly benefits those newly established independent schools. Schools will be established in places where there is no check that they will not damage the participation of the public educational sector and where the transfer costs, as they emerge, will gut the effectiveness of the public education system. What we are actually doing is trying to hide unemployment. This government is trying to hide unemployment by shifting it into forcing people into yean; 11 and 12 education when we, as the former government, had already increased participation to a degree which was hitherto unknown in Australia. We were actually getting people going through higher education. Now we will force unwilling participants, who will not be capable of benefiting from it, into that system. That will degrade that public education system. It will continue the transfer and shift of people out of public education into private education. A class-ridden outcome, where wealth dictates your success in life, emerges as the likely outcome. That is what you can predict as a result of these very stupid changes. The only motivating factor that underlies them is a desire to obscure the fact that this government has nothing to offer to young Australians, who they bleated about before the last election as being their object of primary concern.

What do they do in government? They tum on those very people. They offer them no employment opportunities. They offer them no effective training opportunities. They park them in an educational system for which they cannot gain a benefit because that system is not designed to operate as a technical or further education system. It is not designed to increase job readiness. They will park them there, they will degrade that system's effectiveness, and they will increase the shift of people from the public sector to the private sector. This is retrograde and stupid as far as Australia's national interests are concerned. (Time expired) recent intervention by the parliamentary secretary and I can understand his feelings about treachery with respect to his former assistant, Mr Oldfield. He has raised very serious allegations today going to the operation of the parliament and the system of assistance, both to government and to the opposition, with respect to their staff. In that context, it is exceptionally important that he actually tables the correspondence that he has sent to the department setting out his allegations, so that the parliament at large and the Australian public understand the types of allegations he has detailed and required the department to investigate. It is only fair because I think that there is a genuine desire on both sides of the House at the moment to ensure full and proper parliamentary accountability with respect to the use of parliamentary entitlements. In that context, I fully appreciate why the parliamentary secretary is, if anything, really a little bit emotional with respect to these issues. I would feel the same way if it had occurred to me. So, I suggest that today, or at some date that is possible, the details of the allegations as set out in his correspondence be tabled because I think the parliament wants to know what is really at the bottom of this. The allegations that he has made today do not just go to his own staff; they also go to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I also want to touch briefly on questions raised by the parliamentary secretary relating to an overall budget strategy. I appreciate that there is no quick-fix on the issue of jobs. It is fair to say that both houses have different approaches but, from the Labor Party's point of view, it is appropriate that we detail what we regard as an appropriate strategy. It is a debate about ideas and not a question of a bottomless pit and throwing money at the unemployed. It goes to your capacity to generate economic growth-and I point the finger and suggest that a projected level of economic growth of 3.5 per cent is inadequate. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Reserve Bank governor and the secretary of Treasury. I also suggest that economic growth alone is not necessary. It goes to government policy and to whether you have industry and regional policy-and I am pleased to say that the government actually embraced our automotive plan. We have paved the way and forced reform at an international level with respect to the globalisation of the economy and changes, for example, on the tariff front. But enough was enough. It was appropriate that both sides of the House came together on the Labor Party's industry plan for the automotive industry. But it extends beyond the automotive industry to a range of other industries. It then goes to the question of regional Australia. You need to intervene and assist in regional Australia. It also raises the question of services to regional Australia. If you care about jobs, it is not smart to sack 28,000 public servants in the first two budgets. That takes me to the final aspect of a program, having touched on briefly the issue of a trade policy. We have a pool of long-term unemployed. Unfortunately, more and more of those",146,Representatives Main Committee

You have to have targeted decent labour market programs that you are prepared to invest in to try and get those people job ready, back into the discipline of work and back to work. We are prepared to debate the ideas. There is no quick-fix, but you have got to have a strategy. The problem with this government, I dare to suggest, is that it does not have a job strategy. It has a mind-set which extends beyond a role for government actually intervening and getting its hands dirty. It should be trying to facilitate, to push and prod, to attract investment, to create jobs and also to deliver those vital labour market programs that are so important to get people back into the discipline of work so that they have a capacity to change employers' attitudes to ensure that the employers finally accept that those people who could have been forgotten are worthy of employment. That is what it is about. We should not push them aside and forget them. We have to intervene and assist and invest in their future. They are worthy of employment; they deserve a second go. Green Corps is wrong. The majority of places have gone to people in employment and/or education. Our responsibility-that is, the responsibility of the parliament as a whole, irrespective of policy differences-is to accept that there is a role for government in assisting those people. (Time expired) Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.40 a.m.)-We have had a full debate on these issues, and I thank members opposite for their contributions. I would like to indicate that, as far as the government is concerned, the debate has canvassed the issues adequately. Finally, on the matters raised concerning the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), yes, she does have an important challenge to demonstrate just what kind of an independent member she is in respect of her attitude to public funds. Yes, on the suggestions before us, she may resemble Mal Colston more than she resembles Ted Mack. I want to say that the matters are being investigated. They are serious matters and, when those investigations are concluded, an appropriate statement will be made. I can give the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson) that assurance. in relation to the comments of the member for Warringah ( Mr Abbott). It is not merely a matter, I would suggest, of referring matters in relation to the former employee for investigation and assessment. This is analogous to the situation that emerged in West Germany before East and West Germany merged, where it was discerned that Willy Brandt, when Chancellor, had had on his staff as one of his closest advisers a person who was working for and reporting to the East German authorities. When that fact was discerned, it was a matter not merely of how that had come to occur, what responsibility there was and what prosecution or action could be taken against that former employee who had betrayed the trust, but also of how the supervision and the character judgment of Willy Brandt was such as to have allowed that person to remain in that office for such a period of time and to carryon that activity under the nose of a person in Brandt's position. There are questions that actually go to Parliamentary Secretary Abbott's capacity, responsibility, supervision and management of his office. There is also the question of the degree to which he, ministers, other parliamentary secretaries and other members of the coalition parties may in fact have contributed to the situation through their failure to scrutinise the work that was being undertaken and also the character of, and the nature of the",147,Representatives Main Committee

That situation was occurring under the watch of the parliamentary secretary, and we do not know whether similar practices are occurring with respect to any other coalition members, parliamentary secretaries or ministers. This goes also to a further question relating to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). If she was knowingly the beneficiary of work that was being performed by somebody who was on the payroll of another member of parliament, and if she was drawing from that a benefit to which she was not entitled, that is plainly analogous to a form of corruption of the process. It is a form of corruption because it goes to taking that which you know you are not entitled to-by reason of the fact that it was being paid for in order to be supportive of, in this case, the parliamentary secretary at the table. It is analogous to drawing from another member of parliament part of their postal entitlement or any other entitlement to which you yourself are not entitled. So, there are questions that go to the knowledge and the participation of those in the office of the member for Oxley. Those are fundamentally important questions. Has the parliamentary secretary asked that those matters also be pursued? If not, why not? Why have those matters not been sought to be put to the test? I would also ask the parliamentary secretary why his judgment of the character of those working for him was so remiss. What steps did he put in place to select people who were fit to occupy the office that he entrusted them to hold within his staff? It is not a matter you can brush off by saying, 'These people betrayed me.' From what the parliamentary secretary has indicated to date, there plainly was a long history of deceit. What was it that was so slack about his management of his office? What steps are in place to ensure that this does not happen in other circumstances where there may be people who are actually letting down those who have placed trust in them? What are the staffing processes that those in ministerial and other executive positions, including parliamentary secretaries, undertake to make certain that they are not appointing people'to positions of high responsibility who will, as occurred in Germany, betray them. When that occurred in Germany, the criticism fell on Willy Brandt for his failure to manage his office, as much as it did on the betrayal of those on his staff. There are two questions there: what were the circumstances whereby your scrutiny of your own office was so deficient; and, secondly, what steps, if any, have you asked to be undertaken with respect to the member for Oxley's participation? (Time expired) Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.46 a.m.)-The member for Denison( Mr Kerr) does raise two important issues. The sad truth is that it is impossible to control what members of one's staff do in their own time and outside of one's own office. I think I can give the chamber an assurance that none of the misdeeds of my former staff member took place in my office, certainly not in office hours, for the simple reason that it is an open plan office and anything untoward would immediately have been noticed by the other staff members who were sitting around him. The misdeeds took place out of the office and on the mobile phone, to the best of my knowledge, and I think I can reasonably make the assumption that that is the case. The member for Denison also says, 'How on earth could I have possibly employed this person?' Yes, that is also a fair question.

He was also a member of Manly Council, elected by the people of Manly. SoI think I had reasonable grounds for assuming that the man was competent, capable and trustworthy. Certainly there is no denying his competence. It is just that what he did while in my office over the last few months of his employment was an act of treachery. relation to a particular staff member whose salary was not covered by the estimates under debate would need to be relevant to the issues before the chamber. of what process does apply with respect to character checks of staff being employed by the executive? As minister for justice under the former government, I am aware, because I had some managerial and supervisory role in relation to this, that staff were required to be vetted not merely by those who recommended their appointment in the first place but ultimately, including when security issues and other issues were of concern, by officers of ASIO, for example, in relation to security vetting. These were checks that were built into the employment system. I acknowledge, with respect to the former government, that there were occasions between the appointment process and the completion of those checks when those vetting processes were not taking place. But those checks would deal with associates and a whole range of other issues and would go to character and a whole associated raft of issues. I wonder whether, if not necessarily now, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs( Mr Abbott) could take on notice whether or not those same arrangements still apply, and, if not, what arrangements are in place to ensure that mistakes are not made simply because somebody has a seemingly good public reputation yet may have participated in a way which could ultimately be very damaging to the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia. This is simply an interest where your political interests have been damaged significantly because of that betrayal. But, potentially, a failure to assess the character and fitness for service of an employee of the executive could have much more significant security and other national consequences were that betrayal not to another political party but, for example, to another nation. I simply ask that that question be addressed.

Warringah ( Mr Abbott) in relation to this debate and in terms of employment. The government's forecast of economic growth in the budget is at 3.75 per cent. It is that that concerns me with the government's attitude and the parliamentary secretary's attitude, 'Let's have a bit of patience. Let's wait, things will get better,' but 3.75 per cent growth is not enough to pick up newcomers to the marketplace into job opportunities. In our last couple of years of government we exceeded those growth rates.

What we have had is a government in the last 15 months that is like a rabbit under the spotlight. They do not know which way to jump; they are frozen. We have had a number of interest rate cuts and the government says, 'Oh, isn't this terrific.' The interest rate cuts that have occurred are a vote of no confidence in this government. They are interest cuts that have occurred because the economy is comatose. It is like a corpse and the interest rate cuts have been applied by the Reserve Bank to try and breathe life back into the economy, to try and kickstart building opportunities, housing opportunities and to create work opportunities. That of itself is not going to be enough to bring down the levels of unemployment. It is the budget figures themselves that are the cause for doom and gloom on my part and on the parts of other commentators. This government is not addressing this issue and it will not get better. They have a hands-off approach-the previous Labor government had a handson approach. We had a situation where there were external factors that affected unemployment. I can remember making my first speech in September 1990 and talking about the 1.7 million jobs that were created by the Labor Party until that time. That is when unemployment went bad as a result of external factors and other factors such as the TCF policy, the lowering of tariff barriers. This government has the opportunity to learn from some of those mistakes. But what do they do? It is a hands-off approach. The only intervention that this government engages in is intervention against indigenous Australians. Instead of allowing the marketplace to rule and the rule of law and the Native Title Act that allows miners and Aborigines the right to negotiate, they want to intervene to take away the limited rights that the High Court gave them. They are interventionists against Aborigines, but they are not interventionists when it comes to creating job opportunities. That is the problem-the budget figures nail the lie, they nail the myth. Employment opportunities are not going to get better under this government. The growth is not enough. That is why you need intervention. The very areas that are suffering are the areas that voted for you overwhelmingly. Regional Australia is haemorrhaging-it is bleeding. Towns are closing. You cannot take away the tax office and all these other offices and you cannot rip 28,000 public servants out of the system and expect the system to pick up the slack. There is a multiplier effect, a knock-on effect. That is why people now are starting to get alarmed. They are still reserving their judgment because there is enormous goodwill out there for this government. But when it sinks in that what has happened is a betrayal of the hopes and aspirations that were promised to them in the lead-up to the last election, that is when you will see the shift. But that is of no comfort to regional Australia. You do need labour market programs. Working Nation was a successful program. The training programs were beneficial. Money spent on skillshare in my area saw 65 and 70 per cent outcomes in terms of job opportunities for people. Skillshare is a successful organisation. It has a great track record. You should be encouraging it. You should be opening up skillshare offices, not closing them down. I lost a CES in my area: that is what is happening. There is no future under this government for young people, or for anyone else, and time will show that to be true.

386,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (11.55 A.m.),"In debating the estimates for this portfolio and5930 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 disparity of the unemployment figures. That needs to be stressed to this government because it does not seem to acknowledge that that is the case. It is not only the absolute figures that we are concerned with, the fact that there has been an inability by the government to reduce unemployment, but also the fact that on a regional basis, as has been outlined by the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson), in areas such as rural Victoria there has been increasing unemployment. If you look at the unemployment figures in a region like mine, which I share with the member for Batman and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and although the figures are not sufficiently disaggregated easily, we know that long-term unemployment is increasing. Traditionally, in a region like the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, that has been a factor within the unemployment figures, that the long-term unemployed in the region that we represent is great. Also, if you look at the figures that are supplied by the Bureau of Statistics you will see that in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne that female unemployment has increased by a large amount recently. WhatI am trying to do by highlighting those factors is get the government to understand that it just cannot have a broad brush approach to the problems of unemployment. I also want to say that those programs that have not yet wound down, and those programs that are applauded by people like the Minister for Schools (Dr Kemp), are targeting areas where there is already a good labour market. They do not target areas where there are disadvantaged, unemployed people. You find that when you have things like the pathways programs going into schools, that that has been targeted to areas where it is for the easy outcomes. It is in areas where the labour market is in a more healthy condition than it is in other areas. There appears to be this tendency to put the programs in where they can get the easy mark. There does not appear to be a willingness to develop programs that are going to attack unemployment in regional areas such as the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. There the problems of unemployment have been very severe for a long time, and there the problems have been exacerbated by the opening up of the economy to international factors. Things like tariff reductions have already had a dramatic effect there. That is why schemes like special assistance to people involved in the passenger motor vehicle industry and in TCF were so important. In the area I represent we had both those industries as major employers. The dramatic effects of tariff reductions have been felt, and there is a need to target those people who are losing jobs in those industries. That is a feature that over the last year and a bit we have lost. This government is unable to understand that we should be maximising outcomes to ensure that unlike the United Kingdom and unlike the United States we do not see this continuing marginalisation of large areas of the nation. That is what will happen unless we attack and target areas of greatest disadvantage. If we do not have that as one of our primary reasons for putting in place programs it will lead to the same problems of social dislocation and all the other matters that we see highlighted in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. I implore the ministers and the parliamentary secretary, who has been good enough to stay for this long debate, to have a look at these matters. They are important, and the government needs to be looking at ways in which it can at least give hope to people who are finding it difficult to find Thursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5931 employment, and to areas that are going to be in even more difficulty unless they get this type of assistance.

Although this first matter perhaps pertains to the Treasurer's portfolio I want to mention that, and I have stated this before, the laws in relation to child support are the worse examples of legislation that can truly be called an as, and I am sure a majority of members would agree with me. Why haven't we reformed the punitive, mentally destroying formula for setting non-custodial payments? They are cruel and destructive in many cases, and I am sure other members would have cases on their files and would agree. It is an absolute disgrace that the previous government and now this one have not treated reform of this area with the urgency it deserves. We talk about making apologies for the stolen children episode of our history, and yet here today we have a federal act that is causing similar pain and disruption to many familiesparticularly children-and no apparent sense of urgency to introduce meaningful reform. While child support legislation, in my mind, is the most urgent in need of serious reform, number two, as far as complaints go during my relatively short time in this place, would have to be problems in relation to the Copyright Act 1968, and the way it is being mercilessly exploited by the Australian Performing Rights Association, or APRA. This is a problem that other members and I have raised on numerous occasions with the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) and he has indicated reforms are possible but, as far as I am concerned, as with child support, the changes cannot come soon enough. APRA has embarked on an aggressive revenue collecting campaign over the past 18 months, based on a fact that a court ruled that the inside of a business could be regarded as a public place. APRA is now threatening businesses all over Australia that it will take them to court unless they pay licence fees to have a radio on in their premises. Let me give members an example. I recently visited a small butcher shop at Yeoval up in the top end of my electorate run by a young man in his 20s. You could not really begin to imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, how lonely this job is in a small place like that. I called in on a Tuesday about lunch time. This young man had had two customers through his doors that morning. The only company he had was the local radio. The week before he had been sent one of those threatening letters from APRA saying that his radio was a public performance of music and that he would be taken to court unless he paid the annual copyright exemption fee, which I would suggest was a darn sight more than that small butcher made in profits during that particular day. As this young man pointed out, the radio was not on to entertain the public. It was there solely for his personal benefit. So small was his business that he did not have meat out in the display fridge, he had little signs with the prices for 'short loin chops' and 'sausages' spread out for the people coming into the shop. It was not worth his while to cut the pieces off and put them on show. He had to cut the meat to order from that he had in the coolroom. The",151,Representatives Main Committee

I raised the issue with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs( Mr Prosser) last year. His reply to my representations showed an alarming lack of interest in the issue. The Attorney-General( Mr Williams) has shown a deal more interest, and I appreciate the problems he faces. The story of the butcher at Yeoval, however, is but one of no doubt hundreds of examples from around Australia of how small business is suffering. I have taken the trouble to visit APRA headquarters in Sydney. I have heard their story. I realise our international understandings and obligations but, as the case of the Yeoval butcher shows, the system is unfair. Obviously there is double-dipping of performing rights, given that the radio stations already pay substantial rights for playing the record. I have no problem with the performing rights for music played for commercial gain in gyms, for example, but the system is unfair and it is penalising business in my electorate, and no doubt elsewhere. I ask the Attorney-General to revisit this particular piece of legislation urgently. I also hope he passes on to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, the need to do something urgently about the Child Support Act. Those Senate reforms have been sitting around for a couple of years now and they must be addressed with haste, because some people out there are almost suicidal and their lives have been destroyed by the impost that that act places on them. WiIIiams) is here because I have a couple of questions to ask him. There are only II days to go before the end of the financial year. I would like to know, and I am sure the House would like to know, what is happening to the legal aid agreements. A $120 million budget cut was imposed in the Attorney-General's Department. I am not holding him responsible-the bean counters got to him and did him over. As I understand it, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) were working away to try to resolve the problem, and then the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) went on the Laurie Oakes Sunday program. He was not properly briefed. He said, 'No, we are not going to change what we are doing.' I understand that a proposal was going to go back to the cabinet to remedy the situation, because they were acting on old figures and a few misconceptions. However, as a result of the stubbornness of the Prime Minister, legal aid is In CrISIS. This is a great tragedy for me. I am a product of the legal aid system. I was only in private practice for three months and then I was proud to go to work as a public solicitor in New South Wales from 1979 to 1987, when I received appointment as a public defender. I worked as a public defender in New South Wales from October 1987 until February 1990, when I had to resign to run for public office because it was an office of profit. I have a commitment to legal aid. Legal aid cannot cover the field-it is there in partnership with the private profession-but the former Labor government looked after legal aid. When Labor came into office in 1983, the Fraser government had turned the Australian Legal Aid Office, which was a creation of the Whitlam Labor government, into a referral factory. There were discussions with all the states and territories. There was a merging of the Australian Legal Aid Office in New South Wales with the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. An efficient system was then operating.",153,Representatives Main Committee
388,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.06 P.m.),"I am thankful that the Attorney-General( MrThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5933 That was repeated around the country. There was a one-stop shop and there was a Commonwealth-state arrangement. Then the bean counters got in. A lot of people do not understand what the definition of a Commonwealth offence is. Have we worked out what the definition of a Commonwealth offence is and what a state offence is? New South Wales has decided, in effect, to go it alone. What has happened with Western Australia? We are told that the federal government has yet to make an offer to Western Australia with 11 days to go. I ask the Attorney-General: what is the current situation? There are only 11 days to go. Legal aid is in crisis in this country. I understand the pressures on the Attorney-General and the bean counters, but what has happened to the legal system, with the increase in court fees and a whole host of things, is a disgrace. AndI know it is currently being debated in the Senate. Access to justice now is a myth. It is the rich or the infinitely poor that are able to access the system of justice Even then it is a question of whether the poor can access it, because people on pensions are missing out on a whole range of things. This is what is happening at the coalface. This is what disillusioned people who work in the system are telling me. If it was not for the goodwill of a lot of people working in the system, who are carrying the system by working extra hours, the system would be in total collapse. My question to the Attorney-General is: what is the state of play? I know that you have to run the government line and these decisions are not solely your own, but I would like to know the current situation with all the states and territories. What is happening as of 1 July? What agreements have been signed up? What has not been signed up? What are the provisions in the Commonwealth area where there have not been agreements signed. I think we need to know. I am not holding him personally responsible. I know the pressures he is under but, in the end, he has to carry the can. That is what ministerial responsibility is about. In the end, he is the spokesperson. HaveI got it wrong? Have the states given us wrong information? What is the situation? (Time expired) number of questions that he could address. My colleague the member for Banks( Mr Melham) has raised the question of legal aid. I would like to ask a few specifics regarding other areas of the Attorney-General's portfolio responsibility. Firstly, in respect to the Australian Federal Police, I would be grateful if the Attorney General could indicate to us what the staffing impacts of the cuts that have been imposed will be. What will be the number of AFP staff that will be reduced as a consequence of those cuts, what areas of policy responsibility will be reduced, and what will be the effect on the schedule of those matters which are removed from the purview of the AFP? The second issue I would ask in relation to these matters is whether or not there has been any reduction of our overseas AFP staffing officers and where they would be. The third issue in relation to the AFP is on the very apparent ready availability of drugs in this community. Does the government have any response to the increasing calls by police commissioners and others for a strategy that goes beyond simple enforcement and looks at some of the areas that have been put into a public debate by a great number of commentators, including a number of the most senior within the law enforcement community? I would also like the Attorney General to address the staffing reductions that will be consequential on the smaller, but still significant, cuts to the National Crime Authority and what that may do in respect of any menu of references the authority has under its jurisdiction.",154,Representatives Main Committee
389,Mr Kerr (Denison) (12.12 P.m.),"I might ask the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) a5934 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 The second area where I would appreciate advice is in HREOC. The Attorney-General will be aware that that particular agency has suffered the greatest reduction of funding of any agency in his portfolio, and indeed, perhaps right across government, apart from the ones that were abolished entirely in the last budget. Plainly, there are going to be significant consequences in the capacity of HREOC to do its task, particularly in view of the increasing pressure that is emerging on HREOC because of the unenlightened comments that have occurred over the last year since the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) welcomed the end of a pall of censorship and allowed the bushfires of racism to run out of control. What will the consequences be for the community for those funding reductions? The third area I would appreciate advice on is in relation to the Administrative Review Council's Better decisions report. I would appreciate it if the Attorney-General could advise us on the article in the Canberra Times last weekend, which suggested that rather than implement the recommendations of the report there would be a move to go away from an effective system of merits review. Is that on the Attorney-General's agenda? Finally, if I could tum to a matter which I think is going to be of very great interest to the community. I refer to comments made by the member for Warringah ( Mr Abbott) in the previous estimates. He indicated that he was betrayed by a member of his staff who acted not at his behest but rather at the behest of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I wonder whether the Attorney-General, having administrative responsibly for ASIO, could bring us up to date as to the percentage of staff of ministerial officers and parliamentary secretary officers-that is those serving the executive-who have been subject to the processes of character and security assessment through that agency. Can we be assured that judgments that are being made as to the appropriateness of staffing are not being made in a way which exposes us to the possibility of security risks? Judgments left to individual ministers can be plainly flawed as to the adequacy of character checks if those kind of agencies are not involved. member for Banks( Mr Melham) has raised a question of what is happening with legal aid. He asserted that legal aid is in crisis, let me assure him that it is not and let me assure him that the expectation of the government is that there will be arrangements in place on 1 July with all jurisdictions which will enable a delivery by legal aid commissions of state and federal funds for legal aid in each jurisdiction. A number of announcements have already been made in relation to individual jurisdictions. In respect of the Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia, it was some time ago announced that in principle, agreement had been reached with each of those jurisdictions for the continuation of a cooperative delivery through the legal aid or legal service commissions of those jurisdictions. In respect of Queensland and New South Wales, it has already been announced that in principle, agreement has been reached with those jurisdictions on the delivery of Commonwealth funds for legal aid through the state legal aid commissions but on an agency or funder provider basis. In the case of Victoria, there has been an announcement made that there will be a combination of the cooperative and the agency arrangements made, initially the cooperati ve arrangement and then the agency arrangement. Negotiations with the two remaining jurisdictions, Tasmania and Western Australia, have progressed well. In fact, with one of them, the negotiations are effectively complete. With the other there is still some detail in relation to guidelines to be determined but we anticipate that",155,Representatives Main Committee
390,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General and Minister for Justice) (12.16 p.m.)-TheThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5935 the requirements will be met in respect of both those jurisdictions in time for a 1 July commencement of new agreements. The member for Banks made some comments about the budget cuts. Let me just say that the government policy is to eliminate budget deficits. One of the problems we have with the inability of the economy in recent years to maintain economic growth on a sustainable basis has been caused by the government debt generating foreign debt as a result of budget deficits and the government has turned around the budgetary situation such that the $10.5 billion deficit that it inherited for the year 1995-96 will, by the year 1988-99, be converted into a surplus. In other words, from a major deficit, through three budgets, there will be a surplus. In respect to legal aid, let me mention that legal aid is not the only item on the access to justice agenda. Community legal centres are increasingly an important source of legal advice and access to justice for individual citizens. There are some 115 of those organisations funded under the Commonwealth budget and funding for them, subject to the indexing, both upwards and downwards--efficiency dividend on the one hand and the CPI indexing on the other-has been maintained, and in excess of $15 million in the current year's budget has provided for CLCs. In addition, you do not need legal aid money from Legal Aid Commissions to be able to obtain legal advice. In any event, legal advice itself is not necessarily the best means of resolving a dispute. In that vein, the government has recently provided some $6 million over three years for 34 new services. (Extension of time granted) I am indebted to the member for Banks and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was talking about mediation and counselling services. It has been demonstrated very well that people who receive relationship education are much less likely to be divorced than people who do not. In fact, those who receive pre-marriage counselling, or are the recipients of education services, have a very low rate of divorce. It may, in part, reflect the fact that those who seek that sort of advice are less likely to be unable to resolve cont1icts that might arise in a relationship. But the fact is that it seems to be effective, we ought to be expanding it, and this government is expanding it. That means that there is less call on agencies like the Family Court. We are seeking to have mediation and counselling focused in community organisations where it is much more available and can be delivered much more inexpensively. That in itself provides access to justice, looked at in a broad way. What we are doing is preventing the need for money to be applied at the wrong end and applying money in an effective way at the front end. So the access to justice story is a bigger one and needs to be looked at. On legal aid itself, let me just add a couple of comments. There has been a major reform of the legal aid delivery system, resulting from the renegotiation of the agreements. The result is likely to be that there will be measures introduced by legal aid commissions, such as those that have been introduced by Victorian legal aid. There will be some categories of cases which will not be funded. That is appropriate. There will be some categories of cases where there will be funding cuts. That also is appropriate. Victorian legal aid has been criticised for imposing a $10,000 limit on partners and a $15,000 on separate representation of children for resolving issues relating to children, that is, residence or contact issues in relation to a particular family. An amount of $35,000 to enable parties to organise a separation seems to me to be more than adequate. If there is an impetus on the part of the lawyers to resolve the matter within 5936 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 that sort of fee cap, there will be correspondingly an impetus for the parties to be a bit more reasonable and not to seek to extend hearings in the Family Court unnecessarily. There has been a lack of application of the notion that legally aided clients should not receive assistance in excess of that received by or available to a person who is funding himself or herself. What we want to do in the guidelines is to ensure that the principle of provision of legal aid to legally assisted clients is limited to the sort of assistance that would be likely to be provided at their own expense by an ordinarily prudent self-funding litigant. The member for Denison( Mr Kerr) has raised a number of questions and, in order to answer those questions in some detail, I would need to take them on notice. Let me offer some broad comment, however. In relation to the Australian Federal Police, the only impact in the current budget on the Australian Federal Police is the efficiency dividend. I cannot tell him precisely what the impact of that may be on staff. I can assure him there is no area of policy responsibility that will be eliminated. But, in his former capacity as minister for justice, he would be well aware that the AFP, like other law enforcement agencies, is unable to investigate every complaint that is made to it. (Extension of time granted) The member for Denison would be well aware of the need by the AFP, like other law enforcement agencies, to prioritise the matters to be investigated. The system that was put in place under the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review in broad terms remains in place for that purpose. As far as overseas po stings are concerned, it is my understanding that there will not be any overseas liaison officers currently in place removed. Without additional funding, it may be difficult to expand the overseas liaison service, but that presently in existence will remain. Those officers are in fact providing a very valuable service. In many cases they operate within one country, but have dealings with a number of others. The officers in Thailand, for example, regularly visit Vietnam and have contact with the liaison officers in Hong Kong who in tum deal with China. As far as the NCA is concerned, again in the current budget there is no cut to the NCA other than the efficiency dividend. But in addition the NCA will, as a result of a new initiative, receive over four years an amount of $20.4 million for a special project in relation to fraud against the Commonwealth. It is anticipated that this will bring in significant revenue to the Commonwealth amounting to some $60 million potentially in tax that would otherwise be uncollected and $30 million in anticipated recoveries of the proceeds of crime as well. Far from cutting staff under the current budget, the NCA will in fact be able to place additional staff in Perth and Adelaide, among other places. I have seen different figures, but I understand it may be up to about six officers in Perth and up to four officers in Adelaide. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is alleged by the member for Denison to have suffered the biggest budget cut of any agency. In fact it has not. It has only suffered the efficiency dividend, like all other agencies, in the current budget. What he presumably is referring to is the anticipated cut in next year's budget which is contained in the forward estimates-an amount of $4.3 million to come off the budget. 1997-98 to 1998-99, it is 27 per cent. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its current form, was established under the 1986 act. Since then, it has grown from a budget of about $5 million in 1986-87 or 1987-88, I forget which, to a budget that at one point",156,Representatives Main Committee
391,Mr Kerr,It is an effective 40 per cent cut.,158,Representatives Main Committee
392,Mr Williams,"No, it is not an effective 40 per cent cut. If you look at the figure fromThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5937 exceeded $20 million. It has grown from a staff of approximately 50 in that 1986-87 period to a staff that at one point exceeded 220. What has happened is that each time a new function has been given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission they have been in effect given a new funding arrangement and, regrettably, a new commissioner. So we now have a commission which comprises a president and six commissioners, each of whom has something that operates, in practical terms, as a separate budget. Attempts by the previous government to achieve a more corporate structure through a review of the commission failed because the review officers failed to agree on a report. Two members were prepared to sign the report, another member was not prepared to sign it. In a time when money is in short supply and there is a necessity to bring the budget into balance or surplus, the funding available to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is, in general terms, more than adequate and it is appropriate that there be a significant cut to the budget. The commission is expected, in consequence, to run a more efficient ship, to run a ship that is administered corporately. There is in fact being debated today a bill which will enable some reform of the commission to take place. The effect would be to transfer complaint processing to a full-time president, taking it out of the hands of the individual commissioners. The commissioners would then be able to focus to a greater extent upon the portfolio responsibilities in their own areas, but principally in the education area, which I suspect has suffered somewhat through the need for the individual commissioners to be involved in the conciliation of complaints. I am sure that the commission will be able to live within its budget and still achieve much that is expected of it by the community. But, like every other agency in the government, it has to live within the government's means. That will mean that there will be some cost cutting. It will also mean that some things that the individual commissioners might like to do will not be able to be done. But hopefully it will mean that individual commissioners, together with the president, will decide on what are the priority areas for action, rather than leaving it to individual commissioners to engage in personal interests. The Administrative Review Council report Better decisions has been considered by cabinet. The member for Denison is probably aware that an announcement has been made that the cabinet in principle accepted the recommendations of that report and established a interdepartmental committee to consider how the recommendations might be implemented. I have seen with some interest the article under the name of Roderick Campbell in the Canberra Times last Monday, 16 June, and I am interested to see how what is suggested there would be consistent with the cabinet decision. Plainly, it is not. But let us not attempt to speculate on what cabinet might decide when the interdepartmental committee reports to it. That is likely to happen in the near future and we will all be able to act on the cabinet decision. The member for Denison also mentioned a debate between himself and others and the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the member for Warringah ( Mr Abbott), regarding a member of his staff who has apparently left and gone to join the staff of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I am unable to answer his precise question off the top of my head as to the percentage of staff of ministers and parliamentary secretaries who are security checked through ASIO and through other means, but that information can be obtained. 5938 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 As the member for Warringah said, the same processes that were in train under the previous government are still in place under this government. It is not all staff who have access to highly confidential or higher classified material, and I have no knowledge whatever about the individual status of that former member of the member for Warringah's staff. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I have dealt with all of the issues that have been raised. of Commonwealth offence. What happens in trials that involve Commonwealth offences and state offences, who is going to bear the brunt of that? You have a number of drug matters where the accused is charged with Commonwealth offences in relation to importation, and the accused could also be charged with state offences. What happens in bankcard offences? If you are dealing with a Commonwealth bank, you have a mixture of Commonwealth and state offences. I am interested, and I am sure the parliament is interested at the moment, in what constitutes a Commonwealth offence and what will the Commonwealth fund? Are there areas of disagreement as to what does constitute a Commonwealth offence, or are the officials still deciding what the definition means? The Attorney-General has confirmed in his contribution today that the bean counters did get to this part of the budget. I think it is a false dividend. He talks about the efficiency dividend and the deficit and having to rein in the deficit, and at the same time he talks about a number of cases that will no longer be funded. That is going to produce false economies of scale because if an accused is not represented, will the judge discharge the accused because he or she cannot get a fair trial? If the judge does not discharge them, you will then have unrepresented accused and that will slow down the trial process. Trials that go for one week or less will go longer because the judge will be required to take more caution in terms of that trial. I know this because I have had that experience. Jockey Smith was a classic when it came to representing himself. He could tie up the courts in New South Wales for six months at a time and then he would get legal aid on his appeal and get a fresh trial. That is what is going to happen. When I was a public defender, when I was a legal aid solicitor, the efficiency dividend was applied overwhelmingly by having a legal representative in there who had, in effect, no incentive to prolong a matter. Cases were run efficiently. Accused were getting proper advice. Pleas of guilty were being conducted at an earlier stage. Sentence indications were given. It was churning over. These cuts are going to mean that people are not going to get legal advice. With no legal advice they are going to go into the courts and clog the system up. There will be pleas of not guilty when there should be pleas of guilty. This is going to have a multiplier effect. That is why the judges are screaming blue murder. That is going to be the result. The bean counters are going to bring the system to a halt. There has been a clear message. Look at what the High Court has had to do. It has just had the efficiency dividend applied to it and it was left with two options: does it sit less often and not go around the countryside, or does it close to the public on weekends and public holidays? The High Court took the correct decision. That has meant that there is no access to that court on weekends and public holidays. The public cannot go through the court to familiarise themselves with the highest court in the land. I think that the High Court was left with no option. The High Court should be quarantined from the efficiency dividend. Fancy placing the court in that position. You have the President",158,Representatives Main Committee

They made the correct decision. To sit less often would have been the wrong decision. But that is something you can blame the bean counters for. Again, it sends the wrong message. There are some areas-and this is one of them-where they have got it drastically wrong, and time will show that. At the time when racism is being encouraged in this community, when there are more complaints of racial abuse and vilification coming at all levels in New South Wales and elsewhere, we go after HREOC. What kind of message does that send to the rednecks in the community? It says that government is responding to their low grade, prejudiced and ill informed concerns. You have the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) claiming credit for government policy. It sends the wrong message. HREOC was expanded, and specialised divisions are the way to go, in my opinion. We should be encouraging HREOC and Auditors General and a whole range of other independent watchdogs, not gutting them, which is what this budget has done. (Time expired) colleague, the member for Banks( Mr Melham) concerning the closure of the High Court on weekends and public holidays, and in particular the attack made on the administration of the High Court by my Canberra parliamentary colleague and President of the Senate, Senator Reid-uncharacteristically for her-a most unreasonable and unwarranted attack upon public servants doing a job for which the government had given them no choice. many issues in Canberra over the years that we have both represented this area, particularly in the years when we both represented it in the Senate. She has not been one prone to the tendency of the conservative side of politics to attack public servants for decisions forced on them by governments. In all that time she has had it pretty easy. It was easy for her to attack because if there were decisions she disagreed with, she was always in power so she could attack the government. But decisions like this were not forced upon agencies. It is not that they did not have to make hard decisions, they did, but there was never a decision such as this, to close the High Court in Canberra with significant adverse consequences. But the member for Banks is correct. The decision to close the High Court on weekends and public holidays was the lesser of the two evils facing the administration of the High Court. I do not welcome the decision; it should be reversed. But it cannot be reversed by the administration of the High Court at the price of limiting access to justice for Australians elsewhere. I do not want to take this. Obviously, I have a parochial concern. The Canberra economy has been driven into recession and continues to be in recession, and one of the few areas which has any growth element at all is the tourist industry. One of the significant elements of tourism is access to the great national institutions, of which the High Court is one. That is of great concern for me as the member for Canberra. But actually, I am more concerned about the decision for other Australians. At least the people of Canberra and the people from the region-even as far away as Sydney-can make arrangements to come to see this great institution. If the first time they come it is not open, they can come back another time. The Liberal government is essentially a Sydney government. It drives the people of Canberra quite mad when they see headlines saying, 'Canberra decides ... '. We had one cabinet",160,Representatives Main Committee

We have worked together on5940 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 meeting held in Sydney with not one person from Canberra present in the room, and yet the headline said, 'Canberra decides ... '. I have to say that none of us here made the decision, and I have not found anyone who actually agreed with it. But that is beside the point. What we now have is a Sydney government looking at the world through Sydney eyes, and they do not realiseconcerned about the policiesNorth Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia-the home area of the Attorney-General( Mr Williams), where I also grew up-ome to Canberra only once, if that. Most never come but, if they do come, they come once. Most Australians do not travel around in aeroplanes, because they do not have the money. When they come to Canberra, they expect to be able to see the things which their taxes have paid for and which represent the great national capital of this country. This closure is the first step down a road that denies Australians, wherever they live, access and the opportunity, equally, to see the best that Australia has to offer; and it is a decision that causes me great concern. I hope the Attorney will make it clear that he does not share the view of my parliamentary colleague, Senator Reid, that this was a decision, the responsibility for which should be sheeted home to the administration of the High Court. Those officers are good officers and are not responsible for the decision. It was imposed upon them by the cuts made by the government. for Banks( Mr Melham) from a slightly different perspective and take up the issue of cuts to the legal aid budget. It is plain that the budget savings that were proposed and put forward in the 1996-97 federal budget will not be achieved. Whatever savings are ultimately achieved will be significantly less than were provided for in the budget, and so all the disruption and pain, all the destruction of national uniformity, and all the destruction of the work of the Legal Aid Board-which was established with a view to actually getting some coherence in the system-will be suffered for a return which will be nowhere near that which the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced in relation to the budget. I appreciate that some of these new arrangements are not yet in place and that some may never be put in place, because of the difficulties of negotiating them. But I would appreciate it if the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) could advise us of the difference between that which was set out as savings to be achieved in that budget and the ultimate reductions in Commonwealth expenditures that emerge, because the savings will be nowhere near those which were first projected. In other words, all this cost has been for very little gain to the budget, and certainly not the substantial gain to the budget that was projected. There will be a substantial shortfall. I appreciate the Attorney-General's undertaking to find and to tell us about the percentage of those in ministerial employment who have been subject to the scrutiny of the security services and the like.

401,Mr Kerr (Denison) (12.46 P.m.),"I will approach the issue that was raised by the memberThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5941 employed without the capacity of all of this to have been gone through beforehand-the scrutiny process is still substantially incomplete. Plainly, if that is so, we would wish to know why it is that that lack of responsibility-in terms of our perception of our vulnerability in these key areas-would be allowed to be sustained. I appreciate the minister's willingness to provide some detailed advice relating to the cuts to the AFP. I wonder whether the minister could actually undertake to table or provide the menu as adjusted to take into account the ongoing funding reductions that that organisation is suffering. I do not accept that the only reductions have been those related to efficiency gains because, in fact, there have been associated detriments to the overall effectiveness of the AFP which I think go well beyond the normal burden that other organisations have had to suffer. I think there was an accelerated efficiency gain that was imposed. I have two final points to make and, again, I appreciate the Attorney's comments in relation to the apparent inconsistency of the cabinet decision and the report in the Canberra Times, but I would appreciate the Attorney's assurance that he will fight to maintain merits review. It is not enough merely to observe that this inconsistency apparently has emerged within officials. Given that he has a cabinet decision which supports his position and, given that the Attorney does have a responsibility to ensure that fair processes are capable of being obtained by Australian citizens, whatever the arguments for or against better decisions, I would appreciate his undertaking that he will fight to maintain a fair system of administrative review with a merit system built in. The final point I would make is in relation to a matter which overlaps with my immigration responsibilities. The Attorney would be aware of reports that a number of North Koreans, some of whom are alleged to have had significant criminal records of kidnapping, rape and other like offences, recently arrived in Australia on visitors visas. The Attorney mayor may not be aware that I have publicly called for the minister for immigration to review those processes to advise us how this might have happened. I ask the Attorney: what steps, if any, are within his jurisdiction through the AFP to ensure that proper processes are in place so that people with serious criminal convictions do not get visitors visas to this country. (Time expired) Court closing at weekends, as did the member for Banks( Mr Melham). Both members will be aware that my department assisted the High Court in a review with a view to seeing what measures were open. A number of options were canvassed and two mentioned by the member for Banks were among them. Obviously it is better that the court close at weekends than the court cease to be an itinerant court. I think the member for Canberra put it plainly when he spoke about tourism. The High Court budget is not a budget designed for tourist purposes. It is an advantage to the court that it is known to the community and it is seen to be accessible. It is open whenever the court is sitting-it is open on week days. Not every public institution that tourists would like to visit is open on weekends. If the Canberra Tourist Bureau would like to make a contribution to the High Court budget in order to assist, I am sure the High Court registrar would be pleased to receive the funding. I am told that it would, in fact, cost something like $8 per tourist to keep the High Court open on weekends, having regard to the number of people who visit.",162,Representatives Main Committee

403,Be Brief In Response. The Member For Canberra ( Mr Mcmullan) Raised The Question Of The High,"5942 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 The comments by the President of the Senate were obviously in defence of her constituency, as the member for Canberra's comments here today are in defence of his constituency, and I really make no further comment on them. The member for Denison( Mr Kerr) referred to a number of things. The cuts in legal aid will, in fact, achieve approximately what was set out in the forward estimates and I do not understand any suggestion to the contrary. The separate point which the member for Banks made, but I did not understand the member for Denison to be making in his comment, was thatMr Kerr interjectingall the figures before you can conclude what has happened. There seems to be some misunderstanding on the part of commentators as to the nature of the arrangements that have been entered into, but it is not an appropriate time as yet to indicate what has been achieved. The point the member for Banks was making that, for example, an unrepresented litigant is going to impose additional costs on the budget, I think is at this point speculative. We need to monitor what is going to happen. Let me make the point that I intended to make earlier on. We have reached a point where the community has said, 'This is the amount of money that is going to be available for legal aid.' If the courts have a different view as to what is required for legal aid, then the courts have two choices. One is that trials cannot go ahead and the other is that the courts can review and reform their processes. There is a lot that can be done. Legal aid has tended to be treated as a bottomless pit by some legal practitioners. Courts have not really had regard to the limited resources available to litigants, and the time has come when there should be a clear focus on that. I think the onus now, having regard to what has been achieved, is on the legal profession and on the courts. and is effectively dealt with in guidelines that are being either put in place or negotiated, so that should not be an issue. I do not think the fact that there will be charges-as is already the case in some cases, both under state law and Commonwealth law-will be a problem, because it is a simple matter to have a pro rata charging of the legal aid funding to the state and to the separate Commonwealth sources. (Extension of time granted) The matter of the security check of ministerial and parliamentary secretary staff requires no further comment. The member for Denison is wrong in suggesting that the AFP has been subjected to additional cuts. It has had cuts in previous years. Some of those cuts were imposed by the previous government. They obviously have an impact, and they have a cumulative effect as well, but this year it is only an efficiency dividend. On merits review, I am committed to merits review and I will obviously be participating in any review of the IDC report. The matter of the Korean immigrants is principally a matter for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock). The AFP does provide advice to the department of that minister, as the member for Denison is aware, and will continue to do so. relation to the menu of matters.

Environment (Senator Hill) in a position to provide the information which was sought in the Senate estimates committee about the difference between the coalition's pre-election commitments to fund the Natural Heritage Trust, and the forward estimates of the previous government? The consequential questions that were asked related to the difference between the previous core funding for the environment, which was in place prior to the last election, and the reduced expenditure under the coalition as a result of the transfer of functions out of that core funding and other budget reductions. So the first question is: is the government yet in a position to identify what it says is the shortfall between previous core funding and current core funding? The second issue I would appreciate the minister's advice on relates to the RFA process in our own state of Tasmania. As the minister may be aware, the RFA process in Tasmania is moving towards a conclusion, albeit it is unlikely to be concluded by the 30th of this month, as was anticipated at an earlier stage. One of the obvious issues which is causing concern to participants in that process is the question of the reservation of forest types on private land. By way of background, a simple summary, it is plain that the scoping agreement targets of reservations of 15 per cent of forest types that were in place pre-1750 and the 60 per cent old growth and 90 per cent wilderness targets simply cannot be met in Tasmania, in any credible way, without massive destruction to the forest industry and without there being an associated preservation of some of those forest types on private land. The difficulty emerges as to who is going to take funding responsibility and management responsibility for those reservations. At present, it is my understanding that the Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments are deadlocked on this issue. Why has the Commonwealth yet to ante-up some serious proposal for it to take some responsibility to ensure the success of the RFA process? The Labor Party, in government, established the RFA process and wished that process to conclude to its successful end point. The current government asserted that it is committed to that. Yet the whole process could founder on the failure to provide a sufficient confidence in the system that necessary reservations on private land will be protected, not necessarily by acquisition, as some urge, but by at least some Commonwealth involvement",164,Representatives Main Committee

410,Mr Kerr (Denison) (1.00 P.m.),"Is the minister representing the Minister for the5944 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 in a management process and a commitment to necessary funding. This may need to be evolved should there become some issues of a compensation or the need to protect the forested areas from land clearances or from some other initiatives that might emerge down the track. Plainly, the state government has been placed in the budgetary position in which it has been placed by this Commonwealth government, with the massive reductions that have occurredagainst a background which the minister would be aware of in our own state, where the state itself plainly does not have a financial capacity to meet those ongoing obligations yet the Commonwealth budget is moving into surplus. It is at least $187 million short of its pre-election commitments on funding to the national trust to date and will not apparently ante-up even a modest amount of money to secure confidence that forests on private lands can be built into an outcome in the RFA, which will enable us to have both an environmentally credible and an employment credible solution to that issue. contribution to the consideration in detail of Appropriation Bill (No.1) for the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories is to restate my personal concern and very strong objection to the decision which the government made to premise any commitment to the improvement and maintenance of the Australian environment on whether or not it was able to sell one-third of Telstra. I believe that that was one of the most indefensible abrogations of national responsibility which has ever been perpetrated by any national government in Australia. At the time of that debate, when that matter was being considered, I said that the government was, in effect, saying to the Australian people that-despite the fact that many of the great river systems of Australia are being serious degraded; despite the increasing salination of Australian rivers; despite the destruction of Australian forests, the degradation of the soils, the impoverishment of many of our coastal areas-if the Australian people and the Australian parliament were not prepared to allow it to sell one-third of Telstra, then the Australian environment could go to hell. That is what the government told us, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. That is what the government told the parliament, and that is what the government told the Australian people as well. If one-third of Telstra were not to be sold, then the Australian environment-with all of that deterioration and degradation and the threat to Australia's future arising from that damage to the environment--could go to hell. That was a deplorable decision. It was an abrogation of national responsibility in the extreme. It was one of the worse examples of a decision made by a national government that has ever been seen in Australia. I want to make this point as well: I have very serious reservations about the genuineness of the proposed Natural Heritage Fund. If one-third of Tclstra is sold and it realises what may be available from it-and that has been estimated at possibly $12 billion or $14 billion-then $1 billion of that will go into what has been referred to as the Natural Heritage Fund. I am concerned about the genuineness of this government in the disbursement of those funds and the application of them to particular problems of the environment in Australia. I am concerned, because it simply repeats a practice which has become apparent in the operation of the government of Australia under the present coalition government. The other one is the Federation Fund. It is going to be interesting to see how those funds are applied, to which projects they go, and in whose electorates.",165,Representatives Main Committee
411,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (1.05 P.m.),"The reason that I want to make aThursday, 19 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5945 Another example is the reintroduction of a program called the roads of national importance. There is one road of national importance, Mr Deputy Speaker, for which you, in particular, have been persistent and courageous for years in pursuing work: the Pacific Highway. Money will be allocated to that, but I am concerned about where the rest of it will go. I believe very firmly and very genuinely that those funds will be used to pork-barrel. There will not be a strict application of funds according to objective criteria and objective priorities. We have thus got three examples. The Natural Heritage Fund has ostensibly been established to correct the degradation of the Australian environment. I will be watching to see what projects those funds are applied to. The Federation Fund will be another slush fund, another pork-barrel fund. And the most recent one is the roads of national importance program. (Extension of time granted) The particular project that I want to mention is the Natural Heritage Fund. As I said, I opposed the sale of Telstra and I opposed the funding of environmental programs and projects in that way. But since the decision has been made by the government-and presumably at some time in the future, then, the fund will be established-I want to put in a very strong bid for Lake Macquarie in New South Wales. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not very far from you and I know that you are a frequent visitor to the beauties of that lake. It is the largest coastal saltwater lake in Australia. But, because of its location, because of the nature of the urban development that has taken place around it and because of the nature of the very high risk industries which have developed around Lake Macquarie-in particular, power generation and mineral concentration and processing-there has been some very serious degradation of Lake Macquarie. Because those particular examples of degradation have taken place as a result of the national contribution which that region has made to the national economy and to the national welfare, I believe that a more than adequate case can be made out for restoration and remediation of the problems of Lake Macquarie being financed from national resources by the national government. I want to mark the spot as far as Lake Macquarie is concerned. I have written to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) asking that top priority be given to the needs of Lake Macquarie, in relation not just to some of the heavy metals that people have referred to recently as a particular problem but to the whole question of having an estuarine management plan developed. Very clear priorities can then be determined in relation to Lake Macquarie and appropriate funds can be provided to make sure that that magnificent lake system is returned to a pristine condition. It will be able to continue to make the very substantial contribution that it has made in the past to the future of Australia, not only in terms of urban development and industrial development but also because of the extremely important recreation and tourism role that it fulfils at the present time. It is one of the most magnificent saltwater lakes in the world and it must be preserved and restored. concern in this great nation of ours today and if we had more time we could raise quite a few of them. The particular one I would like the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) or his representative in the chamber to be aware of is the proposal relating to the Fitzroy River, which is one of the great wild rivers remaining in Australia. The proposal is to dam the river and erect other irrigation infrastructure. I believe that that is something that he ought to consider. Certainly back in 1983 the Franklin Dam established the precedent and the right and responsibility of the Commonwealth to be involved in these issues.",166,Represent Atives Main Committee
412,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (1.13 P.m.),"There are a lot of environmental issues of5946 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 One of the two or more dam projects that might be proposed on the Fitzroy River will almost certainly be located at Diamond Gorge, a remote and beautiful site north of Fitzroy Crossing. It is a haven for rare bird species, such as the gouldian finch, the purple-crowned wren and also species such as the rock ringtail possum. Tim Fisher-not the Deputy Prime Minister, but Tim Fisher of the Australian Conservation Foundation-has pointed out that a whole series of adverse environmental impacts would come from such a proposal, including significantly reduced wet season flows and much larger dry season flows, which would effectively reverse the natural flow patterns. In addition, the dams would create impassable barriers to fish, particularly migratory fish that have to move up and down stream to complete their live cycles, and the ecology of the river would be radically affected. For these and many other reasons, I would urge the Commonwealth and the Minister for the Environment to be involved in this issue. The Fitzroy River is one of the last, long wild rivers remaining in Australia and, in my view, to dam it would be an environmental tragedy. Communications and the Arts estimates that are also before us, with particular relevance to the arts matters. I will try, in terms of the agreement between the whips, to compress three or four issues into one and a half contributions because I know that we neLd to make sure the minister has some time to respond to a range of issues across a range of portfolios. I want to first raise some issues concerning the film industry. Overall the film industry is in the position of the arts as a whole from this budget. They are expected to be thankful because the extent of the cuts this year is not as great as the extent of the cuts last year. The cuts are nevertheless substantial when looked at cumulatively. We have a small cut to the Australian Film Finance Corporation arising from the efficiency dividend. The efficiency dividend, however it is described, still comes from the program money available to the Film Finance Corporation this year. That was made clear in the Senate estimates. We have on the face of it a $6.2 million cut to the Australian Film Commission, which is substantial, but underestimates the true position. The parliamentary library research indicates that in 1995-96 the forward estimates were expected to increase to $50 million and yet we find the Film Commission budget at $29.7 million. On the face of it, there is a direct obvious cut on the budget papers, acknowledged by the government, of a cumulative $6.2 million to the Australian Film Commission. In fact, compared to the Labor government's planning, it is a much greater cut. We have in addition the pressure on Film Australia, speculation about its privatisation and the uncertainty about what will happen there. In cumulative terms for this industry that means that we are cutting its research and development. That is essentially how the Film Commission is most simply described. It is more than that but is that. We are cutting its venture capital because that is essentially what the Film Commission and the Film Finance Corporation supply. Then this is compounded by the impact of cuts to the ABC. The film and television industry is more than just an industry because it says a lot about us as a nation in its cultural role. In other circumstances, I would speak about that at length, but we have the agreement to be brief. I will not go into that. I will simply acknowledge that we must recognise it. It is a very important industry and it creates lot of jobs. WhatI have been seeking, and what we did not seem to get out of the Senate estimates committee, is whether the government has made any assessment of the cumulative impact on",167,Representatives Main Committee

That is one matter on which I would like some response. Secondly, I am concerned about the continuing speculation about the sale of Artbank. It might be fortuitous that it is under both the Communications and the Arts and Finance portfolios. We might be able to get some response on both accounts if the Minister for Administrative Services( Mr Jull) is representing the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) here also. Artbank has not for five years made any call on the budget and there is no prospect tha, it ever will. Yet by proposing to sell it there is a major threat to the income of emerging visual artists in Australia. There is a threat to the income of artists and private galleries where we have what I would have thought the conservatives would think is the ideal form of support for an industry, not grants but commercial purchases of the work of Australian artists against which a return is anticipated, that is being achieved. What is the cultural or financial benefit that the government sees itself achieving by persisting with its attempts to sell Artbank? When it is going to stop the insecurity and the uncertainty that the continuing playing with this important enterprise is having in the visual arts in Australia and on that important organisation, Artbank? Those are the first two matters I wish to raise. (Extension of time granted) The other two matters which I wish to raise, which I will try to do briefly, relate to the heading in the estimates concerning cultural development assistance and some matters to do with literature. In the cultural development assistance area, it is true that the cuts to the Australia Council and to cultural development assistance overall are not as great as last year. On the face of it they seem small, but when we start looking at them we find more emerges. I would like to get some clarification about the details of the $1.5 million cut in cultural development assistance to fund the ongoing activities of the Visions of Australia program. I was the minister who initiated the Visions of Australia program. I welcome the fact that the government has made a continuing commitment to it, even if only till 1998-99. I would rather it had been more substantial through the forward estimates period, but even that is welcome. But to do so, it is not extra money for the arts. The arts area is being called upon to fund this by other cuts, and nobody yet knows where that cut is going to fall. We also have the problem that, following last year's two per cent across-the-board cuts to all the great Australian arts institutions funded through the major organisations fund of the Australia Council, we see the evidence this year that virtually all of those agencies are suffering great stress because of the difficult economic times, which is putting pressure on sponsorships and ticket sales. There is nothing in this budget to assist those organisations and nothing to compensate for the two per cent cut last year. We still find the funding for the Australia Council at less than the 1995-96 funding. What does the government have in mind to assist Australian arts in general and, in particular, my current concern, which is the major national organisations and the major organisations fund? The other hidden cut in the budget is to the National Film and Sound Archive. I welcome the commitment to build the new building for the National Film and Sound Archive. It was a scandalous decision last year to cancel the commitment of the previous budget to build a new building. I welcome the fact that there is now some funding through the Department of Finance to meet part of the cost of a new building. But when we look, what we find is that 5948 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 June 1997 at least half the cost of that building is going to have to be met by cuts in the other ongoing activities of the National Film and Sound Archive and the Department of Communications and the Arts. That has not been made public, but it is clear, on the face of it, and what we want to know is: what are the implications of those cuts for the other programs of the National Film and Sound Archive and for the arts in general? I have not got time to talk about the public lending rights; I have discussed that before. I think this government has led a most mean spirited attack upon arts in Australia, but I will discuss that on another occasion. I want to ask one question about libraries. The government went to the election with a commitment of $11.4 million for what has now become known as the on-line public access initiative, merely to match a budgeted commitment of the previous government. But it obviously was not a core promise because what you have provided was $2 million, not $11.4 million. That was in the last budget. I understand, and I would like the minister to confirm, that applications were received for $25 million of funding under that program. Last week a distribution of the $2 million was announced. There is nothing further in this budget. What prospect is there of your $11.4 million promise ever being met? Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (1.25 p.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker and members for your contributions. Given the limitation of time, I will try to do justice to those matters, and what matters I cannot deal with I will undertake to get some answers on for honourable members. The member for Denison( Mr Kerr) raised several matters. The first one was with regard to overall funding for the environment and whether core funding, the promise that had previously been made, had indeed been met. We undertook, prior to the last election, that we would spend an additional $1.15 billion over the five years, on top of the previous government's forward estimates. That is an average of about $230 million each year. In 199596, the previous government spent $212 million on environmental programs, and your forward estimates for 1997-98 were $171 million on environmental programs. In 1997-98, we will spend $255 million, an increase of $84 million, a 50 per cent increase. Your forward estimates for next year, that is 1998-99, were to be $147 million. So we will spend in 1998-99, $267 million on environment programs, an increase of $120 million. That is an 80 per cent increase. And this is despite the environment program having to find savings announced in last year's budget of $34 million to help repair, of course, the deficit that we inherited. In other words, the environment programs-when you look closely at the figures against what we said we would do, and against your own forward estimates which were part of what our undertaking was-are contrary to what you have said and contrary to what I read recently in The Age by Kenneth Davidson, and in yesterday's Bulletin. I think that they are the basic figures that one should start with and then, in addition, of course, there is the Natural Heritage Trust. that we would undertake to spend in addition and above to meet the $1.15 billion target ahead",168,Representatives Main Committee

I understand that they have been put down in the estimates, as well, by Senator Hill. was brought up by the member for Denison concerned the RFA process. It related to the question of private land and how that would be treated in the process of the negotiations. The negotiations, I can report to the Chamber, are at a penultimate stage. We may meet the 30 June date-one is still hopeful. Negotiations and discussions are continuing with all the relevant parties. The issue of the preservation and reservation of the private land to which you refer, is an issue that is actively being considered by the states and the Commonwealth, as you would appreciate. The point that was made by the member for Denison was that are there are ways in which acquisition, or a management process, or funding, or compensation, or other such initiatives might emerge to give effect to the desire to reserve significant species within private forestry to meet the overall criteria of the CAR reserve system under the Janis criteria. I accept the point that is being made by the member for Denison. These are very difficult issues but we, like any sensible people within the broader parliament, would want to get an RFA that is successful, to give some sustainability and certainty in the forest industries. How that might be funded, if indeed funding is required, is a matter that is actively being considered by my colleague Senator Hill and by me when I assume the position, as I did last week, of Acting Minister for the Environment, and I am sure, if that occasion arises again, that I will give it very active consideration. (Extension of time granted) The point about mining issues-because they were involved in the RFA process-involves my colleague, Senator Parer. The member for Charlton( Mr Brown) basically made three points. The fact, of course, is that the parliament has approved the sale of Telstra and therefore given effect to the government's policy. SoI acknowledge your right to make the points that you have but, of course, the parliament has chosen to go in a different direction from that of your own views. Concerning your question about the NHT, the genuineness of the fund, we believe that the process of assessment of projects involves states, local government and independence of the technical assessment panels. I am sure that they, for example, would be looking closely at the applications for Lake Macquarie funding. We are very cognisant of the need to have a fund of that size vested with genuineness and integrity and we have tried to put in place processes that will deliver those particular outcomes. The first project of the Federation Fund was announced by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) as being the National Museum here in Canberra. We are developing criteria about the assessment but, broadly, they will be major items such as a national museum that will be looked at in conjunction with the states around the nation. That too will be a transparent process. Roads of national importance-the other point you made-do not really fall into either of the portfolios that I am involved in. From your remarks, and as a former minister for roads, I think you appreciate the need for such a program. That is a matter for my colleague Minister Sharp. I think there has broadly been a very warm welcome of that proposal by local",170,Representatives Main Committee

I take notice of the points made by the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson). It was not part of the budget process, but I am sure that comments that he has made will be passed to Senator Hill. think I am going to be able to do justice to at the moment, partly because I do not have all the information. Some of it may have been dealt with in estimates, but I will undertake to find out the points that you have referred to. Broadly speaking, you asked the fundamental core question of whether or not there has been any assessment of the cumulative impact of the changes that have arisen in the budget with regard to the film industry. The information that I have, provided by Senator Alston, does not answer that question specifically, but it does point out that the funding for the Film Finance Corporation was maintained. There was a reduction of $5 million in the television production fund to which you referred, but there are continuing access arrangements for the tax deductibility for films, which I think you acknowledged, if I recall your remarks. Concerning your point about the R&D being reduced, in a sense that is still available through the tax deductibility provisions. The TPF fund still continues, but it has been reduced. That, of course, is to meet broader budget objectives so it may not be quite as detrimental as you point out. On the issue of Artbank and the continuing uncertainty, the government is still considering that matter and the points that you made are, of course, noted. I make the point that I know there is no diminution of the personal commitment from the minister respoilsible in this area, Senator Alston. I am sure that he will be making decisions that will give effect to recognising the qualities in Artbank. Whether it should be operated by government or by some other private arrangement is the issue that government will have to decide upon. They will obviously be considering that matter in some detail and will make a decision in due course. Concerning the cultural development assistance and the $1.5 million cuts to the Visions of Australia program, which you yourself commenced, it has been indicated that that will be continuing and you have welcomed that. We certainly welcome that. Concerning maintenance of the funds for the Australia Council, those funds are actually maintained at the same level as in the previous budget, as I understand it. That is important. On the issue of the library, I simply do not have any information about that, and I do not have any knowledge on that matter but, as I understand it, funds have been applied. Your point was whether or not the amount that is applied is equal to the amount that was anticipated to be applied-some $25 million versus the $11 million. I would assume that what is taking place here is funding over a period of time. There is a commitment to library matters. That is the sum total of the comments that were made. IfI have missed any matter, if members want further information, please let me know and I will undertake to provide it. would provide additional information.
