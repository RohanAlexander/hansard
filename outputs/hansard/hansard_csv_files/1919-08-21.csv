The Conunonwealth agrees to make available to the States the' necessary funds to enJapanese boat, after unloading merchandise at able the advance of £625 per settler to be made. The interest charged the States is that at whicb tbe Commonwealtb borrows, less a rebate of £25,000 for every £1,000,000 made available.

Whether, if thc Government cannot see its way clear to disclose the name of the person making a charge against an internee, it w ill arrange that the accused shall be informed of the terms of the charge, and of the reasons why it is proposed to deport him? 3. Whether the Government w ill allow every internee to call witnesses to prove that he has not been disloyal to the Britisli Allies during the war, ancl that during his residence in Australia he has been an honest, law-abiding, and industrious resident? 4. Whether, in cases where an accused person is unable, on the ground of expense or other cause, to bring witnesses from distant parts of Australia to Holdsworthy, New South Wales, he w ill be allowed to have his witnesses examined on oath by a justice of the peace or other qualified person in the town or place at which said witnesses reside? 5. Whetlier the Government w ill permit all internees whom it is decided to deport to remain in Australia under surveillance during such reasonable time as the Board may decide, in order that they may dispose of their businesses, farms, or ""otlier property? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The present practice is to call upon the internee to supply evidence in support of bis application for permission to remain in Australia. It is not intended to adopt the course suggested in this question. The incident referred to occurred only in one State, and as soon as it was noticed at Head-Quarters, the State Commandant was instructed to take a l l steps necessary to allay any anxiety caused 2. The internee is informed of the class of information -he should have available for the Board, such as length of residence, family ties, loyalty, &c, and every opportunity is given to him to obtain same. After hearing the case, the Board states whether it thinks the internee should be allowed to stay or should be deported. On receipt of such statement, the Minister, to secure uniformity of decision, refers cases of doubt to the Release Commission for further consideration. The procedure suggested is not considered as suitable as the present procedure.. 3. ,The internee is permitted to obtain written declarations or statements showing that he was not disloyal, and as to his character. It is not considered necessaiy to permit witnesses to be called, as tile present system gives the internee a l l necessary protection. 4. Written declarations' or statements supplied by an internee are accepted as evidence, in the form of a declaration or letters. 5. This is governed by the question of shipping. It is not possible to hold boats back, but, as far as possible, facilities are given to arrange their business affairs through agents or attorneys. It would not be possible to adopt the suggestion made. orable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked, with reference to the running of the trams in Melbourne, Avhether it would be possible to make the stoppage, considered necessary, between the hours of 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., and allow the trams to continue running at night time for the convenience of the public, as this would not consume any more coal, and the fires could be banked up. I have now to say that this matter has received the consideration, of the Central Coal Board. The present regulations were drawn up at a conference of the tramway and electric power managements with the Board. It was at the time suggested that a reduction of running might be effected during the day, but. those competent to speak on this subject stated that no economy of fuel could be effected by such a proposition, as it would be necessary to maintain pressure of steam to meet recurrent load, and it was therefore decided that the only effective way of",23,Japanese Shippi Ng At Rabaul Pigott Asked The Acting Prime Min

Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply-pro posed. to bring under the notice of the House a matter affecting not only myself, but the good name of the Commonwealth in its treatment of soldiers and ofiicers. When I returned to Australia. I did what I thought was a good tur n to those who were concerned in the dispute on the troopship Somali, but I was charged with inciting to mutiny, and, under a dragnet clause that is part of the regulations of the BritishA m y , w i th conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. I was guilty of neither of those offences. The evidence has not yet been laid on the table of the Library, or I might make pointed reference to it in order to prove my statement in that regard. During the t r i a l not onej individual was brought forward who said he was influenced in any way into being mutinous by anything I said to ham. Some of the evidence brought against me was secured by means of the civil police, (Formal). who went throughout Victoria to obtain it . Two witnesses were brought from country districts to Melbourne for the purpose. Their evidence was of such a character that one of them was treated as hostile and cross-questioned by the representative of the Crown. The eviOF CONSTITUTION-DIS but both of them came down under the impression, which they made no secret of, APthat they were coming to Melbourne to give evidence on my behalf. That was the kitnd of witness brought down to give evidence against me so far as the ',' digger "" was concerned. As regards officers, all the evidence on which I was convicted was given by sergeant-majors, and any man who knows what a sergeant-major is need not be told that he is the go'between between the tyranny of the officer plied. Not one of them gave conclusive evidence that I had done anything to in cite the men to mutiny. If I had the evidence here, I could quote passages which prove that the sergeant-major of major on the voyage, swore that he stood within 10 feet of me when I made the utterance complained of. The other sergeant-major said he was coming fro m the hospital along the hurricane deck, and that he stood alongside the other I wish officer. That was an absolute impossibility, because the well deck was in between the hospital and the place where I addressed the troops. That point, however, was taken no notice of. That is a sample of the evidence given against me by the officers who came forward to swear that I incited to mutiny. I assure honourable members that if I had been the bloodthirsty individual they make me out to be, and had wanted to create a real mutiny on the vessel on that voyage, it would not have taken more than five minutes to do so. I did not want a mutiny. I simply wanted the "" diggers "" to get the treatment to which they were entitled as men who had gone overseas and suffered greatly on behalf of the Empire.

Not only was to us by I robbed of my liberty for. a certain time, but but it cost me a fair sum out of pocket. I consider that I have been very harshly dealt with in the view taken of my action on that occasion. When we arrived at Colombo, we had one case of sickness aboard. We carried twenty-six Cingalese who had offered their services to the I do not Empire, but who were not required on but one account of the Armistice being signed, and they were brought back to their homes on our ship. It was one of these men that was sick, and he was taken ashore at Colombo. That is the only suspicious case of influenza bhat we had throughout who, on one occasion, the trip . We l e f t Colombo, and had a not eati the morning stew good r u n down to Western Australia. it was inspected by the offiThere we were informed that influenza They carried it straight up was prevalent in Australia, and that the touching it, so troops who disembarked in Western Austhere should be no question tralia would have to go through a period of quarantine for the protection of the every people on shore. So far, good. I do not bhink any of the Western Australians complained about having to do that period of quarantine. The remainder of the troops' were told that inhalation chambers would be provided on the boat That, also, is none too nice for use on the voyage to Adelaide, and decks that if the inhalation process was undergone properly we would not have to The men undergo quarantine when we reached port. It took us approximately, six themdays, and we went through the inhalaThe porttion process religiously every morning. Every man was up at the period fixed for him, and went through the process. The evidence given by the officer commanding the troops, notwithstanding what I spanned them may be said regarding a few high tembetween peratures,' showed that when the health officers came aboard at the Semaphore morning, they pronounced the ship clean. It was stated in the newspapers next day by D r . Hone, the quarantine officer, that the Somali was a clean ship. We were paraded at 9 o'clock on the morning of our arrival there, and the usual order given when troops are to disembark atmosphere was issued, that we were to bring period. up any k it bags we had w i th us, and stow them on the starboard deck. Hammocks were to be handed in , and half-an-hour after lunch our mess utensils were also to be handed in . We were to be paid prior to disembarkation. All these orders were carried out; the troops paraded on the mess deck, and had their temperatures taken, and everything went "" as merry as a marriage bell "" ; but we were there u n t i l 4 o'clock in the afterg j into quarantine for seven days. noon, and no word came as to what we were to do. A t 4 o'clock some one came along and said that I had better go down and get a hammock, because every one down below was grabbing a hammock. I went below and secured one, and then I returned to the deck to get my k it bag. There had been a stack of k it bags, about 10 feet high, but when I got on deck they were strewn over the place, and men were trampling on one another's bags in an endeavour to find their own. That annoyed me considerably. I knew that my wife and daughter, the latter w i th a baby in arms, were expecting me, and I was not too pleased to think that they had been waiting on the wharf from 9 o'clock in the morning without knowing what was going to happen to the troops on the boat. Consequently, I paraded before MajorA r n a l l . I did not go direct to the did something off my own bat. ship's captain, as .Major Chanter says I did. I did not do that on any occasion. I spoke to Major Arnall and pointed to the k it bags strewn about the deck. I said, "" We have paraded according to your orders, and now look at the k it bags being trodden on."" I had not been allowed to remain in England long enough to purchase souvenirs to bring home to my people, and it did not affect me whether my bag was trampled on or not; b ut I realized that others might have souvenirs in their k it bags. I said, "" This is not the way to treat men who have done so much in the interests of their country.. I Have been told to get my hammock. A r e we to stay on board to-night?"" He said, "" The health ofiicers came on board this morning and inspected the ship, and have gone away, but as to what is to take place I am just as ignorant as you are."" I said, "" I feel very wild about it . "" ThenI explained how my wife and daughter were waiting for me on shore, and he said, "" If I were in your position I would feel as you do,"" candidly admitting that the attitude I took up was the one he would have taken up in the same circumstances. We did not know what was to be done to us u n t i l we received the newspapers on the following morning, and they contained the information that the Somali had arrived, and had been declared a clean ship, but that she was to I asked permission to write a letter to the Register, and the Officer Commanding said that as the censorship restrictions had been lifted I could do so. Thereupon I wrote a letter to the Register, pointing out the position as we found it . I stated that there were 1,100 men between decks on the vessel, that she was a still ship, and did not have the wind chutes that were provided on the voyage out, and, that there was nothing to prevent an outbreak of influenza going right through the vessel. I added that men who had risked their lives in France were now obliged to r u n a greater risk of death by remaining on the vessel in such circumstances. During the day a lot of the troops came to me, and asked what I thought it best to do. I did not advise them in any way, but I I prepared a telegram, jointly signed by South Australians, to Brigadier GeneralJ An t ill , but I would not allow any man to be coerced into signing it , nor would I allow any one to sign it who had not first read it . I then paraded before the Officer Commanding, and asked h i m if he would get the South Australian officers to sign it . He said that he could not do so, as he thought he had done all that was necessary by appealing to the shore authorities against the quarantining of the vessel. Thereupon I asked permission to send the telegram to Brigadier-GeneralA n t ill . ' The Officer Commanding said that I could do what I liked in that respect. I drafted the telegram on a cigarette wrapper which was lying on the deck at the time, and this was the wording of the 'message whioh was forwarded to Brigadier-GeneralA n t ill Undersigned soldiers 4th Military District desire your intervention for immediate release from quarantine. Authorities acknowledge clean ship. Contend that further detention be the next day when, I was on the mess deck tween decks of still ship liable to breed outI saw the men signing it. It was signed break rather than prevent same -YATES . There were seventy-two South Australians on the Somali, and sixty-six of them voluntarily signed the telegram, only one man refusing to do so. Time heing the essence of the contract, I sent it without the other signatures, but subsequently those South Australians who had not signed it came to me and expressed their regret that they had not had the opportunity of doing so. There was nothing in the message contrary to military discipline. It simply stated that we resented unnecessary quarantining in our own port, without our relatives and friends being given the opportunity of learning what was to be done with us. After despatching the message I mingled myself with the crowd, who were engaged in catching sharks. and I have one of its teeth. gave it to me, mounted in gold, as a tribute to the work I had done for them. In the evening some of the troops from tbe other States began to display impatience at the delay, and they asked me to draft a petition to Brigadier-General Antill. I said, ""What for?"" They said, "" We want you to draw up a petition similar to the one you sent to the Brigadier."" I was not anxious to mix myself up in anything that would be likely to lead people to believe I was seeking to foment trouble. I said to them, "" I appreciate your position, but I am sorry I cannot help you. I have done what I thought was best, by sending a telegram on behalf of the men who are in their own home -port. Anything that you want to do you can do off your own bat. take my share pf the responsibility attaching to anything I do myself, but I do not propose to do anything beyond what I 'have already done."" They turned from me rather crestfallen, and one man said, "" We thought that you would write it out for us."" I said, "" Oh, if you simply want me to draft your petition, get me a piece of paper and I will do so."" At this time lights were out, and I had to go into the second saloon to get the necessary light. I drafted a petition for these men, and had nothing more to do with it. On Afr. Yates. by 718 of them, and was sent ashore-by whom I do not know. I had nothing to do with it after preparing it, although I am aware that the men went to the Officer Commanding for permission to send the petition ashore. Nothing else happened on board the Somali until Friday morning, when we were again paraded. As on the Tuesday morning our kit-bags were put on deck, our hammocks and our mess utensils were handed in, and we were notified that we were to be paraded for disembarkation at 10 o'clock in the morning. Tuesday morning's performance was repeated. The kit-bags were walked over, we had to draw our hammocks again, and again I paraded before the Officer Commanding and told him that A shark was caught, the position, was intolerable. I asked The men whether it was a fair thing to .parade us twice and go through the same performance as we had on Tuesday. The South Australian trbops asked me to intercede on their behalf and get release for them from the ship. I told .them that if they wished me to act on their behalf I would speak for them if they had a representative number of South Australians. They asked at what time they should assemble. I said, "" An y time you like, but let me know when everyone is there."" They made the time 4 o'clock in the afternoon. As there was not a representative gathering of the men, I refused to approach the Officer Commanding in their behalf, bu£ decided to interview h'im on my own account. I felt that I was aggrieved, and had a right to speak to him regarding I the treatment of the men. I was again paraded before him in the ordinary official way. I did not go up to him and give him a tap on the shoulder. I went to the orderly room, and asked the runner to tell the Officer Commanding that I wished to speak tor bim. If , in so doing, I transgressed any military rule, the fault was not mine. I could have been told that there was a more proper method of approaching the Officer Commanding. The court martial admitted that there was no lack of discipline in my action in interviewing the Officer Commanding, and that gives the lie direct to the statering their request to the Oflicer Commandment made by Major Chanter that I went to Major Arnall's office. I spoke to the Officer Commanding regarding the treatment the men were 'receiving, and he informed me that he had paraded the men on that day because somebody had oalled out from a tug-boat on the previous night, "" Get ready to go off to-morrow morning."" action on such an instruction, because, as was afterwards proved, it was not authoritative. He told me that he considered the position unfortunate, but that he had done his best to get the men ashore. This conversation took place on the deck outside the Officer Commanding's office. The men standing near knew what I was speaking about, and as I left the Officer Commanding, they clamoured about me with a request to be told what I had said, and what he had replied. I told them that the interview, had been a personal one, and that Major Arnall knew no more than we did. The men had to remain on board."" Thereupon they resolved to hold a meeting on the poop-deck, and I was requested to explain the position to them. I did so. Then came a proposal that we should allow Major Arnall from 2.30 till 5 o'clock to acquaint the shore authorities hy wireless that unless we were released from quarantine we would seize the boat and go ashore. had been made that the rafts and other loose deck fittings should be cast into the gulf as a demonstration of the chagrin of the troops, but as that action would not get the men ashore, somebody moved that an ultimatum be given to the Officer Commanding that unless he assented to the request of-the men, they would take action on tlieir own account. I said to them, ""Before you do this, give the Officer Commanding an opportunity to communicate with the shore authorities."" 1 They decided to do that, and asked me to interview him. I said, ""AmI to tell him what you propose?"" and they replied ""Yes."" I told them that I would act only as one of them, and not. in my capacity as a member of Parliament, as I had no more authority than any other private on the boat. I also stipulated that, in prefering, I should be accompanied by one man from each State represented on the ship. We were paraded before the Officer Commanding. I introduced the deputation, and explained the demands of the men. ""When I had finished speaking, in order to prove to the Officer Commanding that this was not a one-man show, I made He had no right to take every member of the deputation express his views.

Another man jumped up, and said that he had a mate's certificate, and could take the bridge. I pointed out that while that was all very well, he would still have to find men to work the engines and do the firing. The man who had said that he was possessed of a mate's certificate then asked whether there were any engineers amongst the men, and two certificated engineers volunteered for service, as well as five A.B.' s and four or five firemen. This man then said, "" T h is is good enough for me, Yates. I can take the ship back to her anchorage."" I replied, "" If you think you are competent to do so, well and good; but I would point out that you are proposing to take a very serious step. Unless that step is taken on the authority of the men as a whole, I will have nothing to do with it . You .must whip up all the men, so that I may know whether or not the majority are in favour of what you propose."" As many as possible were then brought up on deck. I refused to allow the question to be decided on the voices. A show of hands was then taken, and it was such as to lead me to take the action I d i d . Again, however, I would not be the leader of bhie movement. I said, "" If I am going to take this resolution to the Officer Commanding, or the captain, I must be accompanied by the same men that went with me on the last occasion. Four out of the five agreed to go with me; the fifth backed out, saying that he would have nothing to do with a proposal to take charge of the 6hip, but another man promptly took his place. We then waited on the captain. We did not threaten the Officer Cpmmanding that we would take charge of-the ship. He was "" out of the joke."" It was a matter between the captain and the men.

I told h i m the men were desperate, he said, "" If you go on with this proposal, we w ill not attempt to stop you. It would be useless, since you outnumber us by fifty to one."" There was no opposition on bhe part of either the military 'or ship's officers. They recognised that the position was serious. did. story merely to give the newspapers something to write about. My only desire is to show that I was unfairly treated. I am not the only man that has been dealt with unfairly by the Military Department. When I was in Darlinghurst I met a soldier who was serving a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment for fighting another private, and I will give the Acting Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Russell) credit for the fact that when I p u t before hi m the whole of the evidence relating to that case he caused the sentence to be reduced by one-half. tence would have been passed on him had he struck an officer?

I am bringing this matter before the Housei n order to focus public attention on the treatment meted out to these men. When our soldiers went away they were heroes, but when they fell into the clutches of officers with an abnormal regard for discipline, their treatment was such as to justify action of the kind of which I have been speaking. I am telling a p l a in , ' unvarnished tale. I challenge contradiction. I have not embellished the facts in any way in order to put my own position in a more favorable light.

After leaving the captain's cabin I returned to the rear of the ship where I usually sat with a chum, and I did not kn'ow what was happening until I was sent for.

Captain Malcolm is, I believe, employed on the press to do military work. If Major Chanter says he did not know his friend, Captain Malcolm, took down the statement for publication, he is, in my opinion, telling a deliberate lie. absolutely wrong. I say he did not know. he knew or not, the indiscretion was his; 1 and if a private had been guilty of it, he would have had to pay the penalty. This is what Major Chanter said to the pressMajor J. C. Chanter, D.S.O., a Light Horse officer, who left Australia w it h the 9th Lightt h in g to say-'that a ship u n d e r w e i g h Horse Regimenti n February, 1915, and has latterly been attached to the 4th Light Horse Brigade, was one of the ship's complement, and he stated on Tuesday that the general conduct of the men was excellent. They were a splendid lot of men, and quite amenable to reason, but a small section, who were led by Rp. Yates, adopted unusual methods of obtaining redress for their grievances. Instead of approaching the CO. of the boat through ""their officers, they went to him direct, and delegates were appointed from the various units to meet the CO. in conference on any matter which tbey considered required attention. They never met the Commanding Officer but on the one specific subject of quarantine, and that subject alone was dealt with, and certain action was threatened unless certain results were obtained. The statement goes onWhen the troops reached Colombo they were told, according to Major Chanter, that any shore leave then received would be deducted from the period granted on their arrival in Australia. The result was that the men remained ' on the boat, and gave no trouble. Then when. they got to Fremantle they were not allowed""ashore owing to a reported outbreak of influenza. As a matter of fact, the only case resembling influenza was that of the ship's carpenter, who resumed work four days after the report of his sickness. Shore leave was consequently disallowed, and the men were given to understand that they would undergo a course of disinfection on their voyage to the Eastern States, where they would be immediately landed if there were no further outbreaks. Every day on the voyage to the Largs Bay anchorage tlie men were treated in fumigation rooms, and then, on their arrival, they were told that they would have to undergo seven days' quarantine before the boat continued on it3 voyage. This was naturally in terpreted to mean that when the Somali reached Melbourne, Sydnej', and Queensland, similar periods of quarantine would be enforced, and all the men felt they had a grievance, although only a few expressed it , and become militant. It was then that Rp. Yates proceeded to the commanding officer, and told him that if the men were not allowed on shore they would seize the ship's boats and land themselves. That makes it a "" one-man show ""To obviate this trouble the captain of the Somali decided to put to sea, and anchor further out, and tlie boat was got under weigh.

There are, however, a lot of other cases which I hope the Minister w ill sympathetically consider. I believe a number of purely military offenders have been released; but there are also a number of civil cases of which I have instanced one. For example, two men fighting would constitute a civil case, which in civil life would entail a fine of perhaps 50s. As the case I mentioned secured the individual twelve months' i m prisonment, I dare say if we went through the whole of the "" crimes"" which are still being expiated by members of the Australian Imperial Faroe, and which are considered civil offences, we should find that many of the penalties inflicted were far too severe.

He went on shore, and there met a brother officer with whom he had fought side by side in the various Egyptian campaigns. He lunched with him, and in the conversation at the table this friend said to him, "" I hear there has been some trouble on the Somali.""

But Avheni t appeared in the Argus, one part was absolutely incorrect. That was the part regarding the captain of the ship. I was present when my son went into the Argus office and pointed out to the subeditor that that part was not correct.

I should be sorry to say that of all official statements, but there are some of which that description is true. I do not ask for the issue raised in this case to be dodged or obscured.

The Department of Trade and Customs seems to have no concern in the accommodation provided for its officers. That does not matter at large ports where accommodation is not difficult I to find. But in places like BrokenH ill and Wilcannia, the Department should find residences for its ""officials. Henry was sent from Wilcannia to BrokenH ill at short notice, and was obliged to buy a residence and furniture. Later, altered circumstances made the closing of the BrokenH ill office necessaiy in the interests of economy and good government. For that, neither the Sub-Collector nor the Department is to blame; but it is hard on the oflicer that he should be asked to sacrifice the house and furniture which he had to buy at ""boom"" prices. He must have been a careful and economical Department of Trade and Customs. The whole matter may be put in a nutshell. Mr Henry petitioned the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), who at that time occupied the unique position of being Prime Minister, Attorney-General, and concluded his petition as follows:Your petitioner, therefore, humbly prays1.

171,Dr. Maloney,"The Defence Deis nofc satisfied -with it . The industry,, however, haa never had a ""dog's chance."" At first, if a soldier employed was in receipt of a pension, the amount of pension was deducted from the money he earned. I am sorry to say that Senator Millen was not stating the truth, or perhaps it would he more polite to say that he was inaccurate, when he declared that none of the soldiers thus employed was injured. That was when I asked the Acting Prime Minister( Mr ""Watt) why the ANZAC soldiers, who were engaged making oloth, had not some of their pro-lucts shown in the Queen's Hall along with the work of other soldiers. We all know that no soldier receives a pension unless he is proved unfit from a military point of view, eitlier through severe illness, or, more likely, by reason of wounds. The method in the factory was that if a man was receiving 15s. per week as a pension, it was deducted from his wages, which were thus reduced to 27s. per week. If a man had not heen injured, he was allowed to earn £2 2s. Certain yarn supplied wa.s worse than shoddy. wool, but, as I have shown on previous occasions, it is of very short staple. In company with a member of a State Legislature, I showed Senator Millen some samples, and he said that they were terrible, and their production must be stopped. up, and sent to Buckley and Nunn's, by whom, as it was not fit for the use of adults, it was made up into children's garments. garments if it is not fit for adults 1 posed to be heavier, and, at certain parts, wears out the cloth more rapidly than children. does not know children ! alleged reason. I desire to say nothing disparaging of Messrs. Buckley and Nunn, to whom I tender my thanks for coming forward at an awkward moment, and taking all the output they were allowed to sell. As the representative of Melbourne, however, I,do object to this firm only being allowed to obtain the wool. This tweed, manufactured at 7s. or 7s. 6d. per yard, would give those engaged £A to £4 10s. per man for weaving. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) asked on one occasion why this cloth was not sold at 10s., and I repeat the question. If it were sold at 10s. 6d. per yard by the roll to warehousemen and tailors, it would give a .profit of 33^ per cent. All others who purchased in suit lengths, which is more expensive than purchasing by the roll, might be charged is. or Is. 6d. a yard extra. The other day I mentioned the fact that ai number of gentlemen in this city were willing to put tlieir money into this industry if they had a guarantee that good yarn would be supplied from the Government mills; but this suggestion, like all else connected with Senator Millen, is hung up. Of all the contemptible things in connection with the business the worse is an attempt to reduce the remuneration of the men. The usual way of .paying weavers is so much per yard as the cloth leaves the loom, but the DepartI t is true that it is all ment desires to pay the. men by the yard after the cloth, has been shrunk, and cloth shrinks from \ to \ of a yard, according to the material. Thus tlie Government sought to save a paltry 6d. or so on the weaving. If tlie Government will guarantee that the Government mills This yarn was made at Geelong will supply good yarn, any one can make good wages at the trade. fusing to supply good yarn? use it for children's good now, and the price is. not bad. Senator Millen, in a statement he made, said that there were thirteen men, engaged in the industry, to whom the Government had an obligation, and he was quite willing to keep them in the business and find out what they could do. How many more years does Senator Millen want to "" f in d out""? -A-s I have said, there are private gentlemen who are willing to give this industry a show if the clair for standing up against his officers, the Department, and even against the Ministry, and refusing to make cloth from vile stuff that is worse than shoddy.",44,Profit Sha R The Ship Who Was The Brigade Sergeant

If the business had been properly managed there would have been, not thirteen men, but 500 or 600 men earning good wages, and cloth for a suit could have been bought for 32s. 6d., and of a quality that is not sold in England under 21s. a yard. Honourable members may think I am drawing the long bow, but the Reverend S. H . Cox-who , by the way, is a relative of the Acting Prime that cloth from the Geelong mills went out at 8s. per yard, but, after going through the big warehouses in Melbourne, it was returned to Geelong to be sold at 21s. and 25s. per yard. This, Mr Cox said, was not a question of the Tariff, but one for parliamentary action. ment was made in the presence of Mr Smale, the manager of the mills, and his next officer, and they did not contradict it when in conversation with me 'afterwards.

If a tailor is sufficiently energetic to ask for a roll of cloth, he should be charged the same price as tlie warehousemen are charged. Some time ago I made inquiries regarding "" B l i g h t y "" tweeds, which are just the same as the Harris tweeds, though without the peat smell, and are sold in lengths of 7 and 8 yards. The 8yard lengths are for women's overcoats, and the 7-yard lengths are for men's suitings. An y one can go into the shop and purchase tliis cloth. The weavers are returned soldiers of the same calibre as our men, only they are British. They are given a splendid chance, and earn up to £ 4 10s. per week in Glasgow and Aberdeen. The only difThat stateference between that cloth and the cloth I am wearing is that the yarn is handturned by a spinning wheel, like that used by Marguerite in Faust. That is the only difference between the so-called Harris tweed, Or the present Blighty tweed, and the tweed our men make. In the latter case the yarn is spun by machinery. There is no reason why, in stead of thirteen meu. there should not be 500 or more employed at this work if the Government wish it to continue. A u educated gentleman at the Working Men's College assured me that any in telligent man could learn simple weaving work, such as this, in three weeks. Foy and Gibson do the dressing and fixing up I think that must at a cost of 4Jd. after the tweed has beenwoven, and I am glad to give them credit for all they have done. But for that firm the industry would have been killed Government through the inaction and opposition of the Repatriation Department, especially before Senator Millen took charge. Wheii the State War Department were in conA l l the cloth turned out trol, they helped the industry greatly, and it was the lament of the men them employed that the officer in charge was arriving at a removed when the Commonwealth took things over. it is the Repatriation Commission that is the trouble.

190,Dr. Maloney,"The n get r i d of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) yesterday, as reported in the Argus today, that profiteering does exist. is the report as it appeared in the ArgusThe Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) was asked in the House of Eepresentatives yesterday by Mr Tudor whether his attention had been directed to the press reports that the United States Government was pursuing the profiteer and the men who hoarded supplies of foodstuffs, and that 500 arrests were expected. Would the Attorney-General promise that a similar proportion of profiteers would be arrested in Australia in the next few weeks? Mr Groom replied that Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs when profiteering was rampant. . . . will see, from the Hansard proof of my remarks yesterday, that what I said was, "" If profiteering was rampant at all, it was rampant when the honourable member for Yarra was Minister for Trade and Customs, at the beginning of the war."" It was not a question of the existence of profiteering, but the power to deal with it. say that tliere is profiteering, or not? on the part of the> Commonwealth to deal with profiteering so far as Intra-State trade and commerce is concerned. Dr. reply to the question p ut yesterday, as reported in the Argus, wasMr Groom replied that Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs when profiteering was rampant, and knew the difficulties of dealing with the position. I do not know yet what position the M i nister takes u,p. Does he say that there is no profiteering at the present time? a question now being investigated by the State Government to ascertain the extent to which it exists. will not give me a direct answer to my question. An y man who says that there is not more profiteering now than there was three years ago has not kept his eyes open, and does not use his brains. It is infamous that we are not doing something to stop the profiteering that is going om. There is not a man, woman, or child outside but is suffering. When the adjournment of the House was moved the other day, it was shown that the price of boots had been greatly increased. ThisI have shown what has happened in regard to cloth after it is sold from the Geelong mills. There is an old somg to the effect that "" We walked right in and turned around and walked right out again."" So this cloth is sent from the mills into the Flinders-lane warehouse, and then is sent, out again to Geelong, and charged so many hundred per cent, more. We have read what is happening in regard to the price of hats. A. statement was published this morning showing that over 1,000,000 carcasses are in cool storage in Melbourne, and that there has been an enormous increase in the price of meat since 1909. Women who used to buy good meat now have to buy bones and boil them down for soup. Honourable members should see the poor people being served, with small portions of soup by the relief committee at the TradesH a l l . There is soup there every day so long as funds are provided. It takes my mind ' back to the time when over 250,000 meals were served at the old TradesH a l l following the debacle of the land boom. In those days people could get three loads of sheep's heads free, delivered at the door. To-day, owing to profiteering and otlier causes, which have brought about tained at a reasonable figure, although 1,000,000 carcasses aTe held in cold storage. W h at are the Government doing? What is the House doing? One can call from the house-tops, and nothing is done. It has been suggested to me that the Government intend to wait u n t i l their Leader comes back, when he will fight profiteering. I have fought him when I thought he was wrong, but if he does righ t in this matter he will have my f u l l support and cordial approbation. Something must be done. Every day the Government delay they are doing themselves neither honour I see the Minister nor justice. Take the case of bread, which is called the staff of life.

195,Dr. Maloney,"may have to come to that some day, because it seems infamous that so much should be charged for bread after the bountiful harvests with which God has blessed this country. H ad there been a famine, one could have understood it . Mr Wilkinson, one of the brilliant scholars of the Melbourne. University, shows clearly in his book on The Trusts of Australia, that when flour was sold at £ 1 1 10s. per ton, which is higher than the present price, bread was sold at 5^d. and 6 i d . per 4-lb loaf. If people buy a 1-lb. loaf, which goes under the name of fancy bread, they now pay 2^d., or at the rate of lOd. for 4 lbs. charged ever so much more. All these fancy breads are so much fake or camouflage to rob the people. I have taken the trouble to ask members of the House who have had farming experience what is a fair pnice for wheat per bushel to give a return to the man on the land. I have also made inquiries in various States, and have been told that from 4s. to 4s. 3d. per bushel at the station will pay. From my experience of the miles of country I saw under wheat in Western Australia, that price will give the farmer a fighting show. show at the price of articles to-day!

No one on this side would refuse the farmer who grows wheat a fair price. L e t the price be fixed at whatever is a fair thing.

Then let the Government, if they wanfc to stop profiteering, fix the price of flour at, say, £10 7s. 6d. or £ 1 0 15s. per ton, and let any miller be imprisoned who refuses to supply flour at the price fixed by the Government to any baker who wants it .

That is one instance of how the public is being robbed. In the prices of hats there has been a considerable increase. thing to what it will be in future. Inter-State Commission should be made available, not only to members of Parliament, but to members of the general public. If the people had access to the information which they contain, there would be considerably greater protest against) tlie profiteers than there is to-day. I have been informed that early in the war the Defence Department let a contract for military hats at 7Ss. per dozen. When the next contract was advertised, the manufacturers combined and tendered at 87s. per dozen. The Ministei* who controlled the Department at that time said, "" You made the first lot for 7Ss. per dozen, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, made a very good profit out of the Department in war time. If you are not prepared to accept this contract at the same price. I shall commandeer your hat mills, and the Department will make its own requirements."" Faced wifch that alternative, the manufacturers tendered at the old price of 78s. per dozen. I do not know whether they have made attempts since to profiteer at the expense of the Defence Department. In regard to woollens, I direct the attention of the honourable member for New England to the following table in the report of the Inter-State Commission :Net proflts affluent circumstances before the war broke Capital three years, out.

At a time when their country was in the throes of the greatest war in history, these grasping hawks came in and demanded exorbitant prices for the very clothing required for our soldiers. This is the comment of the Inter-State CommissionIt is much to be regretted that the greater proportion of tlieir excessive profits were derived during the period in which they were engaged in supplying material for the clothing of our soldiers, and when they were acting in unison. They combined to keep up prices. It is unnecessary to look much further for evidence to show the profiteering that is going on. The Prime Minister Mr Hughes) submitted certain questions to the Inter-State Commission, and their answer to the first inquiry was as follows : The enhanced prices are directly attributable to the war, and to the fact that local manufacturers, wholesale and retail distributors, have to a large extent taken advantage of abnormal conditions for the purpose of increasing their profits. In these few words we have summed up the rapacity of some of the so-called respectable citizens of Australia. The comment applies to firms that were in Emploved, 1915. 1910, 1917. for the material for our soldiers, these firms, having done so well in this sunny £ land of ours, might well have said, "" The 536,639 541,135 country is at war.

The indictments I have quoted, and whicli are laid at the door of some of the chief manufacturers of Australia, are not made by Labour men, but by an independent Commission, as the result of exhaustive evidence taken by it. The Government, meantime, is supinely looking on. Surelyi t would be worthwhile to take risks! able member suggest should be done? Regulations are still in force. They have been in operation for practically five years, but little or nothing has been done under them to stop the depredations of. these people. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -What would the honourable inember do ? able member. As I mentioned just now, a number of manufacturers had manufactured military hats for the Government for 78s. per dozen, but when further contracts were invited, they met and decided to put up the price to 87s. per dozen. When this higher price was put before the Minister, he said to these men, "" The first contract at 78s. per dozen was carried out by some of yon men. If you are prepared to go on making tliese hats at that price you can have the contract. Buti f you insist upon the increased price, I will commandeer your mills, and the Government will manufacture the hats required for our military men."" That is what I would do in all these cases. I would be prepared to do anything to put a stop to the people being robbed as they have been consistently robbed during the bitteT period of the war. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -If the honourable member were Prime Minister, what would he do in regard to this matter? these mills, and manufacture for the public. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -' ' Nationalize!''

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Then the honor, able member would nationalize the whole of the woollen mills in Australia? did that, they would confer a great boon upon the people. I do not believe that any thinking man would object to that being done in the interests of the general public. The ""welsher"" at Flemington is punished by the Victoria Racing Club; the burglar is sent to gaol; but here we have men who have been robbing the people and the Government, and their supporters, who are supposed to be policing the country, do nothing to put down their profiteering. They actually laugh' at what is going on.

Profiteering is more rampant to-day than ever it was. The distress of tbe people is greater than ever, and tbe supineness, indifference, and utter callousness of the Government to all that is going on, in this respect, is worse than ever it was. With increasing distress and increased necessity to take action, there is but increased apathy on the part of the Government. It is true, as the Prime Minister said in England, that profiteering breeds Bolshevism. If tbere is anything calculated to cause a spirit of rebellion to rise up in the hearts of law-abiding citizens, it is J: would nationalize the belief that they are being robbed.

Even a Tory like Mr Bonar Law is prepared to do something to put down profiteering. He w ill not go as f a r as the miners desire by nationalizing the coal mines of Great Britain, but that is coming. House of Commons some twelve months ago, said that in two years the dividends paid on shipping shares, which had cost him £8,000, amounted to £7,000. I dare say that by now, on his capital outlay of £8,000, he has received dividends totalling £12,000. are making some effort to stop profiteering, whereas Australia, which should set an example to the world, is in this respect lagging far behind? The people will take us to account for this neglect, and rightly so. We cannot remain silent while they are being robbed by the profiteers. I do not know how one-half of the people manage to live at the present time. A p a r t altogether from the industrial trouble, there is much distress. Even men whom I thought to be almost indej>endent have been bitterly complaining to me of the difficulty of making ends meet owing to the increase in the cost of living. Men who have been for years in receipt of goodsalaries are coming to me from time to time, and are saying, "" If the Federal Parliament cannot help us, is there not some Parliament that oan relieve the situation?"" the pinch, what must be the position of those who are earning only £ 2 or £ 3 a week, and some less? Isi t right for this Parliamenib to remain idle? I know that tlie old parrot cry, "" We have not the constitutional power to deal w it h profiteering,"" will again be raised. But little has been done by the Government under its war powers during the last four or five years. The Labour party tried to secure an amendment of the Constitution, conferring much wider powers on the National Parliament. posals were rejected by a majority of something like 250,000 votes; but on the second occasion, we were within an ace of carrying some of our amendments. Subsequently further proposals to amendthe Constitution were, made, but largely owing to the influence and promises made by the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes), the referendum was not put to the people. To-day, I believe far more drastic propositions would be carried. I believe that the people would: even vote for Unification, if they were satisfied Mr Bonar Law, speaking in the that the National Parliament would thus have f u l l power to deal with the profiteers. If we have an election within the next month or so, the people will not rest content unless, ,at the same time, proposed amendments of tlie Constitution are submitted to tbem-amend The British Government ments such as will not permit any encroachment on the part of the States upon the privileges of the National Legislature. My fear is that while we leave the State Constitutions as they are, we shall not have a free hand to deal with this question. Section 51 of the Constitution covers what are known as the thirty-nine articles. Its opening provision is, "" The Parliament shall have power to ma.ke laws for tlie peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth."" Then follow the thirty-nine articles, setting out the subjects in respect of which we may legislate. I would""submit to the people a. proposal to strike out all but the opening clause of the section, so that the National Parliament would be given the broad power to "" make laws for the peace, order, and If such men feel good government of the Commonwealth."" of the State Parliaments if that were carried ? _ cally drop out, or would, at least, have to re-model their Constitutions in accordance wibh the decision of the people.

I now come to an act of injustice to at least twelve telephone mechanics in this State of Victoria. These are the only mechanics in Australia, I believe, who were included in a promise made by Mr Fisher, when Prime Ministeri n 1915. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), and the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), and other honourable members, know the facts of the case; and I may say that we have done everything within reason to obtain justice for these men whose claims are distinctly in accord with the promise to which I have referred. member will state the whole case to the House. the speecli delivered by Mr Fisher when an amending Public ServiceB ill was before us. I may say at the outset that by a subsequent Act the rights that these men. understood they enjoyed have been taken away. I am sorry that the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) is not present, but I cannot allow tMs opportunity to pass without calling attention to the matter. Certain telephone mechanics, prior to the war, had passed an examination qualifying them for permanent appointment. When the war broke out the Ministry of the day had had to revise their idea in regard to promotion in the Public Service. A large number of public servants were enlisting, and it was not considered righ t in their absence abroad to give promotion to those l e f t behind. It was, therefore, decided by the Fisher Government, which was then in power, not to make appointments or promotions while the war lasted. But the promise was given that those who had been made eligible would become eligible for appointhave successfully passed, their examination, but ment for nine months after the conclusion of the war. If , as Mr Lloyd George has said, the ratifications of peace will be exchanged by 1st September, those telephone mechanics, who qualified prior to the war, would be eligible for permanent appointment for nine months afterwards. I should like to quote from Hansard of the 1st September, 1915, page 6599, in reference to an amending Public ServiceB ill which was then before the House. Mr Fisher, in introducing that B ill , saidClause 13 provides that any person who, as a successful examinee, is eligible for appointment to the Public Service, will continue to be so eligible until nine months after the termination of the war. Instructions have been issued to the effect that no permanent appointments be made until the termination of the war. Persons who have already qualified by examination, however, will not be passed over. It will be seen that Mr Fisher, without any prompting from honourable members, said that persons who had already qualified .for examination would not be passed over. Later on in the discussion on the B ill , the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) drew attention to clause I hope the honourable 13, which read as followsNotwithstanding anything contained in the' principal Act. . . . any person who, having successfully passed any prescribed examiI intend to quote from nation . . . . is at the commencement of this Act eligible for appointment to the Public Service, shall continue to be so eligible until nine months after the termination of the present state of war. The following is the Hansard report of the discussion on that clauseclause is very good as far as it goes. omitting the words "" is at the commencement of this Act,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words, ""on the 1st day of August, 1914."" That will take the provision back to two or three days prior to the commencement of the war. who are at present eligible? after the war for pennanent appointment, but I wish to know whether they are to be continued in the meantime in temporary employment. and Treasurer) [11.59] -The question raised by the honourable member is a. fundamental one. All those who are ready to be examined, or who have not joined the Defence Forces, will continue to be eligible for appointment to tbe Commonwealth service. They will retain the positions and emoluments they now enjoy, according to their ability, but they will not be permanently appointed to those positions until nine months after the close of the war. They will have practically all the rights and privileges that they would bave had had they been statutorily appointed, with the exception that",54,Sewing Cottons

To make it clear I will move: That the words "" is at the commencement of tlie Act"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" was on the 4th day of August, 1914."" Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment: Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. On whichever side of the House we sit we all have a high sense of justice, and whatever political opinions the men concerned may have, they relied on the promise of the then Prime Minister. If that gentleman's words mean anything they mean that these men were secure in their right to appointment within nine months after the conclusion of the war. But what has been the result ? Since thenwe bajve passed another amending Public Service Act, in which there is a clause giving preference to returned soldiers. That distinct promise was given by Mr Fisher, and those men who do not object to preference to returned soldiers complain -that others who are not returned soldiers have been permanently appointed to positions while they themselves have been l e f t out in the cold. The other day the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was told, in reply to a question, that two returned soldiers had been appointed as junior mechanics, but I have the best of evidence for a belief bhat these were not returned soldiers, while between sixty and seventy appointments have been made of junior mechanics over those men who five years ago were promised that their rights would be conserved, but who to-day are walking the streets out of employment. Some married on the strength of the promise given by Mr Fisher, and I believe that nearly all of them now have wives and families, and have incurred liabilities in order to establish homes for themselves. For six weeks now their services have been dispensed with. One of these men, I may say, is gifted with inventive genius, and gave to the Department an idea which, I believe, has been the means of saving money to the country. The head of the Department told this man that he understood he had an idea dn regard to a certain instrument, and asked him to elaborate it . This the man did, w it h advantage to the Department, and now he is out of employment, and his wife and family are suffering. I do not think I am committing any breach of confidence in saying that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) , when the matter was brought under his notice, realized that an in justice was being done; but I believe that legal opinion has been obtained by the Government to the effect that the later Public Service Amendment Act gives a prior right to returned soldiers. Eveni f that be so, I question whether if Parliament, when that Public Service Amendment B ill was before it , had had a f u l l knowledge of the facts, it would have accepted the measure. I presume that had this war not occurred, these men would have been appointed in the latter part of August, 1914, and would now be permanent employees; but because of our desire -to do justice to those who ""went to the Front, these men have to waive their claims. They discharged their duties during the whole course of the war, and have proved themselves efficient. It is not f a i r for us to discharge technicallytrained mechanics who have big f a m i l y responsibilities, while, at the same time, sending abroad for equipment and material that can be made here. The Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) said that the Postal Department is a big employing Department, where, surely, there was room for, at any rate, some of these men. It is heart-breaking to see fine fellows like these idle, while work to which they have been trained is sent abroad. These men have presented their case in tiie most reasonable.and moderate f ashion, and, in spite of the legal opinion that I have referred to, I am sure that honourable members w ill not tolerate the injustice that is being done. I hope that honourable members w ill j o in in urging on the Government that if these men cannot be returned to their original positions, other employment may be found for them. Many of them have paid fees to technical colleges in order to qualify themselves for the service of the public, and they have spent four ov five of. the best years of their life i u public -work only to be now turned adrift. The country cannot afford to lose men like these; and we should do our best to retain their services in some capacity. I now wish to refer to the case of those men of smaller stature who enlisted and fought so well during the war. I take an interest in this matter, because I played some little part in getting the standard height for enlistment reduced tp 5 f t . 3 in., and I know that quite a number of such men went to the Front, and, so far as I can gather, fought as well .as, and, indeed, in some cases better than, their taller brethren. But now that the war is over they are not, I think, getting a fair deal. whether the responsibility lies wibh some 6-foot officer who believes that no one. can fight if he be under a certain height, but for certain appointments in this country there is still a stipulation as to inches. Some of these sturdy little nuggets are of the toughest constitutions, and the hardest workers; indeed, I knew a family, who could almost be described as one of dwarfs, but which was quite conspicuous in this respect. The 5-ft; 3-in. man who went to the Front did equally as well as those of greater stature, yet an advertisement of this nature appears calling for applications. from the Instructional Staff in connection with the Permanent Forces, stipulating that applicants must be at least 5 f t . 1\ in. high, with a chest measurement of 35 inches. This debars even men of 5 f t . 7 in. in height from appointment to these permanent positions. We owe a debt to all those men who went to the Front, no matter what their height was, and no such barrier as this should be raised. The Assistant Minister' ( Mr Wise), in reply to my question, said that the Department desired to keep these officers up to a certain height. men or shorter stature have, since they returned from the Front, been temporarily occupying positions as instructors. They have been among the best inMr Fenton. structors that we have in the Permanent Forces to-day; yet they are to have no chance of permanent appointment. This House should not tolerate treatment of that kind. ought to have sympathy with men of small stature. some Ministers are not very tall themselves. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) expressed surprise when I put the question, that a 6-foot man should be such an advocate for a 5-ft. 3-in. man. I believe in doing what is fair towards men who have done their duty to their country. I trust that attention will be paid to the three questions with which I have dealt. Honourable members cannot neglect to take some action in regard to the proI do not know fiteering that is going on. We ought to deal fairly with men who have rendered good service in the public Departments, and give them a chance of earning promotion, and certainly, when permanent positions are being given out in the Defence Forces, we should pay some attention to the claims of men of lower stature. Sitting suspended from 6.24 to 7.4-5 p.m. I wish to draw attention to a matter which concerns a well-deserving section of the people, the blind, who are doing work in basket-making and mat-making in our various institutions.

If there is proper supervision and discipline in the Department, just as good work ought to be done by a father and son as could be done by them if they were perfect strangers to one another. [7.59] I wish to deal with several matters in connection w i th the Defence Department and the Navy Department. The first is in reference to the granting of pensions to widowed mothers. Mr ""WISE -That is a Treasury matter. an outcome of the war. mothers are allowed pensions, but there are many widowed mothers who, while not f u l l y dependent upon tlie earnings of their sons, have been able to establish a right to the pension, and hold the belief that in the future, as they become older and more dependent on others, their pensions will be increased. On the whole, the officers administering the War PensionsA c t have treated, them in a fairly sympathetic way, but there are so many anomalous cases that one fails to understand why these officers do not carry out the spirit of the Act the son o£ a widow in my constituency went to the Pront. She married a second time, and her husband also went to the war. The son was killed; the husband returned, and, like many another soldier, was so upset in mind and habits that his wife found it necessary to live apart from him. establish her right to a pension as. a widowed mother because the Department says that she was not dependent upon her son when, at eighteen years of age, he l e f t for the Front. If that young man had lived he would be now about twenty-two years of age, and in the ordinary course of events would be helping to maintain his mother. married. of the deceased son of every widowed mother. I am anxious to see this woman establish her claim to a pension as a widowed mother. Other widowed mothers who have no more claim than she has-' many, indeed, have less-ar e in receipt of pensions. The Department is even paying pensions to dependent fathers in some cases. I have interested myself in this woman's case, and the reply of the Department is that as she was not dependent upon her son when he went away, she was not eligible for a pension. I bring the matter before the House because ordinary correspondence with the Department does not give these cases publicity or get them remedied.. The spirit of the Act is that widowed mothers are entitled to a pension, and I submit that this woman has not been treated as I Widowed think she ought to be. Under the Defence. Act , service in the Army and Navyf or home defence is compulsory. The operation of this section in ' connection with the Navy causes injustices that ought to bring condemnation upon this Parliament. I blame, not the present Government, b ut rather the whole Parliament, for not having made provision to deal with cases such as this to which I wish to refer. Young fellows, after they are eighteen years of age, when, perhaps, they are indentured to a trade, are called up for service by proFoiinstance, clamation. A lad who is called for service in the Navy may be sent to Queenscliff, Point Lonsdale, or to one of the islands to do garrison duty. A f t e r two or three months there he may be released; then called up again for five or six months, and again returned to civil life. One young fellow was compulsorily called That woman has been unable to up for service with the Naval Forces, and was sent to England on a troopship. Honourable members may recollect that towards the end of 1915 there was some trouble with the seamen, and the then Minister for the Navy( Mr Jensen) called up the young men in the NavalM i l it i a , and",58,Sewing Cottons

257,Mr Mathews,"T h a t can be saidforced them to take a troopship to England. The man to whom I refer was on that vessel, and throughout the trip was subject to naval discipline. On returning to Australia he tried to enlist with the Australian Imperial Force, but because he was in the Naval Militi a he was not accepted. He made another endeavour to get to the Front, but again was prevented. Then he was called up for duty on the Psyche. That boat cruised about the Australian coast for some time, and in December, 1918, after the war was over, the young fellow was discharged. He had lost three years of training at his trade, and is now thrown on the world without any occupation or a chance of availing himself of the opportunities that are given to the members of the Australian Imperial Force. W ill any person say that it is just to make these young men suffer all their lives because the}' were compulsorily called up for service in defence of their country ? It is because of cases of this character that conscription is so generally hated by the community. If this young man had not, by reason of his residence in a certain locality, been obliged to train with the Naval Forces, he would have been a military trainee, and if he had not gone to the Front he would by now have been a journeyman and able to earn a decent livelihood. I have placed this case and others before the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), who, although very sympathetic, has said that if he were to give the assistance that is asked he would be acting contrary to the Act. proposition before the Repatriation Commissioner. He ruled out my request on the first occasion. I have not heard the result of the second application; but the Navy officers are of the opinion that these lads are eligible for the benefits of the Repatriation Act. received from the Navy DepartmentDear Sir,RK NO. 403 E.

I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum of the 13th August covering copy of letter from the above-named relative to his application for vocational training, and in reAct. In one instance the firm to which ply, would advise that Mr Russell is not eligible for this assistance. Under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act1917-1918, those eligible for asistance are"" Any person Who(a) is or has been during the present war a member of tbe Naval or Military Forces enlisted or appointed for or* employed on active service outside Australia, or employed on a ship of war; This 'man was serving on a ship of war, the Psyche.

With regard to naval ratings, the Commission has considered the eligibility for benefits under the Repatriation Act and regulations of the following classes of men serving with the Royal Australian Navy, and those eligible for assistance are:Class A. Royal Australian Naval Sea-going Forces (enlisted men). Class B. Mine sweeping section, Royal Australian Naval Brigade.

The young man whosecase I am particularly stressing performed his duties well, and has a record of good conduct. Now he is without a trade, and the Commonwealth, says it has no responsibility towards him. It is the duty of the Government to order some inquiry into these cases. I should be quite content if the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) would investigate them, and see if something cannot be done to right the wrongs of these young men. There were cases of others who were indentured, and when they returned from naval service were over the apprenticeship age. For .three years they have been absent from their trade.

Representing a maritime constituency, many such cases come under my notice, and I am continually approaching the Minister regarding them. He admits that I have no other course than to appeal to him for redress. It would not cost a great deal to make some reparation to these men. An y such action would be endorsed by Parliament and the people. I know .that the Government are probably afraid of the possible far-reaching effects of any concession they might make i u this direction. Men who have served on troopships or have been engaged in minesweeping, may ask to be similarly treated. Already the munition workers have made claims upon the Government for consideration. They did certain war work for the Empire, and took the risks of sea travelling. So did the men employed on troopships; one man I know was on three different vessels that were torpedoed. The munition workers get no reparation unless for immediate losses of tools or personal effects. The Government fear the possibility of having to compensate all persons who have assisted in the war. I would not say that the people whom I have enumerated are not entitled to the Repatriation benefits, but I do say that young men who were compulsorily serving in the NavalM i l it i a , and who were not allowed to enlist in the A r m y, should receive consideration. I hope the Government will do something to alleviate the conditions of men who are without a trade, although they have reached an age at which they should be taking upon themselves the responsibilities of married life. I wish now'to refer to the complaints as to the food supply oa the troopship Fort Lyttleton. the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to appoint two returned' soldiers each side of the House as a committee, to inquire into the complaints of the men while the evidence was still available and the facts were fresh in their He promised to go into the matter, but all that I have got, and all that I ever shall get I suppose, unless we continue to Mr Mathews. draw public attention to the case, is the following letter:Melbourne, loth August, 1919. Dear Sir,-'With reference to the questions raised in the House of Representatives on the 8th August by yourself and the honourable member for Fremantle, regarding conditions on the troopship Port Lyttleton, I desire to inform you that, as promised, I have made inquiries from my colleague, the Acting Minister for Defence, who has furnished me with the following extract from the voyage report of the Oflicer Commanding troops on that vesselMajor B. Wa-rk, V.C, D.S.O.:Messmg Arrangements and Food Supplies -iTh e arrangements and food supplies .were good; on one or two occasions there .were complaints regarding the food, but they were not serious. It was realized by all that it is impossible for every article to be always perfect, but, taken as a whole, the quality of the food was very good, and the quantity correct and sufficient. Any defect that may have occurred was immediately rectified with the eager cooperation of the ship's officers. I may add that Major Wark has been instructed to furnish a further report in regard to the matter. Up to the present, the Department of Defence has not received any report from Mr Heitmann's representative. Yours faithfully, P. McM. GLYNN, for Acting Prime Minister. I .supplied the name of Mr Heitmann's representative-Privat e Brown, of the 59th Battalion. The Defence Department should have got in touch with h i m and have learned from h i m whether he received mamy complaints as to the food supplies on board. It has nofc attempted to do so. To-day I received this further letter:Melbourne, 18th August, 1919. Dear Sir,-""In continuation of my letter of the 15th August, relative to conditions on the troopship Port Lyttleton, I now wish to inform you that a further report has been obtained from Major Wark, V.C, D.S.O., copy o£ which I append f i r your information:A few days ago I asked Tbe men complained that stew did not contain enough vegetables. The cooks in from the galley were changed daily, as f t was discovered they were selling food to .the troops. The galley was also placed out of 'bounds. No complaints were subsequently received. One pudding was placed outside memories. the ship captain's door, which the men were ordered to remove, and instructed not to waste good food. The pudding was not ordered to be thrown overboard. Complaints were investigated each day, but, except in one or two minor instances, which were rectified, the men had little to his duty in attending to the wants of the -say regarding the food. It is considered the feeding and other ship's arrangements were excellent. Yours faithfully, CH20. H. WISE, for Acting Prime Minister. These letters .plainly show that there was something very wrong on board this transport. It is admitted that the cook was in the habit of selling food to the men at night. I believe that he'used to sell them chipped potatoes at Is. 6d. per plate. out of the ordinary supplies. Action was taken to put a stop to the practice, but tbe only result was that thereafter the men had to pay 2s. per plate for their chipped potatoes. It is admitted by the officers that that sort of thing had to be stopped. The pudding which was placed at the door of the Officer Commanding was unfit to eat. It was .placed there for that reason. I heard of tbese complaints by accident. -joking about the food supplies and saying that the stew served out was uneatable. I was told by the men. that the complaint was, not as Major Wark reports, that there were not enough vegetables, but that there were no vegetables in it . Stew of that kind would have a bad effect on tbe health of the men who partook of it . I have made this complaint because I think it is the duty of the Defence Department to thoroughly investigate all such matters and to punish those responsible for the trouble. If that were done, we would have an end to such occurrences, but when the Department retards these investigations or shows a disinclination to enter upon them it merely encourages the continuance of such practices. No attempt has been made by it to ascertain from Mr Heitmann's representative on board ship whether any complaints were made to him. I shall endeavour to get into touch with him and to obtain his version of the facts. Cases of this kind have caused trouble on all our troopships. It was something of the sort that led to the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) being sent to gaol. Major Wark is no doubt a very brave and gallant officer, but he was remiss in boys who had fought with him. The food served up to the officers would, of course, be good. When we are doing very well ourselves w e are apt sometimes 7 to be unmindful of the wants of others; but Major Wark, having been through the war w i th these men, should have in vestigated their complaints and have insisted upoin. their food supplies being good and adequate. I know of ami Officer Commanding troops These potatoes must have come on board a transport who dealt w it h such complaints in a way quite different from that adopted by Major Wark. When a complaint was made to him that the food supplied to the men was insufficient he detailed a quartermaster to see that the meat was weighed out and that f u l l weight was given. The quartermaster shortly after returned to the Officer Commanding and told h i m that the cook, with a knife in his hand, had chased h i m out I heard some of the men of the galley. The cook objected to his intrusion. Tbe Officer Commanding might have taken certain action in accordance with military discipline, but in stead of doing so he appointed the champion boxer an. board ship as a temporary qiiartermaster and told h i m it was his % duty to see that the meat supplies were properly weighed out. A quarter-of an hour later one of the officers waited on the Officer Commanding and said, "" You will bave to appoint another cook, sir."" There was no more trouble on board that ship as f a r as food supplies were concerned. men,?

264,Mr Mathews,"Q u it e so; but weI have said that it was a somewhat similar trouble on the troopship Somali whioh led to the honourable member for Adelaide (Gunner Yates) being sentenced (by a court martial. I shall never be satisfied until the Commonwealth compensates him for the indignity to which he was subjected, and reimburses him the amount withheld from his pay, as well as the cost to which he was put in having to defend himself before the court martial. I do not want to be personal in this matter, but I insist that justice shall be done. I sat out Gunner Yates' court martial for three days, and heard the evidence in chief. The only officer who seemed to be at all competent was the prosecuting officer, who, I understand, is a lawyer; but it was easy to see that he was disgusted with his job. Gunner Yates was accused of failing to make representations through the proper channels in regard to the complaints of the men on the Somali. As a matter of fact, the ordinary channels were availed of, but no redress could be secured. Gunner Yates' counsel at the court martial asked the captain of the ship, ""Did you ever send for Yates?"" He replied, "" I think I sent for him once."" Further eventually admitted that he had sent for Gunner Yates on five different occasions. ""Now,"" said the lawyer, ""Why did you send for him ?"" "" I sent for him,"" said the captain, ""because he was a representative man, and I thought he might have some influence with the men."" The honourable member was punished because he had some influence with the men, and prevented a mutiny. threatenings, but no mutiny actuallytook place. The man who should have been punished for the trouble that took place on the Somali was General Antill, State Commandant of South Australia. How the hell he came to be made a general, I do nob know. Por six days complaints were addressed to him in vain. While the ship was lying off shore-close to the city from which many of the boys came-they were not even able to obtain a piece of soap. They complained that lice were again appearing on their bodies. They had no comforts, but the officers'had. ilr. Mathews. many. The man who was sentenced to a month's imprisonment, and went to gaol with Gunner Yates for participating in the trouble, is about the most inoffensive looking "" pirate "" I ever saw. He had devoted the whole of his time, both in the Old Country and aboard ship, to the Soldiers' Comforts Fund. He was sentenced to a month's imprisonment really for looking after the interests of tlie men. A great deal has been said about Dr. Hone, the quarantine officer for South Australia. In Court it was given in evidence on oath that Dr. Hone, who was the cause of the men being kept on shore, did not know until 1 o'clock at night that there was trouble on the ship. This must have been the fault of somebody; and it was evident, from his demeanour, that the Officer Commanding did not like his job. I suppose he could not "" give away"" his superior officer-on e of the conditions of the military life. The peculiar thing is that Gunner Yates went ashore while the ship came east. Certain things appeared in the newspapers, and, because of this, six days afterwards Gunner Yates was cross-examined, however, he arrested, brought to Melbourne under guard, tried, and sentenced to 60 days. When sentence was passed, Gunner Yates was recommended to mercy because of the lack of discipline on the ship, but he completed his full sentence, a portion of it in Darlinghurst Gaol, where no soldier should have been sent under such a charge. I was through Darlinghurst Gaol five months ago, and'I can certainly There were say that it is not a fit place in which to detain a.nybody, more especially a man who desires to keep clean. As a matter of fact, Gunner Yates stopped a riot, and did not cause one, and the officers who tried him ought to have appreciated the fact. There has been no attempt made to alter the treatment of the men on transports, find t'he officers have not exhibited that feeling they should to men wbo fought, were wounded, and risked death under them, and gave them the opportunity to obtain honour. All this, however, is nothing new. Many officers regard their men as a father does his son, but others are careless, Qr have a vindictive and superior feeling towards them.

As honourable members are aware, I was summoned before a Court in Maryborough in 1917 for having made a false statement. magistrate found me guilty of making a false statement, but discharged me because, in his opinion, I had good reason for believing the statement to be true. lAs a member of this House, and as a unit in the community, I have a right to produce evidence to prove my innocence, and I endeavoured to get certain papers placed on tlie Library table. quest was refused ashamed of the papers. and I kept quiet under the refusal. Now the war is over, however, I have again asked the Government that all the papers connected with their endeavour to secure and formula for steel for shrapnel shells in 1914, and also the papers connected with my own case shall be produced. In the case of the shrapnel shells I am informed that the Government do not consider it advisable to lay these papers on the table of the Library, and, as to my own case, fchat it is not the practice to lay on the table of tke Library papers in relation to prosecutions instituted by the Coniirnonwealth. man can be arrested, tried, and gaoled without being allowed to produce evidence in proof of his innocence. I observe that a number of merabers are smiling, apparently at the idea of my being kept in the "" booby hatch"" for six months; but, in any case, I am going to take my liberty in my hands again. The prosecution of myself was initiated by the Defence Department under the War Precautions Act, and the information was signed by General Williams, State Commandant. voured to get evidence in the hands of the Department to prove my innocence^ but it has been refused. The facts of the case as to the steel formula are that in 1915 manufacturers in my division, though political opponents, sent to me as their representative, and asked me to introduce them as a deputation to Senator Pearce with a view to their manufacturing shrapnel in order to meet the great demand for ammunition at the time. The deputation came to Parliament House, The but when I saw Senator Pearce he said to' me that it was of no use his receiving them, because the Government could not get the formula from the British Government, as it was a secret formula. He kay came from America he would bring -the American formula with him, and that it would be given to our manufacturers That rehere. When Mr Mackay returned it was found that the American formula was useless; as a . matter of fact, there are are -millions of shells in the United States and Canada to-day that were never sent across the seas because of their inferior quality of the steel. Then they applied again to the British Government, and could not get the information, becaxise the firms which have the secret formula were manufacturing steel, and would not give it up to the Government. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce)' told me so himself, and I made the statement publicly in this House, ahd from dozens of platforms, but the Minister for Defence followed me to Maryborough, and he was asked if it was true.. He would not answer the question, and they would not This means that an innocent let him go on until he had answered it . He came to Melbourne next day, and slipped a summons on me to appear at the Maryborough Court, while he went away to Western Australia.

The arch-fiend who started it was the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), but Ministers seem to be following in his footsteps with a very strong desire to gaol men on the slightest evidence. that all this will be discontinued. People ought to be able to express themselves without the fear of gaol. They ought to be permitted to fly the red flag and tell the truth , as I did, without fear of prosecution. wish to endorse the remarks of the honorbald) in-reference to the case of Mr Henry, of the Customs Department. That gentleman feels that he has a good claim against the Department in that he has not been paid the salary which was due to the position he held at BrokenH ill for a number of years, and because, as a result of the Department moving him about from place to place, he suffered a loss of about £900 on the sale of his property and furniture. I am not concerned as to the amount of his loss; I am concerned in his case because I happen to know that he is not a man who would bring forward a bogus claim. He has too good a sense of what is equitable, just, and business like to put forward a claim whicli has no foundation. The Public Service Commissioner and the Customs Department seem to have arrived at a deadlock about the matter. For the honour of Parliament we ought to have a more satisfactory answer than has yet been vouchsafed. about it . him or any one else. Ministers do not always know the ins and outs of cases. The merits of officers' claims do not often reach the Minister's eye, and I am underthe impression that this is one of those cases. The only reply we can get is that the Trade and Customs Department is of opinion that Mr Henry has suffered no injustice. That is no answer. Surely tlie Department can say something more. If some satisfaction is not given to this public servant, his case will have to be brought forward in a more forcible way. I shall back up the honourable member for Hindmarsh in any step he takes to see that Mr Henry gets justice. Many years' ago I brought forward a motion on several occasions to the-effect that it was time the Commonwealth took I hope over the inspection of produce passing from State to State, but although the House eventually endorsed my motion nothing has been done to carry it into effect. heartily in sympathy with what the honI orable member desired, but if the.States still maintained their own inspectors what could the Commonwealth do? inember would remember, he would see that I suggested that, even if 'the Commonwealth had the constitutional power to do so, which I doubted, it should not attempt to force its inspectors on the States, but should approach them and seek to have the inspection machinery transferred to the Commonwealth. If that were done even now, it would ease a lot of misgiving which exists in the'minds of the producers. They seem to think that they are not getting proper treatment when their produce is passing from one State to another. If their goods are rejected at the New South Wales border, they naturally imagine that the State of New South Wales is not giving them a fair deal by rejecting their produce in order to preserve tlie local market for local growers. Of course there may be no foundation for that belief, but if the work of inspecting produce passing from one Senator Thomas State to another is a Federal matter, that ground for suspicion is at once removed I do not think anything has been done in this direction. If my memory serves me right, three years ago, the honourable member -for Yarra( Mr Tudor) who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, informed me that, while the war was in progress, tlie Government did not intend to do anything to carry out the proposition which Parliament had endorsed.

Persons who are in receipt of the old age pension are not permitted to augment the pension by earning more than 10s. a week, and with the present high cost of living, they find it very hard to exist. It would not be unfair to the community at large, or to other pensioners who are unable to augment their pensions, if those persons who are able to do so were permitted to earn more than the 10s. a week the regulations now permit them to earn. In fact, it would be in the public interest. look into this question, and see if they cainnot do something to meet many of these cases. I do not think that it w ill require great ingenuity on their part to tackle the matter aud frame the necessary legislation. During the course of this session we have heard a great deal about the high cost of living, and I would like to avail myself of this opportunity the subject. speak upon it before. -which it has arisen has proceeded long enough to justify to a close, but I have listened with a great deal of interest speeches that have been made. afraid that many who have addressed tlie House upon the subject have spoken to it with very little point. attention to the high cost of living, and then break of f , and accuse members on the Ministerial having done anything or of being unwilling to do anything to bring about a remedy. instance, I object to the remarks by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) to-day, in which he accused honourable members on this side of the Chamber of being callous and indifferent to the sufferings of the people who are affected by the high cost of living. The attempt to relieve the present state of affairs is not a task attaching to one side more than the other, and it is useless to utter a tirade against and Combines less an attempt a remedy. MrA tkinson. site rely om the old stock remedy of the Labour party, and that is to nationalize everything. I do not object to the nationalization of certain things if the circumstances are favorable to it ; but it is crude politics to say that the way to overcome the high price of commodities is to nationalize everything. The man who talks in that way cannot have studied the history of such: matters, and quite misses the mark. The last state of any country adopting a wholesale scheme of nationalization would be much worse than the present. However, there I hope the Government w ill is no doubt that something must be done to remedy the existing state of affairs, and I agree with the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) that the regulation of profits would be a step in the right direction. I believe that the Prices Commission, if given the opportunity, could do something effective on those lines. I have come to the conclusion, from my attendance -at the Commission, that the Commissioners were beginning to to refer to realize that the fixation of prices was not I have not been able to of much use, but that something might The debate in be done in the direction of regulating profits. its being brought to the various wealth Parliament constitutional power to I am limi t profits ?

For for bhe purpose of giving the States a made start. Most of the States are passing legislation in regard to the fixing of prices, but that is a very crude remedy. It means that the Prices Commission must always have its finger on the pulse of the trading community in order to see that the price fixed ds a fair one. If a number of traders approach the Commission, and point out that they cannot sell their newly-purchased goods at the price Trusts previously fixed, they are allowed to or single traders uncharge a higher price.

The only way j n which that could be done is by means of a referendum. I desire a more expeditious procedure. In regard to the ups and downs of prices, honourable members will find by consulting the records that during the first half of the last century there was a f a l l of about 60 per cent, in prices. Between 1850 and 1875, prices recovered about 30 per cent. From 1873 to 1896, there was another fall of 40 per cent.; and from 1896 to 1914 they rose approximately 35 per cent., and there has been a gradual rise ever since. well if honourable memberswould explain to the people a few of the causes of advancing prices. The increases are not all attributable to one cause. chief factors at the present time is the inflation of the currency. wages has probably very little to do with the cost of production.

351,Mr Atkinson,"Undoubtedl y wecommunity. Corporations have ""neither souls to be damned nor bodies to be kicked."" and, like tbe tiger, wben tbey taste blood, in the shape of high dividends, they want more of it . Their position is often so strong that they can keep up prices. We should be able, however, to control such organizations by the taxation or regulation of profits. "" There are various means of control that have not yet been attempted in this country, but which are far more reasonable from a business standpoint than are many of the proposals for dealing with Trusts that have been made by houorable members opposite. A convention representing all sections of thotight in Australia should be able to arrive at a satisfactory decision as to an amendment of the Constitution designed to meet our wants. There is another point to which I desire to refer, and which I shall elaborate on another occasion. I am a great believer in the principles of co-operation, profit-sharing, and co-partnery. These are among the most sensible schemes that have been propounded for the alleviation of industrial troubles. to mend. I am not so foolish as to believe that we shall find a panacea for every ill . But for a long time not only political economists, but all the great captains of industry-the enlightened thought of the world-hav e favoured cooperation, profit-sharing, and co-partnery. The more enlightened of our captains of industry who do not look at business as a mere matter of £ s. d who do not want to keep their employees in a r u t , but are anxious to improve thedr position, believe in these principles. They have come to the conclusion that, where practicable, they ought to be applied. Such remedies follow natural lines. A f t e r all, they constitute an appeal to human selfishness, and enlightened selfishness is the mainspring of most economic action. There is such a thing as erlightened selfishness as well as mean and sordid selfishness, just as we can have l of ty as well as petty ambitions, a lust for power, or any other smallnesses of mind. Seeing that profit-sharing and co-partnery give t a man some incentive to do his best, I think it is along those lines that some measure of success is likely to be secured in the alleviation of industrial trouble. This policy is being tried so widely, and with such success, that it only requires a few more instances of its adoption for it to gather great strength. If we can convert many of our employees from mere workers into partners partners! friends on the other side are always suspicious if one offers tbem anything. They seem to think that all who' approach them are trying to inveigle them into some trap. It is true that co-partnership would not be a very good thing for those men who form the executive of unions, and do the agitating in industrial circles. Buti t would promote the interests of the country and of both employers and employed, while at 'the same time stimulating production. It would give the worker who attended to his own affairs something like a decent recompense, because the bigger the profits the more money he would have to handle at the end of the year. He would not only get his miniI t is never too late mum wage, but a share of the profits, and if he cared to go in for the best form of co-partnership, and accept shares, there is no reason why in time he should not become a director. It would do what our friends opposite are crying out forgive the worker a fair share of the product of his labour. Unfortunately the Labour people claim that the worker shall have all the product, while tlie capitalistthe man of brains and the inventor-is given nothing. W h a t rot it is to claim that only manual labour should be considered ! A man like Edison sees an opportunity that may be turned to profit, anderects a factory in which he employs thousands of men. He may harness ai waterfall, and fill a great public want, and in the process make, perhaps, £100,000. In the course of years, however, he pays millions of pounds in wages; b u t in the present day he would be called a profiteer, and regarded as an enemy of society. It is all nonsense to say that the whole product of Labour belongs to the worker. It only means tliat",72,Robert Best Wha T Was The Will Have To Be Careful I Have Told Them

355,Mr Atkinson,"I know that my-fell© -worker desires to be put intbe prividemand, of which we formerly heard so leged position of a monopolist. On the other hand, if the management and the workers pull together, and regard the whole concern, not as the property of the capitalist, but of the people engaged, there is some chance of giving to the worker that fair share of the profit he is entitled to. If the worker at the end of the year be given a portion of the profits or shares in the business, there will be no need to raise prices because wages have gone up. Thef u n d which pays all concerned is, after all, what a business earns, and it would not be necessary to raise prices because the workers drew a minimum wage, plus a bonus, or so many shares. This is the' sort of scheme that will do away with much of the bitterness that at present exists, and much of which is due to ai want of knowledge by one class or the other. Hitherto some of these attempts, after an agreement has been arrived at, have miscarried, very often, owing to the fact that employers have tried to take away surreptitiously what they profess to give. That difficulty could be easily got over, for there is no reason why every such agreement should not be registered, and approved by some public official. All that is required is the elimination of the mere political element af&d class bitterness in order to achieve tangible and beneficial results. This is a big subject w it h many phases, and I hope on another occasion to deal with it more thoroughly in detail. A t present, I merely ask the Government to keep in mind the points I hav© placed before them. offer no apology for taking a littl e time, even at this hour, to discuss the question of prices. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) has chastised members on this side for constantly complaining about the high cost of living, and offering no remedy. So far as that is concerned, the Inter-State Commission was appointed, I believe, by a Labour Government, to inquire into the high cost of living, and it ha6 brought forward many reports which all go to show that in this country there are combinations in relation to almost every line of goods. Competition and the law of supply and [445] much, have entirely disappeared. There is no such thing as competition to-day. The price of every commodity is arranged and fixed, and every hand through which a commodity passes claims a share of the profit. As a consequence, the cost of living has been increasing by leaps and bounds. During the war .people made very little complaint, because they were under the impression that this was part of the price we had to pay to secure victory. But it is many months since the Armistice was signed, and the people naturally expect the cost of livin g to f a l l. To-day, however, if we take the commodities selected by the statisticians, not including clothing and other things, we find that the increase in prices represents between 50 and 60 per cent., as against an increase of something like 25 per cent, in wages. This means that the purchasing power of the people is reduced by at least 25 per cent., and that the sovereign to-day is not worth more than 15s. The conditions have been borne with patience. Working people have denied themselves many things during the last three or four years. Families have gone short of clothing, and, generally, have not lived at the same standard as formerly. Those who were in a position to save prior to the war have had their savings eaten away, and those who lived from band to mouth have simply had to deny themselves. All this tends to degeneracy so f a r as the race is concerned, and it is not in the interests of the country that suoh a state of things should be permitted one hour longer than can be avoided. If we have not the power now to fix prices, we had the power during the war; and in many directions we have never attempted to regulate them. Increases have been permitted without any restraint whatever, except, as I say, in a small way in some directions. We are now told that under the Constitution we can no longer deal even with these. I warn the Government that they cannot hoodwink the people all the time. If , when we had the power during the war, we did not regulate prices, what is the use of telling the people that we have not the power now ? No matter what party is in power, it is the duty of Parliament to protect the",73,Robert Best Wha T Was The Will Have To Be Careful I Have Told Them

During the war the people's loyalty led them to suffer patiently, b u t now they are looking for redress. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) suggested that we should ask tbe Statesf o r certain powers, but we must not forget that we did do that after the second referendum, and the States agreed. The trouble is, however, that when p u t to the test the States did not keep f a it h w it h us. We must face the situation. We cannot leave it any longer. We must, as a Government or as a Parliament, take the matter into i m mediate consideration. It will not brook further delay. We ought to inform the State Governments of the position, and ask them if they are going to exercise these powers and deal w i th the profiteers at once. I do not approve of the appointment of committees and commissions. It is only killing time and in tensifying the evil. We have sufficient evidence already from the Inter-State Commission to warrant the State or Federal Governments taking action. If we cannot do so, let us ask the Statest o give us the power to act on behalf of the whole of the people. A f t e r all, no one can expect six different State Governments to operate six different laws in regard to the cost of living. It must be controlled by one Parliament, and that the Federal. We should ask the States to give us the powers^ If they will not, let us go to the people at once and ask them to amend the Constitution, and arm us with authority to act. If we go to them as a united party they will do what The honourable member for Wilmot we want. It is no good going, as we did before, as a divided Parliament. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Sampson), who now advocates an amendment of the Constitution, opposed the proposals when they were before the people previonsly. L e t us point out to the people that the powers are necessary; get those powers, and with the reports of the Inter-State Commission before us, deal with the profiteering evil at once. That is the solution of the difficulty; but talking is of no use. There are one or two things that we have the power to deal with in some way without an amendment of the Constitution -Take the question of the price of boots. I have in my possession a letter from a business man, who has been in formed that the ordinary boots that the average working man wears, which he purchased wholesale for 13s. I d . in June last, are now 21s., and that it is further contemplated that another rise will take place within the next couple of weeks. Where are they going to ? The manufacturers put that increase down to the high price of hides. When I asked a question yesterday about the price of hides, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) said that the grazier . was getting only 30s. for the hide.' was the average. bringing to-day from £ 3 to £ 5 each, who is getting the difference? beasts that died.

Ever since we perfected cold storage, the prices of tilings have been going up.' We have-been able to store the surplus, and the people have had to pay more. This matter is of immense importance to me, because I can see the effect it has on the working people outside. They cannot bear the strain.
