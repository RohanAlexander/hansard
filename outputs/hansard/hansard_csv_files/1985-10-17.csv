There is a world of importance because we have seen, through the difference between understanding certain actions reactions of the Hawke Government to the tragic and supporting them. Anyone can understand events that unfolded through the hijacking of certain actions, but it is a different matter to the Achille Lauro, a continuing pattern of stand up and say one supports them, to go out change.

That is a long way short of the views of the As I have said, it is a major transformation, Acting Prime Minister, as he floundered around and it is no exaggeration to say just that. As a in the Parliament on Tuesday, still muttering consequence, the failure of this Government is that he supported the United States actions and not that it has accepted those ideas propounded that they were perfectly legal. Why was the by the left wing and its followers but that by its Acting Prime Minister not able to send a mesvacillation, its indecision and its basic weakness sage applauding the United States action? It was in standing up to the Left, the Left has been surely worthy of such applause. No violence was reinvigorated. Each time the Government seeks used and the terrorists were brought to justice.

The Minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, spoken about the question of tax averaging for Recreation and Tourism( Mr John Brown), heard professional sports people. I believe we ought to address this as a matter of priority. There is the remarks made by the honourable member for Cowper( Mr Nehl) as I did. I suggest that considerable community support for it. Let me the honourable member for Cowper come to my instance why this is the case. Wherever we home city of Perth to see what is happening look-at people in rugby league, Australian rules there. football, soccer and so on-we see that competitors in general have a very short earning period honourable member for Cowper correctly says sporting career, and subsequent to it, they go that it is a lovely city.
