In committee (Consideration of Administrator's message): Tlmt it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue fund a sum of £250,000 for the purpose of scientific and industrial research. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedThat Mr Casey and Mr Thorby do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. a first time. [11.12] I move That the bill be now read a second time. I possible to explain the purposes of this measure and then leave the matter for debate at a later date. The purpose of this measure is to appropriate the sum of £250,000 from tbe revenue of this current financial year in order to form a trust fund which will be known as the Science and Industry Capital Trust Account for the purpose of financing capital works in connection with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Honourable members are, of course, aware that the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research up to' the present has been confined almost entirely to attempting a solution of primary production problems. Honourable members will also be aware that late in 1936 the Government set np a committee known as the Secondary Industries Testing and Research Committee which was composed of leading industrialists and eminent scientists. The report of that committee, which has been actually available to honourable members and to the public for some little time, I formally laid on the table of the House yesterday, and several copies are available to honourable members on the table in the Library. This committee made its report in 1937, and it recommended, amongst other things, an Australian standards reference laboratory, an aircraft and engine testing and research laboratory, a research service, an information service and a testing service for secondary industries. Subsequent to the report of this committee, the Government, as the House is aware, was fortunate in having the services and advice of Mr H. E. Wimperis, lately director of Aeronautical Research in Great Britain. Mr Wimperis is a very eminent gentleman in his field, and we had him here for upwards of six months. He was primarily engaged in advising the Government on the establishment of an aircraft industry in Australia and on the necessity for aeronautical research. His report, which has been in the hands of the public for some time, was also formally tabled yesterday and copies are available in the Library. Broadly speaking, for the purposes of this bill his report bore out in its entirety tlie report of the committee on secondary industries research. So far as this bill is concerned, the broadening of the actishould like as briefly as vities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has a distinct defence flavour. The two main institutions that will be brought into existence by reason of the moneys made available under this bill are an essential link in the big defence effort that Australia is making now and will make in the years immediately ahead. The two principal institutions which it is proposed to bring into existence are a National Standards Laboratory, which it is hoped to establish in the University grounds i i i Sydney, and an Aeronautical Research Laboratory situated close to tbe works of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermen's Bend, in Victoria. The report of Mr Wimperis, dealt more specifically with the aeronautical side, and honourable members who have read his report, or even such extracts from it as have been published in the press, can be in"" no doubt regarding the need for the inauguration of aeronautical research in Australia.",19,Papers

25,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer)There is already in existence in Australia a number of standards, which really means that there is no standard at all, and it is to overcome that disability that these proposals have been evolved. Up to the present these matters, where they have been dealt with at all, have come under tbe control of the State governments, though the Commonwealth Government has power, under the Constitution, to legislate in this respect. At tbe present time, there are as many standards in Australia, as there are States, but there is no set of standards common to Australia a3 a whole. I refer of course, in particular, to standards of length aud mass, of electrical and light units and to all the other physical propercipal National Standards Laboratory. ties with which man has to deal in secondary industries. In Great Britain, standards are dealt'with by the National Physical Laboratory. The Commonwealth Government has been in close touch with that body which has agreed to afford us all possible assistance. ""We are approaching in Australia the era of what is called "" mass production when parts of any one implement, whether for defence or for any other purpose, may be made either in separate factories or in different vice. This is not directly relevant to the branches of the one factory, and it is essential that all those parts should be, within very close limits, of the same size.

ARCHIE CAMERON -Again the honourable member for Batman says "" Hear, hear"", but it stands to reason that those divergent views cannot consistently be supported by members of tbe Opposition. I shall now quote tbe remarks of one of the younger members of the Labour partya notable member of the party, in that he has three supporters among honourable members opposite in the persons of the honourable members for Denison( Mr Miahoney), Franklin( Mr Frost) and Bass( Mr Barnard). I refer to Mr Ogilvie, the Premier of Tasmania, who believes that it is necessary to go even further than the Commonwealth Government proposes to go in regard to defeuce. disagree witb him? Are oblivious to the fact that tbe Labour Premier of an Australian State has condemned the apathy of the Labour movement in regard to defence? Mr Ogilvie put up a proposition which can be understood by the people of Australia, but we find no echo of support for it from the occupants of the front bench opposite. Defence disagrees with it. other night exception was taken to certain actions of this Government in relation to tbe international position. We were told that we had no foreign policy, that we were following blindly in the footsteps of Great Britain. We were criticized for not having taken certain action consequent upon the resignation of Mr Eden, and then, on other occasions, it seemed that the fault of the Government was that it had taken _ action in this respect. Tbe fact of the matter is that this Government cannot concern itself with the resignation of a member of a government of another British country; that it not our affair. All we were concerned with was the implications of the moves that led up to Mr Eden's resignation, and anything that might eventuate therefrom. Other resignations have taken place, and anybody, I think, would admit that the British Government would have been quite wrong if it had taken steps, for instance, to inquire into the reason why a very senior member of the last Lyons Government resigned from office. _ Similarly Australia would have been surprised if Canada had concerned itself with the resignation at a later date of our Minister in Charge of Negotiations for Trade Treaties. Such matters concern only the governments involved, and we must give each government credit for being able to manage its own affairs. This Government is certainly able to do that. Last night the honourable member for Batman expended a great deal of eloquence in upholding the policy of the Chamberlain Government as an example to this Government. the points in Mr Chamberlain's speech to which I referred. honourable member described the policy of Mr Chamberlain's Government as excellent, and one which this Governlain bad laid down certain conditions with regard to the defence of Great Britain which the lionorable member thought that the Commonweajth Government should follow in respect of the deMinister for fence of Australia. Government showed a capacity for minding its own business and that this Government, might well follow its example in that respect. parently the honourable member now wishes to qualify his statement, but I suggest that ho should read in Hansard the remarks which he made last night. I shall quote from a very important Sydney paper, and one whose veracity honourable members opposite will not question, The Labor Daily.' In its issue of the 5th March, it said that Mr Chamberlain's policy was "" as simple as it is cynical, and as clever as it is diabolical."" I do not know whether the lionorable member for Batman, whew referring to Mr Chamberlain's defence policy, appeared in the guise of what at one time was called advocatus diaboli.

If the honourable member for East Sydney can explain what form of defence he believes in, I suggest that every member of this House will be prepared to stay here for a week to listen to him. I have heard the honourable member for Batman denouncing every form of defence. The facts are that divisions of opinion may exist on both sides as to what will happen in the international sphere in the future. There is no harm in facing up to the facts and I believe in doing so. I am sure that this Government will face up to the facts as they exist to-day. There is no denying that honourable members supporting this Government have advocated certain definite measures which the Government has not been prepared to adopt, but it is only reasonable to expect that they will express their opinions; in fact, the Government would think very little of them if they failed to do so. case with honourable members on this side of the House. complete and absolute unity among honourable members on this side in regard to the proposals which the Government has placed before this chamber. The people of Australia have to choose between this Government's policy and a set of contradictory propositions put up by the Opposition, and I contend that if this alternative were tested before the people tomorrow the Government would win as it did at the general election, for the simple reason that the electors of Australia have no faith in either the intention, porters of the Government, and of the or. the capacity, of the Opposition, if it were elected to power, to implement a defence policy. On the other hand, the people of Australia have complete confidence in the defence programme placed by the Government before the House, and I have no doubt that these proposals will be carried. I do not suppose there is any question which runs across classes and parties in Australia more than does this issue of military preparation. opinion exist on all sides, and have been All I have heard is just as obvious on the Government side in the course of this debate as on this side. All supporters of the Government apparently unite upon a policy of local security, but from some of them we gather that local security is to be obtained by fighting in Europe, whilst others seem to think that it is to be obtained by preparing to fight in Australia and not out of it. The Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) made great play upon the advocacy of compulsory military training by Mr Ogilvie. I point out that Mr Ogilvie advocated such action as a proposed change in the Labour party's policy. He, did not propose a policy for Australia or for himself, but simply suggested, and apparently the Labour conference in Tasmania supported him, that the policy of the Australian Labour party should be changed so as to provide for compulsory military training. Remember, however, that that proposal is compulsory military training for the defence only of Australia and territories controlled by Australia To that extent it is perfectly consonant with the policy of the Labour party. Mr Ogilvie opposes as much as anybody else the idea of raising forces for active service overseas. House agrees with him. Ogilvie is merely making a proposal for an alteration of the Labour party's platform by which he is bound. Before such an alteration can be made, he must get the support of representatives of other States at the Australian Labour party's interstate conference. On this issue the difference between the policy of the supmembers of the Labour party appears to be this: The defence policy of the Government and of its supporters is to be planned and operated in co-operation with Great Britain and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations; that is to say it is to fit into the mosaic of a general imperial scheme to be directed by the imperial authorities, the Australian authorities merely doing their part in effectuating the general scheme.. On the other hand the Labour party, and the Labour movement generally, 'believe Divisions of that the defence policy of this country",26,Casey

That is to say, the Australian Labour party's scheme of defence does not fit into the imperial or British scheme of defence at all, whereas tbe Commonwealth Government scheme does. If war should break out the actions of this Government would be determined by the imperial command. The policy of the Government may change from time to time, but it is constant in that it is framed in relation to Great Britain's policy. If tlie form of British policy sliould change, the Commonwealth Government's policy would change with it. Some have said that the present Government has abandoned the defence policy on which it went to the country, and has adopted a new policy. It has not done that. The substance of the defence policy on which it went to tbe country was that it would co-ordinate its defence measures with tii03e of Great Britain. It is still doing that, although the form of tbe policy abroad may have changed. its defence policy. changed only superficially. The central feature of it remains the same, namely that it can be co-ordinated with tbe policy of Great Britain. The policy of the Labour party provides for tbe defence of Australia only-preparatio n to resist aggression-and it is uot adopted out of ill will or hostility to the British people or even to tbe British Government; I think that we must distinguish between the two. Those who dislike the policy of tbe British Government do not necessarily dislike Great Britain. It would be as unfair to charge Major Attlee with dislike of Australia because he dislikes the Australian Government's policy, as it is to charge the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) with hostility to Great Britain because he disapproves the policy of the British Government. leaning towards Ireland. and I would not blame him for it, but that docs not imply hostility to the British people. It is very obvious to-day that neither Mr De Valera nor any party in Eire is hostile towards the British people. The defence policy of the Australian Labour party is framed with the object of promoting tbe peace of tbe world. It is a sort of categorical imperative. The Labour party proposes that Australia should act in the matter of defence in such a way that its actions may become a rule of conduct for the rest of the world. The only preparations for war which can be consistent with the peace of the world, are those which are for the exclusive purpose of resisting invasion. If nations concentrate solely upon resisting invasion of their own country and do nothing more, it is obvious that they will not be suspected or feared; consequently war will be unlikely. the Labour party would have no interest in the defence of New Zealand? party's platform contains provision to cover the position in respect of New Zealand.

If a nation makes preparations which are not strictly limited to its own defence against actual invasion, such preparations are bound to be misunderstood and misconstrued by other nations. The only way in which a peace-loving nation can preparefor defence, is by making preparations in such a form and witb such restrictions that obviously its measures are intended solely for its own defence and cannot be used for any other purpose. That is why the Labour party, in framing tbe details of its defence policy, prohe has a special vided a scheme whioh cannot be used readily except for defence of Australia against aggression. That is why it regards as objectionable, the provision of large ships of war; these are equivocal weapons, because obviously, while these",27,Casey

I u spite of what has been said by some honourable members, including the Assistant Minister( Mr Archie Cameron), it must be f a i r l y obvious that Australia is not in greater clanger of invasion than it had been; in fact, the danger is less that it was some time ago. . We must realize that there are three great nations bordering the -Pacific. If Australia were in danger of invasion, it would expect invasion from one of three nations. No one can seriously contend that Australia is in danger of being invaded by tbe United States of America. The other nations are Japan and Russia. Whatever one may think of Russia, one cannot escape tbe conclusion that that country is determined not to go to war except in the defence of its own territory. Russia w ill not go to war for the promotion of the Communist cause in other countries. to-day is owing to the difference of opinion between those who believe that Russia should fight only for the defence of Russia, and those who want that country to become the centre of a world revolutionary war. The Trotsky party the only way socialism can become an accomplished order is by its spread to all countries and that advantage should be taken of war to bring about a world revolution. The Trotskyists want to make Russia the spearhead of a world-wide social war, but Stalin is against that policy. Russia abandoned tlie great Communist party of Germany, and recognized Hitler's accession to power. Un doubtedly it has abandoned the promotion of the Communist cause in China, and has been much criticized on that account. In the present conflict, China has not received any assistance from Russia beyond obtaining supplies of munitions. valuable form of assistance? nations are doing the same. Britain supplies munitions to any nation. In a totalitarian State, the Government has to accept responsibility for everything, but a democratic State may decline responsibility for the activities of private capitalists. The one thing that stands out crystal clear in the world to-day is We sliould study closely the that the Government of Russia w ill not fight except for the defence of its territory; not even for the support of communism in other countries will it draw the sword. It is clear that Russia has no aggressive intentions towards the rest of the wor*d and much clearer that it has no such intentions towards Australia. The position in respect of Japan is much better than it has ever been, because it is quite obvious that, whatever be the outcome of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Japan w ill be in a state of financial exhaustion similar to that in which it found itself at the termination of the Russo-Japanese war. If it wins, its f u l l resources of men and money w ill be required to consolidate its conquest; if it fails, it can be, to a great extent, disregarded. .

103,Great Mr Blackburn,"It is perfectlyCentral Europe, probably spreading eventually to the East. In reply to the point raised by the honourable member for Grey( Mr Badman), it seems to me that a great deal of talk about the return of the former German colonies is intended for overseas consumption. It supplies the German Government with an argument. I do not believe that Germany desires a colonial empire; if it does, that empire will come, not by the retrocession of its former colonial possessions, but by the annexation of Holland and the acquisition of Dutch overseas possessions. Whatever may be the position in Europe, it seems perfectly clear that a war with Italy or with Germany would be a war fought out in Europe, and would not affect Australia. member realize that nations outside Europe might join in? nations could do so ? I have disposed of that point. It is, -in my view, quite in-, conceivable that Bussia would take part in any war unless attacked, and it would appear to be out of the question for Japan to do so in order to assist either among other nations. The only attitude Germany or Italy. honourable member think that Japan would maintain the status quo in the Pacific during a European war? position of Japan will be such that it will not be able to do anything in that direction. Further, I do not think Japan desires outlying possessions. member that? mon sense, which also tells me that Great Britain would be more secure to-day if it did not possess a far-flung Empire. Now that the plane of warfare has shifted from the sea to the air, the nations desire empires comprising territories near home which can be controlled and policed from the air rather than from the sea. I believe that the change of the method of fighting from the'sea to the air has altered tremendously the imperialistic ambitions of nations. Oversea colonies are quite a secondary consideration with Germany. If German ambitions with respect to the acquisition of territory develop, Germany will occupy most of Central Europe, and, similarly, if Italian ambitions extend further, Italy will establish a Mediterranean empire. Eveni f I believed there was a mueh greater danger of attack-than is actually the case, I should nevertheless endorse the policy of the Australian Labour party as the correct one for Australia, or any other country, to adopt. A great deal of the danger of war eventuating is undoubtedly due to preparations made for war. Nations cannot continually prepare for war without incurring that danger. In such nations there grows up a class of people habituated to the idea of war. They see in war all sorts of opportunities for capitalistic success and the conquest of new markets. Members of the woi-king class see that if new markets can be gained by their masters a greater degree of employment can be proother vided, while administrative and military classes see in any war opportunities for advancement. A nation cannot continue preparing for war without having to fight some day; it cannot make such preparations without creating a state of fear consistent with peace is one that cannot paration for action overseas. In those circumstances the policy advocated by the Labour party is, I believe, tbe right one for this country. If Great Britain were, involved in any way at all it would be a tremendous disaster for Australia. member think that other countries would regard Australia as a separate political entity ? Britain were at war I am certain they would not regard Australia as not being at war, too. If , for instance, Great Britain were at war with Japan, the Japanese would probably attack Australia, irrespective of what Australia did. But that does not affect my position. I hold that whatever happens to Australia or to any nation in the long run, we must make a stand for world peace, and with that object in view, if it is necessary to make preparations for war, only such action should be taken as could not be construed as anything but preparation",29,Casey

111,Mr Blackburn,"No. If Greatfor the actual defence of our own territory. I do not believe that there are malevolent nations in the world or that tbe rulers of any nations are actually malevolent. In my opinion the greatest danger of war results from international misunderstandings. There is little danger of war between Great Britain and the United States of America, because both nations speak the same language and read the same books and there is a free interchange of ideas between the two. But there is a great danger of war between countries that do not possess the same institutions and do not understand one another's views. As I pointed out a moment ago, nations that prepare for war upon such a scale that they could wage a war overseas create fear in other countries. unpreparedness for war the cause of the present risk of war? so. One factor that in my opinion may bring lis to the verge of war is the closed Empire policy for which we, as well as Great Britain, are responsible, and under which* an attempt is made to close the Empire's markets to other nations. This policy, which was adopted by Great Britain in 1931, is bringing war nearer. tariff. a commercial union with New Zealand and the United States of America, and considerable reductions of tbe tariff. I should be prepared to make many sacrifices to bring peace nearer, because I realize that there cannot be peace when nations cease to deal with one another. All these things are secondary to the necessity to maintain peace. There is in -my mind a difference between a nation saying: ""We are going to keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves, but we will trade with everybody else on an equal basis"" and saying ""We will keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves and beyond that trade only with favoured peoples"". is tbe more dangerous attitude and, as I say, I believe it is the closed Empire policy rather than Britain's unpreparedness that is making for war. policy by Great Britain in 1931 the British Empire had acquired a great deal of overseas territory without opposition on the part of other countries, because it was realized that when Great Britain took possession of, for instance, a portion of Africa or Asia, it did not exclude other nations from trading with the inhabitants on equal terms with British people, whereas if Germany, Erance or any other country assumed control of an undeveloped area a monopoly of trade would be established by that country. But Great Britain has abandoned its former policy with the result that the danger of war has been increased. I have, however, been drawn from my main theme. I repeat that in my opinion the defence policy enunciated by the Labour party, and to which I heart and soul subscribe, should be adopted in the interests of Australia. Sir. HENRY GULLETT (Henty)' [12.24] -A t the outset I desire to congratulate the Government, and the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) in particular, upon the enlarged national defence scheme placed before the House. To me it is admirable so far as it goes, but my complaint is that it goes neither far enough nor fast enough. I shall, however, deal with that point at a later stage. I regret that the Minister for Defence has spent so little time in the House during this very important debate. Apart from debates during the Great War, this is the most important discussion on defence that has ever occurred in this Parliament, and it is most unfortunate that the Minister should not have been in a position to listen to the views-many , I admit, critical, but many also constructive-put forward by honourable members. I make that comment, however, in no chiding spirit. I assume that the Minister is not present because he is overwhelmed with the great burden he is carrying at the present time. That brings The latter me to a very interesting point. In no other part of the world would the Minister for Defence be absent from Parliament during a debate of this nature, and I am impelled to ask whether the Prior to the adoption of that Minister is not carrying an impossible",30,Cameron Doe S The Be Construed In Any Way As Being In Pre

115,"Mr Blackburn""","I would favourload, and to urge strongly upon the Government the desirability of giving immediate consideration to the -question of dividing the Defence Department into two sections, and creating another portfolio. The crisis through which we are passing at present demands, I think, such action, for which there is ample precedent. For many years tliere was in this country an Assistant Minister for Defence when the defence programme was more or less normal. There are Assistant Ministers in departments of much less significance, and the responsibilities of which are less onerous than are those of the Defence Department at the present time. There is, for instance, a Ministry for Commerce under the control of a Minister and two Assistant Ministers. Heaven alone knows what they do, but that is the position. Then the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has acquired an assistant within the last six months, and altogether several departments are double-banked with portfolios, while the defence of Australia, which is of supreme importance at the present juncture, is dealt with by one Minister who is not able to remain in this chamber for more than a few minutes at a time during a vital debate, continuing over a number of days. I desire now to refer to the proposal to appoint for a term not clearly defined an Inspector-General of the Australian Military Forces, and to bring to Australia to occupy that post an officer of general rank in the United Kingdom. In past years there have been visits by a number of very highly placed aud distinguished British officers who have dealt with defence matters as a whole. For example, Sir John Salmond came to Australia some years ago to advise upon the Royal Australian Air Force, and important representatives of the British navy have visited this country also; but in each only, just as it is the part of every other case their mission has been a brief and special one. Tbey have been requested toreport to the Commonwealth Government upon our defence system, and to make recommendations with respect to it, and I trust that the Government will, if possible, confine the duties of the distinguished officer who is to come from Great Britain on this occasion, in a similar manner. I make that request for a num8ir Henry Gullett. ber of reasons, but particularly because I believe that the briefer the visit tbe better the man we shall get. There is not an unlimited number of officers of general rank of outstanding capacity in the British Army, and to bring one of these gentlemen to Australia for any long period would, in all probability, interfere very seriously with bis status and promotion in the British Army. To me the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was incomprehensible; throughout, it consisted of a series of contradictions, and it was quite contradictory of tbe previous responsible statements made by my honourable friend. As recently as the 26th March last the honourable gentleman saidThe defence programme outlined last night is a vastly different thing to the theories of collective security and external cooperation which hitherto have been the Prime Minister's preoccupation. And then he went on to sayThis is realism. It faces tlie facte as they affect Australia and Australians. That was, apart from detail, one hundred per cent, endorsement of this scheme; it was a complete endorsement of its principle, its enlarged nature, and the increased expenditure. I admit that the honourable gentleman went on to say in the course of that statement that the Government had stolen the Opposition's defence scheme. If that charge is truo why did the honourable gentleman occupy the best part of an hour yesterday in condemning tlie Government's scheme? He said that the scheme is bis own, yet yesterday he literally kicked it to pieces. Tlie honourable gentleman still stands for a policy of isolation, a defence policy run-ning along independent lines; he says that it is our duty in the formulation of a defence policy to look after Australia portion of the Empire to look after itself only. The honourable gentleman is against co-operation.. It is a case of "" Each for himself, and the devil take the hindmost"". If that policy were carried out in the present circumstances, Australia would probably be the country that the devil would take. The honourable gentleman is in favour of each of the component parts of the British Empire providing separately for its own defence. It must be obvious to the honorable gentleman that the certain way come to that a little later. I should like to court defeat is to allow an enemy first to say a few words upon the very .such as we might . have to facea important subject of the preservation qf powerful nation in itself, and not imour trade routes, because this seems to probably a combination of powers-to me, and I am sure it must appear so to -dispose of the British countries one by all who have pondered it, to be one of -one.

In the British House of Commons British members speak frankly of Germany, Italy, Japan or Russia, and I believe that Japan will appreciate our honesty if we discuss these matters frankly. consider not Japan alone. There is in existence to-day a three-power pact, two of the signatories of which are the most overcrowded and the most land hungry countries in the world. In Australia we have at once the richest, the fairest least defended of all the countries in the world. I turn now to discuss briefly the problem of Australia's Infantry Forces. I wish that I could be as positive as is the honourable member for Bourke( Mr ""less two days travelling to and from Blackburn) that there is no danger in the near future. Unhappily I have not his certainty of mind. I do not suggest that invasion is imminent, but I am not unmindful of the fact that international law ancl international morality have apparently been forgotten by the rulers of some great countries. During the last two or three years we have witnessed aggression in a most terrible form. . I applaud the Government's scheme, as far as it goes; but I emphasize that, without adequate infantry forces well equipped and sufficiently trained to go into immediate action, Australia cannot be considered safe. Eminent military authorities believe that if invasion does come to this country, which God forbid, it will come, not as a great army, but in a series of raids. Military strategy would probably suggest the landing of say, 10,000 troops at one point with feints, demonstrations or actual landings elseWhileI am in complete agreement that we must have these technical services incur heavy expenditure, it is, I believe, essential that we should have adequate infantry to meet the raids in strength where and when they may be made. Obviously an aggressor would not land forces in the north-west of Australia, where it would be easy to get ashore, because that portion of tbe Commonwealth would have no attraction for the enemy. The objective would be one or more of our vital industrial areas. If to-morrow we had a couple of months' notice of impending danger of forces being landed simultaneously near SydBesides, we have, to ney and Melbourne or in Western Australia what strength would we have to resist them? Once they got ashore we could not expect to halt them with our -air forces, and the vulnerability of modern naval units to attack from the air has been very much exaggerated. This, at all events, is the opinion of British naval authorities. Therefore, if an invading force landed, within striking distance of Newcastle, Sydney or Melbourne, our position would be extremely grave. Our present infantry strength is 35,000 militia, scattered all over Australia, whose training amounts to twelve half-days a year and six days in camp, oamp, so that their actual period of training is ten days a. year. I have no wish to criticize the men. On. the contrary I warmly commend them for their public spirit. But the truth is that we have the greatest difficulty in getting sufficient",33,Cameron Doe S The Be Construed In Any Way As Being In Pre

123,Sir Henry Gullett,"And thenumbers, and the physical standard of the units is not as high as it should be: it is not nearly up to the standard for acceptance during the Great ""War. Yet this is the force upon which we should have to depend to guard Australia against the possibility of two or three heavy and well-planned raids. It is interesting to see how the 35,000 militiamen are distributed in the various States of the Commonwealth. The distribution is, of course, very largely on a population basis. Thus, in the great State of New South Wales we have less than. 13,000 of these slightly trained men, and in Victoria we have 9,500. These men would, in all probability, be confronted by war veterans or conscript trained forces. In Queensland, that part of the Commonwealth which an invader would obviously find very habitable, there are militia. and there are only 2,300 in Western Australia, which is so isolated from the rest of the Commonwealth, that rapid 'assistance could not be given. The State of Tasmania has a mere 1,200. If the members of our militia were comparable to the Australian Forces in France and Palestine in 1917 and 1918, the defence force, although being still totally inadequate, would be experienced fighters upon whom strong l-einforcements could be rested with the certainty that they would very quickly reach a high standard of efficiency. The1 capacity of the present militia forces to absorb and train recruits must be very Low indeed. Months would elapse before we could produce men with sufficient training to go into the line against experienced troops without suffering appalling casualties. The position is even more serious than that. We have no system for the calling up of reinforcements in an emergency. This is an aspect which I wish particularly to stress. I urge the early re-establishment in this country of the area officer system, and I suggest that area officers should, wherever possible, be supplemented by industrial officers. These officers would be responsible for compiling a register of all men in the Commonwealth between the ages of IS and 50 years fit for service or wartime industry. The men should be classified according to whether they are to be front line men or industrial workers. If they are highly skilled, then they would be in a reserve for industry. If they are classified to go into the front line, they should be allocated in such a way that their services would be available immediately the order for mobilization was given. Under existing conditions in Australia, if the order for mobilization were to be given to-day, there would be chaos. It is not difficult to visualize the disorganization that would occur in Sydney in the event of a sudden raid. I happened to be in France on holidays in 1914 when the war broke out, and I was amazed by the efficiency and expedition with which mobilization was carried out. The only notification that France was at war was a single typeonly 5,000 partly trained written line giving the date of mobilizaSouth Australia has 3,000, tion, 1st August; yet within half-anhour, the older men in the fifties began to pass down the streets on their way to the barracks, where they were equipped, and given such duties as fell within their capacity. By the tenth or twelfth day, mobilization had extended to the first reserves, or the near reserves, for whom the barracks were ready, so these men were able at once to enter the fighting services. We are not .a conscript country, and never want to be, but we should make adequate provision for our defence so that if war does come, our men may go into action in a business like way. will prosper. hope that war will never come to this country, and, I urge that we take every possible step to keep our sons out of war. Like the Prime Minister, the Acting Minister for Commerce and many other honourable members. I have a son of military age, so it would be foolish to suggest that I am in any way speaking in favour of war. I emphasize that a scheme for the systematic mobilization of Australian manhood should be drawn up by the Government, concurrently with the addition to the A ir Force, the Navy and coast defences. It has been said that we have not the necessary equipment for larger",34,Utjoii Which The Government Proposes To
124,Mr Mahoney,And the war profiteers,35,Utjoii Which The Government Proposes To
125,Sir Henry Gullett,"I sincerelynumbers who might be enrolled for compulsory training. I strongly challenge that statement. The existing equipment for infantry, machine gun, artillery units ancl other arms is used only on twelve half-days ancl one week in every year] so the possibility of expansion of training is apparent. A battalion commander in Melbourne, to whom I spoke last week 7 on this subject, informed me that with his existing equipment he could train five time the present number, provided more training days were made available. There is nothing warlike in my suggestion. defence. enemy take stock of this country? Would it be our 70 odd aeroplanes, or double that number, as proposed under the enlarged defence scheme? Would it be the cruisers of the Australian Navy or our coastal defences? No. All these things would count for little, if we were without an efficient infantry force. An enemy would measure our defence potentiality on our trained man-power, or man power in availability. If we were measured only on our very limited technical services and our 35,000 partly trained militia men our rating would be very low indeed. An enemy would know that if his forces could get ashore, resistance would be very slight. If , however, we had a proper system providing for the rapid mobilization of an effective defence force, we should be assessed as a far more formidable objective ancl probably be left to enjoy our peace. I submit that scheme with confidence to every member of the Opposition, and I put it forward as a common sense one. I satisfy themselves as to conscription. Everybody must subscribe to tbe statement made yesterday by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) that one cannot visualize stripping this country of its manhood as was done in the Great War. It may be that we could send two or three divisions somewhere overseas, but they would be volunteers, and we could always be certain of getting volunteers; compulsory training is in no way associated with conscription for overseas service. What does recent history show as to the indispensability of infantry ? Madrid; Sir Henry Gullett. for a year or more, has stood against all the modern mechanism of war. Why? It has been practically bombed to bits, and i i is constantly under heavy gunfire, but it has stood so far because of its strongly entrenched and indomitable lines of infantry. I clo not say that infantry will save Barcelona, yet, if there were sufficient infantrymen, they could save that city. Most of the professional army of Spain went to the Nationalists, and what a price Republican Spain has paid through not having a trained army! Had it possessed the professional army, the It is purely sound story would have beenentirely different. On what would a potential It started with untrained troops, and that is the reason why it has paid such a terrible price. The history of Gallipoli telk of a glorious landing and a magnificent achievement up to a point, but every good mind in. the Australian Imperial Force knowsthat if we had had there a division of Australians from France, as they were in 1917 or 1918, or a divisionof dismounted Australian Light Horse from Palestine, as they were in those years, tbey would have swept through irresistibly to the Narrows. The United States of America started in the war from scratch,"" where we should have to start to-morrowwithout even a mobilization scheme-and quite a year went by before that country had any men in France. Take the SinoJapanese war. Why have the Chinese, temporarily, at leastI do not say permanently-checke d the Japanese, despite all their armaments and modern mechanism ? It is because when this conflict began China had for years been engaging in a great deal of internal warfare. ask honourable members first to Probably a couple of million Chinese bad been more or less in arms and had been handling rifles. The present Commander-in-Chief, Chiang-kai-shek, had really great forces in arms at the outset of the war. The Young Marshal, the Manchu, had a considerable army with which he was engaged against the so called "" reds "". These forces, once opponents, are now combined against the Japanese, and, in addition, there were armed bandits in tbe northern provinces practised in guerilla tactics, who have all thrown in.their lot witb Chiang-kaishek. Without modem equipment,. China, by attacks upon communications, ancl by being able to stand up to the enemy, has achieved tbe miracle of stopping one of the greatest powers in the world, despite the fact that that power is armed with al l the latest equipment. As I see it , there is real danger to Australia ; I do not say to-morrow, but in the years close ahead. It is in the power of this Government, and the Parliament as a whole, actually to remove that danger, to save this country from aggression, aud to k«cp our young men out of war. I have no doubt at all that, as the debate proceeds, and as tbe Government gives more consideration to its present defence scheme, it will remove the one great weakness in it , which is that, for at least some time ahead, it provides no infantr y of immediate fighting account. Tlie honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) went to considerable pains to allay jiu-blic fears that the Government might impose conscription upon this country, A careful survey of the speeches delivered by honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side would at least provide matter for earnest thought, because it is evident that those honourable members would be prepared to impose upon the manhood of Australia a system of compulsory military service which would definitely require the bearing of arms, not only within the borders of this continent, but also overseas. The whole party history of honourable members opposite furnishes justification for my declaration. No matter how extensive may be the defence programme of the Government, apparently it will never satisfy the desires of those who are incapable of appreciating the limitations of the resources of this country. The honourable member also said that the present defence proposals of the Government neither went f a r enough, nor could be put member is in error. into operation rapidly enough, to suit him. actually engaged in the consideration of f u l l y read the report of his speech. He defence proposals following upon a declaration of hostilities. The panicstricken manner in which honourable members opposite have spoken on this subject makes it appear that they are incapable a sermon out of it ! of reviewing the situation in a calm way. Their the main either of strictures upon members on this side of ' t h e chamber or of observations such as might be expected in time of actual war, and have not been in any sense helpful to the country. Both the honourable member for Henty this afternoon, and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) last night rendered a grave disservice to Australia in seeking to show that there was substantial justification for the view held in certain other countries of the world that we were not developing this country, or populating it in a reasonable way. When our representatives subsequently attend international conferences of one kind aud another, they may be confronted with reports of these and similar speeches. The deduction that we are not entitled to retain possession of this country should not be made possible by the utterances of members of this Parliament. 1 therefore seriously deprecate tlie speeches of the honourable members to whom I have referred. If any people in the world can be said to be really developing the country in which they live, it is the Australian people. The last 150 years have conclusively shown the marvellous colonization characteristics of our people and have undoubtedly justified our possession of this country. We have, in fact, made remarkable progress. Tbe speech of the honourable member for Hunty was also contradictory in that, while he said with one breath that the defence programme of the Government was not sufficiently extensive and was not being implemented at a sufficiently fast rate, he said in the next breath that even with the elaborate expansion now proposed, the programme, in respect of ' it s naval and air force provisions, would be ineffective.

129,Mr Makin,"The honourable memberin my impression of the meaning of his utterance. He will, no doubt, recollect that he said that even with the increase of the Navy, foreshadowed hy the Government, it would still not be difficult to bottle up all our vessels in certain harbours of this country. He ""will also recollect saying that, even if we were to double the number of our aircraft, the force would still be incapable of undertaking the service which it was intended to perform. In spite of these remarks, however, the honourable gentleman enendorsed the programme of the Government, and even went so far as to offer his congratulations to .the Minister for Defence. If anything more inconsistent is desired than the remarkable speech of the honourable member I do not know where it could be obtained. I would say to honourable gentlemen opposite who make extravagant statements member for Henty leaving the chamber? Other honourable members interjecting, I must insist on honourable members refraining from interjections. though some honourable gentlemen opposite do not hesitate to lecture the members of the Opposition, they are unwilling to listen to criticism of their own observations. The retirement of the honourable member for Henty from tbe chamber is in itself eloquent testimony to his unwillingness to listen to the other side of the question. We have before us for consideration a loan defence equipment. I strongly protest against such a measure being introduced without a great deal more explanation of it than has been furnished to us by the Government. The purpose of this bill, we are told, is to provide, in part, for the thusiastic about this enlarged defence financing of a three-year defence programme involving an increased expenditure of £43,000,000. That being so, the Government should have given us much more information than it has seen fit to provide. If it had not been for the timely rebuke of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) we should not have had the meagre information that is now before us. Even as it is, I challenge the propriety of some of the items which appear in the schedule thathas been tabled. Before proceeding to a detailed consideration of this schedule, however, I protest strongly against the failure of the Prime Minister, or some other responsible Minister, to explain fully all that is involved in this proposed added expenditure of £43,000,000. The Government should undoubtedly have related the expenditure proposed in this bill to that contemplated in the remainder of the programme that is to be implemented next financial year, and in the following year. gave a very clear outline of tbe three year programme in the statement he made on Wednesday night. statement and I do not regard it as in any sense the comprehensive survey to which we are entitled. The proposal of the Government to finance its defence programme out of loan funds is definitely unsound and out of harmony with the wishes of the general community. The Leader of the OpposiI t is remarkable that tion yesterday pointed out clearly to the House that defence equipment is a wasting asset; it is subjected to deterioration and obsolescence to a degree more marked tbaii in any other public utility. That being so, surely it is our obligation, and not that of future generations, to provide for the expenditure upon this equipment. It should be provided for by either direct taxation or by utilizing those undoubted facilities that are possible to the bill which provides for a nation through the Commonwealth Bank. of £10,300,000 for certain I feel that it is reprehensible for the Commonwealth Government to try to place upon the shoulders of future generations the burdens that the present generation should rightly carry. Honourable gentlemen opposite would not be so enprogramme if fresh taxes upon their special friends were inescapable. The method that is being adopted, however, not only avoids fresh taxation of the wealthy interests of this country and -absentees, but also gives them a further opportunity to extract profit; because under this bill £300,000 is set aside to meet expense involved in the flotation of the loan, which is, of course, a "" rake-off"" for",37,Utjoii Which The Government Proposes To

134,Mr Makin,"I have considered thatthem. And, after having obtained that "" rake-off"", they will have the further opportunity to make profits in meeting the orders of the Government under the defence programme, as well as the constantly recurring interest bill which will ultimately aggregate this loan amount to double the figure set down. In a word, the Government is opening the way to exploitation of the people of this country by private banking interests and armament firms that have their affairs so -closely interlocked, and, accordingly, I oppose the proposal now made, first, because it lays down a principle in the financing of defence expenditure which is not only unsound, but also definitely wrong; secondly, because no ministerial statement has been made to justify this enormous expenditure to cope with what is claimed to be a state of emergency; and thirdly, because I am emphatically opposed to the private manufacture of armaments in which exorbitant profits are made at the expense of the nation and, in particular, its social welfare. What state of emergency exists to-day that was not apparent six months ago? When six months ago the Government increased the rate of expenditure on we thenprovided would meet all requirements. What has occurred 'since then to change the opinion of the Government? The Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) endeavoured to explain that world conditions had deteriorated, and that the interSydney. Now a further £1,000,000 of national situation gave cause for greater fear than was the case last year. But I do not think that any honourable member of this House, or members of the general public, will endorse his declaration. As a matter of fact, the position in Europe to-day, and in the world generally, shows 1 some appeasement compared with last year. It becomes all the more astounding that the Government should seek sanction for its programme provided for under this bill when one .considers the Government is prepared to advance to this House some further justification for the programme that it has submitted, we are not warranted in making available to it means which will enable it to create a war hysteria in this country and deprive the people of the social benefit due to them. I seize this opportunity to declare that the Government will never implement the social insurance proposals to which it has committed itself. The Government will find a convenient excuse to shelve the scheme, or abandon it altogether. Of course, it will not accept responsibility for its action; it will make some excuse such as that the States refuse to co-operate, and then it will use the money that should have been devoted to the inauguration of this important social service for the furtherance of its colossal 'defence schemes. ' ber ""may not discuss national insurance on this bill. bill that the sum of £1,000,000 is to be devoted to paying the final instalment on the cruiser Sydney. The first instalment was paid from revenue, and Parliament was given to understand that all subsequent instalments would also be paid from revenue. Last year, however, the Government departed from that principle, and an the defence of this country instalment was paid out of the loan of were told that the amount £2,500,000 which was raised overseas. At the time the Treasurer informed honourable members that this loan was to be used to meet non-recurring expenditure, and nothing was said at the time about part of it being used to pay' the second last instalment on the cruiser loan money is to be used to make the final payment on the cruiser. Thus the new loan of £10,000,000 is not even to be expended wholly on the Government's new defence programme; part of it is to be used to pay for the old programme. The Treasurer tried to make us believe that the new loan is to be raised entirely in Australia, but when we remember what happened in regard to the instalments on the cruiser Sydney, we are justified in believing that he will be world-situation.

164,Mr Lyons,"The answers to the honorhonorable member for Wentworth made certain inquiries pertaining to the charges for telephonic conversations between the Awaiea and (o) Australia and (b) New Zealand. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information:The charge for telephone calls between New Zealand and Australia, which was fixed by agreement between the two Administrations, is £2 5s. for three minutes' conversation and ISs. for each additional minute. It will be appreciated thai conversation from a mobile station Such as the Awaiea is practicable in both directions immediately the vessel leaves port, aud it is consequently anomalous to pormit conversation from the ship at an amount substantially lower 'than the through rate. It has to be remembered that tlie charge covers conversations to and from any point served by the telephone trunk network of Australia, and a tariff similar to that imposed by the New Zealand Administration would not only be inconsistent with the agreement for the through ""service, but would be totally unprofitable. The department has no knowledge of the reasons which induced the New Zealand Administration to introduce a charge so much below the rate which is applied by them, in common with Australia, for through traffic. The lionorable member might be interested to know that the tariffs for through traffic, and also for ship traffic, are at present under review, and it is hoped that means may be found to reduce the charges, although there is no likelihood of the fees between the Axoatea and Australia being reduced to the level of those which are now applied to traffic between the vessel and Now Zealand.",42,Industrialrequirements For Defence
