For Parliamentary Orable Member For Lang ( Sir Elliot Johnson) Asked A Question About The Granting Of Christmas Railway Passes For Civil Servants. I Wish To Ask, Mr Whole Question To The Tariff Board, The Speaker, Whether You Will Take Into Con","sideration the granting of railway passes to parliamentary officials who wish to spend Christmas with their families in Melbourne ? matter looked into and, later, will inform the honourable member as to the position. asked you, Mr (Speaker, if the table at which Queen Victoria signed her assent to the Commonwealth Constitution Act could not be moved into the King's Hall, where it could be seen by the public, and you were good enough to say that you would take steps to have that done. . I should like to know why the table has not yet been moved from the library ? move the table from the library, but it is not yet possible to do so, because the glass case in which it must be enclosed, has not been delivered. I am making inquiry as to the cause of the delay, and I shall take steps to expedite the removal of the table to the King's Hall. IRON AND STEEL DUTIES. for Trade and Customs circulate thc report and dissections of the departmental officials upon which he has based the duties on iron and steel set out in the tariff schedule, in the manner followed with Tariff Board reports, Avithout the divulgence of confidential information, so that honourable members may inform their minds as to the value of the departmental officials' dissections and report? honourable members that these dissections contain confidential information that cannot be disclosed. of the debate in committee I shall disclose all the details I have, excluding that confidential information. seem, the duties on iron and steel are the result of departmental dissections and report rather than of the Tariff Board's recommendations, will the Minister say whether, after receiving th* departmental report, he re-submitted the body appointed by this Parliament for the purpose of investigating and. reporting upon proposals for duties ? of the Tariff Board is to investigate and report to the Minister, and through him to the Government. The duty of the Government, before it places proposals before Parliament, is to analyse the recommendations of the Tariff Board and to view them from all angles, to come to a conclusion upon them, and to submit its policy to Parliament. That course has been pursued in the present instance and, as the Minister in charge, I am prepared to defend the policy of the Government when the items are being discussed. PORT AUGUSTA TO RED HIL L Herald of the 26th November last, appears the following statement:Not_ the least interesting possibility in a campaign on the part of the Government to cut expenses, may be the dropping of the Red Hill to Port Augusta Railway Bill, which is now at the second reading stage in the House of Representatives. It also saysThere is considered to be more than a remote possibility that the bill may vanish from the notice-paper as the session closes. I should like to know if that statement is correct and whether it is the intention of the Government to take-the Port Augusta to RedH ill Railway Bill off the notice paper, and not proceed with the construction of the line? proceed, before the House adjourns for Christmas, with the bill for the construction of a railway from Port Augusta",13,Setup

That is the of aboriginal and half-caste women when construction work is in progress. Thfi Minister is well aware of the danger to aboriginal women who come in contact with these camps, and 1 should like .to know what instructions he has issued to put into effect the provisions, of the ordinance? Home and Territories, the Government Resident of Central Australia, and the Works and Railways Department have been collaborating with reference to this important subject so that half-castes may be safeguarded not only against contact with railway construction camps, As without the cobut also in other ways. If the Queensland Government .will lend the services of a senior officer, we hope that we can get him to begin his work in the Alice Springs district, so that the whole position may be investigated at the earliest possible moment.

42,Mr Pbatten (Martin,"Minister for of galzanized iron into the Commonimportance to the Australian iron industry, which provides the steel bars that are used. I should explain that . when straight out tariff protection is given, the manufacturer is at liberty to use either imported or local materials, whichever he finds are the more profitable; hut in the manufacture of galvanized iron sheets under the bounty he must use Australian steel. I have already stated that the capacity of the local works is from 2S,000 to 30,000 tons per annum, and that about 450 hands are employed. I wish to say also that a large amount of caj)ital is invested in this industry, but that since its inception only a small return has been received""from it. I should like to say now a word or two respecting the amendment that relates to tractors. amendment apply to Australian zinc as well as to Australian steel? honourable member with all the particulars when the bill is being considered in committee. Prom memory, I should say that Australian zinc is used Tho schedule to the principal act makes provision for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of tractors, varying from £40 to £90 according to the horse-power. This bill does not propose to alter the rates. Generally speaking, the basic principle of bounty acts is that a bounty shall be paid only in respect of articles that are produced wholly from Australian material. The Iron and Steel Bounty Act certainly provides that a manufacturer may be permitted tp use imported materials; but it is intended that those shall be used only in an emergency, wben for some unforeseen reason Australian materials are either not obtainable at all, or cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities. tractors have experienced a difficulty in obtaining a suitable internal combustion engine of Australian manufacture. Since the bounty has been in operation a further difficulty has arisen as a result of the Crown Law authorities having expressed the opinion that the term "" materials "" in the section which authorizes the Minister to permit the use of imported materials in exceptional cases cannot be interpreted to include finished parts such as an internal combustion engine or a magneto. Thus any manufacturer who finds himself in tlie position I have described is prevented from claiming any bounty, and consequently is obliged to manufacture tractors under conditions that I do not think Parliament intended should operate. The object of the bill is to afford relief in that direction. Under it the full amount of bounty will be payable on the manufacture of tractors that are wholly Australian; ' but it will be reduced in proportion to the quantity of imported material used. Thus, if a tractor is 100 per cent. Australian, the full amount will be payable.

It will certainly define in a legal way the position that Parliament intended to create. adjourned. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . Debate resumed from 4th November PAGEThat the bill be now read a second time. bill proposes to amend the Land Tax Assessment Act. I draw attention to the fact that the Government has abandoned the position which it took up when it forced through Parliament a bill to withdraw the per capita payments from the States, because it then proposed to repeal the land tax and to remit other forms of direct taxation. The identical payments that it formerly made to the States jnder the per capita arrangement it now proposes to make in a different form. If anything proves the value of criticism in Parliament, this does; because there is » no doubt that on the occasion to which I have referred the Treasurer was determined to withdraw the per capita payments, repeal the land tax, and reduce other forms of direct taxation. Now it is intended that the land tax shall be continued, though at a reduced rate. The bill is one mainly of concessions. addition to the 10 per cent, cut in the rates which will be made under the provisions of another measure, very considerable reductions are proposed under certain clauses of this bill. One concession proposed is triennial valuation of land, and another the abolition of retrospective assessments. The. loss in revenue that will be occasioned by tbese amendments, in conjunction with the 10 per cent, reduction in the rates, is estimated to amount in the ensuing year to £445,900. That loss will increase as the years go by. These are very generous concessions to. the large landholders of Australia. No owner, the unimproved value of whose land is below £5,000, pays land tax; therefore, a struggling farmer or a small landowner is not affected,, The Government has no warrant for making such a generous gift to these people. It talks at random about the mandate it received at the. last election; but I challenge i i to show any mandate to proceed with this proposal. It carefully refrained from making any mention of it when ir appealed for the suffrages of the people. A Labour Government in 1910 passed the Land Tax Act with a two-fold object: to secure to the people a portion of the unearned increment that accrues to land, and to burst up large estates so as to facilitate closer settlement, and enable those who are born on the land to obtain for themselves blocks from which they may produce wealth and earn a livelihood. ""We have reached the stage at which there is no longer any need to argue that the, aggregation of large estates is inimical to the interests of this country. There was a time 'When that was necessary. In the. early days it frequently happened that, meetings of pastoralists passed resolutions and conservative newspapers published articles in support of the argument that large estates should not be broken up, but should be retained for the purpose of running sheep and supplying the markets of the world with wool. But that day has gone by. ""With few exceptions people believe to-day that closer settlement leads to increased pro--duction from the land, and that the bursting up of large estates is desirable in the national welfare. It is strange In that one of the exceptions to the rule ia the Prime Minister. At any rate he does not subscribe wholeheartedly to this policy as I shall show later. Speaking in general terms, it is realized that the aggregation of large estates is an obstacle to development and progress. Our first Land Tax Assessment Act was passed in 1910. In 1914 provision was made for the taxation of Crown leaseholds and the rate of taxation was increased. A further increase of 20 per cent, was made in 1918 but it was removed in 1922 under the provisions of a bill introduced by the present Prime Minister.",19,Second Reading

51,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [11.40],"Thisposed as a super tax for war purposes. still rest upon us and the increase should still remain. The present Treasurer has also been responsible for decreasing our land taxation. He introduced a bill which had the effect of entirely abolishing the taxation of Grown leaseholds and so exempting 968,000,000 acres, or almost half the area of the continent, from taxation. It is now proposed that a further reduction of 10 per cent, shall be made and that concessions shall be granted which will be in effect another 10 per cent, reduction. So that our land taxation, if this measure is agreed to, will be were heard; at Farkes, in September, 20 per cent, below what it was in 1914. It is estimated that in 1927-28 our war aud defence expenditure will amount to £34,000,000, yet we are told in justification of reduction of land taxation, that the war is over. The fact of the matter is that our war obligations are still increasing. tender-hearted towards large land-owners that it proposes to relieve them ""of this obligation. It is recognized generally that our financial position is serious and that our loan expenditure is increasing. There is a strong demand for land throughout Australia, and one of the objects of this taxation is to discourage the aggregation of land in large estates and to encourage its subdivision into areas which would permit of it being put to better use. Since this taxation was first imposed in 1910 many large estates have been subdivided. In the first three years of the operation of the measure £30,000,000 worth of land was subdivided. According to the 10th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, since the inception of £100,000,000 worth of land has passed from taxpayers to non-taxpayers. In other words estates of a value of more than £5,000 have been subdivided into estates of a less value than that. I am aware that some of the subdivisions may not have been genuine; but it cannot be denied that this legislation has had the effect of accelerating closer settlement and of encouraging men of limited means to take up reasonably small areas of land for agricultural and pastoral pursuits. There are still many people in the community who would be glad to secure land under reasonable conditions. Whenever either leasehold or freehold land is made available to the people by the various State governments, the number of applications is at least ten times as great as the number of blocks available. The following figures in respect of New South Wales are enlightening: At Albury, in March, 1925, there were 1,900 applicants for 98 blocks; at Lake Cowal, 413 persons applied for a single block; at Grafton, in August, 1925, 2,200 land seekers applied for three blocks; at Moree, in September, 1925, there were 1,205 applicants for one blockI was in the town at the time that the applications 1927, 1,072 persons applied for five homestead farms, and 29 for one Crown lease; and at Wilga Downs, in November last, the Nyngan Land Board had 1,380 applications for seven Crown leases on the Wilga Downs. in Tattersall's sweep. have my speech punctuated by interjections, but I shall reply to the honourable member for Wannon. The monopolizing of our land by a comparatively few people who own large estates has had the effect of inflating values to such a degree that when the Crown is able to make a few blocks available they are sought after with all the eagerness that the people display to win a prize in Tattersall's. In Victoria, during the last three years, 2,057 applications have been received for the 444 blocks that have been made available in the Mallee; and for the nine blocks now available at Lake Tyrell there are 167 applicants. Most people this legislation approximately agree that the aggregation of land in large estates is detrimental to Australia and hinders our prosperity. Only those who wish to see a few people enjoying the heritage of the nation would argue that it is desirable to allow large estates to be held by the few to the detriment of the many. Land that is suitable for subdivision should be subdivided.

55,Mr Sctjllin,"I do not desire topurposes which were not being put to their best use. I was shown a property of 4,000 acres which was managed by four brothers. I do not desire to mention their name, but it is well known to the honourable member for Wannon. The adjoining estate consisted of 30,000 acres and was held by a big squatter. The four brothers were able to run nearly a sheep to the acre of their 4,000 acres, but the big squatter had only about one sheep to four acres on his estate. The explanation was that the brothers worked their land thoroughly. stroyed the dead wood, rubbish and vermin upon it and generally looked after it ; but the squatter made no particular effort to increase the production of his estate. At one time, as is well known, the whole of the Wimmera was given over to grazing; but to-day, in consequence of its closer settlement, it is carrying many more sheep than it did when it was a purely grazing proposition, and in addition, it is producing a large quantity of the best wheat grown in the world. Cultivation does not mean that the sheep pass out, but that the land-owners use the land as it should be used. The Prime Minister is not favorable to the breaking up of large estates. When he was in Queensland last August he delivered a speech which is reported in the Brisbane Courier of the 2nd of August, from which I take the following paragraph:We aretoo apt to yield to the cry that this continent must be cut up into small areas to give settlers with small capital a chance. The development of sheep country can only be successfully carried out by a person Now we know how the members, of the or a eompany with sufficient capital to withstand a periodical drought. That argument has been discredited by experience. Queensland. out Australia has discredited it. Wherever large estates have been subdivided and improved, the country has been able to carry more stock and to resist drought conditions more effectively. I do not say that the comparatively poor country in Western Queensland should be subdivided into small farms. No man with a practical knowledge of this subject would argue in that way; but I do say that even that country could, with advantage, be divided into smaller estates than at present. In consequence of the withholding from cultivation of good country in recognized rainfall areas and adjacent to railways and markets, many of our people have been driven right out into the bush to get land. In the speech of the Prime Minister from which I have already quoted, there appears a statement relating to one of the most interesting pieces of legislation which this Parliament has passed in recent years. The disclosure which the right They systematically dehonorable gentleman made is significant and amazing. He indicated that on one memorable occasion, during the debate on the bill to abolish the taxation of crown leaseholds and remit all arrears in such taxation for the preceding seven years, he disciplined his party and brought it to heel. He statedI f it were in his power, he would wipe out all those arrears. He had threatened to resign and it was only then that Parliament agreed to abolish the tax, but compelled him to collect arrears. Honourable members who were in this Parliament in 1923, will recollect that the Labour party fought that measure tooth and nail and were able to obtain sufficient support from honourable members opposite to oblige the Government to abandon its proposal insofar as it related to the remission of arrears of taxation. There was a race between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, which the former won, to catch the Chairman's ' eye in order to move for the deletion of that clause. party behind him were whipped into line. We thought then that they had acted of their own volition, but now we know the truth. The Prime Minister whipped them into line so far as the abolition of the tax on Crown leaseholds was concerned, but he was unable to get them to agree to the remission of arrears of land tax being retrospective for seven years. He got them to agree to wipe out this tax on half litis continent only by threatening to resign as head of the Government. I have quoted from the Brisbane Courier. If the statements are not correct, I ask the right honourable gentleman to contradict them. We have here a striking piece of inside information. When honourable",21,Second Reading

57,Mr Scullin,"Experienc e throughmembers on this side said that by a threat to resign the Prime Minister forced his followers to submit, honourable members behind the Government resented the statement, but here are the Prime Minister's own words to justify it. I recall these two statements of the Prime Minister in order to show that the Government is not sound upon the question of land taxation, and that it is more interested in the welfare of large squatters than in enabling smaller farmers to acquire farms on which to make a living for themselves and their families. Land monopoly and the curse of landlordism have been the struggle of the ages. In some of the older countries of the world they have forced men and women to emigrate to freer lands. The Labour party set its face against land monopoly in 1910. The Labour Government then in office brought in a system of land taxation. Since the present Government has been in office the provisions of that legislation have been whittled away. If the process is continued much longer the land tax will be worthless as an effective check against the aggregation of large estates. I shall say no more at this stage regarding the general principles of this question, but shall refer in general terms to some of the clauses of the bill before us. I propose to deal with them in greater detail in committee. One clause provides for the creation of a valuation board. Notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that far too many boards and commissions have been appoiuted by this Government, I think that the appointment of a valuation board, composed of experts with a knowledge of land values, would be justified if it were the final court of appeal against the valuation of the Commissioner of Taxes and his officers. If one thing more thananother has been demonstrated by our experience, it is the great need for some authority to give consistent interpretations of the law and to determine finally the value of land. Every honourable member knows the disputes that have arisen in connection with land valuation. Should such a dispute arise, the case is eventually brought before the court and decided by a judge. I have the highest respect for our judiciary. I believe that its members are impartial and, in the main, able; but however learned in the law or impartial they may be, I submit with all due respect that judges are not the proper authorities to decide questions of land valuation. In the tenth report of the Commissioner of Taxation honourable members will find some very interesting reading. From it I propose to quote the following extracts:The judgment of the court in the appeal of Jowett v. the Commissioner of Taxation, could not lie treated as being applicable to the facts of any other case The court did not lay down any rules oi valuation which the department could usefully follow The department was surprised at the decision. The decision of the judge in that case was not accepted by the department as a guide. Further cases have to be heard on appeals which will probably come before the same judge. I want to ensure that the Valuation Board, which I assume will be an impartial tribunal, representing various interests, will have the last say as to the valuation of land for taxation purposes. The appeal from the commissioner's valuation to the board should be the final appeal. I shall give my reasons for this view. The case of Jowett v. the Commissioner of Taxation furnishes a striking illustration of my contention that judges are not the proper authorities to deal with land valuation matters. The decision of the judge in that case not only was a different interpretation of the law from that of the Full High Court of Australia, but it also produced a mathematical jumble which, -to say the least and to use the mildest term, was weird. I shall not worry honourable members with the details of that judgment-the y can read it for themselvesbut I propose to take one illustration from it. For the leasehold of the Quambatook estate in Queensland, comprising 107,000 acres, Mr Jowett paid a rental of £544 per annum. Notwithstanding that Mr Jowctt's witnesses agreed that that rental was reasonable the judge valued the fee simple of that property at £376. on the unimproved value of the property ? per aunum was on the unimproved value",22,Second Reading

I believe that the annual rental for the .estate referred to was low; even the lessee admitted that it was reasonable. In the circumstances, the capital value of that property, as determined by the judge, was ridiculously lo w. Let us .examine the method adopted by the judge in arriving at his valuation. In doing so we should remember .th-.uthe Quambatook estate had been purchased, so that His Honor had before him the purchase price. £13,604 was paid. Included in that amount was a sum of £10,696 for improvements, leaving £2,908 as the value of the lease which had 25 years to run. That is a plain admission by the o-.wiers that they regarded the rent as low; otherwise they would not have paid anything for the balance of the lease. The sale was on a walk-in walk-out basis, the total purchase price for land and improvements and figures I have, given are exclusive of stock; the amount was agreed to by both the buyer and the seller. The judge took the price paid for the unexpired term of the lease, namely, £2908. By some process of valuation, he assessed the annual value of the lease at £249. He then added the annual rental of £544, and arrived at a total annual value of £793. That amount he capitalized at 10 per cent, and obtained a capitalized value of £7930. Yet, he said that the fee simple of the property was worth only £376. is wrong in saying that the rental leaves for political purposes. the improvements out of account. were kept entirely separate. them is the annual value. was, the leaseholder would not have paid £544 as annual rent and £2908 for the unexpired portion of the lease. I have tal value of £7930. To that amount he added improvements valued at £10,696, making the total capital value of the land and improvements £18,626. But the next move of the judge was the most extraordinary of all. Although he inI n dealing with this cluded the value of the improvements at. £10,696 to procure a total capital value of £18,626, in .arriving at the result of £376 as the capital value of the property, he deducted £18,250 as the value of those improvements. ments valued at different times? £18,626 would be the value of the improvements in fee simple, whereas £10,696 was their value with a 25-years lease. His Honor, in endeavouring to Por the leasehold, ascertain the fee simple value of the whole property, should have taken into account the fee simple value of the improvements. If he had done that his decision would not have been the inaccurate mathematical jumble that it is. Honourable members need not concern themselves about that jumble. All that they need to know is that the judge capitalized the rental of £544 per annum at 10 per cent, and arrived at a value of £5440. stock being £35,000. The Eveni f the rent was a fair one-and I contend that it was low-the property was worth at least £5440. Yet the judge valued it at only £376.

LastJowett case in an endeavour to confound me in the stand I had taken in connection with arrears of land tax on Crown leaseholds. made it appear that the victory of Mr Jowett was over me and honourable members on this side of the chamber, whereas it was a victory over the Commissioner of Taxation. A victory, and on such a decision as I have mentioned! I raise this matter now, because I want to ensure that the proposed Valuation Board, if appointed will have the last word in the valuation of land and not leave the question of valuation to the judges. Questions of law, of course, and of law only, must go to the judges when there is an appeal. If that is not made definite and clear in the bill, I shall them for holding big areas-the applicanot support the appointment of a valuation board. sound. able member. I should like to refer to another aspect of this question, and this our income tax or to any tax that is is a matter of equity. The proposal is to . allow an appeal by the taxpayer from the department to the board on valuations only. other appeals that can go to the court; but from a number of arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner' there is no appeal, either to the board or the court. With due respect to the Commissioner, who, I believe, is conscientious and earnest, I think that he, like every other man, is capable of making mistakes. ' It is a basic principle of law that when a man has arbitrary power to give certain rulings, there shall be some tribunal to whom appeals against his decisions can be made. I am strengthened in that statement by the fact that right through the Income Tax Act such a right of appeal is recognized, because an appeal board is provided. It is true that in respect of this tax there will be appeals to the court in some cases; but in other cases no appeal is allowed. For instance, ""section 42A was purposely designed to protect the revenue from fraud, and I agree with the provision; but when the Commissioner gives his decision under section 42A, or section 37, or section 76, the taxpayer has no right of appeal against it. I suggest in the present case that, if he cannot appeal to the Valuation Board-and there may be an argument against that-h e should have the right of He appeal either to the court or the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Act. That is provided for in a minor degree under the present bill, where certain action can be taken by members of the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under that act the board can hear appeals against arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner. That is only reasonable and fair. WhilstI am strongly in favour of land taxation, and believe that the large land-owners both in town and country should contribute substantially to the revenue-the tax on big estates should be sufficiently high to penalize tion of such a law as this should be just. out of date a quarter of a century ago. It might appropriately be applied to based on the principle that the burden shall be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Every tax imposed Of course, there are some in that way can be called a class tax; but the class that objects to pay it always has the remedy in its own hands-it can break up the large estates, and make them available to the small holders who are land hungry. When the bill reaches the committee stage, I shall discuss this matter further. For the present I hope that the Treasurer will make a note of my remarks. There should be a right of appeal to a board or to the court against any decision, especially when it is far-reaching and involves considerable sums of money; but the right to appeal against valuations should be limited to appeals to the valuation board. If we grant the right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, it will bring the bill into line with the Income Tax Assessment Act. I draw attention to the clause proposing the abolition of retrospective assessment. These re-assessments are provided for under both the Land Tax Act and the Income Tax Act. The Commissioner can go back three years under the Income Tax Act and re-assess the value. Under the Land Tax Act, as it",24,Second Reading

76,Mr Scullin,"That argument wasstands at the present time, he can go back two years. The reason for that is obvious. It is not always possible to obtain a correct re-assessment. Mistakes can be made both by the taxpayer and the department, and a reasonable time must be allowed for the correction of valuations. The Treasurer said that, although that was necessary while the Land Tax Act was a new measure, it was not so necessary now. Would not that argument apply equally to the Income Tax Act? There is not the slightest doubt that we shall lose considerable revenue under the bill, and certain persons will evade taxation. Under this measure there can be re-assessments that reduce the tax, but not re-assessments that increase it if it is too low. harshly where land has been sold, and the interest in it has passed on to others. applies in respect of income tax, when a man spends his income. lity that always remains with him as an income tax payer. years. If he spends bis income for a given year he can still be re-assessed for that at a higher rate three years afterwards. If a man sells his land and spends the proceeds, he is in no worse position than is the income tax payer who has spent his money and is subsequently reassessed. the tax follows the land, and the previous owner may not be available for taxation. bility of the purchaser. It is for him to see that there are no rates or taxes due or any encumbrance on the land when ho buys it. When the department was first established, there was good reason for this provision, because it was impossible to make valuations of all taxable lands so as to include them in the original assessments. But every year lands are becoming taxable that were not previously assessed. When they are discovered, it will be impossible under ibis bill to go back even for the two years provided under the existing act. the 10 per cent, reduction under the Rates Therefore, I shall oppose the clause that Bill, will be £-145,000 in.round figures, provides for the abolition of retrospecequal to approximately 20 per cent, off tive re-assessments.

This system has operated for seventeen years. account one pays it, and that is the end of the matter. member rendered an account, and found out that after it had been paid an amount had been omitted, he would include that amount in the next account and expect payment. The department has a similar right. The Statute of Limitations allows six years; but in the act it is asked that the time limit as it stands, of two years, be abolished. There is a further and worse blemish upon this bill. It removes the power from the Commissioner to -make annual valuations, and it limits the department to triennial valuations. It is true that, in practice, valuations may not be made frequently. Years may elapse before certain areas are re-valued; but the department watches land movements and notices whether the prices move upwards or downwards. It makes its valuations when the changes take place. In certain localities values alter rapidly, and sales disclose that the department has not always discovered the change in values. It should retain the right that it has under the act to-day to make a new valuation. This will be denied to it under the amendment, and for three years a valuation will stand before it can be altered. Reductions could be made; but the valuations could not be increased. Surely that is not fair. The Treasurer, when questioned as to what he estimated the loss would be, put it down at £80,000 a year. This loss, through not assessing lands at their true values as they move upwards, will be all in the interests of the men whose land is increasing in value. It will be of no benefit to those whose lands are depreciating in value; the latter will have the same rights as before.. That is an anomaly that should be removed.

I ask the Treasurer, to see that in future the reports of this department provide honourable members with the complete information formerly supplied. I am making an estimate which I think is nearly accurate, on the basis of the latest available figures, and, in my opinion, £400,000 of the total reduction of £445.000 will go into the pockets of the owners of estates worth not less than £25,000 each. viduals and others companies. The 10 per cent, reduction alone will mean that, to 75 taxpayers with estates of over £100,000 in value there will be reductions of approximately £1,000 each, 25 taxpayers with estates of over £200,000 value will get reductions of approximately £1,900 each, and five taxpayers with estates valued at over £500,000 will each receive reductions amounting to about £3,500. That cannot be justified. Many of. these landowners are sitting down on large areas of land that could well be cut up, and some of it is suitable for intense cultivation. By not utilizing their lands to the full they are driving the sturdy sons of farmers far back into the bush. I could take honourable members to portions of the State of Victoria with which I am familar, and 1 could show them the broad acres of the Western plains on which sheep are running, although the land could be well used for agriculture. Men born on the land, and anxious to establish homes there, have been forced to take up selections down at Otway and Beech forest. After 20 years or more of heart-breaking toil, most of them have had to abandon that country, with their hearts broken and their little bit of capital gone. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of land alongside railways, where there is a good rainfall-lan d in every available because of the ring fence of the squatter. That is one reason why I feel so strongly upon this question. I want to see increased production, and I am anxious to see the sons of farmers and future arrivals in this country comfortably settled on the land. I want to see more provided for them. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) advocated certain reforms and pointed out, as have other honourable members, that there are producers working long hours in the back blocks who are receiving less than the basic wage. I know many of them. that, particularly in the dairying industry. monwealth Government came to their aid with bounties and assistance in other directions, they would still be deprived of the full benefit to which they are entitled. I would go to the full limit to assist these people to get the full reward for their labour and a return commensurate with that paid to others. But what would be the result? Land values would increase and the land monopolists who hold large areas would demand higher rents, or sell their land for sub-divisional purposes at greatly enhanced prices. Years ago beautiful rich land iD the Western District of Victoria ar,d other rich districts was leased at small rentals, and was carrying perhaps one sheep to the acre and sometimes less. Later improvements came along. Butter factories and creameries were established in suitable places, refrigerator space was provided on overseas ships to carry their produce across the seas to the markets of the world, and instead of having gluts during good seasons with butter being sold here at 3d. to 6d. a lb., we had a steady market all the year round, and the butter industry was successfully established.

91,Mr Scullin,"The major portionI could mention the names of numerous squatters who have made fortunes, not because of their own efforts but owing to community effort. Their land values have been increased owing to the improvements produced by the brains of scientific men, and because of the hard toil of the men and women and even children, who have made slaves of themselves on dairy farms. These things have to be stopped, and before bounties are paid on butter and other products, an effort should be made to stabilize land values. I do not wish to support legislation which would assist in ruining anyone, or to drag down land values. But I would prevent landowners reaping the benefit of subsidies, or of other people's I welcome the bill in so far as it affords toil. tion. of every industry we were out to assist, we should be well justified in saying that the value of the land should be pinned where it is was at the time that assistance was proposed. member apply the same principle to secondary industries ? wherever advantage was being taken of the assistance given. I would say flb the lett) that if the party to which I belong were in power and we had the constitutional authority, there would not be' a duty given to a secondary industry without the right to check their profits and see that they did not take fair toll of it. I would not make any distinction between primary and secondary industries. I would not show enmity or favouritism towards either. I wish to see our mauufacturing, agricultural, and pastoral industries marching successfully along side by side, and their prosperity being shared by those engaged in such industries. They should receive full reward for their labour, whatever they may be, and not be allowed to take advantage of the beneficience of the Government or of the activities of tbe people. That is why I am advocating the retention of the land tax. Apart from the fact that the tax gives to the community a portion of the value that the community has given to the land, it has also an economic value. It will assist to burst up large estates and give an opportunity to the men of this country to produce wealth from the land on which they were born instead of being driven to the cities to eke out an existence. It is because of those reasons that I move That all the words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" in view of the grave and expanding obligations of the Commonwealth manifested by an adverse trade balance and increasing loan expenditure, and of the urgent need for the subdivision of large estates to increase production, and to meet the keen demand for land, reduction of land taxation is not justifiable."" some relief to land taxpayers; but there are many directions in which I hope it will be improved when the committee, stage is reached. With that reservation I welcome it as an instalment of. longdeferred justice to an important section of the Australian people. Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) is, to use a colloquialism, ut his top on the question of land taxation, and honourable it was the memory of some of his, may I say, flamboyant speeches made in this House and in the country that impelled me to direct a few remaiks to him during the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill, particularly in regard to the incidence of income and land taxation upon the land-holder. Prior to the last election the honourable member marched up and down the country telling the people of the wrongdoings of the land-holders and particularly of Mr Edmund. Jowett. Their actions, which he regarded with suspicion, became a political weapon in the hands of the honourable member, and he must have been somewhat dumbfounded when the court declared that Mr Edmund Jowett was right and the honourable member was wrong. The subject had, however, served his political purpose. In regard to the principle of land settlement and land holding, strange as it may seem, I agree with the Leader of the Oppositionalthough we arrive at the same conclusion from different angles-whe n he says that if we are to have progressive development it is a sound principle that as our populaiton increases the needs of rural Australia in the matter of land",27,Second Reading

I have always said that we should be determined to make rural occupation-lan d settlement-the blue riband life of the nation. It is gradually becoming subordinated to the extreme and excessive demands of city dwellers of Australia, and our potential wealth and secondary industries upon the landholding is daily becoming more precarious and less remunerative. I agree with the honourable member when he says that the making available of la'nd suitable for intensive production and agriculture, and even for closer pastoral settlement by the application of scientific methods such as top dressing for pasture and other improvements, will be the means of settling a larger rural population than we have to-day. Therefore, I am not championing the cause of those who desire to hold exclusively large areas suitable for subdivision, whether for agricultural or other purposes. But there are other considerations which must not be overlooked. There are, however, vast areas of land, mostly in the back country, which, owing to climatic conditions and precarious seasonal vicissitudes, are quite unsuitable for subdivision, and which can be held profitably only in large areas by those who have sufficient resources at their command to withstand the dire happenings of a succession of bad seasons. It is impossible for a person with limited capital to take up large areas of unsuitable land and brave the known conditions which prevail in those areas. I do not share the views of the honourable member on that point. It is an easy matter to tax a man off the land, but it is not easy to put him on. From the time when the principal act was first introduced I have always felt that it was not born in an atmosphere of justice. As the Commonwealth Parliament had not the power to deal with land and land settlement, it was intended from the outset to be a penal tax. At the inception of federation the control of land and land settlement, as well as all activities associated with the land, was deliberately left to the State Parliaments. The Commonwealth had no power to determine land settlement policies or the conditions [102] governing the holding of land. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has apparently never thought of an alternative to penal taxation for forcing land settlement. When thc need arises, there is an alternative which rests with the States in the form of legislation providing for compulsory acquisition, which is at present in operation in some of the States. Reference has been made by -the honourable member to a nation hungry for land, and to only one in every 1,000 applicants for certain blocks of Crown land offered by ballot or Land Board, being successful. If the honourable member will refer to pastoralists' associations and land agents in all the States, he will be informed that he can obtain as much alienated good land as he wants at reasonable rates. At present, land Can be obtained at reasonable rates because many land-holders who have ""given their labour and that of their families have not received a return comparable with that received by those engaged in secondary industries. This is not a. land-locked country. There may be certain districts in which large areas are held by wealthy land-holders. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. gentleman stated that Australia was a country in which people were unable to obtain access to the land for settlement, and that there was, in consequence, retardation of national progress, production and development. There is, however, in every State an abundance of land available for purchase, and most of it may be had on easy terms. These holdings consist, for the most part, of-improved lands and ready-made farms, of which young men may take possession without a great expenditure of time or money upon development, and begin straight away to carry on the chosen occupation. Confirmation of this may be obtained by any one who cares to .make investigation in any township or centre in any State in the Commonwealth. Land values have received a check, and land is available at reasonable prices on reasonable terms. I repeat, however, that if the nation is to progress and population increase, land must be made available as required to meet t'ne",28,Second Reading
98,Mr Rodgers,"The honorablegrowing needs of this country. It is, after all, to the great lauded interests to which we have to look for the funds with which to develop the secondary industries of our country. I am one who endeavours to put first things first, and I place it as an unassailable truth that the success of Australian economic life to-day depends primarily on the success of the rural 'industries. in Australia countries which have become the world's workshops and have a great distributing trade in which industrialism plays a large part in providing the world's commodities. But Australia, for generations to come, must depend for its development on primary industries. Anything which tends to weaken the primary industries is reflected very 4 quickly in our secondary industries, as we find in this year of short production, when already unemployment is increasing in all the States, and a condition of financial disorder has been brought about. One would assume from the remarks of the honourable gentleman that Australia had not faced this great question of land settlement in a bold and comprehensive manner, but actually the reverse is the position. If one takes the trouble to go into the historical records of Australia one will see that there were various phases of laud settlement, starting in the old days of what might be called ""squattages,"" which represent a rather romantic, though passing, phase in the rural life of Australia. They represented, for the most part, the handling by adventurous and daring men of small flocks of imported stock, for which, at the time, no preparation had been made, no large estates built iip, and no water or pastures provided. There was practically no'market for any of the products other than wool, and the price for that was very low. The practice was to boil down the carcasses for the bit of tallow which might be obtained. But we march on from those days of squattages when the foundations of the States were laid. ' There was a feeling on the part of. our increasing population that they were not able to get sufficient land for homes, and a great forward movement was taken by the statesmen of the day. They gave to the then rising generation the power to go out and select from the squattages which then were the Crown lands of if r . Rodgers. the country their holdings in their own chosen localities, there to put. in their pegs, and found their future homes. They gave the most liberal terms, requiring no deposits in many cases, or, at any rate, not'more than the payment of the survey fees. Those were difficult times; many of the selectors, after leaving the mark of their labour on their This is much more sa holdings, were' finally forced to thau ... in the . older abandon them. Those were hard times. Some, however, struggled through by means of the unpaid toil of their families, and their capacity to work and wait, until finally they became the foundation of Australia's yeomanry of to-day. Now we have reached a further stage, and scattered throughout every State there is a magnificent array of rural homes owned by those who have fought adversity, who have won out, and established the primary industries of the Commonwealth. They have sought out the lands most suitable for their purposes, and it has taken no act of Parliament, no act of compulsory acquisition, to secure the settlement of these areas. The judgment of the men themselves, and the pressure of economic conditions,forced the settlement. The honourable gentleman will know that, in the districts with which he is most familiar, the TowerH ill district of Victoria, no act of Parliament was necessary to procure settlement. That land is now worth over £100 an acre, but the force of economic circumstances was suflicient to clear it of forest, and to make it rich and fruitful. In no age can there be a perfect system. Australia is not the home of landlordism; it is the home of people who came mostly from other countries to avoid the curse of landlordism. In the main, we are a great body of freeholders who believe in the right of a man to have some spot on earth that is his very own; a spot upon which he may set up his citadel, and upon which no one can set foot to desecrate his home. That is the fundamental belief of our people. NowI come to the question that perplexes the honourable gentleman, the question of land values. He says that he would mark as with a javelin the ruling prices of land to-day, and would not allow them to advance beyond their present point. position? I said that if we are to subsidize any industry, we ought first to stabilize the price of land in that industry. beyond which it would not be allowed to go. The ideal valuer has not yet arrived upon earth. The man wbo thinks he can fix a stable price for land is a dreamer of dreams. Take this very act which seeks to tax the unimproved value of land, and contrast it with similar acts in the States. In Victoria, for example, the Parliament did not agree on the same formula as our federal act for tbe taxation of unimproved land values. If there is such a thing as a definite basis for determining the unimproved value of land, we ought to be able to fix upon a formula defining it. act/ differently in Victoria. cannot lay down a formula which will be the same in any two States or the Commonwealth Land Tax Act that is only an additional proof of what I have stated: that it is impossible to fix definitely the value of land. one of these systems is obsolete. deal of experience of land selling and land financing, and I know that it is the most difficult thing in the world to fix the value of land. Some say let us fix upon its productive value, but what is the productive value of land? One man will grow wool, and another will grow corn Therefore, there is no such thing as fixing a value that is not subject to change. may have a serious depression in the value of products. Probably never before in Australia were there such wonderful seasons and high prices for primary, products as during the period of the war and immediately following. beginning of the war there was a drought, but for ten or twelve years after that there was a period of unprecedented rural prosperity, with prices for rural products at a level never previously dreamt of. That is a human impossibility. The effect of this was that there was a re-state my wave of prosperity throughout Australia. Values of land rose in sympathy with that wonderful fund created by the prosperous conditions prevailing. Many people bought land, sold it again, and bought more, and, in many cases, the price they paid was not the true value of the land, but the mark of their capacity to purchase. Their capacity to purchase often dominated them when they desired to acquire land on which to settle their families. In considering the value of land, we must remember that there is something in human nature which makes men dearly love to build some reserve, and there is ho class of investment so favoured for this purpose as investment in 'land. The only form of investment which approaches it for popularity in this connection is investment in the country's consols. We cannot, therefore, lay down any hard and fast rule that will determine values, because they fluctuate; according to the season, the output, prices of produce, and If the Crown the demand for land. I have never been attracted by the federal land tax. Judging it by any test that may be applied to it, it, it cannot be regarded as just taxation. It is not based on any spirit of fairness. First of all, it is the only form in which wealth is taxed in Australia, and even the Labour party has abandoned all its ideas of imposing a wealth tax. Then, why should a portion of the land of Australia be subjected to land taxation and not the rest of it? If it be an equitable system of raising revenue to impose a land tax, it should be levied without exemption, but when the Comor some other commodity. monwealth Labour party introduced its land tax it, so to speak, gilded the pill by exempting from the payment of the tax Then, again, we any person owning land whose unimproved value was less than £5,000. By that exemption owners of suburban cottages and all small land-holders, in the aggregate representing a great voting and political fighting power, were exAt. the empted, leaving the rest of the landholders of Australia, numbering fewer than 20,000 persons, to provide the whole of the revenue which the Commonwealth was to derive from its land tax.",29,Second Reading

Hunmoney on mortgage, the bond-holders dreds of thousands of acres have been acquired under an act that contains a provision for compulsory purchase for intention of the Commonwealth Constitution that the land.tax should be imposed, for the purpose of breaking up large estates. The tax itself is not only a tax on the wealth of the man who owns the land; it is also a tax on the borrowed money invested in the land, without being, a tax on the mortgagee who lends it. Speaking broadly, it may be said that the amount of money advanced on land in Australia is 50 per cent, of its value. We have, therefore, a wealth tax in the form of an emasculated land tax, specially designed to fit the case of 20,000' people, and leave free the mortagees,. of the value of the holdings of these people.

If it is a right principle to impose a tax on wealth, it ia inequitable to pick out 20,000 people to pay it, unless it has been conceived in the spirit of a penal tax to carry out the purpose referred to by the honourable member for Yarra. In my opinion, judging it by any test we may apply to it, that legislation is unworthy of an Australian Parliament. I regret that the Government's instalment of relief is so small.

If wealth is sound, why have we this one form of taxation which taxes, not only the equity which a man has in his land, but also the very money he has borrowed to enable him to hold it? The principle of the Oommonwealth land tax tested in every way is unsound, and its perpetuation is a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia; likewise on their courage, as they are apparently not willing to get rid of it. We should ascertain who are benefiting by the expenditure of the people's money, and then levy taxation on them for the prosperity they enjoy by income tax according to their incomes. The honourable inember for Yarra referred with a sneer of contempt to the legislation recently enacted which exempted from land taxation our western lessees. After all, those lessees were not holders of valuable Crown lands; they were merely lessees of doubtful areas. Had they not put their improvements on that country it would have been infested with rabbits, noxious weeds, and wild dogs, and the Crown lands would have been not only useless, but also a menace and curse to the country. These lessees have done -a great service to the nation in tackling those far back lands, which for the main part are the least dependable in Australia. They are mostly in drought areas, and the living conditions on them are most unfavorable.

I am afraid social standard of Australia, but in the. main it is not enjoyed by the great majothe principle of taxation of rity of those who take on land settlement. The great majority of those who have settled in the western area of New South Wales, in Central Australia, and in the northern portions of this continent, are far removed from pleasant social conditions'. The only things they enjoy are .the happiness of their family life and any feeling of satisfaction they may have in knowing that they are playing an important part in the development of our great public asset. I have looked at this legislation from every aspect. It is not the Commonwealth's task to break up large estates. The States have ample power to undertake that task. In every sense the people of the States are those who ought to control land settlement. They know their own requirements better than we do, and most of them are endeavouring to grapple with the problem. The honourable member for Yarra has drawn attention to a few landboard ballots for isolated lots which have been made available. From time to time the Crown combs over its lands, seeking areas suitable for settlement, and when a lot is found it is offered at a reward price to any man. who is willing to settle on it. As unoccupied land, it has been bringing in very little return, and consequently the upset price placed upon it is generally sufiicicntly small to draw a lot of applicants. The man who gets the block is just like the man who wins a lottery. He is lucky because immediately he becomes possessed of a good equity. It is a wonder there are not more applicases.

Land settlement is certainly a responsibility that should be left to the States. The founders of our Constitution intended that, because they entrusted the matter to the States. I am pleased to' see that under this bill a board has been appointed to deal with land values. When the value placed upon land by the commissioner is regarded as excessive, a board is to be appointed to deal with it, and I hope that that board's decision will be final. I do not believe that a judge who has been (trained in law, and whose position has Ibeen one of isolation and non-contact with the land or with rural industries, should determine land values. I hope that the iboard will consist of sound practical .men, who know something of land holding and the use of land. If there should ""be a period in which land values have suddenly gone up, I hope that they will not go round the country taking the -sales as If block for his son in a locality adjoining his own holding, and is willing to pay through the nose for it, I hope that the board will not be a party to a -system whereby the taxation commissioner -sale and fix the value of the land according to the price paid for it. Tliat should not be done. There should be a good margin between the taxable value and the market value of unimproved ""land. There is no force in existence that -can keep values up at a time when the money market is depressed. f r u it f u l sources of depression in land values is the existence of periods of -financial depression. withdrawn the weak holder is unable to hang on. He has to sell, and sacrifice, and it takes very few enforced sales in a locality to affect land values. Land valuers should not take cognizance cf either those periods .or boom periods. able member think of the suggestion that there should be a right of appeal against the decision of the board? leave that matter until we get to the committee stage. This country, when it settled its returned soldiers, gave forced or artificial settlement a trial. The Victorian Soldier Land Settlement Board did splendid work in purchasing land mostly at reasonable values, in sub-dividing it, and in nursing the soldiers in the early years when they were placed on the land. In the main, it bought well, and had an overwhelming regard for the welfare of the soldiers as against the vendors. The results of that artificial settlement have proved that it was impracticable and it has been, in the main, unsuccessful. When a man is settled on land of which he owes 100 per cent, of the value, and when similar conditions apply to his stock and implements, it is practically impossible for him to make a success. Those conditions were not faced by the earlier settlers or upon those who were in the . business with their families prior to launching out on their own. Such men a basis of valuation. begin by gaining knowledge from associa man determines to get a ation with practical farmers; then proceed steadily with the assistance of their families, and, with the credit granted by pastoral companies, auctioneering firms, machinery business merchants and the like, usually make good. They are in will follow such auction quite a different category from the unfortunate returned soldier settlers. Frequently the returned soldier did not know his work, he was just married, and had probably cashed his gratuity bond which, with his other money, had been absorbed by the purchase'of furniture and establishment costs. The task of settling on the land in Australia is not a rosy one. The seasons impose a considerable burden which, coupled with economic conditions, make the undertaking exceedingly precarious. It is certainly not as attractive as many other undertakingsWhen credit is which escape the wealth tax which this measure imposes. Undoubtedly, land settlement is a difficult problem. It involves the balancing of bad years with good, and it needs a ,very high courage. I hope that the spirit which prompted the land tax will not be persisted in, and that something of a more equitable nature than this bill will be introduced.

The honourable, member for Wannon, in the course of a good speech from his point of view, found it. necessary to make an attack on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so. member that it was not intended to be an attack. to cause people to think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had no justification for the attitude wbich he adopted some years ago in reference to Crown leaseholds. It will be remembered that at that time a very large sum of money was owing to Australia by leaseholders, and an endeavour was afoot tb relieve them of their obligations. The Deputy Leader of thc Opposition has been able, for the first time in this Parliament, to indicate that the Prime Minister was favourably inclined at that time towards making the then contemplated legislation retrospective. The right gentleman had made a statement to that e,ffect in Queensland, and he probably thought that it would not appear in the southern press. Hitherto the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has always been credited with the desire to make that legislation retrospective. We now find that the Prime Minister .threatened to tender his resignation if his views were not adopted, plainly indicating that he was endeavouring to assist a body of individuals who had consistently omitted to pay taxes which were due to the Crown. a few had evaded the tax. member has a perfect right to place his own construction on the matter. honourable member for Wannon slaimed that thc Deputy Leader of the Opposition went round the country making capital out of the incident. At that time il was stated that Mr Jowett owed the Commonwealth Treasury £77,000, and that a large sum was owing by a number of other Australian taxpayers. Those figures are authentic, having been taken from the official report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Surely, in the circumstances, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was justified in using them.

The amendment by the honourable member for Yarra has the whole-hearted support of the Opposition. oppose the amendment, and I may incidentally mention that I am not particularly enamoured of the bill. 1 am inclined to agree almost entirely with the remarks of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Eodgers). If the Federal Government .should meddle in land taxation, the object being, according to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to break up large estates, the tax should be imposed on unimproved land. That would tend to bring about a subdivision of large unimproved holdings. It was stated That would be a machinery bill, and not really a taxing measure. The greatest crime, commercially and financially, is to further load the people on the laud who are raising the wealth necessary to maintain the credit of this country. To-day the land-owner is taxed in three main ways, directly/ and he is taxed indirectly in many other ways. He escapes none of the taxes. He, above all, bears perhaps 97 per cent, of the taxation levied through the customs, particularly if he is an exporter, because he is die only person who cannot pass any of it on. He has to pay high railway freights, because the railway employees under our arbitration' system, must be paid high wages. He 'is required to pay income tax like everybody else; but he pays a little more than the others because his income is irregular. In some years, such as the present season, he may have no system of taxation, he may have to pay more direct income tax than the ordinary individual. Then he has to pay a land tax that is not imposed on any other section of the community. His land is capital, and therefore this is a capital tax I in this way. He is taxed upon the machinery by which he earns his income, although his income is taxed in the same way 'as the income of other people. I am referring to particularly valuable land that has perhaps been held by wealthy persons for generations. We should look by and large at the jnar* on the land, and compare his percentage of increase of taxation with that of those engaged in other industries and professions.

At a time when the farmer is getting little encouragement, the Taxation Department assesses his property at a value that is not inherent in it. I have with me a report supplied by the Taxation and signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Federal Taxation in Western Australia, and in it is a schedule showing the old and new values in various districts. 816,350. The old unimproved value was £279,020, and the new unimproved value is £S18,433. In the face of those figures the Treasurer says thaj^he is giving the farmers a 10 per cent, reduction! is a little bit of the Hebrew in that. The -acreage in Broomehill is 279,122. The old unimproved value was £180,658, and the new unimproved value is £247,428. In Quairading the acreage is 462,456. The old unimproved value was £301,265, and the new unimproved value is £471,486. tirely due to the inflated prices of wool and wheat, and not to any legislation passed by this Parliament or the State Parliaments. are not likely to last. Those holding land may consider themselves to be in possession of a greater asset than before, but the land is not producing any more, and its enhanced value is nothing more nor. less than the means of placing on additional tax upon them. The farmers are taxed in every way. They have to bear, in addition to the direct taxes levied -upon most people, the shire tax which helps to make the roads, and that is a very heavy impost upon them, the wheel tax and the vermin tax. Rural life is becoming uninteresting to the country people and they are nocking to the cities. help them to develop their land in order that they may profit from their labour. Extraordinary statements are made in this House by those honourable members .who do not own land, and do not know what it really means to go out to settle in the outback country. or seventeen years ago my brother and I had the experience of taking up land which was considered to be unsafe because of the light rainfall. When I went there to inspect the land before selection, had I not been trained as a ""bushmari, I Mr Prowse. should have been lost, and I suppose that the majority of honourable members, under similar circumstances, would have been lost iii the scrub and afraid to go near the place again. Western Australia at that time was, and is to-day, offering Department people every inducement to settle on the land. All the capital that could be raked up was put into the land to clear, fence, aud fertilize it in order to produce wealth, to improve the credit of this The acreage in Bruce Rock is country, and to provide work for the railways and other means of transport. We want people to settle on the land, but this is not possible when our legislation provides for continual reThere valuations of land that are taking the last ounce of strength from our farmers. Not only is tbe farmer loaded with the protectionist policy of ' Australia, but the Taxation Department is trying to grab all bis profits from his operations on the land. The Government That increased value is enof Western Australia seems to have been more reasonable. to the farmer in order to help him to develop his holding. If his income tax amounts to more than his The present high prices land tax, he pays the income tax only and vice versa. The Federal Government is collecting both taxes and making no differentiation. The Taxation Department is not sympathetic even in its interpretation of the act. It has been said that it would pay the Government to give the land to the people in order that it may be developed; but we have paid for the land and developed it. I had this experience two years ago. I wanted a piece of Crown land adjoining my property to square up my fencing. That land was so useless in its natural state that its. freehold was sold to me at 5s. an acre. Last year the Taxation Department The Treasurer declines to assessed the unimproved value of that land at 17s. 6d., for the simple reason that the valuer did not see the accumulation of stones and rubbish that had been taken off it at great expense, nor did he take account of other unseen improvement made also at great expense. The About sixteen man on the land is not credited in his land tax assessment with his contributions to the upkeep of roads. He, and not the man in the city, has to pay for them. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) does not pay for the roads, at any rate, in my district. Because these roads are made and the land improved by the farmer, the Taxation Department takes the last penny from the man on the land, and that is calculated to discourage land settlement Treasurer has said that we-are to have a valuation every three years. ""the consideration that is given hy honourable members opposite to the man the Opposition ( Mr Chariton) has said that primary and secondary industries should go hand in hand, and I agree with h i m ; but that is not the position to-day. The man on the land is groaning under the burden of secondary industries. If industries were going hand in hand, there would not be the adverse trade balance that exists to-day. If the Treasurer pursues his present policy and -extracts the last penny from the farmer, -our adverse balance w ill soon be three -or four times what it is to-day, and we shall then begin to realize that we have indeed killed the goose that laid the .golden eggs in this country. The Leader -of the Opposition also said that land was different from other assets, because its -existence was not due to the owner. -One buys property of any kiud as an investment, a means of earning a livelihood, and tbe most difficult livelihood to „get is that which comes from Mother Earth. If the Treasurer w ill consult the Commissioner of TaxationI am sure that be will be told that the bulk of the direct taxation is paid, not by the wheat farmer, but by the manufacturers and city merchants, which shows that the farmer is working for little if any profit. the wealth that maintains the community is produced by the man on the land, he is just permitted a bread and water existence so that he may continue his in. dustry and keep the country solvent. .ask the Treasurer to consider seriously the insertion of an amendment to provide that land used for the production of wealth shall be exempt from land taxation. That should accord with, the views -of honourable members opposite. Under -.the present law we definitely impose upon the man on the land two taxes that are not borne by anybody else in the community. I propose to show how unreasonable are some of the assessments of unin this country. The improved values. What is known as "" the Captain Cook value"" of land is practically nil . Who really is responsible for the enhanced value that is given to certain land? The land I selected in Western Australia had no real value until I expended my money upon it . Until that time it would not carry three kan-. outback. The Leader of garoos or two sheep over the whole area. The railway was already built, so it cannot he said that the value of the land was enhanced by Government expenditure. The Crown owned the land, and I bought it . We put the whole of our capital into it , and when we proved that it could be put to profitable use others desiring to follow our example set up an inquiry for land in the neighbourhood. In consequenece the land became more valuable than it was when I acquired it . B y so enhancing the value of that land I helped other citizens and the State, not myself. What benefit do I gain from the increment of values? If I continue to utilize it for wheat-growing that increased value will not help me at all, so why put a burden of taxation upon me in respect of a value created in accordance with public policy and the desire of the Government and the. people? The definition clause of tbe Land Tax Assessment Act defines "" unimproved value "" in relation to land as the capital sum which the fee simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired Although 90 per cent, of by the owner or his predecessor in .title had not been made. Several interpretations of that definition have been given. TheH i g h Court has heldI That thc unimproved value of land may b< ascertained by comparison' with the prices ob tained for similar land in the neighbourhood in a state of nature. The mere sale price of land in a districi is no index to its value unless one takei into consideration the reasons that go verned the payment of that price. Tht price might have been excessively high",39,Second Reading
174,Mr West,The poor land-owners!,41,Second Reading
175,Mr Prowse,"That remark typifiesnot because of tbe merits of tbe land, but because a father wanted to buy an adjacent block for his son, or a land holder desired to acquire an adjoining property. Special consideration should be given to those facts when valuing property for land tax purposes. The High Court also heldTliat tlie word "" improvements "" in the defipartnerships are formed for the purpose nition of the term ""unimproved value"" includes sueh operations of man upon the land since it has ceased to be Crown land, the benefit of sueh continues at the date of valuation, and operations of nature which are only effectual by reason of what man has done, as have contributed to bring about the present enhancement of tlie value of tlie land. That phase is not sufficiently taken into account when valuations are being made. The valuer visits a property that is fully improved, and asks the owner the cost of the fencing, clearing, dam sinking, &c. Upon this information he tries to estimate the value of the actual improvements done on the property. Then he arrives at tbe unimproved value by taking the improvements from local sales. The department does not allow, however, for the fees that have been paid to roads boards or the cost of root picking for a number of years after the first clearing of the land, or the cost of destroying noxious weeds and poison plants, and the interest paid on the capital expenditure. These outgoings should be taken into consideration wheu endeavouring to arrive at the unimproved value of a property. There is another injustice that affects the people of Western Australia particularly. When the goldfields commenced to decline, not because the gold was exhausted, but because high costs made the winning of it no longer profitable, many people in mining to the land. city positions selected land, as they were entitled to do, and entered into a form of partnership with brothers or other relatives One man worked the property, and the other provided from his earnings the capital with which to carry out improvements. most economical arrangement. The two brothers thus associated raised more taxable income, developed the land more .rapidly, were able to buy more efficient Mr Prowse. machinery, and produced more per unit. But for purposes of taxation the department treats the two brothers as one unit, and allows only one deduction. The Treasurer and the Crown Law Department should be able to frame an amendment which -would give relief in such bona fide cases. I recognize that certain of evading taxation, but there should be provision for honest, genuine partnerships of the kind I have mentioned. When each partner has individual rights and a family to maintain, both should be taxed as individuals. Instead the department combines their holdings and brings them within the scope of thc Commonwealth land tax. I ask the Treasurer to give the fullest consideration to the amendment I have suggested, which I am confident would encourage and help the development of the land. The honourable ""member for Porrest( Mr Prowse) has been arguing on false premises. He has painted a most doleful picture of the conditions of wheat-growers and agriculturists generally, because of the imposts of all kinds placed upon them, and particularly because of the oppressive manner in which this form of taxation is applied to them. He has spoken frequently of the man on the land. Surely the honourable member overlooked the fact that the Commonwealth Jand tax does not in the main apply to such people. said were that a couple of small men working in partnership are heavily taxed by the department. particular cases to which attention should previously interested be paid by the Treasurer. But the main turned their attention burden of the honourable member's arguSome who occupied ment was that the man on the land was singled out for double, treble, and quadruple taxation, and he said that this land tax is particularly unjust because of its effect upon agriculture. If the honourable member believes this taxation to have that effect, he should be more specific.

I do not call myself an agriculturist or a farmer, because I own a farm and employ somebody else to work it. There are plenty of cheque-book farmers; presumably the honourable member for Forrest was not pleading for farmers who live in the cities and employ others to work their properties. When he spoke of the struggling man on the land he must be assumed to have been referring to the man gling on the land, the man who is working his farm, and is a producer in the real sense of the term. In those cases there is not 1 per cent., or a fraction of 1 per cent, subject to the Commonwealth land tax. The class of which the honourable member for Wannon spoke-the large land-owners-ough t not to receive special concessions from o tbere are pastoralists who have done useful pioneering work for the community. For that they are"" entitled to the respectin Queensland a great many absentee of the community and of this Parliament; but when he speaks of the pastoralists to whom this legislation applies in its general effect, I say that among them are many who are not, and never were, pioneers. There are pioneers still in the pastoral industry, and all honour to them, but 99 of every 100 in the pastoral industry in Australia at the present time are not pioneers in the sense in which the honourable member spoke. A great deal of our pastoral land at the present time is held by pastoral and land companies, many of them with absentee shareholders. Ninety-nine out of every 100 of the large pastoralist lessees-a t any rate, in New South Wales and Queensland-ar e men who not only have never done any pioneering work, but have done no work of any kind themselves on the land; they have been investors and capitalists. I do not say that they are not entitled to a just return from their investments; that is another matter altogether. But the argument offered against the Land Tax Act by the honourable member for Wannon was that land taxation ought not to be imposed on these men because of their pioneering efforts. He drew a most moving picture of the struggles of the pioneers in pastoral districts, and put forward the argument that many of these areas would be waste land to-day but for the work"" of the pioneers.

But the argument that this legislation should not apply, because of the pioneering efforts of the men on the land, carries no weight. member think that a man should be doubly taxed? Is not, income taxation sufficient ? that anybody should be doubly taxed, but then I do not think that the Land Tax Act places double taxation on auy one. The land tax is justified on the grounds so succinctly stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr agricultural or any other purpose. Scullin). It was intended in the first place to prevent the growth of land monopoly in Australia. It was intended to make it unprofitable to hold large areas of land idle, or to hold it out of its most effective iise, and it was intended acquisition always creates a boom. The to secure to the community a portion of the community-created value of the land, the increment which increases year by year. Further, it was intended to be a revenue measure. It was intended first to prevent monopolies, then to force large areas into closer settlement, and to get for the community a portion of the community-created values. That is the justification for the tax. The longer it is in operation, provided it is not meddled with, the less hardship it will impose on the holders of land. As land continues to be held, the burden of the tax will apply to those who ought to bear it. It does not operate harshly against anyone against whom it ought not to apply. If it has the effect of steadying land values-and it has had that effect if it keeps down the value of agricultural land, it is justified. It has done of land, so that the charge-on the incommore than anything else to keep land values down. It enables those who acquire land to get it for less than they would otherwise have to pay. There is no sound reason why those persons who acquire land for farming or grazing purposes, and who have been enabled to do so at cheaper prices because of the operapulsorily acquired, the prices paid tion of this tax, should complain subsequently that the tax applies to their land. They will have derived benefit from it. The land tax, if it is wisely applied. benefits the farmer much more than it injures him. It makes land available at cheaper prices than would otherwise be possible. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) said that there was no necessity for legislation of this kind, because if the prime reason of the tax was to force land ou to the market to the honourable bring about closer settlement, that object could be accomplished by means of compulsory acquisition by the Government. Every State has attempted the wholesale acquisition of land, and the payment of compensation by means of resumption acts. But their experience has been, without exception, that they have had to acquire the land at a price many times greater than what it was really worth for perous settlers to-day on estates which were cut up under State acts. fact of a government coming into the market has the effect of enhancing prices immediately. It.is the unfortunate agriculturist who settles on these estates who has to bear the burden. illustrated by the settlement of soldiers under the Repatriation scheme. exception, the soldier settlement areas throughout Australia were acquired at too high a price, and in almost every case they have had to be revalued to relieve the present holders of the land, showing that too much was paid in the first place. That is the inevitable outcome of government acquisition. When a government commences to purchase land, it always has to pay too much. There are influences at work which force up the prices ing settler is beyond his capacity to pay. perhaps, but that is the rule.

If it has the further effect of forcing the subdivision of land, it is a good filing; and if it steadies the price of land which the sons of farmers have to acquire, it is doing still more good, and is completely justified. The honourable member cannot ignore what has been happening under this legislation. Estates have been subdivided. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) mentioned the area of land that has been forced out of the taxable class almost solely because of the operation of the land tax. From 1910, the first year in which this tax became operative, to 1925, the last year covered by the commissioner's report, land of an unimproved value of £117,000,000 has been removed from the taxable field by subdivision. ' good thing. That is the justification for the law. A good many of the estates which come within the aggregate value mentioned might, in the ordinary course of events, have been subdivided, but a large proportion would not have been subdivided if it had not been subjected to the land-tax law. The tax has been the prime reason for subdivision, and that is why this land has been made available for closer settlement and is now more productive than it ever was before. In the older countries of Europe, and in America, too, agrarian problems, due largely to land monopoly, and absenteeism, have agitated the public mind. Right through the centuries this has been a f r u it f u l cause of trouble, insurrection, agitation, and the disruption of nations. Because land monopoly has been allowed, landlordism has grown to dimensions beyond anything known in Australia, and the lesson to be learned from the history of those countries ought not to be ignored by us. prevent land monopoly in this country. A great deal of the trouble in Victoria in connection with arrested development is due to it. highly developed State in the Commonwealth. Victoria has more people to the square mile than the other States does not vitiate my argument. In proportion to the population, land monopoly exists to a greater extent in Victoria than in the other States. It also exists in Queensland and New South Wales. It exists anywhere that large areas of land are held by companies or individuals when it could support more people if broken up into smaller holdings. seem always to constitute themselves the judges of these matters. it is not a non-land-owner who is speaking. I am speaking, however, in a representative character. of the honourable member's party. cannot be refuted that there are many Australian towns that are land-locked because the land in those localities is held in large estates. That prevents development, as the land is not put to its fullest use. If this land tax will have the effect of hastening the subdivision of those estates, it will do an excellent work.

He spoke of his own experience, of how he went out-back and took up land which appeared to be valueless. The honourable member explained how he expended his energies and money in the endeavour to develop that land, which is now of a certain value and, presumably, subject to this tax. The honourable member claimed that, surely, he had created that value by his energy and' by the expenditure of his capital. honourable member did not. No doubt he was one of the contributory causes of that value, like every other member of the community. What value would that, or any other land have, if it depended entirely upon the efforts of its owner, and upon no one else in the community?

The building of towns, roads, railways, harbours, tablishment creation of markets, all contribute towards the gradual enhancement of the value of land, and it must be attributable to collective community action It is to secure the return of a portion of that value from the commuuity that land tax is justified.

Statistics show that land values are improving in the aggregate by millions every year in our cities, towns, and in our rural districts. city property in Sydney has appreciated by £80,000,000 sterling, on the municipal and local authority valuation. The enormous enhancement in value was not due to the efforts of persons who owned the freehold, but to the efforts of the entire population, and the return to the community of a portion of the increase of value is no more than common justice. ber adv6cates a tax on unearned increment. Land, values are enhanced tioned three or four factors which justify the imposition of a land tax, one being to secure to the community a proportion of the unearned increment. It also prethe esvents the growth of land monopoly, and of factories, and the is a means of supplementing the public revenue. This last matter was very effectively dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). Our war burdens are still with us, and our war obligations still have to be met every year. This tax brings in only a small contribution of a couple of millions a year from people who own land of an assessable unimproved v!ilue of £256,000.000 sterling. They actually pay only £2,600,000 towards the revenue of the Commonwealth! The whole burden of the speech of the honourable member for Forrest was that the man on the land suffers; aud that this taxation is one of the grievous burdens which he has to carry. If the honourable member believes that the man on the land is the person who suffers, he should be in favour of the abolition of land tax. His argument and the argument of the honourable member for Wannon were not really arguments against this amendment, but against land taxation entirely. Their speeches were directed against this party specifically. Such cases should be I remind those honourable members, and others who are following this debate, that whether there is justification or a lack of justification for a land tax, the present land tax has been in operation continuously for fifteen years, during the last ten years the Labour party has beeu in opposition, and not in office. If there is anything in the contention of those honourable members opposite, that this is a fatal sort of imposition operating adversely against In ten years a class of the community-and the honourable member for Riverina calls it class taxation--the y must blame their own party.

Land which is used for production in either primary or secondary industries should not be taxed. This tax was introduced by the Labour party with two objects. As the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) pointed out, it was designed to burst up large estates. It has not achieved that object. The second reason for introducing it was to augment the revenue. It has become a revenue tax pure and .simple, and it will remain so as long as it is on the statute book. I submit that it is not a federal function to tax land. The Commonwealth is debarred constitutionally from discriminating between the States; but honourable members know very well that, . owing to the wide variety of land in the Comnioiiwealth, this tax operates more unfavorable on some States than on others.

""When I was recently in that StateI heard persons talktion, exempted from taxation leasehold ing about squatters and their land, and the areas that they had in mind would be regarded in Queensland as no more than night horse-paddocks. through New South Wales one sees large unoccupied areas along the railway lines; but, because, of that, it is worse than useless ' to levy a tax upon the value of that land in order to burst up tbose estates, if it will injure somebody in Queensland who happens to be doing .a national work. There may be urgent necessity for cutting up some estates. The State Governments know these; let them act when necessary. On my first trip six years ago, I saw sheep being grazed within about 12 or 14 miles of the Mr Hunter. city. Possibly that was the best purpose to which that particular land could be put at the time; but I dare say the owners of it were merely grazing sheep on it for the purpose of paying the rates and taxes on land which afterwards they would cut up for suburban settlement. Conditions vary greatly in each State, and in different parts of each State. Queensland is a huge tract of country. Conditions in the south are entirely different from those in the north, and those along the coastal belt vary tremendously from those in the western areas; 20 miles east of Toowoomba, the value of the land and the purposes for which it is used, are different from those 20 miles westward. The States are the proper authorities to exercise discrimination legally and for revenue, political and every other State purpose. The States have so discriminated in the past. Queensland and New South The honourable member for Wales, for instance, have done so. I have before me a copy of an act passed by the Now South Wales Parliament on the motion of the Labour Government led by Mr Lang. It is an amending taxation act dealing with large estates. Even that Government saw the necessity for discrimination. It exempts land within the western division of New South Wales, which, like the land in western and north-western Queensland, has been badly hit in clays gone by by the tax on leaseholds. The Labour Government under Mr Lang, wbich will not be accused of having been a Tory administraancl freehold lands in the western division of New South Wales. The measure also exempts irrigation areas, In travelling or lands owned by a person to whom the advisory, board has issued a certificate that they are being used mainly for the purpose of breeding stud stock. Although even that Labour Government saw the necessity for discriminating between certain classes of land, the federal authorities cannot discriminate. We have been told that the object of the tax is to burst up large estates and take a portion of the increment in value. We are informed, also, toMelbourne, that it is a rich man's taxa big man's tax. It may be a big man's tax; but a big man is not necessarily a rich man. If he is rich, and is using his land, he is to be blamed no more, in fact, considerably less, than persons who own a considerable amount of property of other kinds that cannot be taxed. only way in which the latter can be reached is tlirough the income tax. tors in stocks and shares and sundry other things,, men who never circulate their money throughout the country, who never produce anything-som e of them are to be found in the ranks of the Opposition-the y are permitted to escape from taxation; but the men who own land and cannot get away from it, who produce add to the wealth of this country, are selected to be hounded down and penalized. Even supposing this were a justifiable tax and a rich man's tax, which I deny, what would it matter if the Government retired from this field of taxation? These men could not escape. There are four State Labour governments, including one in Queensland, which has no upper house to block land taxation. The State Labour governments would seize such a favorable opportunity to enter the field of taxaauthority, which may immediately enter tion vacated by the Commonwealth. It would be a chance to obtain increased revenue. Goodness knows, the States, with their wild expenditure, need it. would be unable to escape in any case. All the talk about the rich man and the poor man is indulged in merely to renew an old cry, and set class against class, so that, when honourable members opposite go before the electors, they can say to them, "" Look what we have done to place taxes upon the wealthy clasSj thereby but the repayment of debts incurred to relieving the poorer section."" That argument will not be accepted in Queensland, because the rich man can be taxed there. He was taxed in days gone by. But when the honourable member for Dalley, as Premier of Queensland, went , abroad to interview the money-lenders, they whispered something in his ear, and he climbed down. He had to account for his notions to his own party, and it is said that that was one of the matters that led to his loss of the premiership. ber is getting away from the subject matare too large. Beports have appeared in -Jer' of the bill. talk that I hear, that honourable members on this side are the friends of the rich The while honourable members opposite are the friends of the poor. Probably, if an investigation were made, it would be found If they happen to be speculathat I and the greater number on this side of the House are considerably poorer than the majority of the honourable members who sit opposite. One thing that must be impressedupon the people is the fact that there are two taxing authorities in Australia; but, listening to the speeches delivered by honourable members in Cansomething, and berra in the last few months, one would imagine that the people should be encouraged to believe that the only taxing authority is the Commonwealth. The people know to their cost that there are two taxing authorities-the States and the Commonwealth. Queenslanders know it only too well, and so do the taxpayers in every other State ruled by Labour governments. When one of those authorities vacates a particular field of taxation, it is left open to the other it. Therefore, there is little opportunity for any class of taxpayer to escape when two authorities operate. We have heard about the Federal Government receding The rich man in Queensland from direct taxation. Everybody knows that it did uot enter that field until 1910. We are informed that it was done for the purpose of bursting up large estates. Now that we have entered that field, however, we depend upon it for our ordinary revenue. It is true that direct taxation was imposed for war purposes; meet war expenditure is spread over a period of years and cannot be made at once without hardship and ruination to industry. No business man will hold that the taxpayers sbould have to pay in one year the whole' of the cost of the works authorized in any particular year. The people of today are paying something for posterity, but posterity should bear its'share of the cost. The only way to apportion the burden of debt fairly is by sinking funds and other such means. We have the press of attacks upon the Federal",49,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces
260,Mr Speaker,The honourable membeen assured many times that those funds,51,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces
261,Mr Hunteb,"I am tired of the Treasurer for establishing too large a sinking fund. We are told now that there should be no sinking fund at all. It is said by the Opposition that every penny of tax placed upon industry should be kept there, and used to pay off the national debt. Direct taxes are the only taxes that the Federal Parliament can reduce. Our indirect taxes are really not taxes at all. They are spread evenly over the whole community. Eor the most part they are collected upon luxuries that the average man, woman and child does not enjoy. Only from about £1 18s. to £2 per head of indirect taxation can be said to.be properly distributed throughout, the community. No road user objects to the moneys raised for roads; other sums have been raised for other purposes. The total moneys received from both direct and so-called indirect taxation have increased in the last four years from £9 Os. 3d. to £9 13s. Id. per head, an increase of 12s. 9d.; but the direct taxation has decreased from £4 Os. Id. to £2 10s. 7d. Let us examine the taxation figures in; Queensland or any other State that has been ruled by Labour. This party calls itself the Australian Labour party, and claims to be Semper idem, the same in every State and in the country. If we look at its achievements elsewhere, we naturally conclude that it will show a similar record in the federal sphere. The increase in State taxation has amounted to pounds per head of the population in every State that has been ruled, or misruled, by Labour; but the increase in total federal taxation from all sources, even inof a Labour government doing that. This cluding so-called indirect taxation has been infinitesimal. This year the increase will be only 7s. 7d. more than in 1922, and 5s. 2d. less than this year. What have we done? Everybody knows that 6s. per head of that has gone for the roads, and 12s. or 13s. per head for invalid and old-age pensions. If we add the two together, we have about 18s. By eliminating that expenditure, we could bring about a fairly considerably reduction in taxation. But is'any honourable member prepared to cut out that expenditure? We find in the States a constant, increase not only in direct taxarelief, so that they may be better tion, but also in indirect taxation, includable to withstand drought periods. ing increased railway freights, which hit Mr Hunter. the people in the country and particularly the people of Queensland. In the States direct taxation has constantly increased without our having a single benefit to show for it. Certainly wild-cat shows bankrupt State enterprises, and depleted railway returns, coupled with worse services, are nothing to brag about. It may be asked, what have we to show in the federal sphere? I ask honourable members opposite to go to the country, where they will find an efficient telephonic system in operation. The sum of £20,000,000 has been voted for the improvement and extension of telephones and other facilities of communication by the department of the Postmaster-General. Ask the country people if they object to that expenditure and if they want these services curtailed. Ask them also what they think of the roads grant. honourable member not to pursue that line of discussion. the taxation policy of this Government with that of the State governments. Honourable members opposite would lead us to believe that the Federal Government is the only taxing master, whereas the Federal Government has reduced taxation and the State Governments have not. It is the duty of the Federal Government, or of any government, when it has too much revenue, to return some of it to the people. This Federal Government is reducing taxation, but I have never heard Government, through its economical administration, has been able to reduce taxation, and thereby give a fillip to industry. A man is a fool who says that money is better in the hands of the Government than it is in the hands of private enterprise. The Opposition says that we have immense war responsibilities to meet, and therefore this is not the time to reduce taxation. It says also that we have bad times ahead; but, if that is so, who will suffer? It will be the people on the land, and this Government is' giving them some The policy of the Opposition, when bad",51,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces

It would be wrong for the Federal Government to remain forever in the field of land taxaincrease in revenue and railways, tion ; because that should be the sphere of the States. It is a penal tax, pure and simple, and can be imposed by the Statesi f they wish. Reference has been made to thc reduction in taxation on Grown leaseholds. This Government has done that deliberately, and does not apologize for its action. Queensland ^has more leasehold country than any other State. We know what the taxation of leaseholds means. There are few large areas of freehold country in Queensland, so probably the ordinary land tax has not affected Queensland so much as it has the other States. Queensland has huge undeveloped areas, and its population is small compared with those of New South Wales and Victoria. Most of the settlers in the far west have large holdings. Much has been said about the conditions in Queensland, and in that respect I shall quote from a report of the Land Settlement Advisory Board which was ' appointed by the It is frequently said that the industries perty and stock being £50,000,000. This of that State are progressing, and that many of the settlers are rolling in wealth. Let me quote the Queensland figures relating to sheep, spread over a period of 34 years. In 1891 the total number of sheep in that State was 20,289,000; in 1910, 20,331,000; and in 192S, 20,663,000. increase in sheep carried of 1.84 per cent. higher in the intervening years? present 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 sheep in Queensagain, of 3.32d. in 1911,and 2.83d. in land. Take the cattle industry. In 1891 the total number of cattle in Queensland was 6,192,000; in 1910, 5,131,000; and in 1925, 6,436,000. The sheep and cattle are pastured mostly in wide spaces in the outback country. Since 1891 the mileage of railways has increased almost threefold, and the total number of grazing selections has increased from 5,600 to 9,692. But there was a great increase in something typical of Labour Government revenue. The total land revenue ir. 1891 was £489,000; in 1910, £757,000; and in 1925, nearly £1,500,000. A l though there has been an enormous the grazing industry has made little advance. The conditions of Queensland are different from those of other States, and this is shown in the report of the Advisory Committee. Expressing the carrying capacity of New South Wales and Queensland in terms of sheep, over a period of five years-192 1 to 1925 -Ne w South Wales carried 222 sheep and Queensland only 137 sheep to the square mile. In New South Wales the average weight of fleece increased by 1.33 lb., and in Queensland by only 0.38 lb., so that New South Wales is 1 lb. to the good in the increase of wool per sheep. I am quoting these figures to show that, in view of the different conditions in Queensland, we cannot apply the federal land tax with equity throughout the length and breadth of Australia. We have heard much about the producers making money. . The Advisory Board found that the approximate annual income of all graziers from the sheep industry is £4,000,000, the value of prorepresents a net return of only 8 per cent., without taking into consideration the various troubles of the settlers, such as dogs and droughts. The committee found, also, that the production costs had considerably increased since 1911. Taking a flock of from 13,000 to 16,000 sheep, That represents an we find that the costs increased from £2,765 to £7,400. The cost per pound of wool increased from 5.39d. to 12.43d., and the average price per pound from 8.71d. to 15.26d., leaving a net return per pound to the graziers in these far-back places, whose leaseholds the Labour party there are probably from taxed, and whom they propose to tax 1925.

270,Mr Hunter,"I have heard to-dayintends to levy a tax on leaseholds, and that I shall, at the next election, drive thoroughly into the minds of the people of Queensland. ThenI come to the taxation per head of sheep. In .1911, an income of £4,000, representing approximately 16,000 sheep, returning 5s. per head, paid in State income tax £133, or approximately 2d. per sheep. In 1927 the State and Federal tax amounted to £960, or Is. 2-}d. per sheep. Yet we are told that no taxation should he taken off these people. leaseholders, but would press considerably harder on freeholders, because they invest considerable capital in their pror perties and the interest on that would be a low rentals^ and now an additional tax charge against them Most of the graziers in Queensland are leaseholders. Honourable members opposite want to know where the money goes. Take, for instance, a station with a run sufficient for from 10,000 to 40,000 sheep. During the last six years the net income of the owner was £4,479 per annum. In this instance, for every 90s. of gross profit, thc owner received 20s., the Government ISs., the workers and other associated with the industry 52s. Yet honourable members opposite would like to tax that settler, so as to reduce his return of 20s. In the case of this grazier, for every £1 that he received he spent £2 12s. in providthe man in the office, or by the man ing work, particularly reproductive and t national work. He sold his products overseas, and the proceeds were sent to Australia, yet the Opposition says that tbese men are privileged because they own land. ing our trade balance. told that this tax should be kept on, because it would assist our trade balance. But by allowing these graziers a remission of taxation, more money will be put into the industry, and more wealth will be produced, with a consequent less adverse trade balance. The board examined the conditions of the industry, and made certain recommendations. vised a review of the rents that have recently been fixed by the department. It also advises inquiries into the promotion of production and land settlement, so that the value of our exports may exceed our imports and that the Government should take action so that investment in the wool industry might be attractive. That board was appointed by a Labour Government. We have been told that men should be taxed on their leaseholds; but surely that is a matter for the State to decide, because it fixes rentals, not only for revenue purposes, but also for purposes of development. The quality and fitness of land for grazing purposes is not the same throughout Australia, nor These conditions apply to even in Queensland. In the report is a long table setting out the conditions that assessors must take into account when fixing rentals. The board recommends is advocated by the Opposition. Rental values are created and main tained by land development and by thc development of other lands in the neighbourhood. The enterprise of Crown tenants in investing their capital has proved the resources of their country, and make it possible for the State to derive extensive revenue from rents and taxatioi: which otherwise would uot have been available, and spend by far the greater proportion of their gross revenue in wages. This country is not developed by the man in the city, by who sits in Parliament. It is developed by the man who settles in the outback country, and by those who follow him. Private enterprise alone, by investing its capital in the land, can develop the resources of this country. It is the selectors who develop this country, and that was what was in the mind of the Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, when he made the speech that has been referred to by the Opposition. I was with him in Queensland, and I know what he said. He referred to our large areas of land, and the enormous amount of capital necessary to develop them. He said that these areas would be developed only by big men with capital, and subsequently that after they had been It has addeveloped they should be subdivided into selections for the next settlers. The big man pioneers the country, and after he has developed it and made it productive and railways have been constructed, the smaller man can come in and' get the benefit by selection at the",53,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces

272,Mr Hunter,"That is so. We are.resumption periods. That is what the Prime Miuister meant. Nobody in this chamber believes that he said that he was against the bursting up of huge estates that are not being used. Honourable members opposite say that because reduced rents are being charged by the States for certain lands, the Commonwealth should step in and impose increased taxation. They would ignore the national work that the settlers have done for the development of this country and in providing for export, and they say that no taxation should be reduced for them. There are in Queensland and other States vast areas which are wholly undeveloped, and the Land Settlement Advisory Board has recommended that there should be discrimination not only between lands adjacent to and distant from railways, but between lands partially developed and those that are undeveloped. It has suggested that the rents in respect of the latter should be so low that the people settled there will be encouraged to remain and develop the land for the benefit of themselves and tbe nation, and thus help towards adjusting the present adverse trade balance. The report of the board shows that it appreciated the necessity for conserving any interests that create national wealth, particularly the interests in the outback country. It matters not whether the land is occupied by sheep or cattle. The Queensland Labour Government appreciates that fact, and that is why I said that, if some honourable members opposite pitched in Queensland the tale that they have been pitching in this chamber, even members of their own party would laugh at them. The State Arbitration Court discriminated between cattle country and sheep country. Although a sheep property may be divided from a cattle run by only a wire fence, the man who works ou the cattle run is paid £2 10s. a week and the employee on the sheep station £3 10s. The Queensland Labour Government also introduced a law, which will expire this year, to allow of special rents being charged to cattlemen.. The board has recommended the extension of that act for another six years, in order to enable the cattlemen to get on their feet. It is admitted that those men should not be required to pay in rent thc f u l l economic value of the land. But because they have received a concession ou account of bad seasons, and the vicissi ; tudes of the meat industry, members of the Labour party in this chamber say that the Pederal Government should collect the amount that the State Go^ ernment has been generous enough to forego. I intend to let the people throughout the length and breadth of Queensland know that the Labour party is in favour of re-imposing the land tax on leasehold, which this Goverument repealed a couple of years ago, and is against any reduction in direct taxation which would benefit the man outback who is doing a great national work in providing development, exports and work for workmen. I commend the Federal Government for reducing taxation in the past, and for the further reduction they now propose. I know the whole of the people of my State will appreciate it. I cannot understand some of the speeches delivered upon the bill and the amendments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Ministerialists have endeavoured to cloud the issue by introducing many matters that are irrelevant to the bill. I am aware that in debating a bill of this character, much latitude is allowed, and that may account to some extent for some of the extraordinary statements that have been made. The speech of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) was so doleful that it would be of benefit to the country if it could be deleted from Hansard and totally excluded from the columns of the press. Some friends of mine who recently returned from a visit to Europe told me that if honourable members could see the Australian news that is published in the English newspapers, they would be more careful of the public statements they make. If the speech of the honourable member for Forrest is cabled to the other side of the world it will do infinite harm to this country. I have been surprised to hear the enthusiastic championship of land agents and land monopolists; they are the curled darlings of the community, because they extract more wealth from the country than any other section. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra is a protest against",54,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces
273,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.20],"the removal of land taxation from this wealthy section, which is well able to bear of the people who were deriving large it. As one who has endeavoured to study the problems of public finance, I consider the Treasurer's proposal most unjust. While he is losing revenue by the remission of taxation, he is trying to balance the ledger by using loan funds for expenditure that should be met from revenue. Instead of producing a budget that would be a credit to Australia, he has produced one which does uot meet with the approval of any business man. Tbe proposed remission of land tax will mean an extension of the rotten principle of paying from loan account money that should be paid from revenue. private company that did not live within its income would soon find itself in the bankruptcy court. balancing expenditure against income js equally sound in the management of the nation's finances. It is strange that some income, he could always balance his exhonorable members cannot speak on any question without blackguarding the people who live in the cities. They say, that the city dwellers are supported by the man on the land. That is nonsense. If there were no consumers, the goods produced by the man on the land would be worthless, and even land would have little value if the population were small. The land-holders get more benefits from the public treasury than the rest of the community. assistance, and although the land-owner gets the benefit of the resultant increment of values, city residents have to help members of the dorner party are out to pay the interest on the capital cost of the lines. paying, but we do not mind that. South Wales pay annually £2,250,000 in interest in respect of railways that do not pay. There is a good deal of misconception about taxation. The honourable member for Forrest included in the burden of taxation municipal and road board rates. Those rates are not taxation; they are a charge for services rendered. The roads are paid for out of the petrol tax, which is mainly contributed by the people in the cities. I was a member of this Parliament when the Commonwealth land tax was originally imposed. A t that time large areas of land were not being put to productive use, and many incomes from land only partially used were paying little or no taxation. They were actually free from taxation other than that collected through thecustoms and excise duties. I am in the happy position of knowing that the forecast made at that time, that the tax would break up the large holdings, has been verified. Another injustice in regard to the land is that , the governments of the various States have disposed of it at prices far below what it should have brought. In New South Wales there are large areas on the RichA mond and Clarence Rivers, and up to the Queensland border, which were sold by The principle of the Government for £1 an acre. In the old days, when the Treasurer of the New South Wales Government was short of penditure with his revenue by selling so many acres of land at £1 an acre, and anybody could buy it. The whole of the land in the north-eastern portion of the State was sold in this way. .This land along the Clarence and other rivers and on the north coast is selling now at from .£100 to £110 an acre, although originally it was sold by the Government for £1 an acre. I did not follow all the things that were said on this subject; there are Railways are built for their some honourable members who say so many silly things.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition dealt with this matter in a statesmanlike way in the course of his address in support of the amendment. That amendment states, "" In view of the grave and expanding obligations of 'the Commonwealth manifested by the adverse trade balance and the increasing loan expenditure,"" and there is no dispute about those things. We are to-day floating a redemption loan. Our practice is to pay £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 off our debt, and then to borrow another £12,000,000. The amount credited each year to the loan account is much greater than that set aside for debt redemption.",55,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces

It has no soul, or it would think twice before it laid such burden on the mass of the people. am opposed to land taxation by the Commonwealth. I believe that the State can administer that business very much better than the Pederal Government can. So far as this tax is concerned, the city provides about 55 per cent, of it. In the city the major portion is paid by the consumer. I am connected with business concerns, and I know how warehouses and other businesses pass the load on to the consumer. The rural industry is in quite a different position. It has to compete with cheap overseas markets, and has not the opportunities to pass on expenses which are enjoyed by the cannot be emphasized too clearly. Fifty-five per cent, of this tax is paid in the cities by the consumer. At present a harbour bridge is being constructed in Sydney, aud the major portion of its cost will be passed on to the consumers. When the Arbitration Court compels the employer to pay additional wages he passes the increase, with a little addition, on to the community, which must bear the burden. It would be difficult to get two men to to develop it. He must possess capital to value land at the same, price. I have been associated with land valuing for many years, and while I feel that I am competent to value the land with which I am familiar-and in connection with wbich I know the rainfall, accessibility, carrying alleged .exorbitant values placed on large capacity, &c I would not dream of going 100miles away from my own centre, and posing there, as a competent valuer. Values depend chiefly on the man who values, and it is impossible for him to have a comprehensive knowledge of many different'localities. One primary producer may make good on land whicb is valued at £20, while another man may fail on similar land valued at £10. Our experience, with soldier land settlement provides an excellent example of that. There is land in Victoria, arid in other parts of the Commonwealth, which varies in valuation from £1 to £3 an acre from adjoining land, from which it is divided by a fence or a road. That is co-ordination in our valuing. A valuer may be instructed to value a certain estate, which may not have been valued for some time Changed circumstances may warrant the valuation that he places upon it, but the adjoining lands are not revalued, and remain at the old value. We have State and Federal values of the land which differ, and even our Federal values of similar land differ considerably. I have argued constantly that land should be zoned when it is valued for Federal taxation purposes, and that the valuation should apply for three or six years, the land in each zone to be r.e-valued simultaneously. That would set right many existing anomalies. I am very pleased that the old system of assessing land values is to be abolished, as it was unfair. I do not agree with the Leader of secondary industries. That the-Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and the dore), in their remarks on the value placed on estates, and as to the difficulty experienced in obtaining farms. I have been through large portions of Western Australia, South Australia, and other States of Australia, and I believe, that the opportunities to go on the land are as good today as they ever were during my lifetime. It is useless to give a man 1,000 acres of land when he has no money with which pay for fencing, implements, stock, and for the erecton of his house. It must be realized that there is a multiplicity of financial obligations following the actual acquisition of the land. Referring to the estates, I saw five estates sold in a western district at from £95 to £110 per acre, for 20-acre blocks. Large estates, when cut up for sub-divisional purposes, may be purchased at a much lower figure. In Victoria there are estates which have been on. the market for some time, and which may be purchased reasonably. Associated with the subdivision of estates is the cost of subdividing, road construction, cleaning, and so on, and the profits made by the owners are not nearly as great as",57,Eable Page The Number Is Modification Of The Argument Were Neces

281,Honourable Member For Dalley ( Mr Theo,"some honourable members would have us believe. Those who have the most to say on such matters appear to know the least about them.

These are essential to settlement, and until they are provided the areas I have mentioned must remain of little value. I agree with the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that a board should be appointed to hear appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I favour submitting these matters to laymen of wide experience in land valuation and dealing, rather than to judges in a court, for I think that justice is more likely to be done if practical men determine the issue than if such matters are left to lawyers. I disagree with the view of several honourable members opposite that tbe relief granted by this measure, enjoyed principally by moneyed men. In my opinion the concessions will benefit They will played the game iu even be advantageous to the worker, for TheyI approve of the concessions which been granted by this meaa fair thing that persons Many taxpayers have made complaints to me, but when I have advised them to take the matter into court they have said that tbey would not do so, for it might cost them two or three times the amount involved, to obtain a decision.

Income taxation is a much fairer method of obtaining revenue from the country. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), the Deputy Leader( Mr Scullin), and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Debate adjourned. Theodore), all gave reasons why the Government should continue to impose land taxation. The honourable member for Dalley mentioned four specific objects which the Labour party had in view when it introduced the first Land Tax Assessment Bill into this Parliament. They were: first, to prevent land monopoly; secondly, to break up large estates; thirdly, to secure to the Government a, certain part of the unearned increment in the value of the land in consequence of the expenditure of public money in constructing roads and railways and other developmental works; and, fourthly, to obtain revenue. I do not desire to discuss the constitutional aspect of the subject at length, but I submit that it was never intended that the Commonwealth Government should enter this field of taxation. In a time of emergency, such as of war, it is justifiable for a government to obtain revenue by auy means which are fair to all concerned. could impose a land tax which could be just as effective in preventing land monopoly as any such tax which the Commonwealth might impose. serious complaint that I have against land taxation is that it gives no consideration whatever to the man who is putting his land to the best. use. He is charged on the capital value of the land, and not upon its earning power. What has this Parliament done to improve the land values of Australia? We legislate for the welfare of the people :'.3 a whole. Certain powers were delegated to us by the States, but land development was not one of them. monwealth Government intends to take the unearned increment with respect to The sooner it does so the the land in the Federal Capital TerriThe policy of tory. with respect to the Northern Territory. We should be well advised to leave the Land tax is power to control land settlement and development in the hands of the States. I hope that this measure is only the forerunner of the good things to come from this Government, and that the 10 per cent, reduction now forecast will soon be followed by an entire vacation of the field of land taxation.

I am sure that to all honourable members this information will be of the most gratifying character. Last week, we had a discussion in this House upon the trouble which had arisen, and while in the heat of debate some members may have expressed strong views, I think that the desire of all of us was to see that we did not in any way prejudice the situation. We were merely trying to carry out what we thought was an obligation of this Parliament.

(By leave) -The information which the Prime Minister has conveyed to the House is very satisfactory. Nobody could be more pleased than I am to hear of the possible early termination of the dispute that has been in progress during the last two or three weeks.

Although we are not in possession of full particulars regarding what occurred at the conference, or the names of those who took part in it, I think that credit is due, not only to the court, but also to the disputes committee in Victoria, which took u^ this matter. This committee, although it was not a party to the dispute, and is one which is often much abused, got into communication with the contending parties and also with the court, and did its best to bring about a satisfactory result.

287,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [6.20],,61,Second Beading
288,Dr. Eable Page (Cowper,"Treacountry industries and industry generally by a reduction of direct taxation. This afternoon the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) quoted from a report which has recently been made to the Queensland Government by the Land Settlement Advisory Board. board is admitted to have made probably one of the most comprehensive and satisfactory examinations which have beeu made of the pastoral position in Queensland, and its conclusions, incidentally, are applicable to the rest of Australia. In its report, special stress is laid on the fact that if these industries which provide so much of 'the export wealth of Australia, are unduly handicapped by vexatious taxation or exorbitant rents, the immediate effect will be to paralyze and strangle them. The report shows conclusively that in the outback country instead of small areas being economical from the point of view of development and output, they are the reverse, and that to induce men with insufficient capital to settle on the land reduces the total output per sheep, lessens the rentals, and decreases the total production of the industry. The board made a strong plea for reductions of taxation in the outback portions of the country. That applies especially to that taxation which this Parliament some four years ago removed from Crown leaseholds. Certain honourable members today have referred to that action, and the Leader of the Opposition has taken some exception to certain remarks of the Prime Minister regarding Crown leaseholds. At that time the attitude of the Government was consistent. sired to repeal the taxation of Crown leaseholds for two reasons; first, that that tax interfered with State policy-and this report bears that out beyond disputeand secondly, that the industry could not carry this crushing load and that it was practically impossible to administer the tax. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) asked what portions of the tax had been collected. At that time there was in hand something like £690,000 of receipts on account of Crown leaseholds, and the proposal of the Government was to repeal that tax, retrospectively to 1917. It was then recognized that even if we did not Dr. Earle Page. repeal the tax we would collect very little more than we had already received. Parliament decided that the tax should be continued until 1923, and the Government made every effort to collect it. for Dalley( Mr Theodore) was prevented this afternoon from speaking on this subject. to a statement regarding the actual collection of arrears of land tax. order. I do not wish to, prevent this discussion provided that we can take part in it ; but I would point out that when the honourable member for DalJey( Mr Theodore) referred to the taxation of leaseholders this afternoon, you, Mr Speaker, informed him that he could not discuss that subject. Groom) I do not think so. I intervened while he was replying to an interjection. to a statement made by the honourable member for Yarra in connection with the judgment of the court, and with that object. I am making these preliminary observations. Up to June, 1924, we had been able to collect some £909,000. We have continued to collect that tax, but now find that we are in possession of £901,000, which is less, by £8,000, than the amount we had three years ago. That is due to the fact that a royal commission, of which Mr Duffy,'the secretary of the It said that it deLabour Council of Victoria, and Mr Warren Kerr were members, laid down certain lines of action. There have been up to the present, out. of a total of 2,578 Crown leases, some 1,875 cases re-valued, itself and a consequent reduction in tax of £887,000. collected since the 30th June, 1924? honourable member for Dalley was speaking this afternoon he charged the Treasurer with neglecting to collect arrears of taxation.

As a result of revaluations, we have £8,000 less in the Treasury to-day than we had in 1924. answer to a question the Treasurer stated that he had collected over £200,000 of taxes that were outstanding on the 30th June, 1924? the refunds have been greater than the collections. have been remitted had the Government had its way in 1923. been put to considerable trouble and inconvenience, and fought many actions in the court, the moneys in hand are less than they were in 1924. That is a position which I , as Treasurer, very much deplore, because with more money in the Treasury, we would have been able to make'greater reductions in taxation. First of all, the tax on departmental valuations amounted to over £2,000,000. There has been a revision of those valuations on the basis of the Royal Commission's report, with a consequent reduction in taxation of some £887,000. We have had those valuations tested before the court, and it g'ave a verdict against us on the facts. The honourable member for Yarra this afternoon suggested that the arithmetic of the judge-was at fault, but we obtained legal opinion to the effect that the judge had decided on the facts, and there was not the slightest chance of a successful appeal. We have found it necessary to establish the general principle of taxation and to proceed with other actions to ensure some basis that will bring to an end the complicated question of taxation of Crown leaseholds. I make that statement for the information of the honourable member for Yarra, and for honourable members generally. against the department for not appealing against the decision of the court. I merely discussed and criticized the judgment itself. I . agree that legally there could be no appeal. to fight many cases to make certain that we were able to collect this tax. Since the 30th June, 1927, as the result of the application of the new system of valuation, the deductions from the original assessments have amounted to £152,000. I wish now to deal at some length with the land tax itself, because the Opposition has suggested that the Government should 'not under any circumstances reduce that tax. The honourable member for Yarra said that there were two specific reasons for the tax, first, to break down large estates; and, secondly, to ensure that the unearned increment would return, in some degree, to the people of this country. The Government does not hold that view in regard to Federal Land Tax. We look upon it more as a means of obtaining revenue, and. although, incidentally, it may have brought about .a certain amount of subdivision, the Government considers that, as a means of subdivision, it is probably the crudest instrument ever devised in the history of mankind. The tax has to be paid out of income, so that it becomes a tax on income measured by relation to land value. From that point of view I wish to examine it, because I do not think it can be successfully contended that the land tax was originally imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. In .1911-12, the year in which it was first brought into operation there was a surplus in the Commonwealth Treasury of £1,890,000.",62,Second Beading

As a.revenue raising medium the Labour party has never regarded the land tax seriously. It has been regarded as an instrument of subdivision, and as such this Government considers it most clumsy, inefficient, inequitable, and almost useless. An analysis of the land tax returns shows that the bulk of the money is derived from the cities and towns. 1911-12, £525,455 was obtained from the towns and £919,805, or 64 per cent., from the country. In 1912-13, £575,871, or 39 per cent., was collected in the towns, and £S84,092, or 61 per cent., in the country ; in 1913-14, £605,933, or 40 per cent., in the towns and £899,S70, or 60 per cent., in the country. In the next few years the figures were disturbed because of the interposition of tax on Grown leaseholds, which brought the receipts from the country back to the earlier proportions, but by 1920-21, notwithstanding that the leasehold tax was still included in the total returns, the towns, were returning 42 per cent, and the country 58 per cent, of the total tax. In 1921-22, the towns returned 45 per cent, and the country 55 per cent., in 1922-23 the towns 46 per cent, and the country 54 per cent. In 1923-24, when the tax upon leaseholds was remitted, the towns yielded 51 per cent., or £1,042,000, as against 49 per cent., or £999,272, from the country. In 1924-25, the latest year for which I have been able to have the returns analyzed, not less than 55 per cent, of the total tax came from the towns and only 45 per cent, from the country. So that more than half of the revenue yielded by this tax, which was imposed largely for the purposes of sub-division, is derived from town and city lands. Whatever else may be said of the tax it is obvious that it will not bring about any further sub-division. will admit that it operates to the detriment of industry. If a factory occupies a piece of land worth £10,000 and because of the need for doubling the size of the works the company finds it necessary to buy another piece of land along/>»-. Marie Page. side at a cost of £10,000, because of"" the graduation and cumulative effect, of the tax, the company will pay in respect of the first block of land double theprevious tax. The tax on the second, piece of land also will be doubled, so that the enterprise will have to pay four timesas much tax as it did before the necessity for extending its operations arose. That, instance "" indicates very clearly that this tax really penalizes city industries. That is something we do not desire. .We are all anxious to see these industries expand, because asFor instance, in our total production from primary and secondary industries is increased our chance of correcting the adversetrade balance will be greatly improved. I turn now to the manner in wh.ch the tax operates. Section 99 of the Constitution providesThe Commonwealtli sliall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. It is constitutionally impossible for a Commonwealth tax to discriminate bet./een city and country lands. In any one State certain areas, by reason of quality of soil, situation, proximity to railways and ports, rainfall, &c, are much better suited for closer settlement than are others. But the federal land tax is an instrument which operates against the just and the unjust alike. It is impossible to discriminate between lands for any of those reasons; but the tax tends to break up the huge areas outback which are held in the only way in which they can return satisfactory rents to the Crown and produce income taxation. At the same time, it penalizes the highly developed areas close to the coast. The various State parliaments have recognized the necessity for discriminating between different areas In ; New South Wales, Mr Loughlin, a member of Mr Lang's Cabinet, introduced to Parliament a measure, the declared object of which was "" to impose a tax for the purpose of promoting agricultural settleEverybody ment and the subdivision of large estates."" He said definitely that, in his opinion, the land tax was essentially the prerogative of the States, because they could use it not only for taxation purposes, but also for policy purposes in a way not possible to the Federal Parliament. The New South Wales bill prescribed a minimum taxable value of £10,000. estates above that amount were to be taxed, but exemption was granted to lands within the western division, lands within the irrigation area-honorabl e members know how rapidly they acquire value and how few acres are necessary to bring a property under the operation of the federal land tax-Crown lands held for mining purposes, city lands, and land held for agricultural and dairying purposes to a reasonable extent, and lands suitable for grazing only. In addition, deductions of tax were allowed. If in any year a taxpayer put under cultivation a certain specified area he would obtain a deduction of the whole of his tax for the following year. If he put a smaller area under cultivation, the deduction would be proportionately reduced. If in any year a taxpayer sold or leased on share-farming conditions a certain specified percentage of. the land held by him he would obtain a deduction of the whole tax levied in the' following year. The deduction was also extended to a taxpayer who satisfied an advisory board that ho had made a bona fide attempt to sell or lease the specified area. Although it would be competent for a State to make such a law, it is quite beyond the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and, therefore, a federal land tax can be regarded as a very clumsy sub-divisional implement. I do not deny that it has accelerated to some extent"" the rate of subdivision, but we must not forget th at other factors were, and are, operating in the same direction-increasin g local taxation, the greater economic use to which lands can be put if subdivided and used for other purposes, and the death of the original holders. A thousand different causes operated to bring about subdivision before the federal land tax was imposed, and will continue to operate for thousands of years after this law has been relegated to oblivion. The Government, therefore, can only regard the land tax as one of the sources of direct revenue, and believes that great harm must result if it is not reduced -pari passu with other forms of direct taxation. At the same time we must try to remove anomalies, as this bill proposes to do, and to make its incidence as equitable as possible. In doing so we All should have regard to the danger of compelling an undue subdivision of country lands. The Queensland Land_ Settlement Advisory Board brought out that fact very clearlyBut, in seeking to obtain a widespread distribution of pastoral wealth amongst the people of the State, it is necessary to take care lest this dominating' influence strangle the industry and defeat the purpose it is striving to attain. That must be the result unless the requirements above enumerated are carefully considered. Economics cannot be ignored. The grazing industry, like other industries, must be conducted on a business basis. The undue subdivision of land would inevitably lead to1. A struggling class of Crown tenants always looking for relief whenever a dry season eventuates. This would cause chaos in land legislation ancl administration. 2. ^Difficulties as to finance, holdings being over-capitalized ancl representing doubtful security to financial institutions. 3. The depreciation of the standard of wool, inasmuch as the selectors could not maintain a sufficient number of breeding ewes to permit of culling, or have the neeessary capital to obtain good flock rams from time to time. 4. A decline in wool output, due to the depreciation of fleeces, and shrinkage in revenue all round. The same report included another paragraph, which I wish to place on recordA policy of high rents, inevitably, would hinder the development of the Crown lands of the State, and without eontiuued development the Government cannot expect increased revenue from the grazing industry. The primary function of the Lands 'Department is to secure land settlement, and then to administer its lands iu such a way ns w ill lead to the greatest development and the greatest production of which thc lands are capable. The collection of rents should be regarded as a secondary object. The Government cannot have high rents, high taxation, and development as well.

309,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [8.13],"I dois it arrived at ? We now have a decision by Judge Rich which is in complete conflict with the previous decision of the F u l l H i g h Court. Judge Rich, interpreting the law in the Jowett appeal case, saidFrom a process of ascertaining what the unimproved land as it would be improved under yproper conditions, is worth, and deducting the cost of improving it , you cannot find what the unimproved value would fetch. That is entirely in conflict with the rulings of the F u l l H i g h Court. Could we not, at the end of this clause, insert paragraphs reading something like thisThe commissioner may ascertain the unimproved value of the land by deducting the value of improvements from the improved value of the land. Where, in the opinion of the commissioner, tlie land was suitable for sub-division, its taxa fresh definition we should immediately able value may be obtained by ascertaining what the land would realize in allotments, less the expenses of the sale. There is no reason why we should not define the position specifically. Adverse decisions have been given against the Commissioner of Taxation with regard to the value of land that is suitable for subdivision. assessed the value of land for taxation purposes on its value if subdivided, less the cost of subdividing the land, it being in his opinion suitable for subdivision. Such lands were in city areas. Honourable, members know that there is a vast difference between the value of a large estate in the city when it is bought in one piece and when it is purchased after subdivision. I am of the opinion that tlie commissioner was, quite right in declaring that the value of the unimproved value of the land is the value that it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision, but the court held the reverse opinion. In another case, where it was a matter of purchasing land upon whicb to build soldiers' homes under the War Service Homes Abt, and in which the Commonwealth desired to resume at the value of thc whole block, the court ruled that tbe land must be paid for on the value which it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision. There are two conflicting decisions, both against the Government. insert the paragraphs which I have suggested at the end of the clause w i th which we are dealing it would clarify the position. surer) [ f . 2 0 ] I urge the honorable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) not to press his amendment on this clause. I consider that the right place in which to define unimproved land would be undersection 3 of the principal act, which setsout the definitions. Unimproved value ia there defined as meaning. . . . the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any), thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. A similar definition exists in practically all the State acts. If we adopted put ourselves out of line with the States. Our policy is to t r y to have our definitions uniform with State and municipal definitions, to reduce the cost of valuation. Our practice w i th regard to the City of Sydney has been to accept the municipal valuation as theofficial federal valuation. Section7 of the The commissioner has principal act is being amended by the clause which we are considering, and it seeks to bring the act into line with the accepted practice of the department. It was only when the commission on Crown leaseholds was examining the act that it was discovered that the actual wording of the act was not in consonance with the practice of the department. We are now endeavouring to rectify the anomaly.

313,I F The Treasurer Would Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [8.24],"Treasurer a matter affecting both improved and unimproved value, and one which has not, so far, had the cognizance pf the commissioner or his department. Recently, Australian pastoralists have sought the aid of scientific investigation for the betterment of their land. So far that betterment has been in the directiou of improving the pastures, by top dressing with superphosphates, and by the development of new pasture plants. In some cases that treatment has doubled the carrying capacity of the land. Under the present machinery of the act the pastoralist or grazier who undertakes sucb work, is unable to deduct the betterment from the improved price of the land brought about by his enterprise, apart from the annual deduction of the cost of the labour employed to effect the improvements. Thus the progressive man creates a higher valuation of his land for taxation purposes, merely for the benefit of the taxing master. I know of some holdings, particularly along the border of South Australia where "" l i g h t "" country should like to see a new paragraph added capable of carrying half a sheep to the acre has, by concentrated, up-to-dato methods, been so improved that it will now carry two sheep to the acre. I know that it is not possible for the Treasurer to give an undertaking immediately tu rectify the anomaly, but I trust that he and the Government will carefully consider the position, and allow the progressive pastoralist, grazier, or dairy farmer a fair and reasonable allowance on the betterment effected by his enterprise. member suggest that it should be a deduction from the ascertained unimproved value of the land ? not permit the Commissioner or his department to allow such a reduction unless, of course, he is able to give a ruling to that effect. improved value of land, it is assumed that no improvements have been made. act stands, the only allowance that can be made is in respect of the value of the improvements which, of course, include those out of sight, which are often very difficult to value. The lifting of timber out of the, soil of Australia has been a herculean task for which our landholders rarely receive sufficient allowance. Graziers, pastoralists and farmers should be given every consideration' in respect of the expenditure of money to improve their properties. The New Zealand dairy farmers and the small fatteners have been considered in this connection,: but w.e are be-* hind the sister dominion in these matters. I know that in some cases in New Zealand land is fertilized twice annually to improve it.

338,Mr West,"In some cases, the valusof those areas are held undoubtedly for speculative purposes, because they arc being put to no use to-day. The owners are waiting for the extension of railways and tramways so that the land can be subdivided into suburban blocks. In the meantime they should pay taxes on thereal value of the land as ascertained from time to time by the department. Under this clause we shall deliberately take from the commissioner the power to value that land except once in three years. it can be valued. -divided for home building purposes, the allotments are usually valued at less than £5,0(50, and are, therefore, free from land t&x. It is before they are subdivided ithat they should be assessed for taxation [purposes. the estate may be re-assessed. are completely subdivided. Two arguments in favour of the clause have been advanced, first, that. assessments at present are not made every year, and may not be made for five or six years, and secondly, that there are not sufficient valuers in the department to travel every year through Australia making reassessments. I admit that there are difficulties. too costly. an annual valuation, but why take that power from the Commissioner? I suggest that this is being done for no good and sound reason. The Treasurer argued that these re-valuations were costly and difficult,, and brought forth numerous protests. I suggest that there would be less protest if values were increased annually rather than every three years, when the accumulated increases in value would be taken into account. The Labour party favoured the retention of the present land tax rate, but this House has decided against that. ' It has affirmed the principle that there should be a general reduction in land tax. Let us accept that decision for the. time being. Surely we sbould not be prepared to lose £80,000 a year by placing a low valuation on some land, and the correct valuation on other land. One principle of taxation is that it should be equitable in its incidence. I submit that this loss of £80,000 a year cannot be justified. What has been wrong with the practice iu the past ? Not one word has been said by the Treasurer to indicate that the powers possessed by the Commissioner have been abused or have caused difficulty. For seventeen years this power has remained in the hands of the Commissioner, and now it is proposed to take it from him. Land assessments are to be made every three years, despite the fact that large areas of land in and around the cities are likely to increase enormously in value within a short period because of the extension of railways and tramways. The clause also provides for the abolition of the power of the Commissioner to make ru-assessments retrospective for two years. ber is entitled to his opinion, and I am also entitled to mine. The Commissioner is charged by the law to collect the taxes justly, and there is nothing good in the proposal to deprive him of the power to make re-assessments, although obvious mistakes may have been made by the taxpayers or the taxation assessors. Every business man would claim the right to send to a customer an amended account if a mistake had been made in the original. Two years is not a long period within which to re-assess land tax. The Income Tax Assessment Bil l allowed the Commissioner three years in which to reassess, and not one word of protest came from the honourable member for Wannon when the amending bill was before the committee. that. attention to the bill during the three days it was in committee, and I heard no such protest from the honourable member; certainly none came from the honourable member for Angas.

It is quite a common practice to make reassessments retrospective for two years; as a matter of fact, even that limitation has been responsible for the loss of a lot of revenue. The royal commission that inquired into the taxation of Crown leaseholds heard evidence from responsible men about the difficulties created by the limitation of two years. Treasurer proposes to abolish this retrospective power, although experience has demonstrated the need for it. The prof )Osal is unwarranted, and will mean a oss of revenue. If the relief were equally distributed over all taxpayers, it the department has sufficient experience might be included with the general reductions which are part of the Government's policy, but I am certain the Government will not say that it favours a reduction of taxation in respect of one section and not in respect of another. For the reasons I have mentioned, I shall vote against the clause. strongly object to the proposed curtailment of the Commissioner's powers, which hitherto have been exercised most satisfactorily. I have in mind two land transactions that indicate thc need for the power of re-assessment. The erection of the North Shore bridge in Sydney has led to a considerable increase in the values of adjacent land, and one family sold out its holding at a price four times as great as it would have received two or three years ago. The Commissioner should have power to collect taxation in respect of that unearned increment. Another family sold some houses and land at Darlinghurst, and one of the partners in the auctioneering firm of Hardy and Gorman said to me, "" If you had told me three months ago that this land would be sold for £103 a foot I would have laughed at you."" It was a Saturday afternoon sale. come within the scope of the tax. other than that which was sold. The proceeds of the sale amounted to £14,000, but I believe that if the value of the unsold land were added, the tax payable by the family would have been 6d. in the £1. It would be unwise to deprive the Commissioner of power to collect extra taxation in respect of land, the value of which has risen suddenly and considerably.

Why should the commissioner not have tbe power, as he has under the Income Tax Act, to go back over a period of three years and rectify the error ? Departments like this cannot be run properly unless extensive powers are given to the commissioner. No system of valuation can be completely satisfactory. Mistakes will inevitably occur even under the most capable officers. If it were posgree that it has cared for the rights of the sible to get the exact figures, we should probably learn that as much as £1,000,000 has been recovered by the department through tbe Commissioner being able to go back and make re-valuations. We should base measures of this kind upon what is a fair thing between the taxpayer and the State. We should not make any concession to any one. It is possible that vermin-proofing paddocks. The Comthere may be deliberate wrong-doing on the part of individuals, and we. should not allow them to escape their obligations.

Under this proposal there would be no way of dealing witb the position. vided for in the bill. It comes under the heading of evasions. ter would be well advised to accept tbe amendment as placed before the committee by the honourable member for Yarra, and allow the commissioner to investigate these matters from time to time. In connection with taxatiou matters, it is absolutely necessary that the Commissioner should have power at any time to rectify mistakes that might have been made. Tliat provision has been in operation for a long time, and why should we now make an amendment which will cost the Treasury £80,000? There is no justification, so far as I can see, for the Government's proposal. support the clause. I think that it is high time that some limit was placed upon the period during which the Commissioner of Taxation can review returns. The department has limited the period in which the taxpayer may lodge an appeal, and the time of the Commissiener should be limited also. A sense of justice should always be shown by the Government towards its citizens. The time given here is ample for the department to examine the returns properly. It is a serious thing for. citizens to feel in an unsettled condition due to the power of the Commissioner to review their valuation at any time whatsoever. I hope the Government will safeguard the rights of the citizens in that matter to the same dedepartment. I know of a cas.e in point, under the State taxation system in Western Australia, in which a judge of the court gave an interpretation of the Taxation Act"". One of the members of the State Parliament deducted expenditure in connection with wire netting, which he had bought for missioner disallowed the deduction. It was taken to the Chief Justice of of the act, and he upheld the contention of the taxpayer. Now the Commissioner refuses to allow taxpayers any review of their returns, and he absolutely refuses the man who appealed to the^ court any reassessment of his returns beyond the year in which the decision was given. But the act was not altered; the judge merely interpreted it. That is the ""kind of thing that creates a feeling of insecurity and injustice in the minds of citizens. Citizens are apt to say that if the department is going to play these tricks upon them they will see. what tricks they can play on the department. In the case to which I have referred the taxpayer has again carried the matter to tbe court, aud he has been granted the right to cue the department to 'secure justice. I think that this amendment is along the right lines. The citizen wants to know where he stands. The department will not go back for more than three, years in connection with the taxpayer's appeal, no matter how just the claim may be. Some sort of reciprocity should exist between the taxpayer and the department.

Jt is a well-known fact-and 1 can give illustrations of it-that where a new railstated by the Deputy-Leader of the Opway line is constructed, or a public utility is created, land values immediately rise. Everybody knows that land values increase where a new line is built, sometimes us soon as the line is authorized. Under this proposal, however, the department will not be allowed to re-value the land for taxation purposes even after a great increase in value has taken place, due to the expenditure of public money. What huge values, for instance, are going to be put ou to property adjacent to the great Murray Waters Scheme. In that area there has been great expenditure by three States and the Commonwealth combined. Millions of pounds have been, spent, and the value of the land has been increased by nearly £500,000. The electricity scheme, another public utility which has very extensive ramifications, has also added to the value of land. We are providing tliat the commissioner is to authorize only triennial valuations. Except in very exceptional circumstances he is debarred from making any other revaluation. ten years for a re-valuation in Canberra. analogous, as Canberra is a self-contained area. The one thing that reconciles me to Canberra is the perpetual leasehold _ system which obtains here. I should not ' be surprised if this Government, which is steeped in political iniquity, altered that system to freehold. This clause merely provides another method for the remission of taxation. Dr..

When the rich man comes along and makes a request to this Government his request is granted. Honourable members opposite are at the beck and call of the rich land-owners of Australia. As position ( Mr Scullin), this afternoon, if honourable members opposite evince a desire not to support the Ministry, their Leader threatens that he will relinquish his portfolio. The whole party opposite would be "" in the soup "" if he did, as they have not another leader in sight. This Government should husband every penny of its resources with a view to reducing our huge debt. Instead of that it is throwing away thousands of pounds in all directions. But, unfortunately, were I to spend my last ounce of strength and my last word in opposing this concession, I should create no more impression on the Government than I would on a desk. Honourable members opposite never dare to vote against the Government. They are dumb, driven cattle and always answer to the whip when it is cracked over their heads. The Treasurer stated that this concession will cost £80,000 a year. for two years. In three years the position will be all right again. when the Government loses £80,000 a year. We shall give away a very large sum over a number of years, and we are not in a position to afford it. This Government is liberal at the expense of the rank and file. It is continually handing out concessions to the wealthiest people of the land. This is merely one more gift in the long string of gifts given by this Government to the wealthy. If we had the time we could make up a very considerable list of gifts that have been made to the wealthy people of Australia at a time when Australia is distressfully situated. I am not a pessimist, but I object to the distribution of largesse to the wealthy when the burden of it has to be passed on to the already over-burdened We do rank and file.

The appointment of this board is long overdue, but the Leader of the Opposition has not grasped the reasons that have actuated the Treasurer in proposing it. For many years the taxpayers have laboured under a great disadvantage in that they have no right of appeal from the decisions of the commissioner except to the High Court. A large number of taxpayers interviewed the Treasurer and asked that some tribunal should be provided to adjust any differences that might arise between taxpayers and the commissioner. In asking for the appointment of a board of valuation they did not contemplate that they would be deprived of the right to go to the High Courti f they preferred. This matter affects farmers primarily, and unlike some other sections of the community, they are men of reason and sense. An eminent lawyer once said to me, ""Don't go to law, if you can avoid it . "" That is the farmer's view. Litigation, they know, is expensive, and they will not go to law if they can get Surely a board of this justice otherwise. I am entirely opposed to the federal land tax.

HutI hope that before long the Commonwealth Parliament will see fit to evacuate this field of taxation. This board will have duties to perform which, I maintain, will be much better performed by a board containing at least one practical member than is usually the case in High Court proceedings. It will have to thresh out matters which have not been thoroughly threshed out in the past. Complaints are made by farmers that when their assessments are reviewed by the commissioner, and when their cases go to the High Court, none of those who consider the matter have a proper conception of what unimproved value means. .That is not surprising.

Speaking as a practising solicitor, I can say that a taxpayer hesitates a long while before fighting the Governmeut, and it is only on an important principle that he will think of going to the High Court. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the assessment he has two choices: he can ask for it to be referred either to the Valuation Board or to thc High Court. He need not go to the High Court unless he pleases; he can have his appeal heard by the Valuation Board, and the decision of that board is final, subject only to an The definition set down in the act appeal to the High Court on a question of law.

The whole of section 44 K is to protect the interests of thc taxpayer. I think that is all we need really look to in the present instance.

416,Mr E. Riley (South Sydney) [10.49].,"understood that the bill was introduced to simplify the making of appeals, and that taxpayers, instead of having to go to the law courts might have matters settled by experts on a board created for that special purpose. Now, however, we find that instead of setting up a board with final powers, the lawyers want to give the right of going to the High Court, and, I suppose, of going from tbere to the Privy Council. There must be some finality-. But it is in keeping with the policy of the Government to create an-, other board. It has not created one so far this week, and I suppose it is time that something was done in that direction. Ministers appear to consider that it is time that another board was created. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put forward a common sense proposition, which has my support. We contend that the board appointed for this work should be the final court of appeal. appeal to the High Court except on a question of law. formation of any more boards, which are a menace to the country. [10.52] I was rather surprised tc hear the objection of the Leader of the Opposition to the clause as it stands. It seems to be sufficiently probable that a judge would follow the decision of the Valuation Board unless there were very good reason for doing otherwise. The evidence would have been before the Valuation Board, and the judge would naturally start off with a prejudice in favour of what the board had decided. I disagree with the honourable member's statement that no judge has any knowledge of land values. I know personally that there are some judges who have a very shrewd knowdedge of land values. Had the matter merely been one in which it was possible to clearly separate questions of fact from questions of law, it would have been simple, but there are questions of mixed fact and law. High Court, following on a decision by the Supreme Court, it was held that the sale value of a property was not necessarily the value of the land, but that the sale value could be very greatly increased by the terms that were granted in the conditions of sale. In other words, if land is sold for £10 an acre it may be worth only £8, but the conditions of sale which are granted may add to its capital value. I ask honourable members was that decision of the High Court on a question of law, or on a question of fact? Personally, I incline to the view that it was common sense applied to fact. It is obviously desirable that a court like that should decide the point, whether the sale value is the real value, or whether by altering the conditions of sale it may be made an unreal value. I suggest that the matter is not simple. I have no doubt that there are other cases in which law and fact are almost inextricably involved, and it seems to me to be sound that this matter should rest with an ultimate appeal to the High Court. After all, the taxpayer can form a reasonable an opinion as to whether it would be wise for him to go on fighting the case. I protest against the provided. The appeal may be either to the Valuation Board or the High Court, not to botli. on questions of law. There is no appeal from the valuation. under the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Yarra cannot have his objection treated as an appeal ou the question of valuation. I can see no flaw in my argument. If I am wrong, I hope that I shall be corrected by some honourable member. I suggest that these things are not easy to separate, and it is well that there should be a reference to the High Court just as there is to the other board. The point covered by the amendment seems to me to be perfectly clear. I feel quite sure that the honourable member for Some years ago, in the taken as to the intention of the amendment.

The argument of the honourable member for Yarra is that any court of legal jurisdiction is not necessarily the best authority to settle questions as its chairman a gentleman who would of valuation, and may often be the least desirable to go into such matters. Valuation must be left to experts. Wo doubt the Valuation Board would be selected because of the special knowledge of its members. Possibly the personnel would be a movable one. considering the valuation of country lands or city lands its personnel could be adjusted accordingly. As provision is made in. the new clause for the making of valuations on those terms, the honourable member for Yarra proposes that in paragraph b of this sub-clause, where the taxpayer is satisfied, he may request the Commissioner to treat his appeal as an appeal to the High Court, but only on matters other than those relating to valuation. . able, and will inflict no hardship on the taxpayer. appears to me that the Government has altogether overlooked the fact that it remodelled the whole provisions of the previous bill, and substituted section 44, which contains the procedure for appeal. It has clothed and furnished the valuation board with ample authority, provided deliberately for its constitution, and has gone to no end of trouble to perfect the new system-and then it deliberately .gives the taxpayer the right to avoid that board altogether. The giving of this choice will mean that we shall get nowhere. I submit that ample machinery is provided to protect the legal rights of both the Commissioner and the land-holder, for either party would be able to appeal to the High Court or the Supreme Court on any question excepting that of valuation. I should be thc last to take from a citizen the right of appeal on a question of law to the highest tribunal in the land; but it would be folly for us to set up this .expert valuation board and then permit a taxpayer or the Commissioner to go over its head to a court. The honourable member for Boothby said that the court would probably accept the valuation of the board ; but I point out that the ease would go to the court without heing submitted to the board. Seeing that the board will have give his whole time to the work, and as its othor members would be thoroughly competent valuers, we should not permit either party to disregard it. It should be the final authority on all questions of valuation. If the board were Question-That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted ( Mr SotrLinr's amendment) put.
