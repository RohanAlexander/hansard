To do so would not cause the Treasury any financial embarrassment, nor would it create any anomalies; in fact, it seems to me that it would remove an anomaly. I urge the Treasurer to give favorable consideration to the two requests that 1 have made. | a.ICi] -Whil e 1 do uot think that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr proposals. K. J. Harrison) would expect me to remember the names of the hospitals and institutions that are being granted a general exemption from sales tax, I am. able to inform him that all public hospitals and benevolent institutions, all homes for the aged and infirm, all industrial homes and asylums, all institutions for the deaf, dumb and 'blind, all Red Cross and hospital comfort committees, and also church missions performing social services will be exempt from sales tax in respect of goods they 'buy for use. The exemption now being made will also cover purchases made by hospital auxiliary committees for use in hospitals, and goods not specifically exempt acquired by contractors for the currying out of 'building contracts for public benevolent institutions. The list of exempt institutions compiled by the department is generally satisfactory to all concerned. In view of the almost infinite variety of institutions working for the alleviation of human suffering, it is not possible to frame a precise definition that will cover every kind of institution. 1 am glad that the honourable member for Wentworth referred to paragraph ah for it gives me the opportunity to dispel a misapprehension brought under my notice only this morning. There appears to be an idea that this paragraph will cover linotype machines, but that is not sn, and I should like the widest publicity io be given to this statement. The exemption provided in paragraph ah is not intended to 'benefit our so-called rich newspaper friends. The materials that go to make up linotype metal are taxable, but clearly it would be unfair to charge sales tax on the hard lead alloy that goes into the linotype metal every time it is used for the casting of new type. Quite early in the history of sales tax, this exemption was allowed because of the practical impossibility of administering the tu.\ otherwise, and it is only to clear up H legal doubt that this item has been included in the exemptions. Buti t is merely the type cast by a linotype machine and not the linotype machine itself, because that type is cast and remelted dozens of times a week. I can assure the honourable member for Went(Corio Treasurer) worth that stereotype for the production of music will be exempt under these -Speaking to the amendment moved by rho honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden), I take it that, in the first instance, this exemption has been provided to give effect to the principle the Government has adopted of assisting education by making educational facilities for the youth of this country, as fret' and unrestricted as possible, and accepting the declaration made by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that all educational requirements in tbe sense of their use for primary education are exempt from sales lax, I think we can take it that, irrespective of a school being owned or controlled or subsidized either by a State or the Commonwealth, any of its requisites should be free from this tax. is good, but is not applicable to this bill. gathered from the reply of the Treasurer to the honourable member for Melbourne was that sales tax does not apply, irrespective of the school where those requisites like-ar e intended for educational requirements, and irrespective of whether the school is financed by a subsidy, or by the Commonwealth or a State government. crimination been made in regard to technical education? tion. tion can be applied?

62,Mr Beasley,"What other descripTreasurer admits iu tlie first instanceno doubt based on the guiding principle of unrestricted educational that he should follow the practice of refraining from imposing sales tax on the requisites of primary schools, but he allows the tax to remain in the case of technical schools.. That requires some explanation, and it is not sufficient to dismiss it lightly. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has asked the reason for this discrimination, and ho should be supplied with an answer. The Treasurer stated that it would involve the revenue in a sum which he could not estimate. That is an unsatisfactory statement. As a rule when a Minister sets out to buttress his contentions, he can quote details and figures supplied by bis department, but on this occasion the Treasurer brushed aside the query with the simple statement that an unknown sum of money would be involved. I doubt whether, if the Treasurer were sitting on this side of the House, he would be content with such an indefinite reply. His approach to this subject was based on the wording of the amendment. Actually, the purpose of the honourable member who moved it is to deal solely with technical education. The Treasurer's attitude justifies one in examining the clauses of this bill and drawing attention to the many exemptions being made, such as rugs for sheep and pigs. Why preference has been given to rugs for sheep and pigs over technical educational facilities I do not .profess to understand. Apparently it will be a long time before the Government can consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Cook as ranking higher in importance than other requests that may be lodged from time to time. The Treasurer's reply does not break down the case that we have put up in this connection. Quite a number of denominations are engaging in the most valuable work of technical education. Tbe honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) referred to the hospital work,, and I endorse his remarks that every credit must be given to those who devote their lives and services, without thought of any remuneration whatever, to nursing the poor and the sick. Striking examples of this noble work can be quoted. But what they are doing in the hospitals is also being done in technical and primary education. If Mr Beasley. honourable members visit the poorest pari* of Sydney,, they wilL find a technical facilities-education being provided under exceptional difficulties. In order to obtain tools, scientific materials and other requisites, there is a struggle to save every penny. These institutions constantly seek our aid in conducting entertainments to provide equipment for the various, sections-plumbing , carpentering and others. They arc screwing and scraping, yet they receive no reward from the Government for the great services that they are rendering to this country and *o the poor of the community. We arc waging this fight on behalf of the poorer sections of the community, whose boys and girls are compelled to attend denominational schools, in many cases probably because these are nearest to their homos and they cannot afford the cost of transport to obtain education further afield. The discrimination practised in this matter is extraordinary, and has not so far been justified. I invite members of of all parties to dismiss the case made out by the Government. I believe that I have approached this matter in a reasonable frame of mind. I suggest that the Treasurer should further discuss it with the officers of the department and, should he realize the justice of our claim, take steps to make the proposed exemption general in its application. The honourable member has brushed us aside, and will not listen to our representations. I cannot admit that in this instance he has earned the credit which in the past we have been able to accord to him for his handling of the matters with which he has been entrusted. I again urge honourable members to see that denominational schools receive the same treatment in regard to sales tax. exemptions as those wk-ich are subsidized by the State. [3.32] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has sought to make out a case against me, based generally on the ground that I have attempted to brush this matter aside without adequate consideration, and almost, one might think, without reasonable courtesy to the mover of the amendment. I protest against that attitude. I have already made a reasoned reply to",16,Sales Tax Financialrelief
63,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer )the arguments advanced in support of the amendment. There are many aspects from which this proposal could he viewed. There is the educational aspect, and also the aspect of the proportion of government assistance which these schools receive. The honourable member for West Sydney, legitimately for his own purpose, has chosen to adopt the viewpoint of education. ally to regard the matter in this light:* There is an existing exemption in the cose of State schools. . From the administrative point of view certain embarrassment is felt in determining at times whether schools are State-maintained or are maintained by the parents of scholars. The Government is seeking to assist this limited class as well as to solve one of the administrative difficulties of the department. involved. by governments in Australia for purposes of education. has a certain amount of revenue that it can see its way to forgo. It has spread the loss over as wide and as justifiable a field as possible. That field happens to include a number of anomalies and administrative difficulties. Based on the very slender premise that this happens to have an educational flavour, the honourable member for West Sydney would make the exemption have a very wide application. cost? would cost. that as a valid argument; eloquent though the appeal of the honourable member may be, it seems inapposite in the circumstances. The whole subject of education is involved. I am perfectly certain that the perspicacity of the honorhas adopted a narrow and parochial outablo member for West Sydney and his friends is such that, having freed technical education from the incidence of the sales tax, they would extend their operations to cover the whole range of education. member for West Sydney with great respect, and know that he avails himself of every opportunity which arises. At the moment, because his purpose is thereby served, he is confining his atten[351' tion to technical education. I have not the slightest doubt 'that his next step would be to widen the scope of the exemptions to include primary and secondary education.

So long as boys and girls are trained to be respectable and efficient, where their education is obtained does not matter. The scope of technical education must be widened to enable training to be given that will fit youths for the struggle of life. There are no apprentices to-day, nor could any be absorbed in industry, because there is no room for them. Why does this Government, which a month or two ago professed its willingness to promote the welfare of the boys and girls of Australia, refuse to include certain schools in the proposed exemption' relating to technical education?

I am greatly concerned about tlie welfare of the youth of Australia. Travelling through different parts of New South Wales, I have come into contact with young men who, although possessing intermediate and leaving certificates, are engaged in sweeping gutters, and doing other work for which they are quite unsuitable. It is the duty to supply the needs of Australian youth. of both the Commonwealth and the States to provide money for every form of education. apply for the whole of the amount allocated by the Commonwealth for public works, the Commonwealth should devote the balance to the establishment of depots for the education of youths in secondary callings, in which they may make a comfortable living, and prove worthy citizens in the years to come. Sales tax and other burdens which are hindering technical schools should be retime to time for this purpose, periodical moved. Thousands of hoys are to-day merely eking out an existence on the meagre sum which they receive, and the hopelessness which they feel in regard to the future will be accentuated if they remain in that groove. the Treasurer will give serious considerasuch difficulty. It is astounding to me tion to the amendment, and will see his way to accept it even though it may involve some small loss of revenue. 1 hope that members of the committee Treasurer doubts me, let him investigate will not be side-tracked by the unwilling the position for himself; then he would promise extracted from tbe Treasurer never have the courage to proceed with ( Mr Casey) that he will give considerathis measure in its present form.

Treasurer and his friends are able to send In the series of speeches delivered by him their children to the great public school.* last night and to-day, he has made itand to the universities, but the children clear that, even when amending sales lax bills are before Parliament in the future, many other matters will receive consideration before this one. It is idle, therefore, for the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) to pretend that we ought to be satisfied with the promise of the Minister that the point involved in ing regard to the number of matterc which will receive preference over it , it for consideration in the present Parliament. The Treasurer sought to brush the one of small importance. I remind him that all educationists of repute are dwelling with particular emphasis on the need for more and more technical education. Those technical schools in Australia which are to be granted exemption from sales tax under tbe Government's provision are totally inadequate in number There is an acute shortage of accommodation in such schools, and the shortageThe States having failed to would be greater still, were it not for the various denominational schools. In some of the governmentschools, the congestion is so great that classes of 60, 70 and 80 children under one teacher are not uncommon. The private schools are finding it extremely difficult to carry on hecause of shortage of funds, and are driven to all kinds of shifts in an endeavour to get money. Competitions are held from appeals are made to the public and entertainments are organized by the school authorities. Now the Government proposes, like Bill Sykes, to grab from the private schools, by way of sales tax, the I hope that pennies which have been gathered with that any government should contemplate such a thing.

Apart from the government schools, there are very few institutions that give technical instruction, and if the Government was attempting to impose an amendment were agreed to, there would be no serious reduction of revenue. [4.4] -Some honourable members have lost sight of the real purpose of the exemption under discussion. Schools are entirely supported by State governments, and in a limited number of other cases the State governments make up the difference between the sum collected in fees and the total expenditure. Those are the technical schools to which this exemption is directed. If the Commonwealth Government charged sales tax on materials used by them, the State governments would have to make up a larger amount, and to the extent' that we impose sales or any other tax on the materials purchased by those schools we shall increase the liability of the States and benefit the Commonwealth. The relations I know one between the State and the Commonwealth governments are such that we are willing to step aside and relieve the State governments of liability to this tax. The representations in my mind are mainly those made by the Victorian Government. Honourable members opposite are on an emotional rather than a practical plane in expressing concern for the welfare of the children of Australia. I can assure them that the welfare of the working man is perfectly safe in the hands of the present Government. It is the working man, not the children, who pays tbe small amount of tax that may be involved under this measure. When the first Lyons Ministry came into power, it directed its efforts to the reduction of the burden of taxation on the man on the basic wage, and that policy has been pursued by the present Governreduced by 25 per cent, the average amount of sales tax paid by this section now as compared with the sum collected when it came into office. sales tax will be higher this year than in any previous year, except one. could, if he desired, state the reason for that.

It is -iiioinalous that Brisbane harbour works should be exempt from sales tax while works in connection with all the other harbours of the State are subject to it. The harbour boards of the various States are performing services for the benefit of not only the States in which they operate, but also the Commonwealth as a whole.

Strongly urge favorable consideration. 1 trust that the Treasurer will accede to 1 the entirely reasonable request of the conference. Our local governing bodies are doing valuable work for the whole community, and should not be called upon to pay sales tax. State instrumentalities are exempt from sales tax, and logically, local governing bodies should also be exempt from it. The lifting of this burden from tbe local governing bodies would make it possible for them to provide a good deal more employment, for the money now spent in sales tax could then be devoted to other purposes. As the people who reside in our big cities have suffered very greatly during the depression they should be given some consideration in this matter. Many property owners in various municipalities have been unable to pay thoir rates, and this has seriously reduced the revenue of the local governing bodies and curtailed their ability to provide employment. If the Government will accept my amendment the relief given to more than 1,000 municipalities and councils throughout Australia will be much appreciated. [4.37] -The submissions of both the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) and the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) are so similar that they admit of the same reasoning leave-temporaril y in reply.

The authorities involved include municipal and shire councils to the number of about 1,000; the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and other bodies .in charge of water works in Victoria, to the number of more than 100; the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board of Sydney and similar bodies in New South Wales and the other States; the various harbours boards and tramways boards and trusts, and like organizations; also fire brigade boards. Serious consideration has been given by the Government to the possibility of granting exemption from sales tax to all these instrumentalities; but I regret to say that so far this has not been found to be possible. The granting of such a comprehensive exemption as is desired, would involve a heavier decrease of revenue than the Government is able to incur. To accede to the request of either the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Denison would logically imply the granting j f similar exemption to all local governing bodies. I can promise, however, that the position will be very carefully watched and from time to time the Government will grant such relief as it is able to afford. -As exemption from sales tax has been granted to State instrumentalities it. seems unfair to discriminate against local governing bodies by denying them like relief. If State instrumentalities are enwhen moving the second reading of this titled to exemption so also are local governing bodies, for their work is very similar to that undertaken by many State governments. bodies obtain their revenue in almost the same way as the State, although different terms may be applied to the revenue and a slightly different procedure followed in collecting it. Many municipalities throughout Australia have experienced groat difficulties during the depression and have not yet recovered their normal position. This is due to the fact that so many property owners have been unable to pay their rates. The resultant loss of revenue has made it impossible for many municipalities to maintain their social services at a proper standard. No one can overestimate the importance of the social sei vices provided by our local governing bodies. Sanitation, for instance, is of vital concern to the health of the hundreds of thousands of people who live in city and suburban areas throughout the Commonwealth. It might even be said that no social service performed for the community is of greater importance than that undertaken by local governing bodies. If anything should impair the effectiveness of the sanitary service of a big city or its suburbs the health of every citizen would at once be endangered. Various Ministers have Sfiid at different times that the Government is anxious to lighten the burden of taxation on the people generally. I suggest that great relief could be given by granting local governing bodies exemption from sales tax. If .that were done, the services rendered by these bodies could be performed more efficiently, for more money would be available for the purpose. Every member who has had personal contact with aldermen and councillors knows that the gentlemen who fill these positions do invaluable work for the general community without fee or reward, and often incur considerable odium in discharging their duty courageously and fearlessly. The Government should therefore, in the interests of the whole community, do everything possible to make their work easier and more effective. realize that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), bill, stated that he did not propose to give consideration to any amendments moved in committee, because of the anomalies These local governing that it has been found arise, as a result, of decisions which the committee may make, and which have not received proper examination by the department. Nevertheless, I submit that this objection is not applicable in this instance. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) desires to exempt from sales tax, the equipment required by public instrumentalities for the carrying out of their ordinary services to the community. If there is one form of taxation more than another that is grudgingly paid by the people, it is the proportion of the rates which they pay to public trusts, boards or municipalities for 1 services, that becomes a source of",24,Paths

To me it appears ridiculous that this Government should be deriving revenue from the moneys expended by local governing bodies and raised from loans subscribed in the ordinary way and constituting a permanent charge on their administration. For one government to tax the revenue of another government is a vicious principle which is now recognized by the Commonwealth, and State governments are accordingly exempted from sales tax. But is it not conceivable that the corporation of the City of Melbourne is iii many respects as essential to the conas the next man for the reduction of taxatrol of Victorian affairs as the State Government itself? for one thing, carries out the maintenance of health services. In some places, ihe provision of water supplies is undertaken by public trusts. I consider that the amendment which the honourable member for Denison has moved is one which the Treasurer might appropriately -accept without contradicting the statement he made when moving the second reading of the bill. I know of countless instances where local government bodies, when purchasing equipment, have to pay sales tax, and that charge is most burdensome to the ratepayers. As the result of this imposition, they have to pay more than necessary for their communal requirements and consequently the operations of the municipality are restricted. The Commonwealth certainly gets some revenue out of it, but having regard to the general budgetary position, the Treasurer could afford to forego it. principle, I consider that the Commonwealth ought not to collect it, because it is, in fact, a double tax on the community. The ratepayers are taxed for Ihe capital outlay of their municipality in providing the essential services, and portion of that imposition goes to the Commonwealth Government. The only reasonable taxation which the Commonwealth should impose on citizens is on their individual lives. It is not right to tax them as members of a municiThe effect of this is to compel pality. It does not tax them in their organic relationship to the State, and it ought not to do it in respect of a statutory board established because the State delegates to it certain business which otherwise it would have to carry out for itself. As the State is immune from sales tax, it appears to me that any authority created by the State as its agency should likewise be immune. The principle is inescapable. [4.50] -If the remarks of the members of the Opposition were carried to their logical conclusion, of course all taxes are iniquitous.

In no instance have I received a reply. put that question to the Hobart Council1 through the honourable member now. I suggest that the reason why I have had no reply to my many requests is that eaeh municipality finds that the sales tax absorbs a microscopic portion of its rates.

I think it will bo found that if local governing bodies were asked to supply a list of the materials on which they now pay tax tions have 'waited on the Treasurer from time to time if they did not have a case to put up? to the local governing bodies, through the honourable member, to supply me with the information. Further, I would point out that in respect of local governing bodies, the Government announces in the budget its proposal to subsidize interest and sinking funds on their public works to the amount of £100,000. That is no mean amount. The total amount that the departmental officers calculate that a complete exemption from sales tax would mean, is about £100,000 a year, distributed over a large number of local governing bodies. scopic about £100,000 a year. 2,000 such bodies, some large, others small. The Government has framed this plan, to subsidize interest and sinking fund, so that it will come into operation this year, and it is not a charge on the budget for one year, but will probably remain for many years to come. Therefore, anything that the Treasury may fortuitously collect in sales tax from local but a uniform sales tax, with every pergoverning bodies, on the average, will be amply repaid to them under the proposals of the 'Government. listened with interest to the remarks of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), aud I must confess that I am not at all impressed with the view that he has expressed. If the amount of sales tax involved is microscopic, then the sum involved an the Commonwealth grant to municipal bodies must also be minute. The principle cuts both ways. I contend that the requests from the municipal conference at Launceston are soundly based, and are not to be lightly ignored. While it may be a matter of expedience for the Government to continue to collect sales tax, I suggest that there are other considerations that must be taken into account, and accordingly I support the amendment. In regard to the Treasurer's challenge to local governing bodies, I shall make inquiries, because this raises an interesting position. Even if, as the Treasurer says, the payments of sales 'tax by the local governing bodies the deputaare microscopically small and the proposed exemption would not result in a reduction of rates, it would, nevertheless, give them a great opportunity to employ more labour, and that is au important consideration for municipal councils. All the time they are faced with the problem of finding employment for those who are unfortunately out of work in their districts. I support the request made for the removal of this imposition. objection to this provision is that it. is taxation levied by a major authority, th* Federal Government, upon a minor taxing authority, such as a local governing body. .The Government has rocognized that there is an objection to that principle, and has granted an exemption to the several State governments. There is no doubt that, if that principle were carried to its logical conclusion the same exemption would be extended to all bodies which impose taxes on the public. But in connection with the sales tax it is impossible to be logical when any exemptions are being made. Exery exemption granted creates a new anomaly. If -we were to act quite impartially to all sections, there would be no exemptions, son paying it, as obtains in some other countries. We have made 3ome departure from the rule by granting many exemptions, but generally the attempt has been made to follow the principle that exemptions should be made when hardship occurs. A new set of exemptions is brought forward every year, and there is competition to decide what claimants are most deserving of consideration on the score of hardship. Applying that principle, municipalities cannot very well be placed at the head of the list. Admittedly their revenues have 'been depleted, but not nearly to the extent of the revenues of the land owners. Much as we should like to support the requests of municipalities in our electorates, we must recogn ze that : others have stronger claims; and as the",26,Paths

[5.J.J -The .argument adduced by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) may apply in some districts, but it certain ly does not in. others. The municipalities that have experienced the greatest difficulty throughout the depression are those that have had to enlarge their works programmes substantially in order to provide relief for unemployment. Three poor municipalities in my electorate are Williamstown, Port Melbourne, and South Melbourne. During the last five years, these have kept in employment an army of breadwinners whom they would not employ in good times. Had they not done so the shopkeepers and 'business people generally of the district would have become insolvent. It is paradoxical that the Commonwealth should tax these bodies on money loaned to them through the governments of the States for the relief of unemployment. It is wrong to impose a tax on materials used by municipalities upon works which, but for the existence of unemployment, they would not undertake at present. time ago I wrote to the Treasurer requesting the exemption of certain commodities used by tbe South Melbourne council. Some of those commodities are included in the list that we now have before us, but I am not sure how many remain, and I urge the honourable gentleman to give further relief when the tax is again being reviewed. Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has shown on other occasions to consider the views expressed by honourable members on the subject of taxation. I hope that his refusal to give favorable consideration to the amendment of the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) is not his last word. The action of that honourable member was dictated by the receipt of an urgent telegram from the Hobart and Launceston councils. He and the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), in voicing the views of those councils, have put the case of local authorities generally throughout Australia. It has been rightly said that municipal councils are agents of State governments in respect of matters connected with local government that have been delegated to them legislatively. The work of the State governments frequently approaches very close to that of local governing bodies, aud in some cases there is overlapping. Yet the State governments are exempt from the sales tax, while the local authorities are obliged to pay it. Why should not this concession apply equally? Those who have any knowledge of the financial position of local governing bodies throughout Australia are aware that, generally speaking, they are in an impecunious condition. In country districts thousands of primary producers, because of the steep fall of the prices of the'r products, have been unable to meet their liabilities in regard to municipal rates. The same may be said of a large number of unemployed in the cities. It is wrong of the central government, with a bulging treasury and a surplus at the end of every financial year, to assume the right to impose taxes upon the less fortunate local governing bodies which are doing the domestic work of the nation, and employing many thousands of persons upon relief works. I know it is said that this is not a big tax. That being so, the Some concession asked for is not substantial from the point of view of the Commonwealth, although it may mean much to impecunious local authorities who find it difficult to meet their administrative costs. Some local authorities have hardly sufficient surplus revenue to pay the salaries of clerks, engineers and foremen. Quite a number of these bodies throughout Australia have assumed important responsibilities in the carrying out of a willingness water supply, sewerage and electric light schemes, which give employment to thousands of persons. We should lighten rather than increase their'burdens. The Treasurer has claimed that he cannot accede to the request which has been made, because the obligations of the Federal Government 'have to be met. Its revenues would not suffer greatly. In the last financial year it exacted, by means of the sales tax, £8,500,000. This year it expects to receive an additional £300,000, and that will be £400,000 greater than the receipts in 1932-33. This small concession could therefore be made without imperilling budget equilibrium. Honourable members should support the very good case",27,Paths

I undertake to obtain it within a week if he will postpone the consideration of the matter for that period. This grievance of local governing bodies is of long standing. The Hobart municipality has carried out a lot of work for the relief of unemployment, and has been greatly inconvenienced by the high rate of interest. We are not for the moment concerned with interest rates, but any concession, even in regard to sales tax, would be of great help. On the Treasurer's own admission,, the amount involved would not average more than about £50 for each municipality throughout the Commonwealth. rough one. £100,000 would be involved. well aware that city ratepayers have been very severely hit by the depression.

In the rural industries, sales tax has been remitted on every conceivable item of machinery that may be required, and even on the covers for such machinery. I do not object to that, but I maintain that we should be impartial and should extend a similar exemption to tools of trade purchased by workers in other industries. Besides coal-miners working On contract who must buy their own tools, others in the same position are tributers working in metalliferous mines such as those at BrokenH ill and elsewhere. No doubt, the Treasurer ( Mr boots? Casey) will say that the tools of trade are already exempt from tax, but 1 maintain that, in fact, it is not so. I wish the items to be specified in the schedule, so that the miners will know that when they buy tools from the storekeeper they will not have to pay sales tax on them. Mining work causes particularly hard wear on boots. These are soon destroyed by the highly-mineralized water through which miners frequently have to walk. Gum-boots and other kinds of footwear are usually left at the mines, and should be regarded as tools of trade. The coarse moleskin and dungaree trousers worn by miners fall within the same category. If it is considered desirable to exempt covers for traction engines and rugs used on horses, pigs, and cows, the boots and clothing of miners should also be free of tax. I am asking for consideration for a section of the community that has been seriously affected by the slump in the mining industry. The5 .per cent, tax on shovels, picks, and' drills imposes a heavy burden on miners. As the result of representations previously made the impost has already been removed from explosives used by miners, and, to be logical, we should exempt their tools of trade, seeing that sales of tools used in the rural industries are not taxed. [5.35] -The Hunter( Mr James) suggests exempto by him are already free from the tax. tion from the tax of miners' boots and clothing and tools of trade. He has foreact the mining requisites that are exempt, cast some of the remarks I am about to so that those concerned can read the list make, but not the most important of for themselves? them. He was quite right in saying thai the tools mentioned by him are already framed in general terms, and therefore exempt from the tax, if bought for mining purposes. Of course, when coal mining and other companies buy tools for mining purposes they are free of tax. The companies can then issue or sell them to their employees free of tax. If a local storekeeper sells these tools for mining purposes, and the purchaser signs a slip of paper indicating that they are bought for those purposes, he should be able to obtain them at prices which do not include the tax. If the storekeeper has already paid sales tax on them to the wholesaler, he can have it refunded by the wholesaler the moment of tools of trade only. As far as the Government has been able to make provision for this relief it has done so completely. Nothing more could be done in that direction, unless we exempted all such tools for all purposes. As the honourable member has asked to be supplied with a list of the miners', tools to which the exemption applies, I shall convey that information to him by letter, and he can give it full publicity. Similar details will be furnished to any other honourable member who makes a written application for them. The experience of the department and the Government, is that it is not practicable to exempt from the tax goods in general use by the whole community. Where an exemption has been granted in respect of an article used for a certain purpose, it has soon been found impossible to police it, and, in order to make the administration effective, it has been found necessary to remove the limitation and to make the exemption of that article good for all purposes. That is why hoots and clothing used for specific purposes cannot be exempted. The amount of tax paid by individuals for these goods must be very small, as is also the amount of tax paid by any man who is in receipt of about' the basic wage. honourable member for Hunter that most of the articles referred",29,Pairs

In some districts (miners' boots have copper nails, and in other localities rag or rubber soles are worn. The Government is apposed to any extension of the practice of exempting articles required for specific purposes, because inevitably the department would soon be forced to make the exemptions apply to the whole range of those goods, and this would entail a great loss of revenue. I hope that the honourable member will"" not press the amendment. ft was stated by the Treasurer ( Mr tax on the article. Casey) that a miner, on purchasing a shovel from a storekeeper, could avoid the payment of sales tax by signing a declaration that the article was to be used for mining purposes. Is that concession available to the large number of prospectors who are to be found throughout Western Australia, and who have to live for years merely on "" grub-stakes ""? A shovel which could formerly be purchased for 3s. fid. or 4s. now costs up to 7s. 6d. or Ss., and the amount of sales tax involved, though apparently small, is n serious matter to the struggling prospector. I presume that tools purchased by these men would be exempt from the tax. whittle away the revenue required hy the Government, but I wish to know whether the axes used by timber getters carry the tajc. Thousands of men are employed in the timber districts of Western Australia, and if the axes and adzes used by them are not already on the exempt list they should be brought within the same category as shovels. As the Treasurer knows, no doubt, metalliferous miners wear helmets for protection in the event of a fall of stone. This headgear, which is similar to that worn by the Victorian police, was first used at Mount Tsa. The use of miners' helmets is an American idea and is adopted largely at Wiluna and in some instances on the Golden Mile. of immense service in the protection of men from the danger of falls of earth or coal. The minors have to purchase the hats and they are of a class which, obviously, cannot be worn outside of the mine. In these circumstances, the Treasurer might consider it worthwhile inquiring into the amount of tax collected in respect of these goods in order to ascertain if it is worthwhile continuing to exact it. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has stated that the mining equipment which the mine-owners buy in bulk for re-sale to the miner, such as shovels, picks, &c, are exempt from sales tax, and that if the miner buys his pick or shovel from a storekeeper and signs a docket, the storekeeper can claim exemption from sales to he may secure a refund of the tax; but in many cases it is not worth his while to do so. with the storekeeper as to whether or not the miner gets the exemption. from the wholesaler goods for mining purposes free of tax; but if he buys for general stock for all purposes, he has to pay the tax. When he sells to an individual miner goods for mining purposes out of general stock, he can, if he cares to do so, get a rebate for the amount of tax paid, to the wholesaler. left to the storekeeper to please himself whether or not he applies for a rebate of the tax. In any case, however, if exemption can be granted in respect of tools of trade, it should just as easily be made to apply to helmets, boots, and, if necessary, clothing for use in the mines. The miner could sign a docket for one thing as for another. Miners are now experimenting with various kinds of helmets to protect them, from falls of earth or coal, and as compensation has to be paid for injuries received from such falls, naturally the management will endeavour to obtain the.most suitable kind of helmet, and .it is quite possible thatlater their use may be made compulsory. Are these helmets to be classed as hats? These helmets aro I do not think the Treasurer would suggest that men would use them for other than work in the mine.

At the present time, bathing facilities are provided at the mines and the miners change their clothes on commencing and finishing work, discarding their working clothes at the mine. To all intents and purposes, this clothing is part and parcel of their equipment, as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has contended. I supported the exemption from .sales tax of the requirements of rural industries which were in a precarious condition; but to-day nobody can say that the miners are not in a more precarious condition than those engaged in rural industries. All honourable members should be prepared to support us in asking for these exemptions, which to the Government mean so little, but to tlie men concerned, mean so much. honourable member any conception of what an impost of 6d., Is. or Is. 6d. on those articles might mean to tiie miners in the circumstances in which they find themselves to-day? dustry was flourishing, miners were too free with their money to worry about such small amounts; but, to-day, their position is such that they must take care of every penny. There are two widely-accepted canons-taxatio n should fall upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it ; and man was not created for the State, the State was created for manfor the purpose of making life better for him. There should be no hesitation in granting the exemptions for which we ask, and I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment as drafted. If he is not able to do so, I hope at least he will give an undertaking that clothing, hoots and helmets used in mining operations will be classed as tools of trade, and that exemption of these goods from tax will not be left to the discretion of the storekeeper. If the Treasurer will go as far as that, honourable members on this side will be satisfied. port the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr ally for mining purposes, are manufac-fames). exemptions already granted to the rural industries, the Government has adopted the principle of giving relief where it is Tho same remarks apply needed. I suggest that it should apply the same principle in connection with the mining industry. In the past, the Government seems to have been actuated by a desire to afford relief to primary industries. Honourable members on this side say that the workers in industries whose incomes are small are also entitled to receive some concessions. I am pleased, however, to accept the assurance of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) that implements used by miners will be free of sales tax. the miners have to make direct application for a refund of tax. If , however, the Treasurer can give an assurance that other items such as boots and specialized clothing are also covered by the general exemption, honourable menibei'S on this Has any side will be quite satisfied. Whether boots are soled with rag soles and whether they contain copper tacks or not should make no difference; miners do not use them for purposes other than in the purWhen the mining insuit of their calling. I do not think it is right to provide that sales tax exemption can be secured only if the implements used by the miners are purchased from the mining companies. The miner should be able to get full benefit of exemption when he buys from the local storekeeper. The Treasurer must recognize the fact that miners prefer to purchase their requirements at the local 3tore rather than from the mine-owners, who might exploit them in the prices charged. I could quite understand the refusal of the Treasurer to include boots in the exemption if they could be used for any purposes other than mining, because, if that were so, a man would only need to send a miner friend along to buy his boots for him, and he would secure an exemption from the payment of the tax. But these boots conld be used for mining operations only. The miners are working in one of the most hazardous industries in this country, and the Government should be prepared to accept the amendment.

While a miner may need a particular type of hat Or helmet to protect his head from overhanging rock, it can hardly be said that he needs a particular kind of boot to protect his feet. All artisans wear heavy boots when at work, and it would be impossible to differentiate between miners' boots and the boots of workers in other industries and callings. There is a radical difference between miners' helmets and miners' boots. I shall see that the special helmets, made for and used by miners, are granted exemption. I am glad to say, in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green), that axes are completely free of sales tax. not at all satisfied with the reply of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey). The tools of trade to which I directed attention are not specified in the list of exempt goods. I spoke of picks, shovels, drills, and machines. By machines I meant handboring machines. The machines driven hy electrical or compressed air power are provided %y the mine-owners, and are exempt; but the hand machines that I have in mind are provided by the miners themselves, and are not exempt. It is not fair that power machines should be exempt, while the hand machines should be taxed. The Treasurer has said, in effect, that if the miners request exemption for these tools, '.the shopkeeper can apply for it, and it will be granted.; but probably the outlay in stamps and other expenses to get the exemption would be as much as the tax itself. At any rate,. considerable trouble 'would be experienced in obtaining the exemption. I protest against the unfairness of exempting a hoe used by a farmer, when a shovel used by a miner, and costing three times as much as a hoe, is not exempt. The Government has shown clearly that it is prepared to exempt Ihe tools of trade bought by individual farmers., but not those bought by individual miners, although both miners and farmers are primary producers. All the equipment purchased by the mine owners is exempt, but practically nothing purchased by the miners themselves is free of the tax 'except explosives. About three-quarters of the items in the list of exempt goods tabled with this bill arc used almost exclusively by rural workers. for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) is favorable to the exemption of the tools of trade of the farmers, but not those of the miners. Where is his consistency? It is grossly unfair that, while even a cover for a traction engine is exempt, the wearing apparel required by men who delve thousands of feet in the earth is subjected to tax. I can see no difficulty in adequately describing boots for miners, moleskin trousers, and other special articles of attire that miners need. The miners do not wear clothing of this kind in their homes. In most cases they take it to the mine an'd leave it there until it is worn out. That is certainly the case with pit boots and miners' helmets. Probably the only time a miner's helmet or a pair of pit boots is seen in the miner's home is when they are brought new from the shop, and are about to be taken to the mine. Miners need special boots to protect their feet, for quite often the eoal seams are so uneven and the ground so treacherous that coal bursts from the sides of the seams without warning, and falls on the workers' limbs. It is reasonable, therefore, that we should ask for exemption for the special footwear that is needed to protect a miner's legs and feet. Miners' boots are made of special mineral leather., and are iron-shod and liberally provided with hob-nails, and I cannot understand why difficulty should be found in describing them with sufficient accuracy -to justify their inclusion in the list of exempt goods. It is deplorable that we have to .plead with the Government to Obtain-any concession whatever for the workers.

140,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [8.7],"Iin revenue to the Commonwealth Government, appears to me to be an amazing example of the excessive manner in which the product of an industry has to pay taxes to the Government, as compared with the amount that it disburses in wages and salaries. But this industry does more than employ Australian people; it is a substantial purchaser of Australian primary products. As a matter of fact, the materials used in the year under review were valued at £804,000. To the representatives of the primary producers in this chamber, I point out that, of that sum of money, the flour consumed was 19,S62 tons, worth £201,000, and the sugar required was 114,204 cwt., valued at £183,174. In addition, of course, a considerable quantity of Australian milk is used in the manufacture of biscuits. Apart from providing wages, employment and taxation, and being a substantial purchaser of Australian primary products, this industry was also a contributory factor towards the progress in manufacture that Australia has made in recent years. It spends with other secondary industries £123,000 for wrappers, containers and other services. The power, light, and fuel account which it incurred in 1933-34 was £57,000. It was implicit in this act from the commencement, that basic foods would not be taxed unless it was imperative for revenue purposes to do so. Consequently, many basic foods were exempted from sales tax, even in the very difficult year in which the imposition was originated, and I fail to see the distinction between biscuits as a food for the community and other types of food which are at present outside the scope of the tax. I pint this case quite simply to th» committee without any attempt to adorn the tale. As far as possible, it is economically wise to relieve an industry of this type from taxation. I shall conclude with a reference to stuffs has caused more trouble than most the budget statement of the Treasurer other matters. If the Treasurer would ( Mr Casey), in which he alluded to the accept the suggestion to exempt biscuits, buoyancy of the finances and calculated he would have the support of an overthat there will be a surplus for this year. whelming majority of the people of AusThe Government is unwise to tell the tralia. House repeatedly how satisfactorily tlie country has turned numerous corners while the argument is flatly contradicted by the maintenance of heavy taxes upon Mr Curtin. industries which are desirable, not only because they furnish a market for other industries and thus play their part iu the general structure of Australia's economy, but also because they definitely and directly employ young men am! women. Large numbers of females and youths are engaged in the manufacture of biscuits and the industry is not one for the aged. I suggest to the Treasurer thai he relax his ultimatum to the committee that he cannot accept proposed amendments. My proposal is entirely justified, and I hope that he will make an exception in this case. Great difficulties arise when one class of commodity is exempted from the sale tax, for it brings an appeal from associated interests for a similar concession. I realize that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) is confronted with the great task of arranging a satisfactory budgetary position, and I consider that he is carrying out his duty with great credit to himself. If he errs, it is on the side of caution, and that is a matter favourably regarded in financial circles. But having studied the sales tax estimates, I suggest tha' there will be a substantial increase in this year's return as a result of the improved trade position in Australia, and 1 therefore believe that biscuits could very well be added to the list of exemptions, without any great disadvantage tn the budgetary position. The figures that I have before me show that the value of the trade in biscuits generally in Australia is more than £2,500,000 per annum, which is equal to 7s. 6d. a head. Biscuits are consumed in every Australian home, and can, therefore, be regarded as a part of the national diet. A further reason for the granting of exemption from sales tax is that biscuits are subject to the flour tax. The history of the world shows that the taxing of food[8.16] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has moved an amendment for the exemption of biscuits as a whole,",34,Parkhill The Amendment Negatived
141,Mr Jennings (Watson) [8.14],,35,Parkhill The Amendment Negatived
142,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer )and has stated that the loss to the revenue would amount to about £100,000 per annum. It would possibly be less than i hat-betwee n £80,000 and £100,000. The honourable gentleman has argued that biscuits are a basic food, and in order to substantiate his case has placed the value nf the production upon a wholesale basis, at something less than £2,000,000 a year. The honourable member for Watson( Mr vernment has never been able to see its Jennings), presumably on a retail basis, has made the figure higher than that. But whichever is chosen, the average consumption per capila is only a few shillings per annum. That argument, I should think, is not calculated to impress honourable members with the fact that biscuits are a basic item of food. As a matter of fact the view of the Government is that relatively they are a luxury item; otherwise they would figure more largely in the food regimen of the people generally. The honourable gentleman has also said that he cannot see any distinction between biscuits and other foods that are already exempt under the .sales tax legislation. I can see a very great deal of difference. The consumption per capita per annum of other items of food amount's to several pounds. There Hre a number of items, the exemption of which the Government would seriously consider before this. Already, quite a wide range of biscuits which are necessary mainly for children and invalids, arc exempt. They include milk arrowroot, baby rice, Allenbury's diabetic rusks, malted rusks, Caillard's biscuits, gluten biscuits, malto oven milk, Mellin's food, and Ovaltine rusks. Mr E. F. HARRISON -Ho w does the Treasurer classify cakes and pastry, which are exempt? producers, who are merely on the verge of making a living. Many other considerations also enter into that case. This measure provides for the exemption of shortbread biscuits, which represent a half-way house between the product of pastry cooks and that of the big biscuit manufacturers. The loss of revenue in that connection is estimated at something like £7,000. On the average, the amount of sales tax is equal to about i d . per lb. of biscuits sold. I do not believe that the removal of the tax would' lead to greater consumption or a reduction of the price, or that the consumption was appreciably lessened when the tax was first imposed a few years ago. That is the case which the Government makes out for its exclusion of biscuits from the list of exemptions. The matter has been raised many times within the. last three or four years, but the Goway to grant a complete exemption. It believes that it has gone as far as is possible and necessary. I regret that the amendment cannot be accepted. port the amendment, even though shortbread biscuits arc included in' the list of exemptions. I cannot understand why they should be free from the tax and ordinary biscuits should be subject to it. They are the highest grade of biscuit on the market. Joyce's and Arnott's cheap grade of biscuits are to be found in the home of every worker. The midday meal of many workers consists of biscuits, which they consider provide them with necessary food values without reliance upon meat. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) claims that biscuits are a luxury. I have never previously heard that contention put forward. What does the honourable gentleman expect that the workers should eat in order to live? Should they follow the advice of a Queen of France, who said that the workers of that country should eat grass? It appears to me that the honourable gentleman has more consideration for animals than for human beings. Woolworth's, Cole's, and other cheap stores in Sydney and Melbourne sell packages of biscuits for 3£d., and their daily turnover amounts to many gross. Their clients are not drawn from Pott's Point and Toorak. It would appear that the Treasurer is determined that there shall he no increase of the £300,000 which he has decided shall be remitted.

Members of the Country party are continually urging that assistbiscuits are not used only as invalid food; ance be given to the primary producers. That section of the community has benefited most from the exemptions which have been made, while the workers have received no consideration. The attitude adopted by the Country party is that, unless its claims are met it will remove the Government from office. night, during the second-reading debate, I clearly stated where I stand in this mattralian industry which uses Australian ter. I intend to vote for the amendment, which I consider is a step in the right direction. The biscuit industry has been penalized by having to bear the flour tax as well as the sales tax; and recently, it received a further setback when, under the latest tariff schedule, the duty on imported biscuits was reduced. The biscuit industry has suffered a severe shock as a result of these various exactions, and this is a golden opportunity for the Government to reconsider its position with a view to affording the relief which is so much needed. The Treasurer himself has stressed the importance of the industry which is worth nearly £2,000,000 a year to Australia. I do not think it is too much to hope that we should be able to manufacture in Australia all the biscuits we require. At the present time pastry, cakes and buns are exempt from sales tax, so why should we not extend the exemption to biscuits? Big firms like Sargent's and Adams, which manufacture cakes, have not to pay sales tax, and the manufacturers of biscuits should not be placed in a worse position. [8.33] I intend to vote for the amendment. asked why it is proposed to keep the tax upon certain classes of biscuits, when it has been already remitted upon the more expensive kinds. course, is that the cheaper biscuits are used in the greatest quantity, and therefore provide more revenue by way of sales tax. Everything the workers use must be taxed because those are the things which, by their very quantity, yield the most revenue. As I have said, sales tax has been removed from the more expensive lines of-biscuits, such as are suitable for infants and invalids, but such they are a luxury food as well. If it is right that a luxury food should be free of taxation, there can be no just argument for continuing to tax the cheaper kinds of biscuits used by the workers, especially as the Government can well afford to make the remission. Another argument in favour of the granting of this exemption is that biscuit manufacturing is an important Ausraw materials. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that an extra -Jd. per lb. on the price of biscuits would beneither here nor there, but I point out to him that this halfpenny may turn the balance in favour of imported biscuits on which the duty was recently reduced. Australian biscuit manufacturers have improved their factories by the installation of the most modern machinery and the Government rewards them by. removing the tariff protection which they formerly enjoyed. imported biscuits as well as on those locally manufactured. there is a biscuit factory run by Swallow and Ariell in which hundreds of young men and women are employed. They reside in the district, and it would be a serious thing if anything were done to injure the industry, and thus jeopardize their employment. I remind the Treasurer also that there are thousands of children who must be given biscuits as a food, and when the parents ai*e unable to afford the best biscuits, the cheaper kind, which are covered hy this amendment, are used instead. intend to support the amendment. Biscuits are used in practically every home to-day, particularly the cheaper lines.

The Treasurer's accusation that the Labour party is concerned for the wealthy biscuit manufacturers 13 absurd. Honourable members on this side are concerned with the consumers. It is perfectly true that there is a biscuit factory in the Fremantle electorate; I make no apologies for it ; it is a most useful industry, and it sells biscuits in other States as well as in Western Australia. I assure, the honourable member that uo representations of any sort have been made to me by any biscuit manufacturer in Western Australia regarding the sales removed in the interests of biscuit manufacturers only. I am concerned also in the interests of the employees and of a number of other persons who would be When discussing employed if the biscuit industry could be developed and expanded, through increased consumption of its products. In this case they When I deal with taxation, my primary consideration is with taxpayers who, in this class of taxation, are paying over £8,000,000 to the Commonwealth, and who, we know, would pay more if this bill, providing for various exemptions, had not been brought down. The Treasurer has already indicated a number of exemptions which he proposes to add TO those already in the act. Our complaint is that he proposes to exempt goods in this amending bill which ought not to be exempted unless he is in a position to give up revenue. If he is prepared to yield up revenue previously collected in respect of fly-traps, there appears to be no logical ground for the continuance of the tax on an item such as biscuits. We say that by this bill the Treasurer has made the sales tax more anomalous than over, in that he has extended exemptions to persons who are consumers of capital goods, such as primary producers, who are able to get the sales tax removed from To that must be added transeverything they require. But, when the workers want to buy things, they are first told that the revenue to be given up is too considerable to warrant the matter being given consideration, and when that argument is destroyed, the Treasurer says that this is a legitimate Let the Treaitem for taxation, because he regards it as a luxury. If biscuits are a luxury, then indeed the Government's conception of the standard of living is such that it is hardly worth defending. I am surprised at some of the remarks whicb the Treasurer has made; I regret their tone, and I am astounded by what he regards as the essence of his objections to the amendment.

Such a statement is not only misleading, but also a travesty of the facts. The honourable gentleman knows full well that the wholesale people do not pay the tax, but that, on the contrary, it is ultimately paid by every worker. The Treasurer is endeavouring to side-track the committee on this occasion, as on others. His policy is to endeavour to camouflage the issue, and to mislead the committee in an attempt to browbeat honourable members sitting behind the Government who are dissatisfied, and who, he is afraid, may vote for the amendment. members on this side are here to fight for the workers. Biscuits are a commodity which goes into every worker's homo, and we shall do all we can to see that this impost is removed. to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). It is time the Government made an effort to remove the sales tax, which was imposed as an emergency measure in years of distress. At any rate, it is time it was removed from articles such as biscuits, which find favour, not only with the workers, but also with people generally. I see no reason why the sales tax should be continued on this delicate morsel. Eventually, the tax is paid by the consumer, and not by the wealthy biscuit manufacturer at all. All these things are passed on to the consumer, and even though it may be difficult to arrive at per cent, of 3d., that difficulty may be overcome simply by removing two or three biscuits from the packet. dainty morsel should be regarded as a fit subject for taxation, I -can imagine no more dainty morsel th'an a pig with a rug on, yet the rug is to be exempted. I.f the biscuit of the poorer classes of the people is to be regarded as a luxury, it cannot surely be regarded as a greater luxury than the rug for the pig, which is to be exempted. Every aspect of this question has been traversed, and I have no desire to delay the committee any longer than to say that I shall record my vote in favour of the amendment. [9.10] -It has been generally admitted The by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), and most honourable members, that the sales tax is a form of taxation that should be abolished when conditions permit. We are now dealing with an item that provides a considerable portion of the total sales tax collected, amounting, as it does, to £100,000 a year. Honourable members opposite have from time to time charged members of the Country party with being instrumental in securing the abolition of the tax on certain articles necessary for the primary producers. But in those cases, not a great amount of revenue was involved. Biscuits may be regarded as one item in respect of which Honourable we desire to remove the sales tax as soon as possible. Honourable members opposite have referred disparagingly to members of the Country party for their success in securing the abolition of the tax on machinery and the many requirements of the producer, and they have also made reference to fly-traps. Primary producers, I can assure honourable members, have no desire to breed flies, and therefore must trap them. The farmer, obviously, cannot consume all the fruit he grows, and has to sell it to the worker, who receives the basic wage. The farmer himself is very fortunate if he makes even the basic wage. In the operation of his farm, the primary producer has to buy every class of implement and farming machine required for the cultivation of the crops which he grows. The farmer is more entitled to consideration because of the great number of implements that he requires than is the miner who needs only a pair of miner's boots. A good deal of sympathy has been shown with the If a workers in this endeavour to get the Government to agree to the addition of biscuits to the list of exempt goods so that the price of biscuits could be reduced by Jd. per lb.; but many commodities other than biscuits should also receive attention-the sweets the children eat, for instance.

All milk products, including dehydrated milk, which are largely used for young children, have also been excluded from the ambit of the tax.

I shall obtain statistics, which are not available now, with a viewto ascertaining the sum of money involved if perambulators are exempted. But the Government cannot see its way clear to accede to the amendment at what is relatively a moment's notice.

Even so, I would not have had an opportunity to obtain the information on the subject this evening.

I do not think that the Government can be expected to accept an amendment of this nature which may have far-reaching consequences, without investigating all the possibilities. I assure honourable members, however, that the matter will be given earnest consideration when the Government is granting further exemptions. on principle, that perambulators should not be exempted from taxation. Children should not get the idea that they are coming into a care-free life. Every child should be taught to realize as soon as it is able that it is entering a world of taxation and that it will bear the burden for the rest of its days. If coffins are to be exempted from sales tax, it is only because by the time a man is dead he is of no value to the country as a taxpayer. Amendment negatived.

The Rockhampton Harbour Board recently constructed a tug and on the completion of the vessel the board was called upon to pay sales tax. The object in building the tug was to carry out works in the river, giving employment to men who had previously been on relief work. The Rockhampton Harbour Board is working under considerable difficulties, having an indebtedness of £500,000, and money is being provided by the Queensland Government in order to enable it to continue its operations. It is rightly contended that the imposition of a sales tax upon a semi-governmental body of that kind is quite unjustifiable. The tax affects, not only the Rockhampton Harbour Board, but other harbour boards in Queensland as well. The Brisbane harbour being controlled by the Government, is exempted from sales tax on tugs of this description, but harbour boards iu Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton, for example, are obliged to pay the tax. It is not fair to discriminate between semi-governmental bodies and the State Government.

It would be invidious to make any distinction in favour of this reputable body, the Rockhampton Harbour Board, because I understand that it is the only local governing body of this sort in a position to build its own tugs. If an exemption were granted in this instance it would be definitely and specifically in the interests of one local governing body. I do not think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would suggest that his amendment is really practicable. The board, which is building its own rugs under 1,000 tons, is in a peculiar position, but I will have the matter investigated in order to see if anything can be done in future to extend relief to it.

[ do not wish to reiterate tbe arguments brought forward earlier in this debate; they covered a wide range of subjects, and for tbe Government it has been a one-sided proposition. Without returning to the now famous item of rugs> for pigs, I desire to emphasize that wearing apparel of all kinds should be exempt from sales tax, because it constitutes a big item in the weekly budget of a worker on the basic wage, absorbing up to 22i per cent, of his pay. Persons who are on the lower rungs of the ladder in the community, who are unemployed, or on relief works, should be the first to benefit from any relief. If the Government is genuine in its desire to give concessions under this measure, it should not allow one section of the community exemption from sales tax in the purchase of lorgnettes, an imported luxury from overseas, while the imposition on the clothes of the poor is permitted to remain. port the amendment, because I consider that sales tax imposed on the clothing of lower-paid people is iniquitous. The Government has exempted many thiugs on which certain sections of the community could well afford to pay tax, but, the wearing apparel of persons engaged on emergency relief work does not escape the imposition. The poor have to endeavour to feed and clothe themselves and their families on a very low scale of wages. These persons are hard hit through no fault of their own. They are anxious and willing to work in permanent jobs, but they are, unfortunately, unable to obtain employment. That their apparel should be subject to sales tax is a tragedy. Many little children are going to school bootless, and charitable organizations have been established in'an endeavour to ease their lot by begging for left-off clothing. Some honourable members have attempted to make light of the sales tax, because it. is imposed at the rate of only 5 per cent. Even if it meant the addition of only 6d. or Is. to an article, it would increase (Darling) [9.39] I the difficulties of those who are engaged in emergency relief work.

They described it as an iniquitous measure, and said that it would inflict a good deal of hardship on working men and women; yet today they will not give relief to that very section of the community. I invite them to visit mining towns in my electorate, where they will see that prosperity is as far away as ever it was. [Quorum formed.] T support the lifting of the sales tax from wearing apparel generally. One could understand the inclusion of some of the items in the list of exemptions, if the aim could not afford to buy proper clothes of the Government was to serve a party political purpose; but if the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) intended to give relief to the most deserving and the hardestpressed section of the community, wearing apparel should have been the first item considered. Wollongong, because of the hopelessness of expecting to be able to purchase clothing of practically any kind, relief workers waited as a deputation on the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). right honourable gentleman could find the time to attend convivial social functions, but could spare only five or ten minutes to the deputation. It wished to point out to him the urgent necessity for relief being given through, this avenue. Mothers who are handy with the needle have to use calico flour bags and similar materials to make underclothing for their children. [Quorum formed.] Apparently, Government supporters are not interested in this matter. The first necessity after food is the clothing of our people. I cannot understand why this tax on clothing should have been continued for so long. prates about the restoration of prosperity. Honourable members, with tongue in cheek, talk about bringing tbe nation back to normal conditions. They say that, as the nation approaches the normal state, relief will be given. In the provision of relief, I place the Australian baby before a sucking pig or any other kind, and before a sheep, whether it be a stud sheep or any other kind. While I admit that it is perhaps necessary to help the rural industries, I still say that it is a poor commentary on our civilization, and on our attitude of mind, when we tolerate the lifting of the sales tax from the clothing of animals, while keeping it on the clothing of Australian children. The Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) has been broadcasting appeals to the public advocating an increase of the birth-rate, and yet this Government insists upon taxing clothing for children. If the Minister for Health will come with me to some districts on the south coast of New South Wales, I can show him many parents who find it impossible to clothe their children properly. Recently a man was fined for not sending his child to school, and his defence was that he for it. He could furnish the child with some sort of rags sufficient to cover it while running in the bush near home, but he could not clothe it decently to enable it to attend school. The Treasurer may, for all I care, double the tax A few days ago, in on da-ess suits, spats, silk hats and silk stockings, if he will take the tax off the clothing of the poor. There is no hope of his doing that, however, because he must do what he is told by the interests The which provide the party funds. The Government cannot justify continuing to collect tax on the people's clothing. the tax? posed during a time of grave emergency. This Government boasts that it has restored prosperity. If that be so, then there is no need to continue collecting this tax. Any Government can impose taxes; no statesmanship is required for that. A good government, however, will so adjust the incidence of taxation The Government that it falls upon those best able to bear it. This Government seems to be animated by the philosophy of paganism, and is utterly careless of its duty towards the poor. I urge it to remove the sales tax from clothing of low and medium price. No tax should be imposed on suits of clothes up to £5, or on boots or shoes up to 15s. a pair. On the luxurious clothing in which wealthy persons parade themselves vulgarly and ostentatiously, it may double the tax if it chooses. Other civilizations have been",44,Pairs

The cry may yet go forth Destruction of the { palaces and security to the people's homes.'"" [Quorum formed.'] hope that the Minister will reconsider his decision not to accept any amendment designed to remove the sales tax from wearing apparel. Every member of the community is directly affected, and I give what relief is possible freely and gladly, and not in the niggardly fashion which has characterized the attitude of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) in regard to so many of these items. There are 4,000 clothing factories in Australia, employing 72,260 'persons, and paying each year £7,400,000 in wages. evident, therefore, that this industry is an important one from the point of view of employment, while its products are distributed from one end of Au=tralia to another, and are purchased by rich and poor alike. The Commonwealth Statistician has stated that there are 324,000 people out of work in Australia, and probably not fewer than 1,000,000 persons are dependent to-day on some form of charity. When the sales tax was imposed, customs revenue had fallen to £28,400,000, while now it amounts to £37,850,000; yet thesales tax is yielding more revenue than ever before. The Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) against the irritating tactics adopted by has been making eloquent appeals to the one of his followers in directing attenpublic emphasizing the need for a higher tion to the state of the committee when birth-rate. In a pamphlet which he published recently he statedI n 1911 the crude birth-rate was 27.20, in 1933 it was 10.78. To-day it is still less. It is impossible to justify by any Making every allowance for the lower deathrate, the decrease in the number of births is startling. A t the rate of increase for the quarter of a century preceding 1929 the population of Australia would have been 17,000,000 in 19S4. A t the present rate of increase it will bo only 9,000,000! If tlie birth-rate continues to drop as it has done since 1929, the population of Australia will bo stagnant in another 20 years. Unemployment is largely responsible for I the declining birth-rate, because the average working man has the greatest difficulty in supporting a wife and children. If we remove the sales tax on clothing, it will go a considerable way towards lightening the working man's burden. [Quorum formed.] I should like the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to explain the methods adopted by the Government in deciding which goods shall be exempted from tbe tax, and to inform members of the Opposition how they should proceed in the future in making further appeal to the Government to representations for exemptions. The Government has defeated all amendments submitted by the Opposition, and we should like to know the principles which have guided it in reaching its decisions. It appears to us that the Government has decided in a haphazard way to grant certain exemptions, particularly in respect It is of goods used in primary production, whilst it has refused applications for exemptions which would benefit small business .people and workers who have as much difficulty as the men on the land in balancing their budgets.

192,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer)tlie Minister is attempting to make a serious reply to a courteous question. I was about to furnish figures, to which I referred in my second-reading speech, showing the main classes of goods to which the proposed exemptions from sales tax apply. The most important single exemption is that of containers for exempt goods. This is probably the most troublesome item to the administration, and to a large number of individual taxpayers, but it has not been debated at all in the consideration of this bill. Many taxpayers deal in goods which are exempt, yet they are obliged to keep books and a clerical staff merely because of the sales tax on containers. These containers are required for both imported and Ausiralian-made exempt goods, and the cost of the exemption is estimated at about £40.000 a year. The second important exemption applies to goods used by public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and the like, and it will cost £25,000. The third group of exemptions relates to pipes for drainage, sewerage, irrigation, and water supply purposes, and will involve a further tax remission of £25,000. The exemption of certain articles required for the alleviation of suffering, namely, spectacles and aids to hearing, will cost £15,000, and the exemption of sole leather for boot repairing will involve a loss of revenue of £15,000. The items which I have mentioned account for £120.000 out of the £150,000 which the total exemptions are expected to cost this year. During last year a number of honourable members wrote to the Taxation Department from their constituents and others for the exemption from tax of certain goods, and giving reasons for the requests. The officers of the department carry on a continuous audit of these applications throughout the year. Tbe requests are *ent to the deputy commissioners, who are asked to forward to the central office particulars of items on which they have found administrative anomalies, and in respect of which they consider that exemption from tax is warranted. In the course of the month or two before the budget is presented, the officers of the department reduce the numposed to be inserted be so inserted ( Mr ber of exemptions which, in their opinion, CLARK'S amendment)-put . The comarc worthy of consideration to a fairly mittee divided. Sfr. Casey. large list, which I go through with the Deputy Commissioner in charge of the sales tax. After full discussion with ""him on almost every item of importance, I submit to Cabinet an abbreviated list, together with the full list. Against each item is placed the probable cost of a remission of the tax, and the Cabinet decides on the number of exemptions that will cost the total amount of money that it is able to remit in sales tax for the year. I think that is the only proper system that could be adopted. This investigation entails a great deal of re search in respect of' every item, before the list goes to the Cabinet. The classes of goods the exemption of which will mean a loss of £120,000 out of the £150,000 that all the exemptions in the bill are expected to cost, occupy, in point of space, about 90 per cent, of the bill before tbe committee. The effect of the measure will be to reduce considerably the actual number of taxpayers, and this should give much satisfaction throughout the country. I cannot believe that the amendment, with respect to wearing apparel of all kinds has been seriously submitted. If this exemption were granted, the cost would be at least £1,500,000, because the total recorded output value of the industry is at least £32,000,000. Therefore, h is impossible for the Government to agreo to the amendment. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Jennings) referred to certain stanchions and. fittings for concrete water pipes, which I understand are cast in place. I am not certain as to the range of forwarding representations fittings to which he referred, but the component parts of reinforced and non-reinforced supports, stanchions and pipes are free, and the resulting piece, if it is a structure, is certainly free. The honourable member also spoke of photographic goods which were recently the subject of a. High. Court appeal. The Government has considered this matter, in conjunction with many other applications and economic for exemption, and, in the circumstances, it is unable to give it priority; but it will be further considered when new exemptions are being dealt with.

In my speech yesterday, I pointed out from the time the sales tax was brought into operation in August, 1930, until September,, 1933, the practice of invoicing goods at the actual cost and charging sales tax on the price of the goods only, was permitted by a ruling of the department. But, at the end of 1933, a new ruling was given, as the result of which the department is demanding sales tax on freight in respect of goods sold between August, 1930, and September, 1933. country traders are being called upon to pay retrospective tax over a period of two and a half years. I commend my amendment to the Government as a reasonable one. Though the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has clearly indicated the impossibility of accepting any further 'amendments to exempt other items from sales tax, I suggest that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Darling( Mr is not of such great proportions as some Clark) is a reasonable one, and should be reconsidered. tice adopted of charging sales tax on freight results in serious injustice to country storekeepers, many of whom are experiencing great difficulty owing to the bad times through which we have passed. A country storekeeper operating in a locality fairly close to a city is severely handicapped by having to pay sales tax on freight as well as on the cost of the goods, while the city storekeeper pays only on the cost of the goods. Many country storekeepers have directed attention to this anomaly, and I hope that, although tbe Treasurer cannot grant relief in the near future, he will at least take steps to do so when the budget is under consideration next year. [10.46] I give a complete denial to the empting freight from sales tax would be off-hand statement of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) that I promised to introduce an amendment to exempt freight from sales tax -D o I understand the Treasurer to say did give such a promise.

The honourable member for Darling left the chamber this afternoon when I was giving a full explanation of the position in regard to the imposition of sales tax on freight, and I cannot at this stage repeat the remarks that I then made. I regret that I am unable to give the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) an undertaking that the Government will reconsider this subject, for it has already been very carefully considered. I point out to the honourable In other words, member that it is open to dealers, merchants or purchasers in the country to buy goods f.o.r. or f.o.b., in which case freight charges do not appear on the invoice, and so are not liable to sales taxation. It must appeal to the honourable member also that many of the articles which country storekeepers trade in. apart from groceries and certain other foodstuffs, are used by primary producers, and so are already exempt from sales tax. The problem, therefore, honourable members have suggested.

No great principle affecting the sales tax itself is involved. The incidence of sales tax was intended to operate at the stage of the true wholesale price. The department, in practice, has made it operate at the last wholesale sale. sale value irrespective of geographical advantage, is the point at which the tax should attach. -Perhaps the consideration of this matter has not been taken as seriously as it warrants, and if some of us were in the plight of the people in Coonamble and Broken Hill, for example, we should probably be keener to see what is obviously an injustice removed. The correspondence which has passed between the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) indicates that the Government, at one stage, did feel sympathetic, and expressed the opinion that something could be done to alleviate the position of country wholesalers. That shows that the Government appreciated the position of those people. attempted to say otherwise. The point at issue is that any so-called solution that has been propounded would create worse troubles in other directions. If the honourable member has any new proposal to submit, the Government will give it careful consideration. probably be met by the argument that it was contrary to the law in some other respects. The correspondence further shows that a practice designed to overcome the anomaly by a system of rebat.es> was introduced and operated from the 31st August, 1930, to the 30th September, 1933. At the latter date, apparently, the legal advisers of the Taxation Department gave the opinion that the practice was not in conformity with the law, and so the system was altered. A further injustice occurred when these people, after they had been allowed rebates, or rulings had been given them to the effect that they and they had carried on their businesses with that understanding, were, subsequently, according to advice I have, received, notified by the department that the amounts rebated would have to be paid again as taxation. member was not in the House when I previously dealt with that aspect. stand that the department has not made that demand? able member's question when I reply. Government appreciated the fact that an injustice was being clone in this instance. There is always a way of overcoming an injustice if the desire to do so exists. When, taxes have been inadvertently collected without the proper authority, measures have been introduced to ratify that illegality. Hence there is always a way out of the difficulty if it is sought. I do not think the Treasurer should allow an anomaly to remain when he and the department realize that a wrong is being clone to the country people. This applies to clothing and to other items that have been discussed to-night. This tax bears upon the consumers who live in those outback districts, and as the result the cost of living is increased. Those who live in the back blocks suffer many inconveniences while carrying out a work of development that is appreciated by tlie rest of the community. On that account, they should receive consideration. If the department makes a, ruling and advises the taxpayer accordingly, it is desirable that it should be adhered to. I know of an instance where a tailor in Launceston was fined for not having paid sales tax despite the fact that he had obtained a ruling from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, that on the additional charge he had made to cover the tax he was not required to pay tax. It all adds to the irritation caused by this measure, and assists to make it even more unpopular. If rulings are given they should be adhered to, and consideration should be shown to taxpayers by arranging for deputy commissioners to publish a set of rulings as was done in connection with pensions.",50,Chairman Mr E F Incurred In Transporting Them To The

I know that many country storekeepers and country wholesalers have had to pay the sales tax on the freight as well as on the cost of the goods. If there have been substantial exemptions in respect of goods used in the country districts the amountinvolved in this request would not be very great. The objection of the Treasurer to any remissions suggested by the committee is that such remissions would involve the Government in the loss of hundreds of pounds of revenue; but as he has admitted that the volume of goods upon which the tax on freight is charged is not large, a substantial remisto be traced back to the point of import sion would not have to be made. trusttherefore that this matter will be further considered.

This eventually proved to be, not only contrary to the law, but also provocative of anomalies, particularly in cases where the sale price included freight. Consequently upon the rush and confusion in the earlier period of sales tax administration-the work was a tremendous tax upon the department in dealing with the complex sales tax legislation-certai n errors occurred. When these were discovered a general ruling was made, but I am sure no attempt was made to collect the tax retrospectively from persons who were able to prove that they had acted upon erroneous advice.

If the honourable member can produce evidence in a town received the advice officially and passed it on to others?he was acting on advice received from the department, or on advice received from another wholesaler. Tbe revenue aspect is of only minor importance; the main difficulty is the creation of other anomalies.

I am informed that a large proportion of the goods sold in country centres are invoiced f.o.r., or f.o.b.

This amendment is designed to assist country tailors, who have gradually been forced out of business under the existing provision of £1,000. [11.19] I appreciate the point that the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) is seeking to meet.

The exemption of £3,000 would not entail a very big loss of revenue, but would he of considerable assistance to country tailors and would probably enable them to re-establish their businesses. [11.25] T have just been informed that, within the last fortnight, the Prime Minisber( Mr Lyons) has received telegrams from all the master tailors' associations of Australia protesting against any exemption from sales tax based on the amount of turnover. They claim that such an exemption creates unfair competition in the trade. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has received wires from the gentlemen whom tlie Treasurer ( Mr the Government. Casey) has called ""master tailors"", but I ask tlie Treasurer to inform honourable members as to who are these gentlemen. Under present conditions, tailors in country centres who regularly employed half a dozen hands, and sold a genuine article, are being forced to sack their employees and deal from these so-called tailors. who despatched these telegrams to the Prime Minister were disclosed, I have no doubt it would bo revealed that they are men who sell machine-made suits as handmade suits-factor y people who are developing undesirable conditions in the tailoring and soft goods trade. Most likely they are akin to those Polish Jews who set up a few machines in badly-constructed and ill-ventilated buildings in a back street, and dominated the clothing trade of London in the old days. I have no doubt that the so-called master tailors referred to by the Treasurer are developing conditions in the trade similar to those which existed in Melbourne in the SO's and 90's. Genuine tailors in country centres will be forced, under the present exemption, either to become "" snide "" dealers or to face unemployment. If the Treasurer will read the names of the senders of these telegrams, I suppose that "" Solomon, Isaacs and Moses"" would be found among them-gentleme n of the kind who batten on tlic industry and. arc responsible for the undesirable conditions now prevailing in the trade. I support the proposed, clause moved by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden). If the Government accepts it, it will be doing something to rehabilitate the trade which, at its best, was a credit to country commercial life. Under present conditions, however, tailors in country centres who (Corio Treasurer) are struggling to make a living have to pay sales tax. It is possible that a tailor with a gross turnover of £1,000 will show very little profit on his trading. The amendment is reasonable, and the Government should accept it. ask the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to produce the telegrams in order to enable honourable members to discover who have influenced the Government in this matter ? that the telegrams should be produced.

I point out that it is an established rule of the House, which also applies to the House in committee, that documents to which a Minisber invites attention should be produced for the inspection of honourable members. I ask that this well-established rule be observed. Documents referred to. as the Treasurer has referred to these telegrams, become the property of the committee for investigation, first, as to their genuineness, and, secondly, as to their origin or the names of the persons who have taken the responsibility of despatching them to the Government. Who are they? What are the interests involved? Why did the Treasurer collapse so .suddenly after having mentioned, the fact that, the Prime. Minister had received the telegrams?

I realize the importance of the issue, and I believe that the sales tax should be progressively reduced until such time as it can be abolished altogether. In the meantime, I ask the Treasurer to produce the telegrams. That is a reasonable request. referring to the 1930 telegrams? that these telegrams are five years old. How did it happen that the Treasurer was able at a moment's notice to secure information regarding these telegrams received, not by him, but by the Prime Minister five years ago? which I referred were cablegrams dealing with another subject; they had nothing to do with tailors at all. to go back over a lustrum-whic h I understand is the Latin term for a period of five years-and we are invited to consider a new set of telegrams altogether. I again ask the Treasurer whether he will produce the telegrams. There will be all sorts of speculations in tlie newspapers to-morrow as to what the messages contain. I hope that the Government will not, as on previous occasions, make available to the press the contents of these documents which have been withheld from the committee. If the Minister for Trade and Customs has possession ot the documents, and they are subject to censorship, we should be told. I hope that the committee will take note of my protest against the suppression of these documents. If the Treasurer will not produce them, I can do no more than support the amendment of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark). I am sorry to say that the Treasurer has come out of this debate ratherbadly. When the. Treasurer ( Mr Casey) rose to speak a little while ago, I expected that he was going to produce the telegrams to which he had referred, instead of which he attempted to fool the committee by rising and immediately sitting down again. He stated that the telegrams contained protests from the master tailors against what tliey described as the unfair competition which would result if the amendment of the honourable member for Darling (Air. Clark) were accepted. In reply, I point out that there is always unfair competition in trading matters as between large and small manufacturers of any article. With the permission of the committee, I should like to wait until the Treasurer, who is in charge of this measure, returns to the chamber. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr E. F.

The Government should give proper consideration to the points raised by honourable members. For my part, even, if the telegrams to which the Treasurer has referred really existed, and were produced, they would not influence my vote. Honourable members are accustomed to receive shoals of telegrams in regard to most matters that come before the House, sent -by people who wish them to vote in a particular way. Parliament should deal with the cases on their merits and should not be influenced hy any representations made by interested parties; hut it is evident that that course is not to the table, thereby acquainting the Gobe followed in this instance. The Treasurer refuses to accept the amendment, on the ground that protests have been received from a number of master tailors throughout the Commonwealth. When a previous amendment was before the committee, which was designed to remove the sales tax from biscuits, he said that a good case had been made out for the biscuit manufacturers, and he suggested that those who made representations had been offered some inducement to do so. The position is now reversed. It may be that the Treasurer and those who support him in this matter have been offered some inducement by the master tailors in the cities to prevent their smaller competitors in country districts from operating successfully. Many of these smaller tailoring concerns have been forced out of business, and have had to close their premises and dispense with their employees because their trade has been taken from them by certain city manufacturers who sweat their employees. Honourable members opposite who profess to believe in decentralization,.can show their genuineness by voting to keep a proportion of this trade in country districts. That can only be done by making it possible for the smaller tailoring concerns in the country to compete with the master cities. If the Treasurer is unaware of the amount of revenue involved he can report progress, and ask the officers of the department to secure the necessary information before the committee again meets. During the week end he might also communicate with the absent. Prime Minister. with a. view to securing the bundle of telegrams containing protests, so that honourable members may know the persons and organizations which are influencing the Government in its decision. I recollect that, on one occasion, I read in this chamber a protest which had been submitted to me by telegram from a disgusted wheat grower. He was disgusted at the action of some members of this Parliament in voting large sums of public money to themselves. When I attempted to read that telegram the Chairman said that I would not be in order in reading it unless .1. was prepared to place the telegram on vernment with the name and address of its sender. I draw attention to Standing Order 317, which readsA document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister of the Crown, unless stated to be of a confidential nature or such as should more probably bo obtained by address, may be called for and made a public document. surer did not quote from any document. for Batman( Mr Brennan) was within his rights in asking for the production of the telegrams.

However, although we may not always say what we think, there is nothing to prevent us from thinking. I shall not be satisfied until the documents are produced. Andi f they are not produced, I can only assume that the Treasurer's quotation was incorrect. I am not alone in doubting the tailors of the existence of the telegrams to which reference has been made. Is the honourable gentleman afraid tp disclose the names of the senders because they are persons who contribute largely to the funds of the United Australia party?

Has the commission effectively carried out its determination "" to cater for the particular interest of country dwellers in A u s t r a l i a "" so far as its news services are concerned: if so, -on what does it base its claim to have carried out such determination? 3. In view of the fact that the commission's expenditure is approximately at the rate of £1 a minute and nearly half of that amount is used in providing ""highbrow"" items, would it be possible to pay more than £1,450 per annum for the right to use whatever news it wishes, and give listeners a better service and the commission a better .return for the money which they arc now called upon to pay for an inadequate service? 4.
