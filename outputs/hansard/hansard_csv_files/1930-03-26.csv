If the people thought that a Government was proceeding upon dangerous ground, or if they considered its policy too. drastic, complicated, or objectionable for any other reason, they would record their view at the ballot box in due time. It might be said"" Ah, but a government might say nothing about self-imposed difficulties differ its intentions. It might be returned upon dissimulation and, having a majority behind it, might proceed to alter the Constitution at its own sweet will."" But the people have a way of dealing with governments which exceed the mandate they receive. That accounts for the fact that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) is now occupying a seat in this chamber which was occupied in the last Parliament by a much more comprehending statesman. The very simplicity of the procedure by which a Parliament may err has its counterpart in the simplicity of the procedure by which the error may be corrected. It is true beyond doubt that Governments do not habitually go beyoud their mandate. On the contrary, with all events, it would expound the best intention of doing all that they undertake to do, even the most industrious governments usually fall a little short of carrying out the full programme upon which they were elected. It may be said that the Constitution should not be constantly in the melting pot. There is not the slightest reason to assume, from I rise.to a history or from logic, that that would occur if this bill were passed. It is true that we have attempted to make a considerable number of amendments to the Constitution, but only three have been effected in 30 years. During the first decade of the Commonwealth history the only proposals for the amendment of the Constitution were the first one submitted in 1906 relating to Senate elections, and two others relating specially to the Braddon clause, and the peculiar circumstances associated with that period. fested any extraordinary activity in seeking amendments of the Constitution during the first years of federation.

Where does the honourable gentleman find any phrase of my leader or of myself flattering ourselves because we would not violate the Constitution? bare statements that we would not violate the Constitution. There is no self-flattery in that. It is a declaration of firm policy, and instead of finding fault with us for our,self-congratulation, he ought to congratulate himself and the country on the fact that this Government is not so foolish as lie attempted to make the people believe. We pledged ourselves not only to keep the Constitution inviolate, but also to strain every nerve to amend it. Although there was much talk by sorely tried and irritated men who urged us to do violence to the Constitution, we would feel ourselves disloyal to the other sections of the community if we failed to make good our pledge to equip ourselves with powers, as representatives of the people, in order to preserve their interests in this country. The truth is that the suggestion of violating the Constitution would never have been made had there beeu available to the Parliament of Australia machinery to deal with this great Australian problem-the powers ancl the difficulties arising therefrom. of specifying the limits of the two sets of powers in a satisfactory way, the uncertainty which must always exist as to the interpretation of the powers as specified in the Constitution, ancl the fact that what ought to be a political question decided according to the will of the people has become a judicial question decided according to the form which is given to the document by judicial interpretation. All these difficulties become greatly increased and rendered more Mr Brennan. acute when the Constitution is made so difficult to amend that the distribution of powers cannot be readily adjusted to meet the changing needs of the community. No one can, on democratic grounds, defend the present method of amending the Constitution, inasmuch as a minority of 690,000 people may prevent a majority of 2,900,000 people from giving effect to its will. It may be argued that only on those terms would the He said that the smaller States enter the federation; but are we to suppose that the conditions which were necessary to induce the smaller States to enter upon the experiment of federation 30 years ago, are to continue as permanent conditions during All he will find is our the whole life of the Commonwealth? Honourable members know the present method of amending the Constitution. Bills must pass both Houses by absolute majorities, and when submitted by referendum must be passed by a majority of the people in a majority of the States, and by a majority of the whole of the people. By that method a comparatively small number of persons may defeat the desires and intentions of a very large number, not only with respect to a proposed amendment that particularly affects the smaller States, but also in a matter that very slightly affects those States, and is of importance to the larger States. How can that be supported by any argument on the part of those who stand by the principle of one vote one value, or the application of any other democratic principle? It would indeed be sad if, after 30 years of federation, we were obliged to consider this question as an invidious contest distribution of between the larger and the smaller States. There has never been a time in the These include the difficulty history of the Commonwealth when any' Commonwealth Government or Parliament has manifested a disposition to act unjustly towards one of the smaller States. I make that concession to all Parliaments and all shades of political opinion. I have already given particulars of cases"" in which the Commonwealth Parliament, in violation of the principles of democracy, has extended to the smaller States' a considerable amount of generosity. In that spirit succeeding Commonwealth Parliaments, recognizing the peculiar disabilities of the smaller States, have held out to them the right hand of fellowship and support. It cannot be charged against either this or any other Government that it has used its power harshly as against any State. But it would be infinitely more sad if these proposals were viewed from the party aspect. I am old enough to have recorded a vote in favour of the establish[4.37] -This is a subject in which, needment of the federation, 30 years ago.

It would be tragic if we were to look at this question, and I admire the courage that question from the point of view of party, it has nothing to do with party.

We are presuming only to lay the foundations of the building; it will be for succeeding governtion from the point of view of their rements to determine what class of building shall be erected on them.

I fervently hope that this liberal, this full measure of power will be given to the national Parliament. There is no parliament in Australia, [19] except Australia's Parliament, that should have full power. It is idle for any person to prate about Australia as a nation, and its status in the world, until she has a really sovereign Parliament. That Parliament must be elected by the whole of the people of Australia. less to say, I am deeply interested.

For several years I have patiently awaited an opportunity to discuss this very the Government has displayed in bringing forward such a far-reaching and sweeping proposal. AlthoughI shall criticize it in what, I hope, will be a friendly and constructive spirit, I consider that it is the duty of every honourable member to approach its considerasponsibility to the whole of the people of Australia, not in any narrow, parochial party spirit, nor with the idea of reaping from it a party advantage.

I greatly fear that his speech will go a long way towards making this a more narrow party question than it otherwise might have been.

9,Mr Thompson (New England),"his way, to see what would happen. He must be somewhat cautious, because there has beeu no development of public Opinion upon this issue. During the campaign that is to be held, the probability is that his attitude will be largely modified. We know that he possesses considerably developed powers of 'logic, and his record in this House has shown him to be a reasonable man. If he does not modify his attitude, he and the party that supports him will be forced into an unfortunate position before the campaign reaches its zenith. Unquestionably, this is the most momentous issue that has been placed before the people of Australia since federation was established, and for that reason alone it is entitled to the sympathetic consideration of those honourable members who sit on this side of the House, not necessarily with the idea of supporting it, but so as to see where it may lead us. No honourable member of this House can predict where this proposal, if agreed to by the people, will lead Australia. There have been other occasions when terrible consequences have been foreshadowed because of certain action taken by different governments; but the people have soon become reconciled to conditions that, at the outset, appeared to be absolutely impossible, and eventually have regarded them as the ordinary every-day conditions of their existence. . If the first question is carried Constitution that they approached it the whole basis of the federation will be altered. It may be contended that we shall still have a federation; but, if we accept the constitutional and legal definitions of federation, it is obvious that, upon the carrying of this proposal, the federation as it is generally understood will no longer exist in Australia. I shall quote a definition that was presented to the royal commission on constitutional amendments by Sir William Harrison Moore, because it appears to me to sum up the position very clearly. It is to be found at page 230 of the report of the commission, and readsA "" federal government"" exists where, in a political community, tlie powers of government nrc distributed between two classes <of organizationa central government affecting the whole territory and population of the sovereignty, and a number of local governments affecting particular areas and the perMr Thompson. sons or things therein-whic h are so far independent of each other that the one cannot destroy the other, or encroach upon the sphere of the other as determined by the Sovereign in the Constitution. Both are completely subject to the State. Either may be changed or abolished at will by the State. It appears to involve, also, the existence of .some authority recognized by the central and local parts as competent to -determine the conflicts which arise as to their respective powers. That, in a nutshell, means that the federal system pre-supposes two sets of organization, each independent of the other, under a written charter; one dealing with certain defined powers and functions, and the other dealing with other defined powers and functions; and when there is any conflict between the two there is, or should be, some authority to arbitrate-suc h as, for example, the High Court of Australia. Those who have studied the history of the federation campaign in Australia must have been struck with the deep knowledge that the framers of the Constitution had of all aspects of federal and unitary systems. It is quite a mistake to suppose that unification was not considered by them 30 years or more ago. As a matter of fact, our knowledge of the two systems of government has advanced little since then. The great men who framed the Constitution for us considered all 'aspects of federation. It is clearly stated in the report of the Royal Commission on the from the angle that at that particular time'it was impossible to impress on the people the necessity for a central unified form of government; any movement based on that theory would have been laughed out of court. It took 30 years or more to induce the people to be even mildly interested in the subject of federation, because Australia was divided into six separate colonies. The founders of the Constitution were confronted with the task of persuading people who were essentially parochial in their outlook to look at the problem of government from a national angle. The only possible way of getting six sovereign States to come together was to offer them a charter by which their functions and powers would be sufficiently safeguarded. When, after 30 years, they decided to take federation seriously, they asked for a scheme in writing. Conventions were elected, and we all know how arduous was the work of those bodies. that the personnel of those conventions was in any degree inferior to that of similar bodies that might be appointed to-day. It is doubtful whether we could muster men of such statesmanlike character as that of those who comprised the conventions at the end _ of last century. It was admitted at the time that the framers of the Constitution could not see very far ahead; they were legislating practically for their own generation. I have never thought that the Constitution is so radically defective as to make it almost an unworkable instrument of government. The very fact that we have worked under it efficiently for 30 years, despite its defects, shows that there must be some basic merits in it. The first merit is that the agreement at which the six consenting parties arrived has been absolutely honored. The States entered the federal partnership on the definite understanding that the terms of the Constitution could be altered only by means of the machinery provided, in it. The States have seen that the bargain they made was a sound one; the people certainly did well out of the deal. The Commonwealth Parliament has carried out its functions successfully. Despite all handicaps under the Constitution, it is the most powerful Parliament of tbe seven. Its prestige is very much higher than that of the State parliaments., It has been entrusted with .numerous extra powers which the framers of the Constitution did not contemplate would be exercised by it;: but most of the powersso exercised are national in character. wealth has not endeavoured to encroach on State rights or functions. Now, however, we are asked to accept a proposal that would completely alter the basis of federation. If the people adopt, it, the agreement made 30 years ago can be broken at any time at the will of this Parliament. It may be said by the present Government that that does not matter, it because the people are supreme, and Parliament is the voice of the people. We may be assured that if the people agree to the alteration the Parliament will be merely interpreting their will, and acting for them.. But I point out that the people, owing to inadequate education on this subject, may accept the proI t will not be suggested posal. It may be carried by a very narrow majority in all the States, because the people may not be able to look sufficiently far ahead. Once this is done, the federal structure will be destroyed for all time. There is less chance of correcting a mistake such as that might prove to be than there is .of remedying the defects in the Constitution as it stands. No parliament would be ready to surrender such a power as that proposed once it had been granted. It would be most dangerous to delude the people into believing that it would be in their interests to surrender to this Parliament the power to alter the Constitution. It has been said that the people are not a satisfactory agent to be entrusted with the power of altering the Constitution. Once the people agreed to confer this power on the Parliament itself, constitutional issues would not be put to the people at general elections, but would be merged into the general policies of parties. They would not be examined from constitutional, but from purely political angles. If the people surrendered this power, they would be adopting a dangerous course, because they would be transferring it to an authority over which they have little control. It is true that Parliament submits itself to the suffrages of the people every three years. party issues. year, for instance, on a purely party issue a radical change took place in ibe character of this Parliament. If the proposed The Commonpower were conferred by the people, the party opposite,, with its large majority, would say that the people had given it the right to make any alteration of the Constitution that it desired to bring about. Although that party obtained the reins of. government virtually on a single issue it would have the right to abolish the' State Parliaments, if it were game to do.

Judging by the results of various referendums, the people have developed a flair for cautiousness in the matter of alterations of the Constitution which may have effects beyond their immediate ken.

The High Court this Parliament cannot operate even in the four accepting States.

That view ""in supported in a pamphlet called Tlw Misfit Constitution, by Mr A. P. Canaway, who makes it clear that the alteration of the union from the present basis to a new basis can be effected only with the approval of the six parties to the original compact. If that is not a correct interpretation, and only four of the States need approve of the Government's proposal, how is the new power to be operated? Any legislation based upon that alteration of the Constitution can lie flouted by the other two States. Obviously, it would be impracticable for this unified Parliament to function even in the face of only passive resistance on the part of two States; it cannot function in only two-thirds of the Commonwealth, because the Constitution provides that there shall be no discrimination between different States. The fatal defect, in the proposal of the Government is not only that it proposes to destroy the whole basis of federation, but, if approved by the people, if. will produce an unworkable scheme of unification. that the Government has not brought forward a straight-out scheme of unification. Its failure to do so convinces niu that it does not expect this proposal to he carried. For many years the Labour party has not disguised its unification intentions. Various members of thu party.have differed in their statements as to the extent to which unification would be carried, but .1 have not discovered one dyed-in-the-wool labour man, who is not in favour of the Commonwealth Parliament having complete and absolute power. No doubt many speakers, believing that the people favour unification, will tell them that the adoption of the Government's proposal will bring about what they desire. I am convinced that only a small proportion of the people believe in unification, or even like the sound of the word. stand the word, but many people believe that Australia is over-governed. may be deluded into the belief that the T h a t is so, but magic term unification offers a sovereign remedy for all the evils of government, but when they look into the matter more thoroughly they will discover that no party has put forward any practicable cure for those ills. Advocates of the Government's proposal, however, will say to the people, "" Y o u want unification; vote for this and you will get it . "" But they will not get it . I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) that if the Government is granted the power it is seeking it w ill not know what to do with it. The States represent vested interests much more vast than those of the Commonwealth. The States own lands, railways, highways, and harbours.. They have built up tremendous assets over a period of 130 years, and the roots of their vested interests go deep into the soil of Australia. They have created large capital cities, containing immense government buildings; one recently built iu Sydney cost £2,000,000. On every side we are faced with the ramifications of State assets, influence and power.

But the States, although they are amenable to public opinion, would resist such action, and this Parliament would find that it could not wipe them out. If it is said that the Commonwealth Parliament merely seeks power to legislate in regard to certain urgent matters, and will not alter the Constitution in any fundamental way affecting the vested interests of the States, what is the value of the Government's proposal? If the people realize that they are not going to obtain any reduction in the cost of government they will not give this proposal five minutes consideration. They do not want to make the position worse. They do not want complications between the Commonwealth and State Governments; there is enough of that already. Are those who will speak to the people in favour of this proposal going to tell them that it will have the effect of relieving taxation, of reducing the number of parliamentarians and of simplifying procedure, when they know, on the admission of the Government, that it will have no 1 such effect? The unificationist has a programme for wiping out State Governments, and establishing provinces, and he is logical in his proposals. When he propounds that doctrine he is putting before the people something they can understand, and if they accept it, well and good. There is nothing definite in this proposal at all, merely something that will give the unificationists an excuse for deceiving the people. I am doubtful, personally, that the people will be deceived, but the attempt to deceive can be made under this proposal. If the Government wishes to give the people an opportunity to understand the issue, it ought to postpone the referendum. We cannot deal properly with a question like this in three months, just because the Prime Minister wants to rush off to the Imperial Conference. The same thing happened in regard to a previous referendum. The whole campaign was slummed because the. Prime Minister ilr. Thompson. desired to leave the country. The people did not. understand the proposal, and took the safe course of turning it down. The Prime Minister said that we are facing critical times, and should have full powers. We know, however, that the High Court can grant full powers to this Parliament in times of emergency. It was done during the war, and such powers would not be confined merely to defence matters. Under the War Precautions Act, Parliament at that time performed many functions not relating to defence. They were simply attached to the subject of defence as an excuse. If this country were again to find itself faced with a terrible crisis, the High Court could grant to Parliament the necessary powers to deal with it. Is it fair and democratic, it may be asked, that an outside body like the High Court should be superior to Parliament? That was the basis of federation. It was necessary to have an umpire to settle matters at issue between the Federal and State Governments. I think it will be admitted that the umpire has been a good one. The personnel of the court has changed from time to time, but the people of Australia have always had the fullest confidence in it. There has not been a-case yet in which we can honestly call in question any constitutional judgment of the High Court. The trouble is, not that the High Court has prevented us as a parliament from doing what we wanted to do, but that the constitutional limitations have been so severe that our freedom of action has been restricted. There is an obvious way of getting over these difiiculties. Under section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament is given power to legislate on certain matters. The common-sense way to overcome our present limitation is to submit to the people for their approval a further list of powers to be added to section 51. Two Labour representatives on the royal commission on the Constitution furnished a report containing the following words:Should the above recommendations not be accepted, we recommend that the Constitution should be amended to give f u l l power to the Commonwealth Parliament on the following subjects, in addition to those recommended in section x x i i i . of this report:-Health, induetrial matters, trade arid commerce, railways, aborigines, fauna and flora, fisheries and forestry. The only power we have ever attempted to get, outside State dchts, has heen the control of trade, industry and commerce, so that we have not felt such a vital need for other powers. If we went as a united Parliament before the people, and sought from them such powers as we think are necessary, we should have not the slightest difficulty in obtaining their approval of anything short of the complete annihilation of the federal principle. On the two occasions when that course has been followed the people have very willingly granted the power asked for. The first occasion was in 1906, when they agreed, by a huge majority, to a proposal for altering the date of the Senate elections. The other occasion was at the recent referendum, when the people agreed to grant this Parliament control over thefinancesof the States -That was a tremendous departure from the original basis of federation, but the people did not cavil to grant that power when Parliament went before them as a. united body and asked for it. member think that there is the slightest possibility of securing agreement among all parties in this House to the present proposal ? might have been a big possibility if any willingness had been shown to secure that agreement. Honourable members on this side of the House have not been approached by the Government at all. No steps have been taken to secure our agreement. ""We have been treated with contempt; we have been flouted. ber is not quite fair. A fortnight's adjournment was given ou the second reading debate of this bill, so that honourable members might have an opportunity of considering the matter. Treasurer does not suggest that any proposal emanating from this side of the House would have beeu accepted by the Government. The main reason why the non-Labour parties have not been considered in this matter is that the Labour party has all along been wedded to a scheme called unification. It has assumed that such a scheme is the one remedy for all the ills arising out of our present complex system of government. It was assumed that we, on this side of the House, would never accept such a proposal, and that it was not worthwhile considering anything we might have to suggest. I have beeu actively associated with the New States movement for the last ten years. From time to time we have held large conventions-as large as any gatherings of the Labour party-and these conventions have been attended by representative men from all parts of the country. ""We have considered the matter of new States from every possible angle, and have gone out of our way to invite the presence of representatives of the Labour party. We have had Labour men at these conventions, and they have always asked us to invite representatives from the Australian Labour party. We have invited them, but we have never had any response, and never once has a representative of that organization come to our meetings. is forgetting the Assistant Minister for. Trade and Customs( Mr Forde). member for Richmond reminds me that one of the greatest New State stalwarts in this House is the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. I regret that I did not make an exception in his favour just now. He has come to two of our meetings, and is one of the champions of the movement. He is not a unificationist at all. I , as a new-stater, am not prepared to say that I would not agree to the principle of unification if I could only see what the scheme is. Up to the present it has never been clarified. If the Labour Government hat-3 been courageous, if it had acted up to its promises, and had said that it wanted to cut Australia up into provinces, to reduce the cost of government, to delegate certain powers to provincial authorities, leaving the federal Parliament supreme, many the honourable members on this side of the House would have been tremendously interested, and some might have supported the proposal. A great deal of interest would have been aroused throughout Australia, and although the proposal might not have been carried the first time, the way might have been paved for the ultimate adoption of the scheme.",33,Setup

I think that the Government is really taking a short cut, to unification. It wishes to save itself the trouble of forPrime Minister( Mr Scullin) nor the mulating a scheme, and of putting details before the people. It says that there is nothing to fear; that it would have power to do certain things if it liked, but had no intention of exercising such powers; that it might never exercise them. Not long ago the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley), when asked to explain the Labour party's unification proposals said, "" If wo get power to amend the Consituation we may not interfere with the States for 30 years. It may take that time to make the necessary adjustments. Get it out of your head that we want to do it straight away."". His was the first authoritative Labour voice to declare that it would take such an inordinately long time to introduce the blessings of unification. If this bill is passed the people will it will be a waste of money. It is a .be asked to sign a blank cheque. Mr G-KisGony -The honourable member seems to presume that there will be blessings from unification. tion, for the Commonwealth Government will be able, if this proposal is accepted by the people, to fashion a unification plan that will prove a blessing. has always stated that blessings would flow from unification. Personally, I must see the details of the scheme before I will express any definite opinion upon it. I do not agree with the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) that unification must necessarily be a blessing. It all depends on whether practical expression can lie given to the theory that unification will reduce the cost of government and simplify the machinery of it. Apparently all the Government intends to say at the moment is: "" If you want unification, accept these proposals. We shall then be able to give you what you want, although we may not do so. It depends upon how we feel"". If this proposal is accepted by Parliament and the people it will be one of the most amazing things that has occurred in British history, for the British people are admittedly reluctant to make constitutional changes of such a revolutionary character. If the Government has a scheme of unification to submit to the people, the details of it should be placed before Parliament before this debate concludes. Neither the Attorney-General( M i \ Brennan) has given any indication that the Government has formed any concrete proposal? for unification. So far as we know nt present, no one on the Government side of the House has any definite ideas on the subject. If they have, the details should be put before us during this momentous debate. I am sure that the rank and file of the Labour movement will demand a definite scheme. Possibly during the campaign the Government may formulate some proposals and say "" Here is our plan for unification. If the people will accept it we will go ahead with it "" . I have no particular objection to the Government holding the referendum along the lines suggested; but I think that great pity that we cannot go to tin country with a united front on a grea; issuelike this. I suggest that this proposal should be withdrawn and that tinGovernment should submit certain definite amendments to section 51 of the Constitution designed to equip this Parliament with the power it needs, and that it should also submit an amendment to section 128 to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to subdivide the existing States. ber would submit a list of questions "" n ! long, as a rabbi's curse "". people will not read the proposals. They will rely upon the platform explanation of them. If we were granted specific additional powers under sectioii 51 and also authority to subdivide the States under such terms and conditions as the Commonwealth thinks fit, we should have all that is necessary under the existing conditions, and we should be able to counteract the effort of the States to block further progress and decentralization in government.

49,Honourable Member For New England ( Mr Over,"government, conflictingwas later killed in a railway accident, asked me for my opinion about certain referendum proposals. After listening to my explanation, he was quite satisfied that by voting "" Yes"" he would be acting in the best interests of Australia. The people of Australia have long ago awakened to the fact that this country is over-governed. Many persons have informed me that this Government is doing the right thing in endeavouring to reduce the various State bodies in Australia. We have six State Governors, although there is no real necessity for them. I have no objection to the Governor General, because he is the representative of His Majesty the King and, like His Majesty, has no personal voice in parliamentary affairs. The people of Australia are quite satisfied to have a Governor General as a link between Great Britain and Australia. Why should we, by permitting duality of control to continue, allow differences to cause him to lose his seat. That is arise between one authority and another, and thus furnish material for litigation in the High Court? should be some means of avoiding this expensive litigation, which interferes with the commercial and industrial life of the community and impedes the welfare and progress of our people. .More than twenty years ago, I advocated the establishment of a loan council to stop over-borrowing. We have overborrowed to such 'an extent that we have reached the breaking point. If we have learned the lessons of the past we shall drop those stupid practices that have brought us to our present position, and clothe one central government with ful l powers. In Great Britain there is a population of 46,000,000 people who are satisfied with one Parliament. That Parliament makes the laws, and they are administered by local governing bodies, such as the London County Council. The British Parliament does not concern itself with small details such as the imposition of a tax on cartwheels, or stipulating the size of cowsheds. Under that system the expenditure of government is considerably lowered. It is my aim to have a united people, and that will not be possible so long as we have seven governments legislating in different spheres upon similar matters. If the proposal of the Government is agreed to the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), and others who are similarly minded, will be able to set up new States. That is not possible under the existing system. Why should members of Parliament have to take the platform whenever it is desired to have an alteration of the Constitution ? If this proposal is carried, the Government of the day will be in a position to bring forward measures for an alteration of the Constitution. Those measures will not become law unless a majority in each House of the Parliament is in favour of them; and there will be the additional safeguard that a stipulated number of persons can petition to have the legislation vetoed. The utterances of some persons would lead one to believe that some members of Parliament are unmitigated scoundrels and ought not to be trusted. No honourable member is likely to do anything that may a complete safeguard against any outrage being committed at the expense of the There people. Every member of Parliament is a seeker after popularity, and must, therefore, be respectable and honest in all his dealings. These proposals will have to be approved by the people before they become law. Those who view the matter without bias must admit that the object of the Government is to lay the foundation of an Australian Parliament that will be worthy of the people of Australia. Why should not the Australian people be placed on the same footing as those who live in Great Britain, New Zealand and other countries? Honourable members of this Parliament, I believe, are a fair sample of the Australian people, and are actuated by a desire to increase the prosperity of the country and make the standard of living higher than that which has heen reached in any other part of the world. It cannot be denied that*the time has arrived when our industrial laws should be administered by one authority. The present practice is intolerable and cannot be justified. Under it every honest attempt to regulate industry is frustrated. Cannot honourable members realize the need for so altering the Constitution that this Parliament will not be prevented by decisions of the High Court from taking whatever action it deems necessary to bring about harmonious relations between employers and employees? Why should we have seven governments, six of which have no love for the National Parliament? member consider that a single government qualifications may be, have as much diffiis sufficient for the whole of Australia? have one National Parliament, with local autonomy in administration.

I have supported every referendum for an enlargement of the constitutional powers of the 'Commonwealth Parliament, though I voted against conscription when it was referred to the people. referendum was submitted to the people at a time when the Bruce-Page Government had introduced into the arbitration act criminal offences, and that was so resented by many thousands of electors that they refused to grant additional powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. No such circumstances surround this proposal, and there is an excellent prospect of an affirmative vote being recorded. Any fears that the Commonwealth Parliament will thereupon embark on an iconoclastic policy are unfounded. It will not set out to abolish State Parliaments by a stroke of the pen, but will address itself to the cutting out of superfluities, and the removal of duplications. We may decide that in the interests of Australia State governors are no longer necessary, and that the Crown could be adequately represented by the Governor General. We may propose the amalgamation and co-ordination of the activities of the various State ancl Commonwealth bodies now engaged in scientific teaching and research. There are many ways in which the increased power could be exercised without causing any sudden disruption of the existing governmental systems. The pioneers of federation never anticipated that difficulty would be experienced in altering the Constitution to meet the changing needs of the people. The frequent reiteration by the High Court of the constitutional limitations imposed upon this Parliament has created the impression amongst the people that the country is governed by that tribunal. There is no way of removing that impression while conflict continues between the States and the Commonwealth regarding their respective in>-isdictions. When the Pederal Parliament has complete powers the people will no longer doubt that it is the dominant factor in the public life of Australia. The Constitution should be brought up to date.

If the members of all parties in Parliament unite to recommend this change to the people, it will probably be accepted. We must make the people trust the Parliament.

This afternoon the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), in a speech which was clever rather than logical, was pleased to take as his text the words, "" Trust the people."" I think we can all take that as our text. The founders of federation -the men who framed the Constitution -ha d in mind the fact that there might be violent changes of government.

56,Mr White (Balaclava) [8.31],"Therefore they deliberately refrained from giving Parliament power to alter the Constitution. They proposed . that the people themselves should be the ultimate arbiters as to whether the Constitution was to stand or not. They meant to ensure that the Constitution should not be the plaything of politics. I believe they were opposed to unification. The balance of opinion among the royal commissioners on the Constitution was also against unification, as is shown by the following words:It seems to us that tlie concentration of all legislative and executive functions in one authority would he likely to produce that paralysis at the centre aud anaemia at the circumference which has ibeen referred to by some writers on political science. Australia is of such huge dimensions that a parliament functioning at Canberra could not possibly do justice to all the outlying parts. Therefore, the framers of the Constitution created that instrument substantially as we have it to-day. In that they were wiser than we sometimes give them credit for. At the present moment we have a government, "" clothed with a little brief authority"" endeavouring by legislative action to abolish the Constitution. The Prime Minister pointed out that there is no constitution such as ours in Great Britain, nor in New Zealand, nor in South Africa. That is true, but in these countries there are not separate State have. The States here are definitely partners to the federation agreement, and must be consulted before alteration can be made to that agreement. The only case which is almost analogous is that of the United States of America. There the Constitution is somewhat similar to ours, which, we are told, was modelled upon it. In South Africa powers were conferred primarily on the Union Government, and certain of those powers were afterwards delegated to the provincial authorities. The Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) asked us to treat this in a non-party way. One speaker attacked the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) for allegedly dealing with the subject from a party point of view. however, to approach it in any other Mr White way when one considers what this Government has done during its brief tenure of office? By making plausible promises during the recent election campaign, the Labour party was returned to power. Immediately it destroyed the existing democratic system of national defence. It piled on customs taxation in many cases 'without reference to the needs of the industries concerned, and ignoring in a great measure the expert advice of the Tariff Board. It now endeavours to save itself by pointing out that these are desperate times, and, as part of an anaemic official statement, has asked the wheat-growers to produce more wheat. That is' a sound request because the more we grow for export the better; but does it not imply that production should also be increased in other industries, and that there should be more work and harder work all round ? It cannot be denied that the appeal to the farmers to grow more wheat is also an appeal to them to do more work and for longer hours, although the farmers are even now as hard-working a section as there is in the community. Yet the Government did not urge the coal-miners to hew more coal. During the election campaign the Treasurer said that under a Labour Government disabled soldiers would be given posts in the Civil Service. No more despicable promise was ever made for political purposes. No attempts has been made to put this governments such as ' we into effect; but on . the contrary there have been dismissals. He also said that the coal-mines would be opened within a fortnight. Not only did he make that promise, but on the strength of it he obtained funds from the miners, thus preying on the hopes of workless men for his own political purposes. In view of these things, how is it possible for honourable members on this side of the House to treat the Government's proposal in a non-party manner?

The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) attributed all the blame to the Bruce-Page Government. It is a pity he should allow his disappointed hopes to warp his judgment. The principal factor is that there is a world-wide depression at present, and Australia is. feeling the pinch because of the low prices that are ruling for wheat and wool, which means a large decrease in the national income. This Government could, however, do a good deal to restore confidence in Australia if it dealt . firmly with the industrial trouble-makers in the Commonwealth, who are at present doing everything possible to prevent our industries from prospering. Prance has shown us what can be done by a nation which makes a determined effort to put its house in order. She suffered severely from the devastation of war, but took her industrial position in hand with such success that to-day France is prospering and has very little unemployment within her borders. If this Government could avoid taking a narrow and parochial view of industry it could do a good deal for Australia; but it must get away from the iron-bound principle of government by the unions for the unions in the name of the working class. Honourable members generally will admit that our export coal trade was of great value to us a few years ago, and was of considerable importance in our trade balance. If the Government would of our trade balance, and seek to restore peace in the coal industry by urging the coal-miuers to resume work and increase their output it would do a great deal for Australia; it is not only the wheat-farmers who should be called upon to increase their output. A study of the figures in relation to our coal production is enlightening. In 1925 we exported 1,770,000 tons of coal, but in 1928 we exported only 1,130,000. The exports of coal from New South Wales to the other States in 1925 totalled 3,000,000 tons, and in 192S only 2,270,000. The consumption of coal in New South Wales So far the in 1925 was 6,600,000 tons, and in 192S it was only 6,000,000 tons Those figures reveal a decrease in consumption of over I do not suggest that 2,000,000 tons per annum. On account of the coal trouble during 1929 the output was considerably less. If normal conditions had prevailed, the 6,000 odd men who will be left unemployed when the trouble is settled could have been kept employed. Wc all hope sincerely that this unfortunate trouble, which has caused so much misery and has had such a disturbing effect on the economic life of the community, will be speedily settled. But conditions are such now that the demand for coal has decreased very seriously from various causes. Had the demand not dropped, these men could have been absorbed in the industry. It is ridiculous for some honourable members to argue that more production mean move unemployment. One of the important factors that has brought about the decrease in the demand for coal is price. In 1916 coal Avas 12s. a ton in New South Wales, and in 1927 it Avas £1 6s. Id. From being the world's cheapest in 1911, it became the highest in",43,Setup

The popularity of electric power has, of course, had an adverse effect upon coal consumption, and so has the use of oil fuel which is now largely used in ships and in oil furnaces in foundries. .But when all is said and done, the plain fact remains would have been a contented comchat these unfortunate strikes and the uncertainty of supply have been the principal factors in reducing output and consumption. For many years, the manufacturers of Victoria were practically under industrial vassalage to the New South Wales coal industry, but that has now been adjusted, except in regard to high grade coal for certain specific purposes, through the development of the Yallourn coal deposits in Victoria under the superintendence of Sir John Monash. A. study of the causes of the foolish and through stoppages there have been enorfrequent strikes of recent years gives food for thought. There was the case of the cessation of work at Wallarah colliery because a boy objected to the smell of a horse's breath. deputy was killed at Rothbury colliery, and because the management insisted upon the miners carrying safety lamps for their own protection the men went on strike for several months. At the Redhead colliery the men. went on strike for three months for a trivial reason, and shortly after their return they were chide'd by the younger men for returning, so went on strike again for three years. closed permanently. Colliery-proprietors, like other employers, have to conduct their affairs on business lines. All colliery-owners are not John Browns. There are many small colliery-owners who have to work on an overdraft, and these cannot maintain operations and pay overhead expenses when men go on strike ancl there is no production. Since 1919 £8,562,000 has been lost in wages iu the coal-mining industry through strikes. If the levies that have been paid by unions were added to that amount it would be found that 24,000 coal-miners have lost no less than £9,700,000 since 1919, which is equal to about £400 per employee. If some of that money had been put into coal-mining shares through the miners' organizations or otherwise the workers would now have a substantial interest in the industry I would have been no need for this referendum. munity, ancl would not now be listening to industrial Neros fiddling the same old class-war tunes. Many of the miners would have become little capitalists through having a direct financial interest in the industry. It is well-known that some unions in the United States of America own mines and other properties. Their members arc, in most cases, well above the bread line instead of being impoverished through industrial agitation. In addition to the losses that have occurred in the coal-mining industry mous losses in other avenues of trade, though the actual losses in coal production through the present stoppage exceeds £3,000,000 New South Wales has lost Three years ago a about £300,000 in railway freights aloiic.

I undercluding members of this Government, but stand that about the time when the Prime Minister's name appeared in the list of honours, he being made a P.O., the Labor Daily wrote that I may add the letters B.L. to my name, which, I understand, means "" black-leg."" From such a quarter I consider this a compliment. One of the difficulties in the situation on the northern coal-fields has been caused by the dole system instituted by. the previous Labour government of New South Wales. The time came when the Government had to take stock of the situation. It appointed a royal commission to inquire into the whole industry. But as royal commissions are necessarily slow, a preliminary inquiry was instituted into the profits of best legal brains? the colliery-owners, which were found to average 2s. per ton. The royal commission reported later that the profits averaged 2s. l ^ d . per ton. In an endeavour to stabilize the industry and prevent drastic wage reduction and unemployment a proposition was made to reduce the price of coal for local consumption by 4s. brought about by the New South Wales Government reducing the cost of handling by 2s. per ton, the mine-owners foregoing Is. per ton of their profits, which meant a reduction of approximately 50 per cent., and the miners foreaward in the metal industry saidgoing Is. per ton, which in the case of contract workers meant 12$ per cent, and in the case of wages men 6d. per day. That proposition really started the trouble, although the industry had not been in a flourishing condition for some years. of tlie miners on the northern field were working only seven days a fortnight. Every one but the miners could see that if the price of coal could be reduced the reduction in price it would have been possible to regain some of the lost export trade. This proposition was accepted by the coal-owners but rejected by the miners, and the mines were closed. Many conferences have been held since. A levy was made on the trade unions to keep the miners in idleness, and a compromise was agreed upon by their leaders in the men refused to accept the terms offered to them. As a result, this unfortunate industrial dispute dragged on, accompanied by much lawlessness and this Government has no feasible proposition to put forward to end it. The members of the Ministry dare not get up in this House and tell the miners to go hack to work. the award. honourable member. The best legal brains say that there is no award operating in the northern coal-fields. recently ruled that the interim award was bad in law, and Judge Beeby himself has said that no award is operating. It is not necessary for this Government to have greater powers. If New South Wales were allowed to deal with its own industrial affairs, it would settle them This was to be well and efficiently. Interference in industry on the part of the Federal Government has caused a good deal of the present depression. For that reason T strongly oppose this bill. Judge Beeby when giving his last The far-reaching changes asked for made necessary exhaustive inquiry and the exploring of all available avenues of information. As the hearing proceeded, the claim made by employers that vital changes had occurred since the first award was made became irresisI n 1928 most tible. . . .

Coming to the question ot payment by results, Judge Beeby said that the employers' contention that if Australian manufacturers were to hold their own in the markets of the world they must adopt the methods of their competitors was irresistible. His appeals to the unions to submit to the court practicable schemes for the regulation of payment by results in place of their claims for prohibition were without avail . . . and until the unions were prepared to assist in devising schemes he could not undertake the task of prescribing regulations for the control of systems of payment by results. When an employer offered an additional wage as an incentive to output above the average, why should not the man above the average capacity be free to make a bargain on some system which would not injure those of average or less than average capacity or diligence? With all modern restrictions on individual action, individualism within its new boundaries was still the driving force of civilization. The unions' desire to proveut all systems of payment by results, as an aid to their retaining control of members beyond the limit contemplated by legislation, could not influence a court in making its awards. The present policy of unions would ultimately lead to union disintegration. Large numbers of men were working on piece-work or received time bonus increments. others wished to do so. Union prohibitions were steadily losing force. Economic pressure was convincing many out of employment or partially employed that there was something in employers' pleas for reduced production costs. I sider the wages that the miners were receiving in comparison with the wages of men in other industries. I do not say that the miners alone are culpable; because the blame for any arrangement made to increase the price of coal would have to be shared by the parties to it . In any case there has now to be some adjustment of the conditions ruling in the coal industry because of the economic position of Australia generally. I have mentioned already that I went to Rothbury and in vestigated the conditions of work there on my own behalf. I do not claim to be an authority on the subject of coal-mining, but I found there that the mine was being operated by a more or less scratch crew, ancl although the State member for the district had said that the mine was under ,what award the honourable member dangerous and hard to work, I found that was working when he was doing manual the men were hewing on an average about 14 tons a day. They were being paid at the rate of 4s. 4d. a ton, the miner receiving 2s. 7d., and the wheeler Is. 9d. That would be the equivalent of from £7 to £10 for a working week of 43 hours. In spite of the utterances of Judge Beeby that the workers must not expect higher wages, the miners have served a new demand for increased wages, a working week of 40 hours, and a minimum wage of £5 10s. a week, even if they work a few days a week. Is not that an insane' action in view of the known economic difficulties that exist ? The Prime Minister has been applauded in the press and elsewhere for not acceding to the demands of the extremists. I do not think that that is any occasion for congratulation. The crazy suggestions that the Pederal Government should despatch troops to Eothbury mine to fight the State police, or seize the closed mines, and other wild proposals put forward by leaders of the Labour organizations, would not be heeded by any man in his senses. Yet the GoMany vernment remained inactive while the New South Wales Government saved the nation. The Treasurer and the Assistant Minister( Mr. Beasley) went hot foot to conferences whenever the union officials beckoned. ask honourable members to conThere was no need to have increased powers to meet that emergency because the law of trespass was quite sufficient. Why did not the Government devise some means of settling this trouble? Until it is settled, the people are still more unlikely to give the Government power to alter the Constitution as it thinks fit. There is no need for the Commonwealth Parliament to have greater industrial powers in order to place Australia in a position of financial stability.

Any business man who has had anything to do with the Arbitration Court knows what a benefit that institution has been to the lawyer and union advocate.

This Government asks for more and more power, particularly in regard to disputes and lockouts. Its further interference in industry will bring about not only trouble on the coal-fields, but also disputes iu every other industry. The Government claims that its object is the maintenance of industrial peace. Such a claim must give rise to laughter.

I am confident that if the people were asked to vote upon the question of unification to-day, 85 per cent, of them would approve of it.

Could there be anything more unbusiness-like than the running of our railways? The co-ordination of the six different sets of management, with all that they imply, under a unified system, would certainly result in an enormous saving in overhead costs. Great Britain, South Africa and New Zealand possess the powers that we are asking the people of Australia to entrustto this Parliament. It may be said that we are flouting tlie will of the people by withdrawing from them the opportunity to express thenviews by way of a referendum. My reply to that is that any party which altered the Constitution to the detriment of the people would pay the price at the ensuing election. I could quote flagrant examples of the defeat of desirable legislation because of the existence of a weak constitution. In 1906 the High Court of Australia ruled that 123,000 railway men had no legal right to approach the Pederal Arbitration Court. That position continued until 1920, when the decision was reversed. Since 1920 the biggest transport service in this country has run uninterruptedly. But under the existing Constitution the position can be altered at the whim of a High Court that is differently constituted. These men may be told at any time that they are denied the right, which is enjoyed by other citizens of the Commonwealth, to have their case adjudicated upon by the Pederal Arbitration Court. I was greatly struck with the comments of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) with respect to the second question that it is proposed to place before the people.

I am disappointed at the attitude of honourable members opposite towards the proposal of the Government in relation to industrial powers. For many years they have been urging us to bring about industrial peace. I believed that they were sincere, and looked to them to give us their hearty support. I respect the legal knowledge that is possessed hy the Leader of the Opposition, but I challenge his industrial knowledge. Honourable members who sit opposite have not worked in any industry, nor have they at any time been compelled to join an organization to protect themselves; yet when they were in office, they endeavoured to foist upon the working people of Australia, legislation that was so harsh that they failed to survive an appeal to the people in October last. a cost of £110,000 to grant powers that they have previously refused to confer on this Parliament? give this Parliament the power to prevent what is occurring to-day on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales.

An interim award was made by Judge Beeby with a view to overcoming the difficulty. The owners were told that if they got the industry moving the court would later go into the details of their case.

The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) read extracts frotm the judgment of Judge Beeby in support of the argument that payment by results must be introduced if Ave are to save industry. It will be generally admitted that in regard to industry, America is the duction in the engineering trade it is land of "" speed u p "" and "" frame up."" Being the home of mass production, it is able to compete more successfully with other parts of the Avorld than can any portion of our Empire.

In all industry, including manufactures, the production in the same period increased by 29 per cent, with 2,000,000 feAver workers; and there were 5,000,000 unemployed. No man who has any industrial knoAvledge, or a sincere regard for his fellow beings, can argue that a greater amount of work Avill be done if the workers are engaged for a longer number of hours. ployed in the United States of America is less than 5 per cent, of the population, Avhilc in South Australia at the present moment it is 17"" per cent. ber believes that by men Avorking longer hours, the economic position of the mass of the people will be relieved, he has yet to learn the ABC of industrialism.

There has been a change throughout the world from the use of coal to the use of oil, and that has displaced tens of thousands of coal-Avorkers. There has also been a result that more men have been throAvn out of employment. The introduction of electric traction reduced the number of steam-driven vehicles in use throughout the Avorld, and the change from railway transport to road transport is displacing tens of thousands of raihvay men. We are IIOAV threatened with a further chauge from road transport to aerial transport, and that, again, will mean the displacement of a vast army of Avorkmen. Owing to the elimination of horse-drawn vehicles, the demand for chaff has practically ceased, with the result that great numbers of men have been deprived of their former employment.

If any honourable member opposite contends that the solution of the unemployed problem is to be found in longer hours of work, he has not learnt the rudiments of industrialism.

Unemployment relief cannot possibly be given as a State measure, because it will surely meet with opposition from the employing classes, who will say that it might handicap them in competition with industries in another State in which unemployment does not obtain. Queensland. a solution of the problem. If power to deal with employment and unemployment were granted to the Commonwealth Parliament, the Government could handle the problem on national lines. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister announce in his statement of the Government's policy that an unemployment relief bill would be introduced. I shudder to think what is likely to happen in this country in the next twelve months. I believe that, apart from the disabilities I have enumerated, the industrial position will demand full and complete control by this national Parliament. It will be the responsibility of members on both sides of the House to see that no person is left without means of sustenance during periods of unemployment. I do not suggest that the present position has been brought about by the late Government. I believe that it is due to some of the factors that I have mentioned, together with the unprecedented trade depression. I am most concerned about the relief measures to be adopted, and I am firmly convinced that, if this Parliament is armed with the industrial powers mentioned in the bill, we shall have gone a long way towards dealing with the problem on national lines. We shall then have the power to legislate with respect to every class of industry in Australia. On this matter I join issue with the Leader of the Opposition. In the discussion on the arbitration proposals last year, and again in. the debate to-day, be referred to what he called the great evil due to the overlapping awards of dual tribunals. becomes registered in the Pederal Court, it has no right to go to a State Court for an award. lian timber-workers case is a very recentone. cluded by J udge Lukiu, not at the request of the Western Australian branch of the Timber Workers Union. federal organization. later the subject of a High Court judgment. But that cannot be advanced as an argument against federal arbitration. In New South Wales, some 300 State awards still remain on the statute-book; but practically SO per cent, of them have been replaced owing to the unions going to the Pederal Court. In Victoria, a similar condition of affairs has come about in the railway industry. The Railways Commissioners objected that the railwaymen's union was already covered by a State award, and they demanded that the employees should either remain undur that award or accept an award of the Federal Court. The judge said that they had the option of adopting either course, but could not have it both ways. I maintain that that option can be exercised by every federal union in Australia. If the proposed increased powers are granted, the unions can be given the right to go to the Federal Arbitration Court, which is the natural corollary of a federated Australia. That court has done great work in the interests of the employees of this country. I would scrap every State court, and have one federal tribunal to deal with every aspect of industry from the lowest class of labouring man to the highest class of professional man. Mr Gut.LETT -I s that the intention of the Government? ter for the unions who would appear before the tribunal.

That proposal was defeated by only the small majority of 26,000 votes. Asn new member, that strikes me as being an amazing aspect of the voting on that occasion. defeated by a larger majority this time. flowed under fhe bridge in the last seventeen years. This issue was discussed at the election held on the 1.5th October, 1929, and wo know that the people of Australia almost unanimously supported the party that stood for the preservation of federal arbitration as an Australian institution. This Government wishes to amplify that system by making it workable in the interests of not only the trade unionists, but also of every citizen of the Commonwealth. I think that members of the Opposition should have admitted that this proposal was on all fours with the policy advocated by it for years. In 1925 the party opposite declared that it stood for industrial laws that would give peace in industry. We know what a mess they made of the amending legislation It was drafted by clever legal men, but they had no human outlook on industrial matters. asked the people to sanction the abandonment of the federal arbitration system. The Labour party advised the people not to allow the Nationalist Government to do that wrong, but pointed out that the Arbitration Act in its existing form was not operable to the satisfaction of either employers or employees, and that in order that it might be rendered effective fhe Commonwealth should be invested with f u l l powers to legislate in relation to industrial matters. that the existing defects in the arbitration system can be remedied. The first, proposal to give to this Parliament complete power to amend the Constitution is warranted by precedents, for that power is enjoyed by other Parliaments in the Empire. The exercise of it will not be an infringement of the rights of the people, because any government that induces the Parliament to sanction an alteration of the Constitution must face the people, and if , in their opinion, it has acted wrongly it will crash as the Bruce-Page Government crashed last year. In regard to the second bill relating to industrial powers, I remind the House that the last election was fought on the question of retaining the federal arbitration system. All parties were agreed that the existing act is unsatisfactory. The Labour party supported the retention of the act, but said that before it could be effectively A lot of water has improved greater power should, be given to this Parliament to function as the great, minds which framed the Constitution intended it to do. In 29 years changes have taken place, and the Constitution must be brought, into conformity with the conditions of industry to-day. T support the bills. honourable member for Bendigo( Mr. Keane) has dolefully forecasted an increase of unemployment and greater industrial troubles, and his only remedy is increased legislative interference. One would think that Australia, which' has approximately the area of the United States of America, and is endowed with great and varied natural resources, could support four or five times its present population. The honourable member must be made to realize that if we discontinue political Last year the Nationalists interfereuce with industry, set the people to work, and teach them that only by the production of wealth can they expect to enjoy good conditions, greater prosperity in the near future w ill be their reward. The honourable member spoke of the hundreds of thousands of pounds that would be saved if the railway systems were unified. What is the curse of the railways to-day? I am sure retaries. It is political interference from all quarters. If we compare the conditions iu Australia with those under which the railways in other countries operate we need no longer wonder why primary industries cannot be conducted, at a profit.

Much depends on what he means by progress. progress I want is that which is the result of the initiative of the people. I have only contempt for those who are always running to Parliament for special consideration, regardless of how it will injure not frankly ask for the repeal of section others. We have had an illustration of that recently in connection with the wine industry. This evil is partly due to the selfishness of members of Parliament who run about their constituencies offering favours and concessions, careless of what harm may be done to other sections of the community so long as they win votes for themselves. mitted to this Parliament could be more fitly described as a confidence trick than the bill introduced by the Prime Minister to give to this Parliament full power to amend the Constitution. ber is not in order in describing proposed legislation in that way. the Prime Minister, for whom I have a very high regard, should submit a proposal of this kind without making clear to the people what it means. The Constitution contains special safeguards for the smaller States. that, as time went on, alterations would be required to adjust the Constitution to changed conditions, and the necessary machinery for amending it is provided in section .128. In recent years tremendous advances have been made in regard to aviation, wireless, and other scientific developments, and I have little doubt that, if this Parliament applied to the people for greater power to deal with those matters, it would be willingly given. But alterations of the Constitution should be made, not by Parliament, but by the people. I appeal to the representatives of South Australia and Tasmania to visualize the probable effects of the Imperial Parliament when it passed the Constitution majority of the electors and a majority of the States should have power to amend the Constitution, except in regard to the minimum representation of the original States, the equal representation of the States in the Senate, and State boundaries. ' These could not be altered except with the consent of the people The of the State concerned. Because of these three reservations the people of Western Australia were induced the join the federation, and I resent that the Prime Minister, when introducing the bill, did 128, for there is no doubt that that will be the effect of his proposal to add these words in section 129i Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding section, the Parliament shall have full power to alter the Constitution in the following manner:The proposed law for the alteration No proposal ever subthereof must, after the lapse of one month from its origination in a house of the Parliament, be passed by an absolute majority of each house of the Parliament and be assented to by the Governor General. Not only does that destroy one of the safeguards which induced the smaller States to federate, but it is a departure from one of the guiding principles of the Labour party that, the people should be consulted in regard to any change of the Constitution. In future the people are not to be consulted. I contrast the attitude of the Government with the statement of Mr Bavin that he would not violate the Constitution by asking the Its framers knew Parliament to reform the Upper House without consulting the people. The New South Wales Parliament had the power to effect this change but as a vital principle was involved Mr Bavin insisted upon it being submitted to the people of his State. Yet the Labour party in this Parliament is asking the people to agree to an amendment of the Constitution whereby this Parliament may, in future without consulting the people, make any drastic changes in the Constitution that the majority party for the time being may desire. Clearly this proposal means unification, and the Government, should frankly declare that Government's proposals. The its objective is to make this Parliament supreme, so that it may Act agreed that a be able to dictate to the States, and even abolish the State Parliaments if it thinks fit. We must not forget the size of Australia and the diversity of its conditions.

106,Mr Gregory,"I am surprised that120,000,000 of people are living in prosperity. Australia, too, could be prosperous. If we repealed the legislation that hampers industry, and induced the people to realize that their progress and comfort must depend upon their own exertions, Australia would make the same progress as Canada has made. According to the last budget statement of the Canadian Minister for Finance, that dominion, which has the lowest tariff in the world, and whose people enjoy, good wages and industrial conditions, is able to boast that its exports of secondary products last year exceeded the whole of its exports in 1914. And this notwithstanding that Canada is competing with the United States of America, which has the advantage of greater development and mass production. The explanation is that the Canadian people do not attempt to interfere with economic laws in the stupid manner that we do. It is time the people of Australia resented the interference of flattering but self-seeking politicians. powerful section of the American people urged President Coolidge to seek greater power for the National Parliament. I quote from the World's Work of July, 1926The President of the United States went to Williamsburg, Virginia, where he made a plea for the power of State governments and the limitation of federal activity to its proper sphere. The most salient part of his speech wasNo method of procedure has ever been devised by which liberty could be divorced from self-government. No planof centralization has ever been adopted which did not result in bureaucracy, tyranny, inflexibility, reaction, and decline. Of all of it when it was created. If it had come forms of government those administered by bureaus arc about the least satisfactory to an enlightened and progressive people. Being irresponsible they become autocratic, and being autocratic they resist all supreme powers as are now requested. development. Unless bureaucracy is constantly resisted it breaks down representative democracy. It is the one element in our institutions that sets up the pretence of having authority over everybody and being responsible to nobody. While we ought to glory in the Union and remember that it is the source from which the States derive their chief title to fame, we must also recognize that the national administration is not, and cannot be adjusted to the needs of local government. It ia too far away to be informed of local needs, too inaccessible Parliament would be tragic for the smaller to be responsive to local conditions. The States should not be induced by coercion or by favour to surrender the management of their own affairs. The Federal Government ought to resist the tendency to be loaded up with duties which tlie States should perform. It does not follow that because something ought to be done the national government ought to do it . That is the opinion of the President of the United States of America after three years' experience in office. He urged the people of the United States of America to retain their Constitution which gave the federal authority f u l l control of national affairs and left to the State the control of domestic affairs. Under the Constitution of the United States of America, the Pederal Government has less power than has been given to this Parliament. We have, greater power than the Canadian Central Government has under the Canadian Constitution. A great many powers have been conferred on the AustralianFederal Parliament under section 51 of the Constitution, and of these how many have we In 1926 a ever tried to avail ourselves? Nevertheless, we are all the time stretching out for further control of industry, trade, and commerce which, under the Constitution, have been left entirely to the States. All the evils of bureaucracy and official control outlined by President Coolidge would operate from Canberra under these proposals. The people have frequently been asked to grant wider powers to the Federal Parliament, out on only three occasions have those powers been conceded. The reason is that the people have not trusted this Parliament. The Federal Parliament has not lived up to what the people expected up to expectations, I am confident that when extra powers were wanted they would have been granted, but not such I wish to enter an appeal here government and overwhelms on behalf of the smaller States, particularly Western Australia. We know what it would mean to the smaller Statesi f these drastic powers were conferred on the Federal Parliament. A decade ago South Australia had many thriving industries. Where are they now? The result of a further extension of powers to the Federal States. If the affairs of tiie whole Commonwealth were dominated by New South Wales and Victoria, as they would be under a supreme national Parliament, conditions in the smaller States would be bad indeed. As regards Western Australia, I wish to make it quite clear where I stand. If these extra powers ure granted, and the Pederal Parliament breaks faith with Western Australia, I .shall get out and spend the rest of my life trying to induce the people of that State to secede from federation. During the last three or four months I have received a great number of letters from people iu Western Australia, urging that we should retire from federation. It is true that we agreed to become part of an indissoluble Commonwealth, but it was ou certain conditions, arid if those condimitted by the Bruce-Page Government in tions arc not fulfilled, the contract is broken, and we are free to act as we think fit. The Government is seeking power to alter the Constitution in any way it pleases. It is seeking to take away from the States the control of trade within the able member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) States, and to give supreme power over such matters to the Federal Parliament, even to the extent of controlling the issue to us including the whole of the Labour of M pedlar's licence. member not trust the people? Government has shown that it docs not. If it did it would be content to leave to the people power to effect such alterations in the Constitution as they desired, instead of which it seeks that power for itself. Even the Labour party's own repreany trade or calling. It is asking that sentatives on the Royal Commission upon the Constitution were not prepared to grant the powers asked for under this proposal. Those representatives were not in favour of granting Parliament power to extend its own life, nor to alter the principle of adult franchise, but if this amendment to the Constitution is carried the Federal Parliament will have full power to do both those things. It will also have power to interfere with the land settlement policy of the States, and with the minimum representation of the States in the Senate. Section7 of the Constitution provides that representation in the Senate shall be as follows:Until tlie Parliament otherwise provides, there shall be six senators for each original State. The Parliament may make law» increasing or diminishing the number oi senators for each State, but so that equal representation of the several original States shall be maintained, and that no original State shall have less than six senators. Under these proposals, while, it might not be possible to get rid of the Senate at once, it would be possible for the Federal Parliament to alter the basis of representation so as to give the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales complete control by allowing representation on a population basis for the Senate with the ultimate intention of doing away with the second chamber. The second proposal of the Government is very different from that subthe referendum of 1926. ber support the 1926 proposal. it. If the honourable member knew anything of parliamentary proceedings he would know that two members, the honorand myself divided the House on that issue. There were 70 members opposed members, but we judged the wishes of the people better than they. The Brucehonorable Page Government on that occasion did not ask for nearly so drastic powers as are being sought now regarding industrial control. It merely asked that Parliament have power to create courts to deal with industrial legislation; but this Government is asking that the Federal Parliament should have power to pass legislation to control conditions in Parliament should have power to pas; legislation for a working week of 22 hours, as advocated hy the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane). ber for Bendigo said nothing of the kind. coming to that. At any rate, it is proposed that this Parliament should have power to fix the hours of labour in various industries. Do we really want such power, or do we want to leave it to the court? Personally, I do not believe in the Arbitration Court at all. It has been the cause of a great deal of trouble in industry.

If it has such power, it is quite possible that some parliament in the future w ill exercise it . It has been said that the people decided in favour of Commonwealth arbitration at the last election. I deny that. It is true that the Bruce-Page Government desired the election to turn on the arbitration issue, but, unfortunately, many other questions were raised during the campaign. Por instance, the move to discontinue the office of Public Service Arbitrator antagonized the Public Service. Then the budget proposals, which provided for the imposition of additional taxation upon the motion picture industry, caused every theatre in Australia to be used in a campaign against the Government. Proposed increases in taxation on motorists antagonized a large class of electors, and the publicans and brewers were also aggrieved by certain proposals of the Government. In addition to that, the Labour party promised to do all hinds of things to restore peace in the coal industry. The result was t'hat the people did not give a verdict upon the retention or abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. However, this subject has been considered by the electors. In 1926, the Bruce-Page Government submitted certain proposals to the people with the object of enlarging the Commonwealth power in connection with industry and commerce. These were endorsed by the Labour party. I believe that 70 members of this House voted in favour of them. MrA . S. Rodgers, who was then the member for Wannon, and myself divided the House on the subject. In directly, if not directly, the Labour party announced that although it desired to secure other alterations to the Constitution, it would do its utmost to get the people to accept the proposals submitted by the Government. What was the result? In the division of Dalley, 12,411 electors voted in favour of the proposed law, and 24,455 against it . tive of that division was the only Labour member who voted against the proposals. Labour member in either House voted against the Bruce Government's proposal. I give the following details of t.hp. voting in other strong Labour divisions in New South Wales:Division For Against Cook .. 9,858 .. 20,329 East Sydney .. 13,834 .. 18,187 Newcastle .. 15,804 .. 27,480 Reid .. . . 21,332 .. 29,055 South Sydney .. 20.532 22,179 Werriwa .. 10,383 .. 21,490 .West Sydney .. 8,075 .. 23,142 returned a majorit y in favour of the alteration. was a small majority.

Yet. the voting in that constituency was 3.4,148 in favour of the proposed law and 24,741 against it .

I should like a responsible Minister to inform me what is meant by the words "" terms and conditions of labour, and employment in any trade, industry, profession, or calling."" It seems to me that if this Parliament is to consider matters of that description honourable members will be pestered by lobbyists to a greater extent than they are now pestered with them in regard to the tariff. We shall have the representatives of every small industry making requests to us for special consideration. utterly absurd. Parliament to a great extent is to take the place of an arbitraonly one that is paying expenses. tion court. I should also like an explanation of the term "" the maintenance of industrial peace."" What more does the Government think it can do to maintain industrial peace if this proposed alteration is agreed to ? The phrase seems to me to be very far-reaching and to my mind would give the Government power to nationalize industries if it thought that doing so would maintain industrial peace. I am firmly convinced that the people refused in 1926 to clothe this Parliament with additional power because they lack confidence in it. This Parliament has caused a great deal of ill feeling to grow up between the States and the Commonwealth because of the manner in which it has encroached upon the State authority. The entry of the Commonwealth into the sphere of industrial legislation was an encroachment on State rights. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that the Commonwealth should have authority over industry except in relation to shipping and other work of a similar national character. The fact that the Commonwealth has assumed power to determine the working conditions of State railway employees has also caused a great deal of ill feeling. An arbitration court judge rode on a locomotive some time ago with the object of gaining some knowledge of the work of enginedriving. It is abominably and contemptibly absurd for us to authorize judges to Mr Gregory fix the conditions of work on the State railways. The Canadian system of agreement between the employees and those in control is well worth examination. Practically every State railway system is to-day working at a big loss. In New South Wales many employees have been dismissed, and others are working on short time in order to provide employment for a greater number of men and to a big extent this is due to federal interference. on the railway system of Western Australia are not governed by Commonwealth awards. Western Australian railway system is the callings in the railway systems of South Australia, Queensland, or New South Wales are subject to Commonwealth awards. however, that Commonwealth awards have greatly interferred with railway operations in all the States. It is an encroachment on the rights of the State, a violation of the Constitution, and so impracticable and absurd a method that I wonder at it being tolerated for a moment. The Commonwealth also encroached upon State rights in connection with the new 'protection and the savings bank business. A special condition was inserted in the Constitution to ensure that the States would continue to have the benefit of the State Savings Bank business after federation. But the Commonwealth Government took away the goodwill that had been created through the post-offices doing State Savings Bank business and robbed the States of the control of the savings of the people. When we are in committee on the Constitution Industrial Powers BillI intend to move an amendment which will give the people the opportunity of indicating clearly whether they desire Commonwealth arbitration or State arbitration. They cannot have both.' It must be one or-the other. The people have never had these alternatives clearly submitted to them at the same time.

They should be given an opportunity of saying whether full control should be given to the Commonwealth in respect of. industry, or whether the Commonwealth should retire from the industrial field and leave its control in the hands of the States. interstate disputes? and commerce which, as explained by the Leader of the Opposition, affect seamen, should be controlled by the Commonwealth and this can be done under Trade and Commerce powers, but outside of that and so far as the industrial laws are concerned, the control should be left in the hands of the States. I have placed an amendment on the notice-paper, which will give the electors an opportunity of saying which power should control industry-Pedera l or State. It has been given publicity and I propose to move it when we are in committee. this Parliament accepts the proposal to alter the Constitution and it is approved by the people of Australia, Western Australia will consider that it has been treated disloyally and dishonorably by the Federal Parliament, and there will be such a cry for secessiou that nothing on earth will stop it, and the destruction of the federation of Australia will inevitably follow. adjourned.

130,Mr Price (Boothby) [10.38],"Iconsiderable inconvenience to the inhabitants. It occurred on the 27 th December last, two days after Christmas. Similarfloodstook place in October, 1924, that many of them are unemployed ancl February, 1925, and May, 1925. On each occasion the inhabitants suffered severe damage to their properties. The houses concerned are workers' homes and were built by the State Bank. ""Whether these houses should have been built by the State Bank in that particular locality is Military Hospital and see the position for another matter altogether. The question now is-wh o is going to compensate these unfortunate persons for the damage done to their properties? The previous Government built the drain through the military grounds at Keswick in order to carry water through State property. But instead of building an open drain, the Defence Department built a closed in drain with two cylinder concrete pipes. I am not an engineer, but.1 should holders. I have just, received a letter say that it should have provided an open drain like that which carries the water from the showground on to the military hospital grounds. After the 1925 flood, and when the Federal Government placed the drain through its property, the inhabitants on the flooded area were given an assurance that there would be no more trouble from storm waters, yet, as I have related, on the 27th December, 1929, the drain overflowed, and a number of the residents living in the neighbourhood were flooded out. The names of those who suffered most were Mrs. Cummings, a widow with a large family, Mr G. G. Donaldson, Mr member. Three inches of rain within W. Hankwell, Mr A. Foura and Mr twelve' hours in a place like Adelaide, W. Harris. The water flowed right through their houses, and on the day of the flood when I visited the site I saw their furniture floating about in the rooms. In the case of Messrs. W. E. Surman, H . Kiley, Joyce, and Henderson, the flood waters filledtheir backyards, came up to the houses and caused considerable damage and inconvenience. In the case of Mr R. Becker, who lives on the opposite side of Maple Terrace, the water crossed the road, flooded his garden, and came right up to the foundations of his house. This is a very important matter to those concerned. All these residents are living in State bank houses. They are workers who have been struggling to make homes for themi f r . Price selves and their families. The flood has caused them no end of expense, which they can ill afford, and I regret to say have been so for many months. I want to pay a tribute to the Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green) for the prompt action he took on receipt of my telegram. On his way to Western Australia he was good enough to visit the Keswick himself. In addition, he instructed his responsible officers to give him a full report. He has replied to all my correspondence, but it does not seem to meet the case, because the same old drain built by the' previous Government is being re-installed. I take up the position that someone, whether it be the Federal Government or the State Bank, ought to pay compensation to these unfortunate housefrom the Unley City Council asking me to arrange for the Minister to meet representatives of the council and those concerned on the spot. I realize that that cannot be done while the House is in session, but in the meantime I feel that the responsibility to pay compensation should be shouldered by some one, and I ask the Government to give the matter its earnest attention. for Defence) [10.45] I was on my way to Western Australia on the day prior to the flood referred to by the honourable situated as it is within a circle of mountains, caused a serious flood, and as the channel provided to carry away the waters from the Keswick Barracks was designed to meet ordinary conditions, the Defence Department disclaims any responsibility in connection with wha', happened. The engineers of the department claim that they have taken every precaution by providing two drain pipes, approximately 5 feet in diameter, underground for a considerable distance, and that this provision will cops with all the water that is likely to pass over the ground. They blame the municipal council for not providing a clear getaway. There is no proper drain to provide an outlet for",59,Adjournment Workers Homes At Keswick
131,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie,"Ministe rthe waters that leavethe Defence Department's property, and consequently there is a block, as I saw for myself when I passed some distance along the channel. It is claimed that it was a mistake to build houses in a low area which has been flooded from time to time; but the department has built up un embankment to try to dam back tbe water in future and protect the houses that suffer. The engineers claim that if the local council will open the drain below the defence property the drainage'already provided by the department is sufficient to carry off any ordinary storm water. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) will have no occasion for further complaints as far as my department is concerned, and that the oounCil, the representatives of which he is anxious for me to meet, will accept the view of the departmental engineers and provide a proper outlet for the waters below the Defence Department's property. If they do so, there should be no trouble in the future.' Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.49 p.m.",60,Adjournment Workers Homes At Keswick
