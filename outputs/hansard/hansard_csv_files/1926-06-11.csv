37,Mr Gregory (Swan) [11.16],"I demature consideration, we shall not be acting fairly or justly to the people of this country. [11.19] I ask the Prime Minister whether the motion before the House refers only to Monday next? I join with other honourable members in protesting against this motion. What excuse can there be for putting this extraordinary pressure on honourable members ? Six months have elapsed since the general election, but for how long has the Parliament been in session? Parliament is lef t idle for months at a time; but now that we are asked to amend the Constitution, and to disturb the foundations on which the States have built their financial arrangements, we are asked to sit here for five days of the week, and are forced to devote the rest of it to travelling. England during this year. The state of It cannot be done. What can be the reason for the motion? The answer is that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) is going to England, and for five months while he remains away we shall be doing nothing. When I was in charge of the Government, and the present Treasurer sat on one of the cross benches, I was told that I could go to England, and no unfair advantage would be taken of my absence. The Parliament remained open during my absence for the discussion of public business. The proposal to sit on five days a week approaches a scandal. The Prime Minister lives within almost a few yards of Parliament House, and his constituency could be visited in half-anhour; but many other honourable members cannot get to their homes so easily. Honourable members representing the metropolitan ney and Adelaide are expected to go home at the week-end, and when public duty aud Christian morality point in the same direction, what are we to think of a government that deliberately flouts both by placing an embargo upon our movements? It w ill be impossible for me to journey to Sydney and return between now and Monday. It is the custom of Parliament to sit on certain days of the week, and members accordingly make arrangements for the days upon which they w ill ordinarily be free. These arrangements are now to be upset because the Prime Minister is leaving for England at the end of August. The Government's proposal is not f a i r to the (South Sydney) people of this country. W it h in a few weeks they are expected to understand the proposals for the referendum and the discontinuance of the per capita payments. Having disposed of those measures and discussed the budget, we are to shut up Parliament for six months. If the Treasurer were placed in charge of the House while the Prime Minister was away his reign might last a week, but no longer. The PrimeM in ister would not trust him. It is a fine state of affairs when the head of a section of the Government which is supported by an ample majority cannot be left in charge of Parliament. Honourable members would do well to pre vent the Prime Ministerf r o m visiting European affairs, commercially, financially, and industrially, is so chaotic that statesmen have little time to discuss proposals that may be submitted to the I m perial Conference.

It s object is to permit the Prime Minister to visit Great Brita in to attend the Imperial Conference, which is to be held at the most inopportune time in the history of the Empire. I am a friend of the Emconstituencies of Sydpire, and I love the race from which I have sprung. I desire to see unanimity and concord prevail among the various parts of the Empire. Important legislation,, dealing with Commonwealth and State finances, should not be rushed through Parliament.

44,Mr Speaker,"I ask the honorablecerns the Prime Minister's proposed visit to England. I could give many reasons why it should not be agreed to, but I have no doubt that the Prime Minister delights in visiting London and in interviewing royalty and the nobility. This, however, is not a sufficient reason for causing this House to unduly rush its work. statesmen of Great Britain are at their wits' end to find remedies for the social disorders there, and I am sure that they, as well as the statesmen of South Africa and Canada, would welcome a postponement of the Imperial Conference. The Prime Minister is not willing to leave Australia while Parliament is in session. cannot trust the conduct of its business to has happened, I cannot offer any objechis colleague, the Treasurer. If he did, he would not be able to sleep on the journey Home. I enter my protest against this proposal. Nobody sympathizes more than I do with honourable members who will find themselves inconvenienced by the House meeting on Monday, but I think it only fair to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) that I should relate what has occurred between us in regard to the matter. A fortnight ago certain proposals were hurriedly introduced here. The Pederal Executive of the Labour party met in Melbourne at my request to consider them, and I mentioned to the Prime Minister that I thought it would be unfair to push on with the discussion until we had been given some opportunity to formulate our views. He at once agreed to allow two or three days for that purpose, but made it quite clear that the matter must be determined by this House by a certain date. week. Thc business had to be sent on to the Senate on that date, the Prime Minister told me. I said that it would probably be possible to get it through in a fortnight, but I could give no guarantee other than that honourable members of the Labour party would do the fair thing in the matter. I think that they have done that. viewed the Pripie Minister again, and asked him what day he proposed to ask the House to meet next week. He replied that it would be necessary to reassemble on Monday in order that the business could be sent on to the Senate by Tuesday. I could not give him any undertaking that if he did not call honorThe able members together on Monday it would be ready by Tuesday. It would have been improper for me to bind honourable members in that way. Nobody is more inconvenienced than I am by the proposed meeting on Monday. I have been in Melbourne for some time, and I suppose nobody has to apply himself more closely to the matters under discussion. tion to the Monday meeting, but I may have something to say later as to the propriety of dealing with business like this. AlthoughI am Leader of the Opposition, I intend to play the game fairly. If it could be arranged for honourable members to re-assemble on Tuesday, it would certainly meet my convenience, but in view of the fact that the Prime Minister consented to my own proposals in the matter, I considered it only right that I should make this explanation. The Prime Minister is the head of the Government, and the Government is responsible for the business of Parliament. All that honourable members on this side of the chamber can do is to look after the interests of their constituents to the best of their ability. The proposal to sit ou Monday of next week has been talked over for a fortnight. As a matter of fact, when the Prime Minister first mentioned extra sitings to me, he said that it might be necessary for the House to sit on Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday to get the business through. I replied then, that I did not think that would be necessary. It is highly desirable that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) should give honourable members generally as much notice as possible of the intention of the Government to ask Parliament to sit on additional days. As the Labour party Whip, I know that a good many honourable members on this side of",18,Adjournment Member Should Ask His Leader Whether He

Senate will not meet until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, and an important bill was passed on to it last night, it seems to me that it will have sufficient business to ensuggestion that the Government would gage its attention for at least two or three days. I am not in a position to promise the Prime Minister anything, but I can say, without reservation, that honourable members on this side of the chamber will do the fair thing in connection with the business before the House. and Minister for External Affairs) [11.41] -In view of the statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) there is little need for me to say much in rebuttalof the charge of discourtesy levelled against me by the honourable inember for Dalley( Mr Mahony), but I emphatically repudiate it. The House will have gathered from what the Leader of tbe Opposition has said, that there was no discourtesy whatever. It has been definitely understood for some time that it would be necessary to sit extra days to get particular items of business through. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition asked me whether I could say definitely on what days the House would sit. I replied that I thought it would not be necessary to ask honourable members to sit on Saturday, but that it would be necessary to call them together on Monday. I was prepared to sit on either Saturday or Monday, and I was given to understand that it would be more convenient to sit on Monday than on Saturday. I agree that it is desirable that the Government should give honourable members as much notice as possible of its intention to alter the ordinary sitting [116] days. The question of Tuesday sittingswas raised nearly two weeks ago, but as the Government had no opportuuity to give honourable members notice of it, no I action was taken; though it was quite definitely understood that the House would have to sit extra days this week and nexi week. I believe that I can be exonerated from the charge of intentional discourtesy to honourable members, or of causing them avoidable inconvenience. I hardly like to suggest that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) would delibeSome rately accuse the Governmeut of adopting unscrupulous methods in dealing with a bill in which he is particularly interested, As the but, as a matter of fact, he has completely misrepresented the position. A few days ago he asked me a question in regard to that bill, and I repudiated the descend to improper methods in dealing with it ; but the honourable gentleman's remarks this morning would undoubtedly leave the impression on the minds of all but those who are intimately acquainted with the procedure of this House that tlie Government had brought the bill down in some extraordinary way, and that by suspending the Standing Ordersi t intended to rush it through and stifle proper discussion on it.

As to his statement that the reason for the procedure is that I intend to be present at the Imperial Conference, I can only say that that question does not arise in connection with the decision to meet on Monday. He also referred to the "" s h u t t in g u p "" of this Parliament, and to certain things which, he said, were about to happen, and on the whole he appeared to be better informed on that subject than on the proposal to meet next Monday. I have not made any announcement as to whether this House w ill sit in my absence. The right honourable gentleman proceeded on the assumption that it would not sit, and he made some gratuitously insulting remarks about the honourable the Treasurer which I very much deprecate. those remarks, and they were quite uncalled for from him. No one but the right honourable gentleman himself can connect those remarks with the motion under consideration. I regret that so much time should bave been occupied in discussing this matter, but it is essential that these measures should be passed by this House by the time. I have indicated. I remind honourable members that the Government is the authority to determine how the business of this House shall be conducted, ancl it cannot be dictated to by any one; but in arranging for the conduct of business the Government will, as far as possible, meet the convenience of honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. ( ESSENTIAL SERVICES) BILL . Debate resumed from 20th May (vitle Tliat the bilf he now read a second time. This bill, according to the right honourable the Prime Minister, is designed to ensure If he did not know to the people foodstuffs, services, and other essentials to the industrial and physical existence of Australia. It differs considerably from any of the other referendum proposals that we have been disI did not know, and I cussing. This is the first occasion on which such a proposal for a referendum has been placed before this Parliament. We have had 25 years' experience of federation, and there has been no evidence that this Parliament, or the State Parliaments, have not had sufficient powers to provide essential services. It is strange, seeing that a constitutional session is proposed to be held next year, that a bill of this land should be rushed through with the other proposals that we have been considering. No one can contend that this is an urgent matter, and it is on the grounds of urgency that the proposal for increased industrial powers is submitted. If there is no urgency, why should the Parliament be asked to consider this question now ? Leader of the Opposition does not consider the bill urgent, why did he agree to give the Government an extra day for the consideration of it? give the Government an extra day for the consideration of it . I have explained why I voted for a meeting on Monday next. The Government fixes the days of sitting. The rushing through of these proposals is unfortunate for the country, and may militate against their acceptance by the people. the pact ? honourable tbe Prime Minister referred to occurrences in other countries, but I submit that we'are not so much concerned with what has happened in other countries as with what has happened in our own country. It doe's not necessarily follow, because certain action was taken recently in Great Britain, that tliis Parliament should ask for drastic powers to deal with industrial troubles in this country. Although this bill is not linked with the request for greater industrial powers, the only possible assumption is that it is intended to give power to control situations that might arise during industrial",20,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The right honourable the Prime Minister admitted that this Parliament could deal with persons who interfered with essential services, and such powers have been exercised by the Pederal and State Governments whenever they deemed it necessary. passed legislation providing for the deportation of certain persons, but that legislation, fortunately, was subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. ""We have also passed legislation fixing the penalties for certain offences under the Crimes Act, and, in addition, there are penalties in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and in the criminal and civil law. There is a conspiracy law that can be brought into operation against any one who conspires to do anything detrimental to the interests of this country. There has been no demand for additional powers, and unless the Government desires unification, 1 see no justification for asking for more powers than this Parliament has to-day. If the Government's object is unification, it should seek every possible power; but it is careful to point out that it does not favour unification, and does not intend to interfere with the powers of the States to any great extent. That being so, I find it the more difficult to understand the Government's motives in submitting this bill. the Prime Minister as a reason for the bill was the existing trouble in the coal trade. But even if the power which the Government is seeking was possessed by it, coal could not be produced. It is impossible to make men work if they will not work, for they are entitled, if they give proper notice, to cease their employment. The working man's capital is his muscle, and if he cannot obtain sufficient ' the largest coal strikes in this country. reward aud satisfactory conditions in a certain employment, naturally he refuses to work. Industrial disputes will continually arise, however much we may seek to avoid them. The object of taking the referendum is to give greater powers to this Parliament to prevent disputes. We recognize that disputes cannot be entirely prevented, and that they will occur in spite of the best legislation that can be devised. The fault is not always on the one side, for employers are frequently to blame. although frequently responsible, will not be penalized by the exercise of the power sought in this bill. If this power is granted, this Parliament could say, when there was an industrial dispute in the coal trade, that it would not allow the community to suffer; and it could take charge This Parliament recently of the mines and work them. But that, I fear, is hot intended, and I doubt whether many honourable members would support it. The trouble in the coal industry is not new. It is due, not to the miners, but to the engine-men, who hold responsible positions, and have human lives in their charge. Because they have refused to work, the miners, and thousands of other men throughout the Commonwealth, have suffered. The power asked for, however, could not end that trouble. Has anything happened in connection with this disturbance that has in auy way been an infraction of State or Federal laws. That dispute could have been settled in its early stages, and no one could have settled it better than thc right honourable the Prime Minister. I telegraphed to him asking him to intercede, but he refused to do so on the ground that action by him at that time would have undermined parliamentary authority. I differ from him as to that, but I believe that, in the interests of peace and good government, he should have intervened. The only incident mentioned by He could have pointed out to both sides that it was his business to look after the interests of the general public, and he could have made suggestions for settling the dispute. He could have paved the way to a settlement without in any way acting contrary to the legislation of this Parliament. I remember the coercive legislation passed by the Wade Government of New South Wales during one of I was asked to intervene in the dispute, and I did so. I did not settle that strike by violating constitutional authority, but by adopting constitutional means. I asked the Government to give me the assistance of Judge Scholes, and by working with the two parties I was able to effect a settlement. It is incorrect to say that the Commonwealth Government, when there is an industrial dispute that affects the general public, cannot step in without undermining constitutional authority. I The employers, however, regret the trouble in the coal trade as much as any one does. I say nothing about the merits of the dispute; but there ia a dispute, and it should be adjusted.

We are agreed that we cannot secure sufficieut expedition in the settlement of industrial troubles under our existing powers, and the further powers asked for in the last bill are necessary. We shall jeopardize the carrying of those proposals if, at the same time, there is submitted to the people f. proposal for au amendment of the Constitution to enable the Government to us"", the military to secure the continuation of essential services. The Prime Minister did not say one word about the employers' side in this matter. His only references were to industrialists. only instance he quoted as showing the need for this measure was the, trouble in the coal industry at Newcastle to-day. I am sorry to say that it is affecting every part of Australia. In the circumstances now existing, what hope is there that the people will agree to a proposal of this kind, The Prime Minister would be well advised to defer this proposal. We aro to consider constitutional amendments, when we get to the Pederal Capital, and this is surely a proposal the consideration of which may be postponed until that time. .If it is submitted to the people at the same time as those which we have just considered, they will conclude that it is linked up with the other proposals dealing with industrial matters, and that it is the intention of the Government to take power to settle disputes in industrial affairs by calling out the military. Nothing has occurred in the history of federation to warrant this being dealt with as an urgent measure. strike is the greatest interruption to essential services that we have had. If it continucA for another week or two its effects will be more severely felt, than they are at present. Existing coal supplies are gradually being exhausted, and the effects of the dispute will be felt very intensely if it lasts another couple of weeks. Coal is the life-blood of the country. It is required in our homes, for manufactures, and for shipping, and if operations in the coal industry are suspended, many essential services can no longer be continued. We can derive no power by which we can compel men to work after they have given notice of the termination of their services. men. who will work. member will find that it will not be easy to get men to take the place of unionists in carrying on the coal industry. I have said that the success of the proposals about which we are agreed will be jeopardized if this proposal is submitted to the people at the same time. I and the party to which I belong will give this proposal the most strenuous opposition upon the platforms of this country. We will generally support the proposals contained in the bill which has just been passed. I have come to no arrangement with the The Prime Minister concerning this bill. I would never do so. I do not believe that we should have the power to enable the Government to use the military against the workers of this country, and I shall say so with no uncertain voice from the public platform.

105,Mr Watkins,"The Leader of the OpSir speech of the Leader of the Opposition was devoted wholly and solely to trying to create the impression that the main purpose of the bill is to enable the Government to call out the military to suppress industrial disturbances. I repeat that that is unworthy of the honorabln gentlemau. the Government to call out? The Prime Minister referred to the coal trouble as holding up an essential service. The Goverument could uot call out the Commonwealth Police to do anything. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE event of a disturbance holding up au essential service, the course followed by the Government here, would probably be on tbe same lines as that adopted in England, when the country was threatened with a total stoppage of essential services, by a very determined and very numerous body of unionists and others. That course was absolutely effective in England, through the organization of the Goverument there. ment called out the military, did it not? Sir GRANVILLERYRIE the sense in which the calling out of the military is usually understood. members of the M i l it a r y Forces were used to escort lorries aud wagons that had to be taken to areas where feeling was greatly intensified. It would not have been possible to take the lorries through those areas without an escort of some sort. managed by volunteer workers and special constables. There was no calling out of the military. rect. What about the Guards? Sir GRANVILLERYRIE speech of the Leader of the Opposition .sp.'m-fsrs that,honourable members on the other side will mount platforms and charge the Government with the intention to use the military to shoot down strikers. I venture to say that the plan which would be adopted to deal with thu holding up of an essential service would be very similar to that adopted in Victoria when the police struck, and therr was a serious disturbance in Melbourne. Special constables were called out, and ber of young fellows would come out at the call of any sensible and decent government if they were needed to suppress disturbance. When, in 1917, there was trouble in Sydney, Sir George Fuller and his Government took a strong stand and brought down 4,000 or 5,000 young fellows from the country to break the strike, and camped them on the Sydney Show Ground. It w ill not be denied that the young fellows who were brought down to Sydney to suppress the disturbance there very effectively cai'ried out their task. I undertake to say that there are thousands of men who w ill be found ready to come In tiw to the assistance of the community if the continuance of essential services la threatened. A t the present time the Government has not the power to suppress disturbances preventing the carrying on of essential services. The purpose of this bill is to give to the Commonwealth Parliament additional power, so that if the people are threatened with starvation the Government will be able to organize resistance, and see that essential services are carried on. desires to follow the example of the No t in British Government. A few measures taken by the British Government were effective in preventing the community from being beaten to its knees by a general strike, and we cannot do better than follow such a successful example. The Leader of the Opposition said that Mr Collier took steps in Western Australia to suppress disturbances on the Fremantle wharf. He did so, but only when his supporters said to him, "" For God's sake do something, or we shall be defeated at the next election."" And what steps did he take ? A f t e r the unruly spirits of Fremantle had taken posThe session of the wharfs, dragged seamen off the ships, and threatened to break the machinery if an attempt were made to take the vessels to sea, and after serious rioting had occurred, Mr Collier, at the instigation of his friends, sent to the wharfs police armed with rifles and ball cartridge, and told them to fire if necessary.

Sir GRANVILLERYRIE been accused of having on occasions used extravagant language when I said that there was a danger of the red flag flying in Australia in place of the Union Jack. But what happened in Queensland under the weak-kneed Labour Premier, Mr Gillies, who later appointed himself to a nice little judgeship at £3,500 a year? is now giving tbe bill a party tinge. orable member is blathering like au idiot. He is a jabbering nincompoop. honourable member to withdraw that remark. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE draw it . The railway services of Queensland were absolutely held up by the strikers, who took possession of His Majesty's mails, and locked them in a shed. Then Mr Gillies said he would settle the strike, and he did so by giving the strikers everything they demanded. Any strike can be settled upon those terms. On the day following the settlement, when the trains came out of the engine sheds, the engines were decorated with the red flag, and banners bearing such slogans as "" H u r r a h for the revolution !"" We have positive proof that if the extremists get their way they will hoist the red flag in this country. It is likely, especially with Labour Governments in office in five States, that if any serious industrial disturbance takes place no effort will be made by the State authority to suppress it , and the Federal Government will be powerless to do so. What is the position in Adelaide to-day owing to the continuance of the coal strike ? monwealth Government obtain coal if the miners refuse to work? Sir GRANVILLERYRIE have to organize the community in such a way that the mines can be worked, as Sir George Fuller threatened to work them. If coal supplies are stopped, and the hands of the Federal Government are tied, the community must surrender to the strikers. If the power contained in this bill is granted, the Commonwealth Government will be able to take such steps as it thinks fit to ensure the carrying on of essential services. The Leader of the Opposition said, also, that although during the general election campaign I bave there was much talk of bolshevists, communists and revolutionaries, nothing was heard of them now. Of course not; thu shock of the eleotion sent those fellows t.o cover. The vote of the people showed that they have no sympathy for the policies advocated by the spies and political agents of balshevic Russia. Those fellows are in hollow logs to-day, but are ouly lying "" doggo,'' and when a favorable opportunity is afforded they w ill come out again and be as active as ever. It is time that the Commonwealth Government had power to l i m it the activities of these people in time of industrial upheaval. Therefore I welcome this bill, and I deprecate the statement of the 1 withLeader of the Opposition that its main purpose is to give the Commonwealth Government authority to employ thc military to shoot down the strikers. I give that statement the lie direct. because it has drawn from the honourable member a statement of what is in tbe Prime Minister's mind. [12.40] I congratulate the Government upon having a supporter who is prepared to rise and state f r a n k ly what Ministers have, in mind in submitting this proposal to the House. The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) said that because Labour is in power in five Statesi t is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to have authority to handle industrial disturbances. Apparently tbe object of the bill is to bring about unifi cation in industrial matters, and to ignore the power of the State authorities to suppress any rising. The State Governments have the power to deal with disturbances, and they have exorcised it ; indeed, the honourable member for WarI t will ringah related what Sir George Fuller's Government did in New South Wales. But the Prime Minister and his supporter, the gallant general, are uot satisfied.

I do not believe that either he or the Prime Minister would personally use rifles to shoot down the workers, but this bill is apparently designed to give thc Government power to employ force. services that the Commonwealth Government wishes to control?

I do not remember a time during the last ten or twenty years when some essential service has not been in jeopardy. Take the case of a wheat pool. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) suggested last night that conditions might be imposed by some authority which would make it impossible for the farmers to produce wheat and sell it profitably at world's parity rates, and that the farmers might take steps to enforce a higher price for it . We have seen what has happened under the butter stabilization scheme. are we to be powerless to protect those whom we represent? matter ' of fact, this proposed power would give us authority to acquire wheat, butter The right of eminent domain would accompany the other rights of this Parliament. W it h all humility, I say that if approval is given to the proposals in this bill there will be no limi t to our powers. I have no complaint about that, for we should have the power to supply the essential services without which the life of a civilized community cannot be maintained. I merely point these things out to show honourable members and the people generally how wide this proposed power will be. will be no limitations in it . thing that was necessary could be done. As the late Chief Justice of the H i g h Court( Sir Samuel Griffith), whose position corresponded with that of Chief Justice Marshall, of the United States of America, said on one occasion, it is in conceivable that the Constitution will contradict itself. It is obvious that, since under our federal system of government certain powers are vested in a State and others are vested in the Commonwealth, this new power must either completely impair the federal pact, not only in spirit but in substance, or else the words do not mean what they say. It may be necessary, in order to ensure the carrying on of an essential service, that the power of this Commonwealth over the military, It could not do that for instance, shall be greatly extended. A t present no military man can be called upon to maintain order in a State unless the State Government, in due form, requests the Commonwealth Government that he shall do it . other power than that to use. the military in upholding Commonwealth law. Commonwealth can only permit the military authorities to be used in a State at the invitation of a State Government. vitation*.

Commonwealth must be given power to maintain that degree of order which, in a disturbed state of affairs such as is postulated by an interruption of essential services, is absolutely necessary. Therefore the bill seeks to extend greatly our defence power, and our power over the military. ' A t first sight I was utterly opposed to this proSo far as I can see, there posal, but I shall not vote against it , beEverycause the powers given under the preceding proposed law are, in my opinion, inadequate to do that which the Government wishes to do, and the people wish to have done.

While there were some subsidiary issues at the election, this Parliament was in the main, elected upon that issue.

The people are unable to grasp more than one great issue at a time, and on that occasion that was the issue they voted on. It is perhaps right for the Government, holding the views that it does, to supplement the incomplete power contained in the previous proposed law by the very wide and almost indefinite power asked for under I his bill. With this power almost anything can be done, and under cover of it a government holding the views of honourable members of the Opposition could go a long way towards establishing that system of society which some honourable members regard with horror.

This bill comes entirely as a surprise to me.

That paragraph deals with both naval and military forces and "" the forces."" It is directed to the provision of defence against external aggression, and that is more obviously so when it is read in conjunction with section 119, which, relates to domestic violence within a State. This paragraph is the source of the defence power of the Commonwealth against external aggression. Section 61 provides thatThe executive power ot the Commonwealtli is vested in the King, and is exercisable by the Governor General as the King's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution and of tbe laws of the Commonwealth. Under those powers the only laws of the Commonwealth which can be executed and maintained are those passed under the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament as existing from time to time. Accordingly the only laws which force may be used to maintain or defend are laws made under the powers contained substantially in sections 51 and 52 of the Constitution. Under those sections there is no power to legislate with respect to what one may call a stoppage of essential services, save and except that, under the commerce power, which is confined to interstate and foreign commerce, it is possible to» pass laws penalizing interferences with foreign and interstate commerce. Tbat, in fact, has been done in the Crimes Act passed during this session of the Parliament. That law, however, relates in this aspect only to the services of the Commonwealth and to foreign and interstate commerce. There is also in that act a further set of provisions dealing with revolutionary activities directed towards the overthrow of the Constitution and of the Government. There is, therefore, not in that act or in the Constitution any provision covering a stoppage of essential services that may be holding up stoppage is associated with an attack In upon the Commonwealth or the States from outside, or unless it is accompanied by domestic violence and a State applies",32,Granvilleryrie The They Dealt With The Difficulty Any Num

Groom) -The honourable the Attorney General is iii order, and his remarks are quite relevant to the bill. avoid wearying the honourable member. The Commonwealth is able to apply force only in pursuance of laws which it has power to pass, and the powers of passing laws, as honourable members know, are contained in the sections to which I have referred, more 2)articularly sections 51 and 52. Section 119 provides thatThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion aud, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. A very plain distinction is drawn between invasion or external aggression and domestic violence. In respect to external aggression there is a duty laid upon the Commonwealth to protect the States, the words being, "" The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion."" words used in relation to domestic violence are, "" The Commonwealth shall on the application of the Executive Government of the State"" protect it against domestic violence. Therefore, in the case of domestic violence, the Commonwealth has no power unless the State asks it to intervene. If there should be a stoppage, of essential services unaccompanied by domestic violence, which is quite a possibility, the Commonwealth would be powerless to intervene; the defence power would not operate, because, plainly, it would not be a case of invasion or of external aggression, and in the absence of domestic violence the Commonwealth, even if tlie StateI t is possible for the Commade application, would have no right to take any action. able gentleman mean by ""domestic violence""? in the borders of n State. as employees? individuals are guilty of violence, and a Is not the Attorney-General State considers that it is unable to cope He has with that violence, it may apply to the Commonwealth. Tbe Commonwealth has tbe constitutional duty and tbe legal power to protect the State against that domestic violence. Such protection, however, is dependent upon the existence of domestic violence. If there were an organized hold-up of services, by either I shall endeavour to employers or employees, without violence, the Commonwealth would be powerless to do anything except run its mails, protect its civil services, and impose penalties upon any persons who were guilty of interfering with interstate trade and commerce; it would not have the power to take any steps to bring the hold-up to an end. The bill, therefore, proposes that power shall be conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to protecting the interests of the public in the case of an actual or probable interruption of any essential service. Mr E. Rir.nv The Comnioiiwealth could take part iu every industrial dispute. confined to industriiu disputes. There On the other hand, thc might be a catastrophe of some kind which could be handled only by a strong government and upon a large scale. At present that cannot be done.

It should be observed that the words used are not "" protecting the interests of the public '.igai-' t ' an actual or probable interruption of any essential service.""

COLEMAN -Who will have the determination of the matter? Court will have the duty of interpreting those words. An Honorable MEMBER What are e.sseiuial tiCiviees? whether it is desired that I should give a definition or a specification of essential services. I can very readily cite examples-fuel , water, food, and transport are obviously essential sendees. tain a definition of essential services? in the bill the list would be so large as to prove embarrassing and difficult. The words used are sufficiently plain in themselves. This is essentially an emergency power. I particularly emphasize the distinction between a power to legislate for protecting the interests of the public "" against"" auy actual or probable interruption, and a power to legislate "" in case of "" an actual or probable interruption. This power is additional to thoso which already exist. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Chair? We on this side of the chamber Hughes), during the course of his speech, evidently had in his mind certain decisions of the High Court in the earlier years of the Commonwealth, when it was held that the true reading of the Constitution was that control over interstate aud foreign trade and commerce was given to the Commonwealth, and that control over intra-state trade and commerce was reserved by the Constitution to the States. Since the decision in the Engineers' case was given, it has not been possible to maintain the second proposition. In order to make the matter clear to the right honourable member for North Sydney, I shall again read a few lines from the decision in the Engineers' case, which was decided in 1920. They are as follows:J.t is undoubted that those who maintain the sible for the interference. authority of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass a certain law should be able to point to some enumerated power containing the requisite authority; but we also hold that where the affirmative terms of a stated power would justify an enactment, it rests upon those who rely on some limitation or restriction aipon the power to indicate it in the Constitution. The doctrine of implied prohibitions was overruled by the High Court in that case. that the power does not exist rests upon those who deny its existence; but there is a prohibition. does not contain any prohibition against interfering with the internal trade of the States. There is a positive provision that the Commonwealth Parliament may deal with foreign and interstate trade, and with a number of other subjects, many of which affect internal trade. This Parliament is able to legislate to the fullest extent upon those other subjects without any embarrassment arising from the fact that it has no power to legislate upon the internal trade of the States as such. Take insurance as an example; section 51 gives power to legislate on this subject. Insurance is frequently not a matter of external or interstate trade and commerce, but it probably falls under the head of trade and commerce. This Parliament has undoubtedly the full power to legislate upon insurance without excepting from its laws such insurance as affects intra-state trade or oommerce. not the Attorney-General address the are not able to hear a word of what he is saying.

They are designed to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to do more than impose penalties for breaches of laws relating to trade or commerce, industrial matters, or any other subject. The power to impose penalties in the case of unauthorized or illegal stoppages of essential services is a useful one, but it operates only after the event. In order to deal effectively with a stoppage of essential services, we must have power to do more than prosecute the individuals who are responThe Commonwealth must be able to step in and provide such services as the circumstances require.

Whetheri t be one or the other, the position is exactly the .same; there is a responsibility upon the Commonwealth to preserve the life of the community, and this Parliament must have the power to exert its authority. The matter cannot safely be left i u its present members have referred to the coal position in Australia to-day. We are all aware that a large proportion of our coal supplies is obtained fro m an area that is very limited compared with ihe total area of the Commonwealth. If those States which control the coal areas are not prepared to ensure supplies to other States which have little or no supplies, what is to be done? Is the rest of Australia to suffer because of the inaction of a particular state i u such a vital matter? between Tasmania and the mainland. What action can be taken at the present time to ensure its continuance? We have certain powers which enable us to impose penalties; but they will not keep the ships running. It is essential for that service to be maintained. power for which we are now asking would enable the Commonwealth to step in , provide the service, and give the necessary protection to those who were prepared to carry it on in the interests of the general community. There is at pre sent no legal method of exercising such a power. It is true that, with the consent of ship-owners, the Commonwealth may man vessels; but it has no power to compel the giving of that consent or to commandeer the ships. power to work coal mines, protect water supplies, or take food to the people. I have no hesitation in referring, by way of illustration, to the recent general strike in England. Whetheri t is called a strike or a lockout is immaterial. The lives of the people had to be safeguarded; they had to be provided with food, fuel, and necessary services. in every community a power by the exercise of which in an emergency, whatever the emergency may be-whethe r it be a shipping strike or an industrial dispute of some other variety, or a national disaster-the people may be fed. Except at the will of the individual States there is at present no such power. The proposed amendment w ill provide it. For the last three days we have been urged to trust this Parliament' to give it the fullest possible powers. It has been argued that Parliament would not exercise those powers unreasonably. What is the argument against this emergency power, the necessity for which cannot be denied? tional powers to be given under the other bill. It has been proved that we have Dot sufficient powers to enable us to govern the people. mind my honourable friend of the argument poured upon us from the front and right rear. The argument has been that we should take the fullest powers because we must trust Parliament, and there is no risk that it will abuse them. The argument was that it is quite imTake the question of transport proper to limi t or restrain the action of this Parliament by providing that industrial powers should be exercised through authorities. What now is the argument from the Opposition against this bill? It is not an argument directed against the bill itself. It is an argument directed In an emergency the against possible abuses of the power asked for under the bill . The speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) may be reduced to this: "" L o o k at the terrible things that may happen if this power is given to the Federal Parliament."" I submit to the House the proposition that there is not an effective system of government in Australia if there is not a power to protect the community of Australia as a whole, as distinguished from the communities of Neither has it any the separate States, in the case of an interruption of essential services. The object of this bill is to enable this Parliament in any such emergency to preserve the lives of the people, and I ask honourable members to support it . The Attoi-nev-General's references to the position in Great Britain were rather unThere must be fortunate for himself. Although the general strike may have been defeated by the action of the British Government in the exercise of its powers under the Emergency Act, it did not of itself end the general strike; and Great Britain is still very far from being free from its difficulties, in spite of the exeTcise of the emergency powers of the Government.

The Attorney General has said I hat the emergency would be the same whether a disturbance holding up au essential service were the result of a strike or of a lockout; but. there has never yet been an industrial disturbance which honourable members opposite have nol. called a strike. Thev would not think of attributing such a disturbance to a lockout. I was rather sorry that the Prime Minister( Mr South Wales did not know how to use Bruce) was not present iu the chamber when the honourable member for Warringah. ( Sir Granville Ryrie) spilled the beans, but I suppose he has heard of the honourable member's speech since. honourable member commenced i u a very moderate way. He protested against the references of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) to tbe use of the military in the settlement of an industrial trouble, and said that nothing was further from his thoughts, or from those of the Government. able member commenced his speech pacifically, he was not very long on his feet before he adopted his usual military style and gave us a fine example of the military despot. He gave us to understand what the Government would do if it were given this power. He forgot that when the Deportation B ill was under consideration he told us that if he had his way he would "" give it to them in the neck."" The honourable member said he would have taken men by the scruff of the neck at trial, put them on a war vessel and landed them on some island. He would not have waited for law and order to operate, but would have acted despotically, like a Mussolini. No doubt, the honourable member heard this bill discussed in the Nationalist party's room, and knows the interpretation which the PrimeM i nister put upon it , which was not disclosed to this chamber. He dealt with tbe trouble that occurred in New South Walesi n 1917, and told us what Sir George Fuller did. Does he desire that the Federal Government should obtain this power in order that it may do w h it Sir George Fuller did in New South Walesi n 1917, because that conld the in that State? Sir George Fuller sent down the mines blacklegs and scabs who Mr Ijazzarlni. knew nothing of mining, and risked their lives and those of their fellows. The mining laws of New South Wales were abrogated, and inexperienced men were sent into the mines at the risk of their lives and of those working with them. Does he desire that the Federal Government should be in a position to have to pay money to the coal-owners, as was done in New South Wales, when John Brown put in a claim for £17,000 for damages to his mines?

These were the property of the miners who were on strike; but when they put in a paltry claim for £17 10s. for broken tools, the Government The refused to meet it , though it gave John Brown £17,000 for alleged damages to his mines. Such things could not be done in New South Wales to-day, under a Labour government. Does the Government want this power to enable it to establish scab unions, as Sir George Fuller did ? The history of the waterAlthough the honorf r o n t in New South Wales from 1917 until the difficulties were settled under the present Labour Government, shows that the action taken by a Nationalist government in that State did more than anything else to dislocate essential services. In common with the Leader of the Opposition, I am suspicions of the proposed amendment of the Constitution. This is not a proposal to so amend the Constitution that the Federal Parliament shall have the necessary power to develop our national resources under uniform midnight, and, without a economic conditions. I do not accept the contention that it does not matter whether a disturbance is due to a lockout or a strike, because, whilst the party opposite is in power, it will never admit that any disturbance is due to a lockout. The introduction of this measure is a sign of weakness and not of strength on the part of the Government. It shows that it feels that it cannot govern the country without bringing about violence and trouble. A government that cannot administer the affairs of Australia without violence is trying to p u t something over the people which even a peaceful community cannot accept. It says that it wants this power to enable it to secure the continuation of essential not be done to-day with services. There might be a slump in the Labour Government in power coal industry, and w ill the Attorney General or the Prime Minister tell me that, in such a case, the Government would step in and tell the coal miners that they must work the mines, even though they contend that they are being asked to work under unreasonable conditions? 1 have no doubt that the Government would interfere in that way. But will it step in to force a coal mine owner to work his mines? Not at all. We have in New South Wales a Masters and Servants Act which has often been used by Nationalist governments against tbe workers. There are many coal mines in the electorate which I represent, and many miners have been brought before the courts under the Masters and Servants Act and fined or imprisoned. There are mines i u the district that are sometimes worked a three and four days' whistle is not blown and the miners cannot go down the mine, because the boss says there is no business doing. Still, there has never been a case in which a coal-owner has been brought before a court under Masters and Servants Act for not working his mine. It is clear that this legislation will be used only to deal with the workers. One honourable member talked of 600 strikes, and of the loss to the community because of strikes. I can say that, if in a month in the coal industry £500 has been lost in wages because of strikes, £1,500 has been lost in the same time because the boss has refused to blow the whistle and allow the men to go down his mine. I know of mines in Australia where the whistle has been blown only four days in a fortnight, and sometimes less often than that. W ill the Government use this legislation to compel mine-owners to give the miners continuous work ? We know that it w ill not, and that the power asked for will be used only against the workers. The honourable member for Warringah let the cat out of the bag. This measure is submitted because what the Government desires to do cannot now be done in five out of the six States, where Labour governments are in power. not suit the honourable member. is his trouble. that the interests of the trade unionists are ft. r move important to me than are the interests of the bosses. I have stated that nob only in this House, but from public platforms. Still, the party on this side has always recognized ihafc employers as well as employed have interests which should be preserved. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) deprecated the statement of Mr Justice Higgins that in awarding a living wage he could not consider whether or not the industry concerned could afford it . The outstanding feature of the speeches made upon these referendum proposals by honourable members opposite is their conviction that property, profit, and private interest are more important than the conditions under which human beings live. Such an outlook is the very basis of slaverv. I am not prepared to ask the people to agree to this amendment of the Constishift. On other days the tution. Any honourable member who has followed closely this debate, and the analysis of the constitutional powers, must have come to the conclusion that the fire-place is tbe proper place for the the Constitution. I would welcome an opportunity to recommend the people to make the Commonwealth Parliament supreme in all things; but while the sovereignty of the States is recognized, I shall not ask the peoplo to give power to this Parliament to override State legislatures which are functioning in the in terests of the people and will not use force to intimidate the workers. So long as the sovereignty of the State is admitted, their rights in industrial matters must be recognized, and I shall not consent to pub the State Governments at the mercy of a central Government that is hostile to every principle for which the majority of them stand. I hope the Government will yet appreciate the wisdom of not persisting with this proposal at this stage. If the excuse for seeking these additional powers now is that an emergency exists to-day, I remind honourable members opposite that three or four months must elapse before this Parliament can legislate in the exercise of those powers. By that time the emergency that exists in the coal-mining industry will probably have passed. If this Parliament does not meet again unThatt i l the return of the Prime Minister from England, the additional power will not I frankly admit be exercised before May of next year. It seems to me that the Government has been intimidated by the Age and the Argus arc] its conservative supporters, to associate this bill with the other referendum proposal in the hope that one will",36,Granvilleryrie The They Dealt With The Difficulty Any Num

173,Mr Lazzarini,"defeat the other. be able to tell the people that it is trying to carry out their mandate in regard to the establishment of industrial peace, whereas it is, by means of this bill and the endeavour to abolish the per capita payments to the States, creating an atmosphere so hostile to the Federal legislature that the defeat of the referendum proposals will be assured. measure will have my whole-hearted support. 1 admit that I have some doubt as to whether bhe industrial problem can be dealt with the more effectively by State or by Commonwealth instrumentalities j but I am convinced that this Parliament should have an emergency power to ensure the continuance of essential services. No other national Parliament is without such power. Honourable members opposite are inconsistent in advocating that the National Parliament should have complete power in respect of industry, trade and commerce, and yet opposing the grant to it of a small measure of authority to deal with a matter of vital importance to every section of the community. Other speakers have quoted bhe peculiar position of Tasmaniai n support of their contention that the Commonwealth should have power in any emergency, to intervene and provide essential services. Naturally, I am particularly concerned in the hardships that may be imposed upon the StateI represent by the cessation of the coastal shipping services through industrial turmoil. These services have been interrupted in the past, and, doubtless, will be in the bunals the putes. My attitude on this question disregards entirely the source whence the trouble emanates. owners of the ships operating, between the mainland and Tasmania decided not to run those vessels unless the seamen would comply with the conditions they imposed, hoping thereby to cause the aggrieved people in Tasmania to bring such in fluence to bear upon the Government and the seamen that the latter would be compelled to accept the owners' terms; if honourable members opposite were in office, would they not desire to be able to compel the owners to provide a service that is essential to Tasmania? Or The Government will do they prefer that the Commonwealth Parliament should not have power to act in such an emergency, lest the present Government should use its authority arbitrarily? Such an attitude presupposes that the Labour party will never be in office, and that its distrusted opponents w ill hold the reins of government for all time. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) said that at no time had the provisions of the Masters and Servants Acti n New South Wales been put into operation against the employers when they refused to work their mines. As Labour has at different times been in office in the State Parliament, the honourable member's statement is as much an indictment of Labour goverument as of any other. Whoever may be responsible for the holding up of services that are vital to the community should be amenable to the power of this Parliament. If the actions of either employers or employees, or both, result iu the interruption of food supplies or any essential services, the offending party should be dealt with by the Federal authority, and the food supplies and services restored in the interests of the general community. It must not be supposed that we are asking for these powers as a means of breaking strikes. The only argument advanced against the b ill by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) was that the Commonwealth Government wished to use the military power to break a strike by compelling the workers, at the point of the bayonet, to resume their employment. We are accustomed to wild future, whatever tristatements by some honourable members of may be set up. for the Labour party, but such an assertion settlement of industrial disby the Leader of the Opposition surprised the House. His statement was absurd, and indicated the lengths to which Suppose that the the honourable gentleman was driven in finding reasons for opposing the bill. The honourable member seemed to think that in the case of a disturbance only regular soldiers could be called out. I remind him that practically the whole of the Commonwealth Forces are composed of volunteers, and that they and the regular soldiers subscribe to the same oath. There is not the least doubt that if either body were called upon to maintain law and order it would do its duty, no matter which unit or arm of the service it belonged to. It is absurd to say",38,Granvilleryrie The They Dealt With The Difficulty Any Num
174,Mr Bell (Darwin) [3.22],"Thisthat the neople outside believe that these powers are being asked for to enable the Commonwealth Government to call out the military forces in case of a strike. It is absolutely necessary that this Parliament should have the powers asked for, because in the case of the dislocation of essential services, in Tasmania or elsewhere, the State Government concerned could not take action. Tasmania might be vitally affected by a shipning hold-up. The mines on the west coast-Mount Lyell, for instance-migh t be closed down, and workmen thrown out of employment, solely because coal for railways and mining machinery were not available. In such an event, the Tasmanian Government would be powerless to act. Lt is, therefore, essential that the powers asked for under this bill should be given to this Parliament, so that, if necessary, prompt and effective action could be taken to provide essential services. What power has a State Government to control shipping companies or mine-owners, whose operations extend to other States, and whose business is controlled from a head office situated elsewhere, if they suspend their services ? ever. should have power to act in the interests of the States that are vitally affected by the discontinuance of essential services. I shall give the bill my whole-hearted support. I am certain, despite what has been said to the contrary, that if both proposals are placed before the people the referendum w ill have a better chance of being carried. Rarely is so much asked for in a bill consisting of but a few words; but it would be difficult to define what we could not do under this bill respecting any of the activities of the citizens of the Commonwealth. essential could not be interfered with. tial service? fere with one that was not interrupted. honourable member, in saying that, is not so astute in his reasoning as he usually is. threatened. tial service? When we come to interpret that vague term we must consider what would be a probable interruption of such a service. There, again, this bill gives extensive powers. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) mentioned, as a ease in point, a shipping hold-up. We could go even deeper into probabilities of interruption of services and say that under the bill we could, under certain circumstances, acquire the product of theprimary producers. Let us assume that the wheat-growers decided to for m a pool and to fix the price of wheat at an excessive rate, and because of that the organized workers in a certain industry struck work. It is quite possible that, under these powers, the government of the day could commandeer the wheat or fix the price of it in order to remove the cause of the strike. a prohibitive price, why should not the Government interfere 1 the honourable member that I should not for one moment contend that the GovernNone whatment should not interfere. I am tryThe Commonwealth Government ing to make clear to the House that although I support the b ill , I recognize its far-reaching nature. Honourable members opposite are in a cleft stick. They may blow hot and cold on the question of the supremacy of this Parliament, but I do not intend to do so. The point raised by the Attorney-General is one that the Opposition should answer, namely, that last evening they argued that Parliament should have complete control of the industrial tribunals of this country, and in less than 24 hours afterwards they argued that Parliament should not have power over essential services. I , for one, wish to be logical. I follow my convictions whether they are for or against the Government. It has been said that if additional powers are given to the Commonwealth, it will have the right to call W h a t is an essenout the military forces, armed with bayonets, to protect the interests of the public. I say that the Parliament should have that power, but I submit that in the last analysis it is a question not so much of trusting Parliament, even w i th these additional powers, as of trusting the people, who, after all. are the masters of Parliament.

183,Mr Stewart,"I hasten to assurethis country, particularly of the National Parliament, to have full power in any direction to safe-guard the interests of the people. 1 regret that the Government has seen fit to introduce into this National Parliament panic legislation that is likely, if given effect, to cause serious injury to Australia. There are two sides to any dispute, . responsibility to rest more upon trusted officials or authorities, many industrial disputes would be prevented. It is not out of place to refer to an incident that occurred in England in my youthful days. A riot broke, out in connection with the land question, and the public were very much disturbed. An eminent, member of the British Parliament, a man of high morals and humanitarian ideas, was approached by the civil authorities and asked to accept the assistance of the military to guard the precincts of Parliament House. formed them that it would be time to take action when the police force could not made inquiries, ascertained the cause of the disturbance, and removed it . In my opinion, the Government is actuated by a desire to minimize as f a r as possible the good influence of the five State Labour Governments in Australia. I feel sure that the Attorney-General will regret before very long that he introduced this bill. Surely honourable members opposite do uot think that a single member of' the Labour party desires to hinder the progress of Australia, or harm, any one in it . The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) knows better than most honourable members the sacrifices that were made to win the advantages that the Australian workmen now enjoy. Our conditions are the envy of the people on the other side of the. world. We have an educated democracy here which is not likely to consent to a proposal of this kind. The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) has indicated that under the provisions of the bill it w ill be possible to portations from abroad. Inquiries have call out the military to quell any disturbance, thrr, may arise. That has only been done in the history of Australia during the Victorian railway? strike years ago, when the military was ordered "" to shoot low.'' When Mr Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister he received ten urgent telegrams from one State requesting the help of the military in crushing an industrial dispute. He paid a. visit to the disturbed locality, and found that there was no justification for military interference.
