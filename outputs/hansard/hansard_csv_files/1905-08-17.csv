A t the inquiry held in July, 1903, by a board appointed under the Public Service Act, into a cnapg-e of carelessness of management against the late postmistress' at Chatswooa, evidence was given by the inspector, in reply to questions by the accused's solicitor, which imputed irregular money transactions some tflme previously (the dates of which were not given). No evidence on the matter was given by the late postmistress, as she was not called to give any sworn testimony. The inspector's evidence appeared to the Deputy Postmaster-General to need an explanation, which was immediately obtained, and dealt with as shown below. (See No. 4 ) 2. If a Treasury inspector during an inspection of the office discovered any irregularity of the kind referred to, it would nave been reported to the Deputy Postmaster-General, and the postmistress would have been called upon for an explanation. 3. Public Service Regulation No. 45 provides that"" Any monetary transaction between officers, either as principals or agents, whereby any interest or other return in money or kind is charged or paid, or borrowing money by senior officers from their subordinates, is forbidden"" ; but thetransaction disclosed was not considered to be an infraction of this regulation. 4.

12,Mr Fowler (Perth),"I moveby these bodies, amount in many respects to the usurpation of the rights and duties of Parliament as a whole, tend to foment unnecessary party, strife, impede the work of legislation, and precipitate artificial crises; and therefore, in the opinion of this House, such legislation as may be necessary should be introduced to provide for fhe election of Ministers by Parliament. It is somewhere about fifty years since the late Prince Consort declared that representative government was on its trial, and only a short time ago William Clarke, a writer in the Political Science. Quarterly, said something very much to the same effect. wroteThere is no more patent and significant fact in contemporary Europe than the failure, if not the absolute collapse, of parliamentary government. That saying has been quoted by Benjamin Kidd in his book, Principles of Western Civilization, and I think that 'pretty well the same observation has been passing through the minds of many other students of the science of government. of parliamentary government is directed, not so much at the principles themselves, as at the methods by which they are brought into operation. very seriously questioned the that representative government is in some shape or form a necessary and desirable thing, but a good deal of criticism has been directed of applying that principle affairs, and the most serious of all has been directed towards what is known as the Cabinet system. into this question"" as carefully and thoroughly as my opportunities will permit, I have been surprised to discover how many writers have questioned this particular application of the representative principle to the science of government. we have undoubtedly a form of Cabinet government which, as I indicate in my motion, is, to my mind, in many respects a usurpation of the rights and duties of Parliament as a whole. ing anything on my own account, in putting forward this rather sweeping ment ; I am merely endeavouring to emphasize, in our present conditions, the statements and opinions of others moving in a different sphere of action, and thinking out for themselves, in association with other conditions of government, very much the same problems that confront us in Australia at the present time. claim no originality in putting forward the pnposal, nor shall I be able to show very Mr Fowler. much originality in either my remarks or my arguments. The subject has attracted a good deal of attention in Australia lately, and very many able pens have been taken up in criticism of the system of Cabinet government,. and in attempts to initiate and expound better and more suitable methods of achieving parliamentary government. I shall occupy only a short time in offering what I regard as fair and reasonable criticism of existing conditions, and in indicating in a general way the best method, He in my opinion, of obtaining an improvement. In Australia the question of the election of Ministers by Parliament is no new one. For many years the subject has cropped up in the Parliament of South Australia There 'the principle has been enunciated and supported by very many able and thoughtful politicians, sonre of whom, I am gladi to say, have transferred their energies and abilities to the sphere of Federal politics, and are now This criticism will ling to assist in bringing about the change for which an impatient public are waiting. In Victoria, also, a Royal Commission was appointed in 1894 to inquire No one in these days has into this question, but no definite recommenproposition dations were brought forward. I think that the obstacle in the way was largely a constitutional one, which could not be removed without considerable difficulty, and against certain methods the whole matter was therefore-as has to human often been the case in Victoria-allowe d criticism to drop. The fact that these inquiries and debates have taken place shows that In going there was some particular necessity for them, which, I think, is to be found in the tendency of Australian Parliaments towards frequent and unnecessary changes of Government. Too often principles and the public interest have been merely the In these days dice with which parties have played, the prizes being the portfolios of Ministers. Again, during the Conventions at which the Commonwealth Constitution was drawn up, this subject was debated with a I am not proposgood deal of interest, and the principle of the election of Ministers by stateParliament received a considerable amount of support. That some definite proposal in this direction was not embodied in our Constitution was not due to the absence of desire on the part of many members of the various Conventions, but rather to their very proper inclination to allow the Commonwealth to work out in its own wayj as I, therefore, f u l ly and as freely as possible, its political methods. Accordingly, we find that in. section 62 of the Constitution the question of the formation of Ministries is dealt with in the old formula of absolute indefiniteness, which' leaves this Parliament perfectly free to alter existing methods as soon as it thinks fit. I believe I am correct in saying that there is no constitutional obstacle whatever in the way of this Parliament adopting, with very slight alterations, the principle of election of Ministries by Parliament as a whole. In 1864 a book was published by an English statesman, Earl Grey, who expressed in it a very remarkable prediction. In discussing the subject of parliamentary reform, he pointed out that Cabinet government acted fairly well whilst only two parties existed in Parliament. say that if at any time these two parties should be resolved into three or four, Cabinet government as then carried on would have to be swept away, because under a three or more party system the circumstances that had justified the method of government by Cabinet would have absolutely disappeared. party system has disappeared in Australia. ties in the House of Commons. party system has been in operation there for some time. Even in that case, the prophecy of Earl Grey has been fulfilled, and the House of Commons is at the present time regarded By those within it, and by many persons outside, as a huge inert mass, which is controlled absolutely by the Cabinet, and has little or no power of initiative. The important distinction being that three parties in -this Parliament are more evenly balanced. I am afraid that we are likely to have three parties here for some time to come. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We are far more likely to have five parties than two. be a new line of cleavage ultimately, but whether that will result in the establishment of two large parties, or in the division of existing parties into a larger number of small parties, I am unable to say. A t any rate I think we may fairly conclude that the two-party system having disappeared from Australian politics the circumstances which brought into existence Cabinet government have also disappeared, and the present system of Cabinet control of Parliament ought therefore to be abolished. I have indicated in my motion [39]2 that one of my principal objections to the present system isThat the present methods of constituting Ministerial Cabinets, together with the powers exercised by those bodies, amount in many respects to the usurpation of the rights and duties of Parliament as a whole. I think that may be called my principal indictment, in support of which I shall bring forward the words of others, which are weightier than I am 'able to utter myself. I shall submit the evidence of thoughtful publicists, and 1 think I shall 1 be able to convict, out of their own mouths, statesmen who approve of the present system. BeforeI proceed to do that, I willBut he went on to ingly admit the force of the argument that one has to meet at the very outset, in discussing a question of this kind, namely, that based on the antiquity of the institution I am now attacking. I was going to say "" antiquity and respectability,"" but I am not sure that the second word applies as well as the first. There is no doubt as To-day we find that the twoto the antiquity of the Cabinet system, but I have grave doubts as to its respectability. .1 do not wish to enter upon a learned dissertation as to the development of the present system. If we went back to absolute beginnings, we should lose ourselves in the mists of antiquity. There is no doubt that in olden times, when the King absolutely ruled the country, he surrounded himseP with courtiers, whose advice he sometimes* sought, but who were more frequently the mere tools of his roval desires. It was, however, in the reign of Charles II . that we find the true beginning of the same thing exists here, the present Cabinet system. In that reign the the infamous Cabal, as it was known, was interposed between the King and the Parliament. Its duty was simply to act as a buffer against which Parliament generally expended its force in its futile efforts to assert itself, and we find the same body of men also ignoring Parliament, as far I believe there will as they dared, in order to carry out the wishes of the worthless King. Occasionally the power of indictment that remained with Parliament was used against one or other of those Ministers, but I do not think that any one who wishes to defend the system of Cabinet government will be able to regard that particular phase of iLs accompaniments with any degree of satisfaction. Coming a little further down the line to the Hanoverian period, we find a further development. Parliament, in the meantime, had gradually acquired more power, and the",14,Elective Ministries
13,Mr Mcwilliams,There are three par,16,Elective Ministries
14,Mr Fowler,Exactly. The three,16,Elective Ministries
15,Mr Fowler,"brutal methods of the old Cabal had had to .give way to the finesse of the parliamentarians. In the days of the early Georges, -the King selected his particular tool in the person of the Premier ,^the Premier, in turn, proceeded to select his tools in the persons of Ministers, and they selected their tools in an utterly corrupt Parliament. The process by which this was achieved was an unblushing and unconcealed system of bribery. In the days of Walpole there was actually a Department of the Treasury from which -sums of money were paid every month to a sufficient number of members of Parliament for being complaisant tools in the'hands of the Ministry, enabling them to carry on what was euphemistically termed "" His Majesty's Government."" stairs in Whitehall, up which they went to receive their pay. well worn in those days. under the influence of the reform movements that brought about improvements in the personnel of Parliament, the system of open bribery disappeared, and by the time of the great reform of 1832 other methods were necessary to enable the Premier to carry on Her Majesty's Government. Those were found in the consolidation of the party system, and that system has continued to be consolidated by Ministers of the Crown to such an extent that it is absolutely threatening the working and the privileges of Parliament itself. Cabinets have gradually acquired powers that were vested in former days only in Parliament. hold in my hand a remarkable book, written by Mr Sidney Low, a well known publicist, which has been recently issued. The title of this work is the Governance of England, and to my mind it makes a very powerful and forcible indictment against the present system of Cabinet government. The writer points out, amongst other things, that the Cabinet has no status in any legal sense of the term; that it is totally unrecognised by any of the laws under which constitutional government is conducted, and that it is merely a self-constituted body, that meets in secret, at the instance of the Premier, carries on its proceedings in an informal wav, and gives Parliament only such information regarding its deliberations as it thinks necessary. Mr in March, 1901, used these remarkable Low continuesI t has no regular time of assembly. It has .no fixed place of meeting. It has no office, no staff, no secretary, no rules, no corporate funds, no permanent location. . . . Wheni t assembles, the Cabinet finds that it has no corporate character. It might be a fortuitous conference of heads of departments at one of the public offices, or a meeting of party leaders at the Carlton Club. It has a standing president in the Prime Minister, who has more than the ordinary power of a chairman at a meeting, in bringing forward such subjects as he thinks fit, and closes the debate at his discretion. The proceedings are conversational and informal. There is no agenda paper, and, indeed, no paper of any kind. Not only are no records or minutes kept, but it is understood that a minister may not take a note, for future reference, of anything said or done during the council. The same author quotes a description of Cabinets given by Lord Rosebery, a statesman who has had experience as a Minister, and who, therefore, speaks of something of which he has had experience. Lord Rose-' bery puts the matter in this wayTo the inquiring foreigner nothing can seem more extraordinary, in a country with so much By-and-by, of democracy about it, than the spectacle of a secret council on the Venetian model, sworn to absolute silence, and conducting, the business of a nation which insists on publicity for everything less important . . . of all anomalous arrangements for executive government in an Anglo Saxon community, during the present epoch, and under the present conditions, the strangest is the Government of England by a Secret Committee. I said, at the outset of my remarks, that I would be able to show, out of the mouths of some of the strongest supporters of the present system, the extent to which the Cabinet has usurped the functions of Parliament, and I intend now to do so. In a speech, delivered at Edinburgh on the I 30th October, 1894, the Marquis of Salisbury saidThere is an enormous change in the House of Commons as I recollect it, and the evolution is going on still ; and we have reached this pointthat discussion of a measure is possible in the Cabinet, but for any 'effective or useful purpose, it is rapidly becoming an impossibility in the House of Commons. These are the words of a former Prime. Minister of Great Britain, who supported the Cabinet system, and whose son, at a later date, spoke in even more absolute terms regarding ths state of affairs that has arisen under the system of Cabinet control in the British Parliament. Lord Hugh Cecil, son of the late Marquis of Salisbury, and a member of the present British Government, speaking in the House of Commons words: We hear often of the infringement of the rights of private members, and it cannot be denied that a transfer of political power from the House of",16,Elective Ministries

"" These were the words uttered by one of the most cynical and aristocratic members of the House of Commons, who has consistently flouted the opinions of members of that House, and who, as a member of the present British Ministry has applied, in the most brutal fashion, the ""gag,"" as we may call it, when members have dared, in his opinion, to criticise too freely the actions of that all-powerful Government. In the June number p f the Nineteenth Century will be found an article by Sir Martin Conway, entitled, "" Is Parliament a mere Crowd ?"" the position into which the Imperial Parliament has fallen, when the consideration of this important question is reduced to such an inquiry. The writer makes the following observations:Fundamentally, the Cabinet is hostile to the House of Commons. It continuously strives, and with success, to appropriate to itself powers which properly belong to the House of Commons. It supplants the House of Commons as a deliberative assembly; it has practically taken away from it the power of refusing supplies or of debating whatever subject it pleases; in fact, in the course of a century it has wrought an absolute revolution in our whole constitutional system. Nothing but the phrase remains-the facts are all changed. We talk of Parliament as possessed of supreme power, whereas it is the Cabinet that possesses it. We talk of Parliament as capable of upsetting the Ministry, whereas the only question at any moment is whether the Ministry shall upset Parliament or not by dissolving it. I think I have shown by these quotations that the process, which has been going on in the British Parliament, undoubtedly amounts, at the present time, to a usurpation, by the Government, of the rights and duties of Parliament. place in that Legislature has occurred also in the Commonwealth Parliament. it to be distinctly understood here that, in dealing with this question in connection with this Parliament,. I shall avoid the personal element. a question of considerable importance* and must illustrate my points by going of Parliament in Australia, I think every member of the Federal Parliament, who has sat in this or another place since the inception of Federation, must have steadily undergone a process of disillusionment with regard to the share he is able to take in the work of the country. I believe most of us came into Parliament with an idea that we could do some little good.; but T. think we are beginning to realize that that little is almost a negligible quantity. The whole process of parliamentary work is hedged round with so many forms that it requires a very patient and persevering individual to be able to thread his way amongst them; and, even after he has mastered the forms, he finds himself in a position of absolute helplessness. If a member sits behind the Ministry, he has the privilege of voting according as they It is a regrettable indication of wish him to vote, and, if he sits in opposition, he votes solidly with his party as the opponents of the Government. a corner? a somewhat better position, but, even in the corner, there is still party influence, from which no member of this House can at any time absolutely dissociate himself. With .this system at work, we have the extraordinary spectacle, as has been indicated by some one, of a number of able men on one side trying to legislate, and on the other, a number of equally able men trying to prevent lhe former from legislating. And all this because of the exigencies of party warfare, which call for a loyalty to party rather than to any particular principles which may be at stake in proposed legislation. Again, an outsider might think that Parliament had undoubtedly some voice in shaping the course of a. particular session ; but we all know that What has taken that is not so. We know that the power rests entirely in the hands of the Ministry, who I wish determine on a policy in the secrecy of the Cabinet, Avithout reference, as a rule, to any of their supporters.

30,Mr Fowler,"If a Ministry chosetoparty strife, if shown in a monetary form to the people of the Commonwealth, would, I think, rouse even them to the necessity for some action. If we take the time that has actually been bestowed on the genuine work of legislation, which for the most part is carried on in Committee, and contrast that with the vast amount of time wasted on no-confidehce debates-o n debates on general principles, carried on in the vaguest fashion possible-it would emphasize very strongly indeed the necessity for some radical reform in our existing methods. I have also said that the present system precipitates artificial crises. -think we all understand what the threat -of dissolution means when whispered around by a Government that wishes to get its own way in a particular matter. No member of Parliament is at all anxious at any time for a dissolution, nor do I think that the country is anxious for frewhat we should put in its stead is simply quent events of the kind. They mean a .great deal of expense, and I have an idea that, even if a dissolution had come about .during any of the crises that have overtaken the present Parliament, parties would have come back Ipretty well as they went -out. But, while that view has been held .very generally by honourable members, still, whenever the Government are in diffiment, the principle that ""culties, we find the whisper of "" dissolution "" going round. Honourable members who are not anxious to face their constituents-and none of us are anxious to do that too often-ma y be cajoled into assisting the Government to tide over some difficulty, and continue them for a little while longer in office. One of the most singular crises that ever happened was, I think, the one by which the present Prime Minister left office on the first occasion. Then we had a crisis precipitated by the Prime Minister himself, in the face of a contrary opinion held at least by a majority of honourable members of this House. The honourable and learned member left office when a majority of honourable members desired him to remaina rather singular state of affairs, that is highly complimentary to the Prime Minister as. a man. But what then occurred indicates what I might call an allegiance to the present system of party government that is not altothe Ministers of the Crown, they are de facto gether in the best interests of good governthe servants of Parliament, and should be '.ment. Mr G. B . viewed in the light of the fact that he has which we all know has brought democratic come back to office. into details in regard to this matter, because every honourable member is fully seized of all the circumstances connected with the c late crisis. I believe I voice the opinion of the majority, when I assert that these crises have been of a thoroughly artificial nature, that no overwhelming revulsion of opinion has taken place, and that no great national movement has made the changes that have taken place in Parliament at any time necessary. It seems to me that the whole thing has come down to the very low level of party struggles for the Treasury benches, a deI plorable state of affairs, inseparable from present conditions, but which it ought to be our duty to try to obviate by every means in our power. If this evil, which I have tried to indicate, exists, even though to a lesser degree than I believe it does,I am perfectly justified in urging ,that the old principle of the supremacy of Parliament. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -The ideal of British development! get back to what the honourable member says is the ideal of British developParliament represents the people of the country, and ought, therefore, to be supreme in all matters pertaining to legislation and administration. If that is an axiom upon which we may all of us agree, I am quite willing to leave the matter there, and to nave the question debated in any way which will throw light on it, and to allow such further steps to be taken, by means of an inquiry by a Select Committee, or some similar investigation, so that the best methods may be adopted to remedy the evil of which I complain. I have mv own ideas as to the direction in which reform should come, and I have indicated them in a general way in my motion.

34,Mr Fowler,"I think that, while techdegree than has any other civilized community, the principle of electing Ministers by Parliament is working to much more advantage that can be claimed for the system operating at the present time in the various parts of the British Empire. Switzerland, the two Houses meet as one body to elect seven Ministers, who hold office do so would impugn the position of the for the term of the Lower House of the Parliament, namely, for three years, and are not removable, except for gross misconduct. They are elected primarily to administer departments, and the true function of Parliament, that is, legislation, is carried on with again, when a Ministry is thrown out of a facility which surprises those who have been working under such conditions as we have here. I do not believe that the Swiss system is the very best possible. I do not believe, for instance, that Ministers should hold their portfolios absolutely for the term way to do this is to displace the whole of a Parliament, without the possibility of being removed from office except for some very serious offence. My idea is that, as Ministers are the servants of Parliament, they should be removable by Parliament whenever that body may think that it would be a wise and a proper thing to remove them. I would not go so far as to say that a Minister once selected by a Parliament should be removable at any subsequent stage in the history of that Parsuppose, is why the principle of collective liament by the vote of a mere majority; but a strong majority, say three-fourths or four-fifths, of the whole House, should be able to remove a Minister at any time it desired to do so. I can imagine many a case in which a man who had been elected as Minister might adopt an attitude towards Parliament which would make his removal highly necessary and desirable, and one of the great advantages of the system which I propose would be that any individual Minister could be removed without it being necessary to challenge the whole Cabinet. Switzerland, because there Ministers have only to register the popular decisions given by referendum. have a great deal more to do than to record popular decisions. They have control of the legislative work of each session. member may bring forward a motion, but it must be submitted to the Cabinet before it can be submitted to Parliament, and while the initiative and the referendum are undoubtedly at work, these apply only to a small proportion of the legislation which is passed by the Swiss Parliament. ridiculous nature of the present situation Mr Fowler. in this Parliament must have appealed to every honourable member when now and again the action of a particular Minister may have been highly objectionable. But while one may thunder against any MinisIn ter, it is never proposed to take action against him individually, because to whole Cabinet, and it has been very rarely in the history of parliamentary government that a whole Cabinet has done something which Parliament has regarded as justifying its removal from office. Time and office, it is because of the transgression of perhaps only one Minister. And time and again, a Minister who ought to be removed from office remains unchallenged simply because under present conditions .the only Cabinet. These are the results of a system of collective Cabinet responsibility, which high-sounding phrase merely expresses the fact that Ministers, in their own interests, have found it advisable to hang together. hanged separately if they did not. cannot be hanged separately. That, I responsibility has been adopted. given enough rope sometimes. a desire on the part of the House to improve the trade in hemp, but because we cannot very well help ourselves. I think I may claim for my proposal that, as it would enable Parliament to attack a particular Minister who had made himself objectionable, without impugning other Ministers who were carrying out their duties thoroughly well, it would be a step in the right direction. The elective principle would undoubtedly give Parliament that power. In Switzerland Ministers are chosen primarily to administer the Departments. Swiss Ministers They are elected individually. They act for the most part individually; and while they have f u l l power to discuss and conAny sider as a collective body the matters which come before Parliament, it is perfectly competent for any one of them to take individual action if he thinks fit.

' Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I think honourable members must have listened with a great deal of interest to the calm, judicial, and withal very f u l l statement of the case against the present system of executive government presented to us by the honourable member for Perth. think honourable members-know that I have been moving in the same direction as the honourable member, but I am as willing to stand at his back, and support his endeavour ,to. bring about the proposed reform, as.I, would have been to move in the first .instance, .and directly. Under these circumstances, I do not intend to proceed any. further-indeed, ' I think I could not if. I wished to do so-wit h the motion on the notice-paper standing in my name. I "" propose to give the motion now before us the strongest support, and I fear that, owing to the importance of the subject, and the very careful consideration which I may allow tliat I have given to it, I shall occupy some considerable time in speaking. My task will be somewhat shortened owing to the very able way in which the honourable member for Perth has gone over' the whole of the ground, and to the almost strange coincidence of points that he has taken up with those I intended to make. The honourable member's speech shows that his mind' has' been "" working, as necessarily it would, in the same direc-: tion as my own. That is the case with all reformers who may take up this particular subject. As far as I possibly can, I . intend' to avoid those'branches of the sub > : ject to which the honourable member has. done f u l l justice. I wish, in the first place, to point out that, agreeing as I d&i generally with the honourable member, T am not altogether in accord with him as"" to the form in which he has submitted his I do motion. As it now stands, it seems tp me to admit that some legislation is necessary I have to bring about the proposed reforms. I am strongly convinced, and I think I shall be able to quote powerful authorities in. support of that view, that no legislation' We can fairly expect that whatever is required to effect the desired reform-that it does not in any sense involve an alteration of the Constitution, but merely a change in the practice that has grown up under it . To that extent, I differ from the honourable member, and I -intend before concluding to move as an amendment that all the words after the word "" therefore"" be struck out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report upon some better method both, of appointing Ministers of State and constituting trie Executive Council, with power to send for persons and papers, such Committee to consist ofMr Speaker, Sir George Turner, Sir JohnI Quick, Mr Groom, Mr Fowler, Mr Skene, and Mr G.

The proposition that you, Mr Speaker, should become a member of a committee of any sort, outside of the-ordinary sessional committees of the House, is perhaps an extraordinary one; but I hope that we shall be able to prevail upon 3'ou, if the motion be carried, to serve on this body. Your presence on the Committee would emphasize the point that this motion is in no sense a party one. It seems almost an Irishism to talk of a ""motion for the abolition of the party system being so"" construed ; but in any. event I feel that it is very desirable that we should have the assistance of Mr Speaker iri dealing with this question. He would probably preside over the deliberations of the"" Committee,and would materially help us to arrive at a decision as -to what may be possible in the-direction of a reform ""that I am in -: clined to believe a very large number of honourable members, as well as a large majority of the people, favour. member see that it would place Mr relations with my leader, the right honorSpeaker in a controversial position? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I thought for one moment that the appointment of Mr Speaker to this Committee would involve him in any controversy, I should be the last to suggest it. It is because I think the House wishes to emphasize the fact that this proposal is only on a parity with one for an inquiry as to constitutional procedure, that I have included his name in the -personnel of the contemplated Committee. The inquiry would be vested in a very inadequate body if Mr experience, would almost entitle him to use. Speaker, who represents all sides of the 'House, were not a member of the Committee, and I "" trust that he will agree to serve upon it . something being done to remedy the existing state of affairs, I must confess that the more one considers the question, the greater the difficulties in the way of accomplishing the object in view seem to be. I shall intimate later on the direction in which my mind has been working with regard to the solution of this problem, and to show that the great mass of our best thinkers and ablest politicians have been moving, however blindly, in this direction-that they have been endeavouring to see how the difficulties, which have been experienced not only in the Federal Parliament, but in all the Parliaments of the British Dominions where the Executive system of government has been adopted, can be removed. These -difficulties have occurred, and are still being experience, even in the Mother of Parliaments, although the obstacles in the way of a reiform of this wide-reaching nature are so great that it has been impossible to suggest a practical scheme. I wish at the outset to explain my personal association with the motion, in order to remove any misconception with regard to my advocacy of it. In the first place, I may say that the motion was drafted long before the recent Ministerial crisis, and has no relation whatever to that occurrence. As a matter of fact, I had made up my mind long before to move in this direction. honourable member speak of it some years ago. Mr G. B . EDWARDS move any misapprehension that may exist 1 in the minds of my own close political friends as to the motion being possibly construed as a reflection upon my political party leader. I may say at once that my able member for East Sydney, have been I do not. If of the most cordial and satisfactory character. I do not think that in the whole history of party government, any member of a party could have wished for a leader who was more considerate and less exacting than the right honourable member has been to his followers. On every occasion that we have had to consider a matter of party discipline or action, he has refrained from exercising that greafpower which his ability, influence and He has always been willing to concede a large measure of liberty to his followers. This has made him a very popular leader, AlthoughI am in favour of and has given him, I am proud to say, a very loyal following. It will thus be recognised that, in submitting this proposal to the House, I have no desire whatever to reflect upon the right honourable member. It is the feeling-as the honourable member for Perth has put it so well to the House, in his calm, judicial, and well-reasoned language-that as the result of the party government system, the Federal machine has not worked as well as it ought to do, and that similar parliamentary institutions all over the world are not working as well as they ought to do. that has induced me to take this action. I shall endeavour to prove that the party sys-' tern all over the world is producing the gravest political difficulties, and that some other system is possible, under which those difficulties may be minimized. It will be my effort to show that the Cabinet system is an anachronism-that it is what one might called an arrested development. When first brought into operation, it was a verysatisfactory institution, meeting alii thedemands of existing political circumstances, and_ subsequently obtaining the glorified praise of the great Whig writers, who defended the theory of the Revolution. But while we have accepted the Cabinet system, which, at its inception, was held to be a' political achievement, almost reaching the consummation of an ideal, in all other directions there has been, and will continue to be, a development further and further towards giving f u l l democratic power to the community, and allowing every man and woman a free voice in the government of I wish to rethe country.

50,Mr Glynn (Angas),"The honourable shown the people of Great Britain that, foramongst a few, of shall I say, illiberality, one cannot yet flatter himself that ignorance and prejudice no longer affect discussions as to the relations of kindred peoples, or that cock-sure opinions may not be entertained as to the faith and aspirations of a nation about which some of those who express them know little, and possibly care less. subject before us from the constitutional point of view, and if I trespass a little in the matter of retrospect, and deal with history, it is merely for the light that it may shed upon contemporary events. I trust that, whether we believe, or do not believe, in the principle of Home Rule, those of us who are sincere are actuated by the common motive of desire to promote the integrity and welfare of the Empire, as well as the prosperity of each of its parts. The object, of course, is to strike some solution of a difficult ancl much-vexed question. We must endeavour to account for the failure of constitutional union to promote that mutual development of resources and sympathy, that perfect amity and compatibility of temper and national views, which ought to exist between the people of two countries whose characteristics are, to a large extent, complementary; and whose interdependence seemed prescribed by an all-wise Providence when He set them in juxtaposition in the deep. I believe that the day of small independent States has passed. The future, unless the ethics of the Gospel become applied, in deed as well as in word, to international affairs, a consummation more devoutly to be wished for than expected, is undoubtedly for large Empires. The petty States of antiquity, as has been well said by Professor Seeley, are no longer possibleThe lustre of Athens grew pale when Macedonia arose, and Charles V. soon put an end to the palmy days of Florence. States like Finland, Poland, Florence, and others are instances of the failure of the smaller States O'f antiquity to stand against the cupidity and aggression of the larger powers. With the disappearance of small States passes, too, the possibility of realizing evils of concentration. But when large bodies the highest type of political organization. As Empires extend, unless they are based upon the principle of local self-government, a lower form of organization has to be substituted for the old. As Seeley saysIn antiquity the good States were usually cities, and Rome herself, when she became an Empire, was obliged to adopt a lower organization. Mr Glynn. a temper of, We know what the weakness of large Empires is. The weakness of great Empires not based upon the principle of autonomy in local affairs, which is what we claim for Ireland, that ignore local centres of loyalty and affection, is at the present time instanced by the demoralization of Russia. On the other hand, we know that the strength of the BritishI intend to deal with the Empire, the very basis of its integrity, and the welding together into affection of its various parts, is due to the fact that it is based upon the principle of local autonomy. What was said 150 years ago by perhaps the greatest statesman who ever appeared in English politics, one whose memory will survive, if I may quote his own words, applied to another, "" after the grave has heaped its mould upon our presumption,"" is capable of even greater application now. I look, I say, on the Imperial rights of Great Britain, and the privileges the Colonies ought to enjoy under those rights, to be just the most reconcilable things in the world. The Parliament of Great Britain sits at the head of her'extensive Empire in two capacities : one as the local Legislature of this island providing for all things at home, immediately, and by no other instrument than the Executive power. The other, and I think her nobler capacity, is what I call her Imperial character, in which, as from the throne of Heaven, she superintends all the inferior Legislatures, and guides and controls them all without annihilating any. That passage is taken from the speech of Edmund Burke, on American Taxation, and I trust that I am not exaggerating when I say that, if the principle of autonomy and central control for the larger matters of Empire were in his time the most reconcilable things in the world, the reconciliation is more practicable now, when our mutual sympathy is. more complete than it was when those words were spoken. Under either an autocratic or a democratic Government, autonomy is the only alternative to centralization, with its ineffective administration, its attenuated public spirit, and its absence in practice of popular control. Even under the democratic form of Government, in which, I trust, from its working here, we are all believers, we see the of electors, minorities amounting almost at times to a nation in size, .may be disfranchised, as in the case of Great Britain and Ireland, for seven, or perhaps, fourteen years, what is the result? A lack of that solidarity of feeling and purpose which ought to exist, and, through the unchecked dominance of the pnrtv in power, the sense of injustice rankling in the minds of those who have been excluded for long periods from the possibility of initiating or controlling legislation. Lord Acton, who was a home-ruler in the true sense, not one carried away by fervour and desire, not one who believed that a paradise would ensue upon the reconstruction of political machinery, but a man who had drawn his conclusions in favour of autonomy from perhaps the widest researches in history made by any man during the last fifty or 100 years, points out this weakness of the democratic principle where it is applied without local self-government over too wide areas. He saysLiberty depends on the division of power. Democracy tends to unity of power. To keep asunder the agents we must divide the sources; that is, we must maintain or create separate administrative bodies. In the view of increasing democracy a restricted Federalism is the one possible check upon concentration and centralism. It is in a restricted federalism that the solution of the Irish question may be found. Such a solution is all the more necessary now when there is a growing recognition of the principle, whether it be good or had, of basing representation exclusively on population. In the old country there is an agitation to which the Balfour Government, which is remarkable for its pliant back-bone, is bending, for the redistribution of the electorates of the United Kingdom, and the fixing of the proportion of the representation of each of the national units of the union, on the hasis of population, a redistribution which, in my opinion, would be a violation, if not of the letter, of the very spirit of the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland. The principle, however, is, I believe, supported at the present time by a majority, so far as a majority can reflect the true opinions of a people's hearts. Ireland would get a representation of seventy-one members in the House of Commons, whereas now she has 103. should be known. Why does not the honourable and learned member tell us something about Norwav and Sweden? member will shed some of his enlightenment on the subject when he rises to speak. I shall be only too glad to listen to the honourable member. We find that leading State constitutionalists advocate the application as the combination of men in society. of the principle of population to representation, even in Federal matters, in which each State is supposed to retain some representation beyond that which would be accorded to it on a population basis-in other words, equal representation with other States in the Senate. For instance, Professor Burgess, one of the leading constitutional authorities, in an address which was published in the Political Science Quarterly, of the first quarter of this year, saysAccording to modern views, principles, and conditions, no rule of distribution of legislative seats in either Chamber, except the roll of population, can rightfully prevail in a national democratic republic, no matter whether the Government is centralized or Federal. In, then, the great States of modern times, with representation so imperfect in fact, however broad the suffrage, with a practically unchecked dominance of the party in power, with large masses of the people entitled to a franchise ineffective to secure proportionate power, with the inevitable tendency to ignore diversities of local conditions in the interests of a dull and spiritless uniformity prescribed by the majority of the hour, some arrangement under which purely local matters are left to purely local control is indispensable to liberty and good government. The inevitable destruction of local character and colour does not make for union. Australia is a homogeneous country, but its development has been from consolidation to local government, and is not likely to be reversed. The people of the British Island's are not in all respects homogeneousa fact which is evidenced by the application of certain Acts of Parliament to only portions of the Kingdom. Some have been applied only to England, others only to Scotland, and others only to Ireland. Unfortunately, however, that diversity of legislation has been prescribed, not according to the feelings of the inhabitants of the particular portion of the country to which the Acts have been applied, but'by the dominant majority of the hour. On the other hand, I admit that it is impossible for the future to make the State co-extensive with the nation. All States are, now-a-days, more or less composite in their character; but the Federal system itself allows us as great a degree of nationality as is possible.

The American Federation seems to be composed of almost all the races under the sun. .Therefore, my idea of Home Rule does not include, as perhaps that of some other persons may, a recognition of the right and the expediency of forming units under a Federal system, based purely on nationality. I hold that some modification of the constitutional relations of Great Britain and Ireland is necessarya modification in the direction of Federalism, under which such matters as the Army and Navy, diplomacy, and all those larger matters of Empire, as well as matters in which uniform legislation could be applied, might be delegated to the central Parliamentlearned, member think that that would suit those who are now advocating Home Rule? that the moment we begin to deal with particular methods, various opinions are held.

I have already quoted Burke, and I should like to make another quotation from his last message-to the peoples of the two islands, which might be put generally as the basis of a system that ought to satisfy the aspirations of the two countries. Even before the union, some suggestions were made for the reconstruction of the political machinery, more likely to meet the needs of modern times. Burke saysMy poor opinion is that the closest connection applicable to England at the time of the between Great Britain and Ireland is essential to the well-being, I had almost said to the very being, of the two countries. FOT that purpose, I humbly conceive that the whole of the superior, and what I would call Imperial, politics ought to have its residence here, and that Ireland locally, civilly, and commercially independent, ought politically to look up to Great Britain in matters of peace and war, on all points to be guided by her, and, in a word, with her to live and die. Now, if the words ""Great Britain"" were replaced by the words "" the Federal State,"" as the representative of the larger matters concerning all parts of the United Kingdom, if Federalism were the principleand in my opinion it could be associated with fieedom of mutual commerce-w e should have the basis upon which most Federal States of modern times have been organized. We should'have the principle under which the American Constitution has led to a union, not only in act but in feel1 ing, between States which a hundred years Does the honourable and ago were remarkable for their diversity; under which they have grown to unexampled prosperity; a principle which has been adequate to the necessities of democratic Switzerland, and which has been even adapted to the more militant type of organization exemplified by the Germanic Federation. We should adopt that type of Federalism which' would help us towards the successful solution of the difficultieswhich have been too long-abiding-betwee n Great Britain ard Ireland. Now, having dealt with the constitutional matter, let us see whether the union has really worked as successfully as was predicted by those who made it a reality. In his message to the King, in January, 1799, advocating the union, Pitt said it would beThe free and voluntary association of two great countries which join for the common benefit in one Empire, where each will retain its proportional weight and importance, under the security, of equal laws, reciprocal affection, and inseparable interests, and which wants nothing but that indissoluble connection torender them invincible. Have the predictions of Pitt been realized as to. the security of equal laws ? Is it not a significant reflection upon the work of the Union, that in the very first year, 1801, no less than five Coercion Laws were passed, and one of the severest of insurrection lawjs to suppress the agitation for Catholic emancipation was placed on the statute-book? A few years ago, a writer in the Pall Mall Gazette, referring to the Insurrection Laws of 1823-25, said that if such laws were Corn Laws, Cobden and Bright would have been sentenced to seven years' transportation by justices or landlords interested in maintaining the taxes on the food of the",30,Homerule For Ireland

Then, has equality been suggested by the facts mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that until the last few years there was a difference in the basis of the franchise; that there was no local government until 1898; that the people of Ireland suffered under religious disabilities-and not even the Test Acts were repealed until 1832, and then only under the stress of a very disturbing agitation. I am sure that the House will excuse me if, not with the idea of promoting asperities, but merely for the purpose of shedding a little light on present conditions, I refer to the question, above all others, that for years past has .been at the root of Irish discontent, namely, the land question. Ireland, even at present, is a country in which three-fourths of the population are directly dependent on the products of the soil. eighteenth century were, owing to the unfortunately narrow views of those days, crushed by direct legislation. Froudea by no means perfectly impartial historianon this question says :Ireland was regarded as a colony to be administered, not for her own benefit, but for the convenience of the mother country. What were some of these commercial laws ? In 1663 the exportation of cattle from Ireland to Great Britain was prevented by "" An Act for the Encouragement of Trade."" An agitation afterwards sprung up for the destruction, of the growing woollen industry of Ireland. A petition was presented to the Government by various English merchants, who asked that the woollen industry in Ireland should be suppressed, and a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which reported on the linen trade in 1825, This export (the woollen) was supposed to inmany cases the landlords, unfortunately, terfere, and very probably did, with the export from Britain,and a plan was in consequence undertaken to annihilate the whole woollen trade of Ireland, and to confine us to the linen manufacture in its stead. When that petition was presented, His Majesty promised to doA ll that in me lies to discourage the woollen manufacture in Ireland and encourage the linen manufacture there, and to promote the trade of England. By the Statute 10 and n William III . , Ch. 10a monarch far more liberal than some of those who prostitute his namethe export of woollens manufactured from Ireland was prohibited. Froude, in referring to those laws, of which I have given only one or two instances, wroteEngland governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculation on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving her moral obligations to accumulate as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the Statutebook of the Universe. I have referred from sheer necessity of explanation to these laws of the past, which I believe not one-fiftieth of the population of Great Britain would now refuse to describe as oppressive. A better spirit prevails in the present day. I remember hearing John Morley say in one of his speeches twenty years ago thatTime was when the Irish peasant saw no light We must remember that upon his horizon save that which shone upon him from across the floods of the broad Atlantic. He now sees a new light, a beacon of liope, nearer homeHer growing manufactures in the referring to Englandthat shall not be put out. Under these laws the people were once more driven back upon the soil. What were the conditions of occupation under which they were to win from the soil the means of subsistence ? Tenure was practically at will. The Land Act of 1870, passed on the initiation of Mr Gladstone, was designed to put an end to capricious eviction. For reasons upon which I need not enter in some cases it failed. The prevailing tenancy system was then at will or from year to year, and in some instances the receipts given for rents regularly bore a notice to quit. This endorsement was made so as to place the tenant absolutely at .the power of the landlord, and also in some cases for electoral purposes. The result of this system was, as stated by the Devon Commission in 1845, that-""the want of saidfixity of tenure paralyzed all exertion."" In were absentees. This was due to some extent to the Union itself, as its establishment put an end to the existence of Dublin as the chief residence of the so-called aristocracy. The absentee system was increased by an unfortunate piece of legislation called the Encumbered Estates Act, which was passed in 1849 or 1.850. After the stress of the famine,, when mortgagees became importunate for their interest and principal, and rents were not as easily procurable as before, owing to the poverty of the people and the unfortunate condition of the country, this Act was passed to enable expeditious sales of estates to take place on the application of mortgagees. Many large estates werethen placed on the market, and were purchased, in most cases, as speculations by absentees, at a price equivalent to six or seven years' rental. These estates were managed to a great extent by local agents on behalf of absentee proprietors, and as the result of the unfortunate piece of legislation to which 1 have just referred, distress and discontent were intensified. The custom in Ireland is for landlords to be non-improvers of holdings. the landlords have always been improvers. One seldom or never heard of such a thing in Ireland as a farm that had been improved by the landlord, for the improvements were invariably made by the tenant. I am speaking, now of three-fourths of Ireland, in which the bulk of the people are dependent on the soil. however, tenant right was recognised, with the result that a much greater degree of satisfaction was secured. ""made"" by the carting of soil, and rent being paid for a patch formed in that way. of the Galtee Mountains that men had actually carried soil in baskets on their backs for a distance of two miles up the mountainside, in order to make the miserable little plantations round their cottages, on which they grew the potatoes that kept them alive. M ill , a dispassionate observer, referring to the landlords under the system prevailing in the middle of the last century, saysReturning nothing to the soil they consume the whole produce minus the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of famine. I have already referred to the Devon Commission, which consisted almost whollv of representatives of the landlord class. That Commission commenced its inquiries in 1844, sat for about eighteen months, and examined 1...100 or 1,200. witnesses. its issue of 6th February, 1884, The Times referred to the question to be dealt with by the Commission asThe most portentous question with regai-H to Ireland to be found within the vast scope of material economy; on which depends, in a manner, the existence of Ireland as a nation existing to the degree to which it does exist under the sway of civil government. When Lord Russell proposed to put some check upon capricious eviction-to put a limitation upon the arbitrary power of a landlord to depopulate a district that has so often supplied the Army of the United Kingdom with men on whose dash and brilliancy in emergencies the Empire has often successfully depended, what was done? The Bil l introduced by him was ignominiously rejected by the House of Lords. Forty years after this, the late General Gordon, after spending some months in travelling through Ireland, described the then condition of the peasantry in these words :In England, on the contrary, The state of our fellow countrymen in the south-west of Ireland is worse than that of any people in the world, let alone Europe. What was the result? As was pointed out by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, the result of all this was depopulation-it was the check on industrial and various other conditions that determined the In Ulster, exodus of the people. We find that the population of Ireland in 1845, at the time of the sitting of the Devon Commission, was 8,400,000; but, according to returns for the present year, it has shrunk, from I have known land to ce various causes, to 4,350,000. For manv years the people left I eland at the rate of 80,000 per annum, and even now the exodus It was proved in the case is going on to the extent of nearly 38,000 a year. An unfortunate feature of the movement is that the young go, but the old remain. It is a remarkable fact, as was evidenced by the figures which Sir Robert Giffen placed before the Financial Relations Commission in 1893-figure s Avhich are said in a recent article in the Nineteenth Century to be equally applicable noAv-that , Avhile in England and Scotland, in round numbers, 13 per cent, of the male population is oA'er fifty years of age, in the case of Ireland 18 per cent, of the population is ever fifty years.

The large proportion of old people among the population of Ireland reacts on wages.

The absence of remedial legislation, and the pressure of unequallaws, has to a large extent contributed until recently, at all events, to these conditions. I acknowledge that, within recent years , measures designed 1 in the most liberal spirit, and with possibly far-reaching effects, have been placed upon the Statute-book. ment Act and the Land Act. member that I do not forget them. tween 1886 and 1891 a sum of no less than .£40,000,000 was advanced or guaranteed by the Treasury of the United Kingdom to enable tenants to purchase their own holdings where landlords were willing to part with them. Again, in 1904, a measure was passed by a very large majority -practicall y by almost a unanimous vote -unde r which arrangements have been made to advance, within a comparatively short period, up to ^100,000,000, to enable tenants to purchase their own holdings, and giving landlords, as an inducement to sell, a bonus of £12,000,000 on the purchase price. Under these laws there are now no less than 80,000 proprietors, where formerly they were but mere tenants, liable at short notice in some ; cases, to be evicted. legislation has been most marked on the industrial development of Ireland and the well-being of the people in districts to which the system of peasant proprietorship has extended. I do not believe, however, that some of the legislation that has been passed with the best of intentions has been the best solution of the land problem, although it has been accepted by 80 per cent, of the people of the country. If the State purchases the land, it ought to own it, because a time comes when peasant proprietary eventually goes back. occurs, at all events,-in progressive communities, where the dual system returns, and the solution which was accepted as a compromise is not one that I can endorse as being the most conducive eventually to the integrity of the Empire and to the well-being of that part of it which it affects. But it is a great advance. As the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, it is an unfortunate fact that these remedial measures have been too long delayed. I do not intend to refer to the I am endeavouring to Financial Relations Commission, an analysis of whose report has been so well given to the House by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but shall content myself with merely stating that, in an article by Lord Dunraven, i i i the last number of the Nineteenth Century to hand, it is estimated that the over-taxation of Ireland at present is £4,000,000. I merely mention the fact, without wishing to examine the statement, because there mav be other considerations-beside s those takeii into account by Lord Dunraven-whic h to some extent may have been ignored or not I assure the honourable have had due weight given to them. J may Beagain refer to the fact that the Financial Relations Commission almost unanimously reported that, in the case of Ireland, taxation is far in excess of the capacity to bear it. _ Now let us look at the working of the Union from the point of view of administration. To put it shortly, in Scotland the Government officials receive £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, as against £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 paid in Ireland. In Scotland the police cost .£539,196, as against £1,567,214 in Ireland, although, according to the report to which I have referred, ordinary crime in Ireland is just half that in Scotland. The Castle system in Ireland has been callJd a regular Eldorado for privileged persons, and this is occupying largely the cause of a great deal of the still lingering disaffection. Arnold White, writing in the Fortnightly Review for OctoThe result of this ber, saysIrish discontent and anxiety as to the future, to-day, are not mainly with the English Government as such, but vested interests which have framed the Castle government as a Caliban for the performance, of servile tasks, useful to the party of ascendency in Ireland, but neither serving the interests of the Empire nor conducing to the maintenance of the union.

67,That Mr Wilks,"Does the honourable andordinate Parliament; but it is idle to juggle with words; the honourable member may mean one thing and I another by the word "" co-ordinate."" Every Home Rule Bill which has been introduced, recognises the supremacy of the central Government, but the Bill of 1896, unfortunately, made the mistake of excluding the Irish from representation in that central Parliament. Such exclusion would have caused a jarring of interests and a sense of subordination without control not conducive to the welfare of ihe Empire. Local government is not . advanced as a political panacea; still representative and responsible government in an autonomous and democratic State, is the only conceivable form that has the ele-^ ments of endurance, and whatever degree ef efficiency may be obtainable. But, except under ideal conditions, it will never lead to the millennium. Th'e imperfections of human character, the rarity of. foresight, common sense,! and a patriotism, that is not partly self-regarding, the complexity of modern affairs, the dependence of the best regulated State on external conditions bevond its control, the fact that party prejudices and perceptions largely decide the issues of our so-called deliberative assemblies-al l tend to affect the working of the best political machine. It was this that inspired the bitter, and perhaps extreme opinion of Swift, that ""whoever could make two ears of-corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians together."" being of opinion that self-government in local affairs can accomplisheverything, ancl is the only condition of industrial development and popular well-being, I believe that it will help towards the realization of those two great ends of civil government, and at the same time conduce towards the greater growth of relations of perfect amity and co-operation between the peoples of two countries designed by Providence for an alliance of strength and affection that the folly of man has too long helped to mar. the honourable and learned members for Northern Melbourne and Angas are, I -suppose, the most. perfect contributions we have yet had in defence of the Home Rule movement. In saying that, I do not in any way desire to be invidious, because I do not forget the speech of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, when he brought forward this question last session. 1 trust that I shall deal with the subject in the same calm, dispassionate spirit that characterized the main portion of the speeches to which I have referred. No one could listen to tlie recital of the grievances of. any nation without sympathy, or without a dislike of the system under which they occur, if it can be proved that the system is the cause. For instance, the account which the honourable and learned member for Angas gave of the low wages paid to certain classes of the community in Ireland could not fail to appeal to anyone with a sympathetic nature, and no one could pretend to defend such wrongs, as those which, as we know from history, have been suffered under the land laws of that country. But it must not be forgotten that agiarian trouble is not confined to Ireland. Even under the advanced laws of Australia there has been trouble in this connection, and the land laws have had to be altered in order to ameliorate the condition of agriculturists throughout the continent. The motion is lengthy, explanatory, and sentimental, and makes a strong appeal to our sympathy; and if it were not for the effects which would follow Home Rule, there would be very little objection to endorsing the proposal. But whenever we find a lengthy motion, in which there is embodied a defence of the principles advocated, it is regarded by old parliamentarians as evidence of weakness. A motion which requires a good deal of padding-whic h is, as it were, a ""gilded pill""-is looked upon But while far from with much keener interest and suspicion than is a more simply-framed proposal. In the motion there occurs the following :We have observed, with feelings of profound satisfaction, the evidence afforded by recent legislation and recent debate in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with Ireland; and, in particular, we congratulate the people of the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question,' and on the concession to the people of Ireland of a measure of local government for municipal purposes. That statement takes it for granted that all honourable members are seized of the facts. I do not pretend to say whether that assumption is right or wrong, but I sincerely trust that there are grounds for ""feelings of profound satisfaction.""

89,Mr Robinson (Wannon),"I haveundertake, and a somewhat similar statement appears in to-day's Age. The facts of the case are as follow:-About ago, at the special request of the Customs Department, the Canadian Government directed an expert to inquire into the manufacture of harvesters in Canada, and report whether the price at which they were invoiced to the Commonwealth was a fair one. It appears from the papers on the departmental file that an exhaustive inquiry was made, and a letter setting out the views of the Canadian authorities was forwarded to Australia. that case; but, on the contrary, the Commonwealth Government caused a letter to be sent thanking the Canadian Government in the most glowing terms, for their action. In another case, having reference to an article of consumption, with the name of which honourable members will, no doubt, be familiar through the advertisements in the newspapers and elsewhere, I refer to "" Force,"" the Canadian Customs authorities were asked for information as to value, and they gave the fullest information. In another case they were asked to give their valuation of an article of food called ""Orange Meat,"" but they replied as follows : -'The Department is unable to meet your wishes in this instance, as the Minister decided some time on the understanding that it was to be ago that it was inadvisable for officers of the Customs in Canada to undertake inquiries in respect of such matters for Customs purposes in other countries. That action on the part of the Canadian authorities has been described in the press as churlish; but I do not think that any such interpretation should be placed on their conduct. Honourable members know that it would be difficult for any Government to inquire into any manufacturer's business, and find out the cost of production of the article made by him. For instance, if the Cust.oms authorities, at the request of the Argentine Government, went through some manufacturing establishment such as that owned by the McKay Harvester Company, and ascertained the cost of -producing harvesters, there would be a public outcry, in which every section of the community would join. very good reasons for such an outcry. We know that, in order to obtain statistics of production in Victoria, the Government tvhat I WILLIAM have to enter into a solemn undertaking with producers and manufacturers that the said particulars with which they are supplied will not be used for other than statistical purposes. If we treat our own people in this way, how can we expect other Governa year ments to deal with their citizens in any other manner. It is most unreasonable for the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Ministerial organ, to take the view that the attitude assumed by the Canadian Government is churlish. We would not comply with such a request ourselves, and we should not describe as churlish the refusal of another Government. As has been pointed out to the Customs Department on behalf of the Canadian Government, if the There was no refusal in Customs officials were entitled to overhaul a man's business and find out the cost of manufacture, and the profit derived, the manufacturer would be subjected to oppression in a political sense. If , for instance, a manufacturer were engaged in industry subject to the operation of a wages board, he would very strongly object to his cost of production and rate of profit being made known. We have specially provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that all evidence touching upon this matter shall be treated as confidential. In Victoria recently, a case was referred from a wages board to an industrial Court, and certain questions were asked as to the cost of manufacture and the profit made upon chemical manures. The information was handed in treatdrl confidentially, and was to be communicated to the Chairman of the Court only. We deliberately refrain from allowing the taxing Departments of the Government to make inquiries into the cost of production and the wholesale value of manufactured products, and yet it has been alleged by the Customs Department that the decision of the Canadian authorities to adopt a similar course is churlish. I do not think we can reasonably expect the Canadian Government to take up a matter of that kind. Regarding the general debate which took place a few days ago on the subject of the duty on harvesters, I need only say that I was perfectly satisfied with the concluding remarks of the Minister, to the effect that he would put no obstacle in the way of the Massey-Harris Company testing their case in the Law There would be Courts. Sir LYME -That is not quite said. wasI believe in fair play, and whilst I am not sure that the right of appeal prevails, I may say",37,Supply Formal Customs Inquirie Sin Canada Defence Forces At Portland Common Wealth Press Writer Federal Capital Massey Harris Company Retiring Allowance Of Post Office Employe S Postal Administration

If he can see his way ceedings against the Government, I should be very much disposed not to place any impediment in their way, but to give them every facility. I cannot say anything fairer than that. For my own part, I do not think the Minister could have said anything fairer than tliat. If he gives the company every facility and does not place impediments'in the way of having this difficult question settled before the High Court of Australia, I do not think any reasonable man can take exception to his attitude. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, namely, the necessity of establishing some branch of the DefenceI orce at Portland. Yesterday, I asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question on the subject. Last year, I brought this matter before the House, and I was "" bluffed out "" on the ground that the question should have been brought up before the Estimates were prepared. I wish to bring it forward on this occasion in good time, so that consideration may be given to the matter when the Estimates are being framed. Ever since the settlement of Victoria, the town of Portland has had an' arm of the Defence Force stationed there. It is the oldest settlement in Victoria, and has historical associations which attach to no other place in the 'State. For many years a battery of garrison artillery was stationed there, but that has been taken away. The residents have, over and over again, urged the Government to allow some arm of the Defence Force to be established at Portland, even though it be only a corps of rangers. So long as the defensive instinct of the people of the district is allowed some outlet they will be satisfied. They d'onot think that they should be entirely deprived of that which they have for so many years enjoyed. I can assure the Government that very strong feeling prevails among my constituents upon this point, and I think that the district is entitled to the fullest consideration. The town of Portland possesses a fine drill-hall, and all the facilities necessary for training some branch of the Defence Force, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council will use his best efforts to comply with the wishes of the people there I shall feel inclined to forgive him many of the political sins he has committed during the last few weeks. In conclusion, I wish to express the hope that the Postmaster-General will endeavour to comply Mr Robinson. with the wishes of the deputation which waited upon him to-day upon the subject of clear to grant the request of the deputation he will confer a great boon on the residents in the country districts, and will earn their lasting gratitude. matter to which I wish to direct attention, and it relates to a question I asked last week with regard to the appointment, through the Prime Minister's office, of Mr John Plummer, of Sydney, as press writer 1 to the Commonwealth. Mr Plummer was engaged until recently in conducting very strong free-trade attacks upon those States that had taken up a protectionist attitude. As far back as December last, he was appointed as press writer to the Commonwealth, and is receiving payment at the rate of .£400 per annum. His articles are to appear in the English, American, and Continental newspapers, and copies are to be seen at the Prime Minister's office. I have read sOme of his articles, most of which seem of a fairly^ useful and informative nature. In the few minutes I had at my disposal, I have made four or five extracts from articles written by this gentleman, and think they show that the Government is treading on dangerous ground in paying a journalist to represent the views of the Commonwealth in the public press. At page 12 of the Department's Book of ExtractsI find the following statement: Brigadier-General Finn's appointment will expire in 1906. The probability is, however, that his engagement will be extended for a further term of years. This is purely a matter of opinion, and some of us advocate the appointment of Australians to this position. Then again at the same page, we find the following In the southern portions of the Queensland sugar country coloured labour is not essential, but the supply of white labour is largely a matter of wages. The assumption, of course, is that coloured labour, is necessary in the northern parts of Queensland. Here is an extract from an article published on the 17th of March last, which appears at page 15 of the Book of Extracts:The system of old-age pensions at present confined to New South Wales and Victoria must be regarded somewhat in the nature of an experiment, and its adoption by the Commonwealth Government will largely depend on the success",38,Supply Formal Customs Inquirie Sin Canada Defence Forces At Portland Common Wealth Press Writer Federal Capital Massey Harris Company Retiring Allowance Of Post Office Employe S Postal Administration

I mer, who is a subsidized agent of the Commonwealth, must necessarily commit this Commonwealth to opinions to which it should not be bound. I come now to another extract from an article written by this gentlemer's old-time attack on the protectionist policy. Not long ago, before entering the Commonwealth service, he published a series of articles with a view of showing how badly the workmen of Victoria and South Australia were paid as compared with their fellow-workers in New South Wales. Writing on the 19th ultimo to the Yorkshire Daily Observer, the Daily Exfress, . Dublin, the Kilkenny Moderator, and other journals, he made this statement : The average weekly rates of wages to men in New South Wales ranged from ^2 Ss. 8d to £ 1 os. iod., and in Victoria from £ 2 4s. n d . to ,£1 is. 1 i d . This is an attempt to show that the free trade policy of New South Wales enables the workers of that State to earn an average weeklv wage of about 4s. in excess of that available in Victoria under the benighted system of protection. Here is another extract from an article on Australian Loan Policy, published on 6th December, 1904Mistakes may occasionally have been made, for the Australians have yet much to learn in the work of financial administration, but the experience gained from these w ill , unquestionably, many public men in this State, took it prevftit their repetition. This extract appears at page 10 of the We all know that it is hard for -a writer to confine himself to facts, and I would certainly urge the Prime Minister to seriously consider whether it is desirable to continue this system.

On returning from Sydney on Tuesday last I Avas handed a copy of the Age containing a letter Avritten by Mr Moore, referring to a speech of mine on the harvester question, in which he asserted that he had given no evidence as to the cost of the machines, and that his testimony related solely to the question of distribution.

I may have given this newspaper too much importance, but some public men would seem to be afraid of journals like this, and, indeed, one can clearly understand their position. same newspaper tried to hound out of public life ai man, with whose politics I do not agree, but who was thenonly acting in the interests of the country. For years the Age newspaper advocated a law which would call upon people through whose properties railways were constructed, to hand the necessary land over free of cost; but when it was decided to construct a railway through land belonging to Mr David Syme, that gentleman' desired, for his own special benefit, to have the law repealed. Senator Trenwith, who was then Minister for Railways in Victoria, had the courage to refuse to comply with Mr Syme's request, and determined to make the wealthy man disgorge; and for that reason the newspaper was used in an endeavour to hound him out of public life. Personally I do not care a snap of the finger for this or any other newspaper. ney Daily paper. I have never been made a tool of by either the Daily Telegraph or the Sydney Morning Herald. paper in my electorate, which is bitterly opposed to me, personally and politically, but I can say that that newspaper never refused to insert a letter which I deemed it necessary to publish"" in its columns. It is time some la.w was passed to compel newspapers-which , by the way, claim privileges all the time to publish communications without any mutilation, when it is desired to rebut reflections made on public men, I wish the Minister to think over the matter, when I am sure he will realize lhe wrong he has done in raising the valuation. Had these been deserving men, the Minister could not have been Blamed for his zeal; but that the contrary is the case is plainly Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney;. I desire to mention a grievance which, though it affects persons who may be deemed insignificant, ought to receive some attention. In the early days of the session, I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General the case of two men, Bartholomew and Frizzell, who, after long and meritorious service in the New South Wales Post Office, were, under a law passed by this Parliament, compulsorily retired on reaching the age of sixty. Und'er the law of New South Wales these men were entitled to a retiring allowance of one months' pay for every year's sendee; and I do not This think that that statement will be disputed, seeing that similar allowances have been allowed by both the State and the Commonwealth. For some reason or another the Federal Government and the State Government came to loggerheads as to the way in which this retiring allowance was to be computed, and the result was that those men, who were retired eighteen months ago, had to wait eight or nine months before they got any satisfaction, and then, I believe, only half of the amount was paid. These men were old, and had no provision for their old age, and yet they were cast out into the cold world, where, for the period I have mentioned, ithey had actually to. live on credit, awaiting a decision. I wrote lo the late Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava, on the subject, and he was good enough to express his keen sympathy. But he threw the blame on the State Government. Whatever the difficulty is beTelegraph? tween the two Governments, these old men I care for no newswere discharged under our own law, with practically a certificate of good behaviour during twenty odd years. It was There is a newsthe duty of the Post and Telegraph authorities, as the custodians of these men's interests, to see that they did not suffer an injustice. Some settlement ought to have been made on amicable terms,, or, failing that, the extreme step should have been taken of obtaining a decision of the Court. The Federal Government do not say the men are not entitled to the f u l l claim, but, because the Sta,te Government are not willing to agree to the amount, the Federal Government are pusillanimous enough not to protect its own servants, and allow them to",41,Supply Formal Customs Inquirie Sin Canada Defence Forces At Portland Common Wealth Press Writer Federal Capital Massey Harris Company Retiring Allowance Of Post Office Employe S Postal Administration

EDWARDS Minister is mistaken, or, if the case has been settled, it is only very recently. tain the case has been settled. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I hope I shall have the right honourable gentleman's assistance in settling it. The injustice of this case has been admitted by one Minister after another. That admission was made by the late Postmaster General, and has also been made, in a round-about way, by the present master-General; and now I may take it that the Treasurer acknowledges that something ought to be done. It is the duty of Commonwealth Ministers to protect the rights of our public servants, and not to cast them adrift on the' world without any provision for their old age. the case has been settled,, I am afraid it is only to the extent of half the amount due; and if that be so, I hope the question will be re-opened. Such an act of injustice is beneath the dignity of the Government. long years of service ought not to be kept out of their just dues for eight or nine months, and thus exposed to the risk of not being able to obtain the bare necessaries of life. or three matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the House. The first of them relates to the Federal Capital Site. For a considerable time past, correspondence has been in progress between the Governments of New South Wales and the Commonwealth in reference to this matter, and at the present time there appears to be a deadlock in regard to it. This deadlock seems to be due to a desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government not to give consideration to fhe reasonable representations of the New South Wales Government concerning the rights of that State in connection with the matter of territory. I have always held-and I brought this view before the House when speaking on the Seat of Government Bill-that , according to the strict reading of tbe Constitution, whilst'the Federal Parliament had a right to determine the Seat of Government, that right was to be exercised only after territory had been ceded to the Commonwealth by the State of New out of one-half of their South Wales, or acquired by the Commonwealth. The more I read the section of the Constitution which deals with the matter, the more am I convinced that that is what I think the was meant. Notwithstanding the attempts of astute lawyers to strain the meaning of the section, it will appear to every intelligent am pretty cerlay mind that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was that New South Wales should first grant the necessary terriI f it has not,. tory to the Commonwealth, and that then the Federal Parliament should decide where the Federal Capital should be within that territory. In my opinion, in dealing with this matter we have gone the. wrong way to work, and should start afresh. The Federal Parliament has, in my opinion, unPostwisely selected a. site for the Federal Capital without first ascertaining whether New South Wales would grant the territory in which that site is situated. South Wales offered the site which was If chosen. land there. was actually done in that regard at the time referred to by the Postmaster-General; Men who have given but I believe that there were other sites offered. member like the Federal Capital to be? I should like it to be near Sydney. bourne as it would be in Svdney. Sydney itself would be a proper place for the Federal Capital; but at a little distance from Sydney there are .suitable sites, one of which might be chosen with advantage, but for the 100 miles limitation of the Constitution. Of these I have indicated my preference for a site lying between George's River ancl National Park. ber's electorate? is my personal preference, because I think it an eminently suitable site, Parliament is debarred by the Constitution from considering it.

Lyndhurst, Tooma, and Dalgety were the three sites put before us, and I think that any impartial person would have said that Lyndhurst was absolutely the best of them in respect of climate, natural resources, accessibility, and general suitability. It is contiguous to the loop-line from Blayney to Harden, which connects the southern and western railway systems of New South Wales, and will ultimately become a main trunk line, connecting the capitals of the States, greatly shortening the through railway journey from Brisbane and other parts of Queensland to Melbourne,' and all places in Victoria, as well as to Adelaide and all places in South Australia.

I should have strenuously opposed any limitation on the choice of the representatives of the people in this matter. The present situation is causing great friction in New South Wales, because the people of that State see that their interests are being sacrified to those of Victoria. The Minister of Trade and Customs tried to get Parliament to choose a site as near as possible to the border of Victoria, and if the site which he supported had been chosen, and it had been necessary that it should be in the centre of Federal territory, that territory would have extended over the border of New South Wales into Victoria. member ever seen Tooma? time there three years ago, and know its proximity to show-clad mountains.

The public feeling on this question is so high in New South Wales that I am confident that if a referendum were taken there to-morrow there would be a practically unanimous vote for secession from the Union. This is what the Constitution declares in regard to the matter. as follows :The Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be in territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth . . . and shall be . miles from Sydney. I submit, as I have submitted before, that the words "" territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth "" pre-suppose that the territory shall have been! granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth before the Seat of Government is determined upon by this Parliament. I say, therefore, that in deciding on the Seat of Government before we have acquired any territory, we have been putting the cart before the horse, and have thereby made a serious mistake. I think we ought to recognise this, and be prepared to reconsider the matter. quire the territory before we fixed upon the locality ? acquiring it if the New South Wales Government are prepared to say to the Commonwealth Government, "" We will allow you to take up your territory in a certain quarter."" I understand that the New South Wales Government are prepared to do that, and if that be so, we should consider their proposals, and try to meet them as far as possible, instead of continuing in opposition to their wishes. The interpretation of the Constitution from the point of view of the New South Wales authorities coincides with my own, and also with that of every reasonable man. I hope that the Government will yet give consideration to this matter. of his letters to the Premier of New South Wales, which have just been published in the newspaper, saysThe determination of Parliament regarding the Dalgety site was arrived at after many months of careful inquiry upon complete information, and with a f u l l desire to do justice, not only to the several States of the union, but to the people of New South Wales. He then goes on to say that, in his judgment, good faith has been kept with New South Wales. I say that that is not a fair statement of the case. member's point of view. of view is supported by the evidence of my own vote. I disapproved of the Dalgety Section 135 reads site, but I voted for it, because, after the site which I preferred, and for which I voted in the first instance, had been rejected, I had only two sites to choose from, namely, Tooma and Dalgety. I did not approve of either of these sites, But I had distant not less than 100 no recourse but to vote for that which was the less objectionable in my eyes. The same thing happened in the case of many other representatives of New South Wales. Under these circumstances, how could it be said that the selection was fairly representative of the opinion of honourable members. I sav that the result of the voting did not fairly represent the feeling of this House, and that certainly another opportunity ought to be afforded to those who desire to have this question re-opened to vote for other sites. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The second position would, I am afraid, be worse than the first. any more upon the subject of the Federal Capital Site. A few davs ago I asked the Postmaster-General certain questions, which I repeated to-day. I asked1. Is it a fact that electricians and mechanics employed in the Department who handle no money belonging to the Department are required to contribute to a guarantee fund equally with officers who have the handling of large sums of public money ? 2. If such a practice obtains, does the Postmaster-General consider it a fair one; and, if not, will he endeavour to alter it? To the second question I received the following reply:The rule which has been laid down is that officers through whose hands articles of value pass in the execution of their duty shall furnish guarantee to such an extent as will protect the Department against loss, and the PostmasterThe Prime Minister, in one General considers this a fair rule.

It is clear, however, that it has not been settled. It is a very live question at the present time, because the Constitution declares that the site of the Seat of Government can be settled only when the necessary grant of land shall have been made by the Government of New South Wales. It is in connection with the granting of the land by the State Government that the immediate difficulty has arisen.. I am one of those who, when the matter was being debated in the House, took up the position that we were approaching it in the wrong way. I , with others on this side of the House, urged very strongly that the Seat of Government Bill should not be passed, at all events for some time to come; that we ought to proceed first of all by resolution, and on the basis of that resolution open up negotiations with the New South Wales Government relative to the selection of the site. The final act of determination should have been a Bill such as has already been passed. We are now told that the Seat of Government Bill is mandatory in its terms; but in reply we have the statement of the Premier of New South Wales, when application is made for the grant of land, that the decision of the Parliament of that State, that the site on which the* Commonwealth Parliament has determined shall not be granted, is equally mandatory. In this way a deadlock has occurred. I presume it is not one that must necessarily continue. I take it that it is one of those stiles over which we, as reasonable men, can step, with the exercise of a little prudence, common sense, and Eederal feeling. It is because I hold that view verystrongly that I make these remarks. I hope we shall hear nothing in connection with this matter that will provoke a feeling of hostility on either side. My desire is that it may be settled as speedily as possible, and with the utmost of good feeling. This Parliament has dealt with one stage of the question. We have decided upon the site of the Capital, but the acquirement of the land has yet to be dealt with, and New South Wales interposes with thestatement that, since she has to grant the land, she should have' some voice in thedetermination of the district in which the Capital shall be situated. I submit that, apart altogether from the legalities and' technicalities of the question, there should be, on the basis of equity and reason, someright inhering in New South Wales to speak as to the situation of the land which she is to be asked to hand over to theFederation. That has been recognised all through the debate. There has been no-",46,William Lyne The Honourable

When the Seat of Government Bill was under the consideration of the House the fact that nothing of the kind could be contemplated was clearly recognised by the present'Attorney-General. In the course of a speech made by the right honourable member for East Sydney, the honourable and learned member for Indi declared that it was not intended under that Bill to take any land. The report, which is to be found at page 3956 of Hansard, vol. sr, 1904, proceeds as follows :pression of opinion ? and we cannot take land by the B ill . passing this clause seriously. Wales. At a later stage, the Attorney-General made it clear that the Seat of Government Bill did not provide for the mandatory settlement of this question. He saidI contend, however, that this Parliament has not only the first word, but also the last word, although New South Wales also has necessarily some voice in the matter. New South Wales is raising her voice on the present occasion, and it is in dissidence with that of the Federal Parliament. We have declared that Dalgety is to be the site of the Federal Capital, but New South Wales, speaking through . its Premier, says that it ought not to be, a free gift of land in each case-the selection of any one of which would, in the opinion of the people of that State, be more suitable, and certainly more in accord with the section of the Constitution which provides for the establishment of the Capital in New South Wales. This is the point which the negptiations have now reached. During the last few months considerable correspondence has passed between the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales. The Premier of New South Wales has now framed a set of questions which he asserts ought to be submitted to the High Court, and asks the Prime Minister's concurrence in, this reference to decide the issue between them. Here is an extract from the last reply made by the Prime MinisterIt would appear that the High Court will not of the Premier of New South Wales, to entertain any questions of law where framed make the cause of action, instead of throwmerely to obtain the opinion of the Court. [40]2 I should think that that would be very probable. Even you, Mr Speaker, decline to entertain hypothetical cases. Whenever we wish to-obtain your ruling without raising a specific issue, you plainly inform us that you are not called on to decide the point. I suppose that would be the governing principle in any Court of equity or law. The Prime Minister ""goes on to sayThe writ issued must be in such a form as to disclose a cause of action by one party to the suit against the other. If the Government oT New South Wales will institute an action, properly framed, it will then be open to the parties to raise any questions relevant to such an action for the decision of the High Court; these may then be put in the form of a special case, in the settling of which we shall be prepared to offer every facility. this offer is not quite as definite as it might be, and the Premier of New South Wales shares my view. I find in both papers today a paragraph stating be a correct summary since the two newspaper reports are, I believe, in entire ruthers' reply is that he regrets that Mr Deakin's offer is not an agreement to submit a case, and he goes on to describe the proposal as "" a gross attempt to evade the question.""

I take it that when the Prime Minister penned this letter to the Premier of New South Wales, he intended to treat the matter in the fairest possible way. I take it that the Prime Minister did practically agree to have the matter submitted to the High Court. the question narrows itself to one of finding a cause of action.

One is that the Federal Government should, under arrangement with the Premier of New South Wales, peg out some area on the site which has been selected. But there is one thing' the Government is entitled to do even before taking that step. Having asked the Governmentof New South Wales to give the land, which we have determined shall be the site-of the Capital, and there being a difference of opinion, I submit that the wish and will of New South Wales, as expressed in the communications of the Government of that State, should be placed before this Chamber for review. If the Government desires to settle the matter amicablv, and to preserve cordial relations with New South Wales, we ought to review the matter in the light of the opinion expressed by the Parliament of that State. -One party cannot act without the other, -unless we suppose an impasse has been reached, which cannot be got over without the exercise of the supreme powers of the -Commonwealth Government and Parliament in a way, we hope will never be reported to. In""the first place, this Parliament ought to review the whole question in the light of the facts submitted by the Parliament of New South Wales; then if the Prime Minister thinks fit to take the other course suggested by the Premier of New South Wales, he himself ought to make the cause of action and thus facilitate ,a settlehorsemanship, and they are just the stuff ment by the High Court as speedily as possible. The longer this matter is allowed to remain unsettled the more disturbed will be the relations between New South Wales and the Commonwealth. The Constitution makes it very clear that that State has some rights in reference to the Federal Capital, and five vears is a sufficiently long period to wait for the settlement. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister in his reply will make it clear that he, at any rate, is anxious to have this matter settled with the least possible delay, and with a desire to facilitate the good feeling between the Commonwealth and the State. little to say on the subject of the Federal Capital Site. tions from Victorian representatives as to Melbourne being the best place for the Capital of the Commonwealth, but my impression is that Sydney is far and away the most suitable for the purpose. In my opinion, the trouble really arises from the fact that there are more Victorian representatives in this House than that State has any right to. Apparently the line of demarcation between Victoria, and New South Wales has been drawn in the wrong place; and honourable members for Riverina, Hume, and Eden-Monaro are representatives more of Victoria than of the neighbouring State. The interests of those districts are distinctly Victorian, as is shown by the fact that their trade goes to Melbourne ; and the representatives I have mentioned really represent the interests of the southern State. I do not accuse those honourable members of improper conduct, but merely say that owing to the geographical position of their constituencies, New South Wales is not able to make her voice heard with, due weight. I hope that some day this defect will be remedied. There are seventy-five members of this House, and any oneentering the Chamber at this mo-. ment might be under the impression they had all gone home. I desire to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] I should like to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to a matter of some importance. In my electorate there is a district which was settled by the original pioneers of the country, who have left behind them a race of what are practically yeoman farmers. These farmers are accustomed to open-air life, and to of which the best of soldiers are made. Many of them went to South Africa to serve in the war, and it is on their behalf that I make an appeal for justice. Lord Roberts, in the light of his experience in South Africa, has said that a great deal depends on the marksmanship of the troops -that marksmanship, combined with discipline, is what is most necessary. Ever since I entered this Parliament, I have been endeavouring to obtain for the citizen soldiers of this district a rifle range, but, though Ministers have come and gone, no rifle range appears. I hoped I had succeeded during the reign of the last Ministry, but just when I thought the matter was almost finally settled, it was discovered that, while I had been agitating, the portion of There have been interjecland, which is desired for a rifle range, had, through some fault in connection with the State Government, been alienated to a private person, who had built a house and erected a fence. I am now told that this person is perfectly willing, if properly com-",48,William Lyne The Honourable

I have repeatedly applied to Ministers in connection with this matter, and I believe the first to take it up was the Minister of Defence in the Watson Government; and I now appeal to the present Government. July of this year, was written by the Under-Secretary of Lands in New South Wales to the Secretary of a Civilian Rifle Club at Singleton: Referring to the copy of the letter forwarded by you from Mr John Smith, of Singleton, respecting the proposed exchange of his homestead selection (portions No. 169 and 170) for portions 174 and 175, parish of Darlington, county of Durham, in connection with the extension of the Combo rifle range, Singleton, I have the honour to inform you that a copy of the communication referred to has been forwarded to the Commonwealth Government, who have the matter in hand. That is as far as we have been able to get after all those weary eighteen months of waiting. The last Government placed a sum of money on the Estimates for this purpose, and I am very much afraid that, seeing the money was not expended, similar provision may not appear on the next Estimates. bourhood has been in existence for many years, but it is now languishing and disappearing for want of the facilities for which I ask. The members of the rifle club have their homes there, but it is unreasonable to ask these men, after working all the ' week, to tramp three miles to the present rifle range, and three miles back to their homes, on the Saturday afternoon. piece of land which is desired is quite close to the town, and military officers have reported that it is in every way suited for a rifle range. I have received another letter from the secretary of a Civilian Rifle Club, asking me to urge on the military authorities in Melbourne the necessity for having this matter settled at once. There is another matter to which I desire to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General. In my district there is practically a new town called Kurri Kurri, which is the centre of a very large coal-field. The value of this district is, I am afraid, appreciated neither by the Postmaster-General nor his officers, although it is an enormous coal-field, which will in time be one of the finest in the world, with a seam of coal 30 feet thick. Less than eighteen months ago the place was a desert, whereas to-day there is a population of 2,000 people, and magnificent buildings are springing up on the land, which was, not long ago, virgin forest, and was sold by the Government for ,£35,000 in one day. Notwithstanding its importance, the only post-office of which the district can boast is a small verandah boarded in ; and in this the whole postal business of the population has to be carried on. If Kurri The following letter, dated n t h K u r r i were anywhere near Melbourne, S have no doubt that long ago proper postal facilities would have been provided, but, unfortunately, the place is in New South Wales, which, as I say, is not properly represented in this House. I believe a site has been chosen for a post-office, and to show the dilatory manner hi which tlie affairs of the Department are administered, I may mention that about four months ago the request was made that a letter-box might be hung on the fence of a railway station belonging^ to a private line; but, although every provision was made for the fixing of the box, it was weeks before the Department would do anything in the matter. I hope that the Post r master-General will see that this district receives the attention which it deserves. dent of the Executive Council) -With reThe military force in this neighgard to the matter brought under notice by the honourable and learned member for Wannon, the Minister of Defence informs me that he is dealing with it, and will endeavour to give the honourable and learned member an answer as soon as possible. The. honourable member for Hunter himself made it clear that there are complications surrounding the case which he mentioned, The which make it impossible to deal with it offhand, but I understand that a settlement of the questions at issue is likely. I will endeavour to obtain a reply for the honourable member to-morrow. the Vice-President of the Executive Council has availed himself of his opportunity to speak before I could put before him another complaint relating to defence matters. The other day we were informed by him that it was not 'in the public interest that this House should be told the exact position of the Commonwealth in regard to coastal defence. The Minister seemed to forget that the House is the responsible body which votes the supplies by means of which the affairs of the country are administered, and while the responsible Minister may be fully seized of the necessity for increasing our expenditure on defence preparations, he cannot expect us to do what is requisite in that direction, unless",49,William Lyne The Honourable

As have now to complain that the Department has recently decided that letterboxes shall no longer be placed on the tram cars running on the Little Bay line. Surely those who devote themselves to the noble work of hospital duty-and there are, in addition to patients, no fewer than 100 adults occupied at the Little Bay Hospital in attending to the sick and convalescentdeserve consideration, and the Department should stretch every point to improve their postal service. the alteration of which I complain is that it is not feasible to fasten, letter-boxes to the electric tram cars. to fasten them to the cars drawn by steam locomotives, it seems extraordinary that it should be impossible to fasten them to the electric tram cars, and if the Postmaster General will give me permission to do so, I will see that it can be done, in which case I do not know how the Department, can further refuse to continue the postal facilities which those at the hospital, and along the tram route, have hitherto enjoyed. I was not in the House when the deputy leader of the Opposition referred to the correspondence now taking place with regard to It is the Federal Capital Site between the Premier of New South Wales and the Prime Minister,, but I hope that the latter will do all that lies within his power to allay the justifiable bitterness existing in New South Wales, because of the non-settlement of this matter. We know that the people of that State made it a sine qua non of their joining the Federation that the Federal Capital should be within their borders, and the other States unanimously agreed to their demands. cause every State of Australasia joined the I know the position of union, and is represented in this Parliament.

The people of New South WalesI desire would not have asked that the Capital should be within their borders unless they had thought that it would be a valuable concession. Through their representatives in this Chamber, they offered a site, Lyndhurst, which would have been not only most acceptable to them, but the cheapest to the Commonwealth. That site was not chosen, and the citizens of the State feel if that were not sufficient, I that by the selection of Dalgety the final settlement of the question has been indefinitely delayed, because they think that this Parliament will refuse to remove the Seat of Government to Dalgety until Victoria bas consented to extend the railway from Bairnsdale to Dalgety, which she will not do. The Prime Minister will therefore see that there is some justification for the bitter feeling of which I have spoken, and I hope that he will do all he can to allay it by stating a question for the decision of the The explanation given for High Court by which the right constitutional procedure may be determined and the claims of New South Wales satisfied. occasion for the ventilation of grievances, a member of a party which has its f u l l share of them has a right to avail himself of it.

So far as the interests of New South Wales are concerned, his electorate might as well be in Fiji. There was a period in our history when he stood up manfully for his own State, and succeeded in securing the selection of what he considered to be the best site for the Federal Capital. I do not wish to throw the apple of discord into the Ministerial camp, but in connection with the selection of the Federal Capital the Postmaster-General proved himself to be much smarter than his colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not for one moment say that he succeeded in outwitting the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is acknowledged to be the arch-political manceuvrer of this House. Possibly the Minister of Trade and Customs consoles himself with the reflection that, although his colleague gained a victory over the selection of the site, he has not succeeded in securing a settlement of the question. The site has been selected, but the Capital is not there. I ask on behalf of the people of New South Wales that this question shall be dealt with at once. We are now placed in such a position that New South Wales, in order to obtain her just rights, bas to sue upon her knees to the Prime Minister in order to have a friendlv suit brought before theHigh Court.

I can imagine how the Age would have denounced the Federal Parliament, and recommended all those over whom it had control to block public business until the question had been dealt with. I believe that the Opposition would be fully justified in taking the fullest advantage of the Standing Orders to obstruct public business until the House consented to recognise the claims of New South Wales to a speedy settlement of the Federal Capital question. It is no exaggeration to say that if any public man of reputation were to commence an agitation in New South Wales for the secession of that State from the Union, on the ground that faith had not been kept with it in regard to the establishment of the Federal Capital, he would be supported by a' large majority of the people. not sincere. thing affecting the price of potatoes were brought under notice, the honourable and learned member would howl until he was blue in the face, but he feels no interest whatever in the affairs of the mother State, which is entitled to considerate treatment at the hands of the House. I do not believe for a moment that the general body of electors of Victoria are opposed to the settlement of this question, but that the whole of the obstacles in the way of the settlement are the result of political and journalistic opposition. The public of New South Wales do not, for one moment, suppose that their existence as a State or their prosperity as a people depends upon the establishment of the Capital within their midst; but'they think they have every right to complain that five years have been allowed to elapse without anything definite having been accomplished in the direction of giving effect to ""this section of the Constitution. They regard their position as a most humiliating one, when their Premier has to become a suppliant to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and on his bended knees ask that a moral compact should be put to the legal test. Then there is the question cf the redistribution of seats, upon which public feeling in New South Wales is very excited. The public there know that an If the Capital Electoral Act has been passed', and that a scheme, for the proper representation of their State was defeated in the last Parliament. They are now looking forward with expectation to the adoption of some other scheme which will do them justice. While the basis of the Federal franchise is equality, New South Wales is being denied her full share of representation. Victoria has now more than her proper share, and apparently honourable members who represent that .State desire that the present inequitable conditions shall be continued. It is very strange that the Government, which is prepared to accept the returns of the States' Statisticians in ordinary matters, should decide that only a Commonwealth Statistician can furnish them with a proper basis for fixing the representation to which the various States are entitled.

I am certain that if I had the knowledge which enabled the honourable gentleman to break up the late Ministry, I should soon secure a settlement of this question. When the honourable member for Parramatta was one of the rank and file, he was most vigorous in his condemnation of the delinquencies of the Ministry, but I am afraid that his responsibilities as deputy leader are making him altogether too respectable and moderate. I expect a man of his vigour and force to impart a little of his old-time fire into the debates, and to join with me-thi s is straight-out talking-in obstructing the progress of business until the requirements of New South Wales in the matter of the Federal Capital end the redistribution of seats have been attended to. ticular State than are the representatives I am told that the honourable member for Parramatta has dealt with the question of the Capital Site in an able manner, and I trust that the Prime Minister, in his reply, will show that our efforts to-night have not been in vain. If New South Wales wishes the question to be settled by the High Court, I trust that the Prime Minister will give every facility to the launching of a friendly suit. The time has passed when we might have hestitated to speak plainly with regard to the Federal Capital Site, lest we might be classed as provincialists.

I do not wish to beat about the bush, and I say unhesitatingly that the way in which the Capital Site question has been treated in the Federal Parliament is nothing more nor less than a piece of sharp practice on the part of Victorian pointers.

If there be any such impression it may be at once put aside. While I do not expect this or any Ministry, or this Parliament, honourable members on this side of the Chamto do what is unreasonable, if there were indications that delay was intended, it would become evident, first, by reason of the actions of the representatives of New South Wales, and, secondly, by the expressions of opinion given in various ways by the people of that State, that the question could not be postponed. But I do not think that we can yet accuse the present Ministry of delay in this matter. A t the same time. I would join with the honourable member for Parramatta in impressing upon the Prime Minister the need for obtaining an agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth and that of New South Wales to some method of settlement. I have perused the letters which the Prime Minister has sent to the Premier of the State, and the only difference between the two parties seems to be as to the method of bringing the questions in dispute before the High Court. As both gentlemen are learned in the law trouble.

They supported Lyndhurst until it was struck out of the list, and they then expressed their second preferences for one or other of the sites which were left.

He strangled the discussion of that question without regard to the interests of New South Wales, in order to secure a vote which would put him into power. As a representative of that State.

In the correspondence hold, whether erroneously or not, a clear in which we are at present engaged with opinion of my own that it is not possible the Premier of New South Wales, we are to refer matters for extra judicial opinion following exactly the same course that was to the High Court.

I assured him that we should offer every facility for the statement of that special case. That was going as far as we ought to go. The case may assume more forms than one, and there are some delicate points involved in the questions of form and procedure. Upon those points I did not desire to suggest to the Premier of New South Wales the course he should follow, but left him to select the one he thought preferable in his interests. out qualification, that whatever he suggests in this way we shall be able to accept. I will not commit the Government absolutely, because it is possible that owing to the limited range of my vision I do not see some incomplete form of action that may be suggested, but I can scarcely conceive of any form in which he could bring his action that would preclude us from cooperating with him. I am willing to cooperate, and am leaving him the choice of means in order that he may be the better satisfied. What was intended to be conveyed, and was conveyed, is that in obtaining the determination of the High Court in that; way we shall, meet"" him freely.

I do not think we could act more frankly, and, personally, although there are some reasons why one does not desire to see a judicial tribunal like the High Court introduced into disputes which have a local or political bearing, my confidence in the High Court is so great, and the cause of difference between us so important, that I am perfectly willing to submit I expressed the case to that tribunal in preference to any other open to us. In view of this statement, I need scarcely enter more fully into the question of sites and the attitude taken up by New South Wales, because it appears to be clear that, even if we were agreed upon the situation of the Capital, certain questions as to area, possibly of access and other matters, would still have to be determined. These, at all events, require to be decided legally as the Premier of New South Wales proposes, so that we shall lose nothing by securing their settlement. legally do anything further to meet the I think we may say, withwishes of New South Wales? pared to do all that is reasonably possible. In my last letter to the Premier of New South Wales, I quoted the opinion of two eminent counsel Sir Julian Salomons, KC., and Mr C. B. Stephen-obtaine d by the Government of New South Wales, which went distinctly to show that the course that has been followed by this Parliament was not only constitutionally correct, but would probably provide the best and most convenient means of bringing the question at issue to a decisive point. Supported by that authority, as well as by the legal adVice on which we originally acted, we have every reason to suppose that the steps we have taken up to date are, after all, most calculated to bring us to a speedy the settlement. We have never yet taken a step involving delay that was not forced upon us by extraneous circumstances. The same may be said of every preceding FederalI t should not be Government.

As honourable members know, it was not passed through the various committees of the Convention, nor sifted and criticised as most sections of the Constitution were. Compared with the proceedings of the Convention, it was hurriedly drawn up at a small Conference of Premiers, to settle the immediate clashing of interests that was before them. It was framed in a way which leaves a number of ambiguities. Having, when Attorney-General, carefully considered that section, I have arrived at a distinct opinion as to its meaning as a whole, and in each of its parts, but am not self-confident enough to assume that my opinion is necessarily right. I think it is, but one must not speak too positively of so difficult and complicated a section. Setting aside the necessary postponements to allow of the examination of suggested sites, almost the whole of the delay that has arisen since has been occasioned by the manner in which that section was framed. I am not reflecting on the draftsmen, having pointed out the special circumstances under which they accomplished their work, but the language they adopted has been responsible for almost the whole of the delay that has taken place, and will be the -ause of the delay involved, in stating a special case after action has been brought for the High Court. If the Convention had been in existence at the time it would have been able to thresh out the provision, and to state its intention in clearer and more preing a number of particulars as to the class cise language.

Since that question was asked I have received a letter from Mr Jeffries, vice-president of the Monumental Masons' Union, in which he takes exception to the statement by the honourable member for Lang, that it was an instance of union tyranny. After givof work which the employee performed, he states that the (reference to the Arbitration Court was not made on the representations of the union alone.

I would remind the honourable member for Bland that when drawing the attention of the Prime Minister to the case, I specifically asked him if he had seen the report appearing in that morning's issue of the Argus. A t that time an opinion could be formed only upon the report appearing in the press, and I had a right to assume-s of a r as one can assume that any statement made in the local press is correct-that it was true. It was with a view of preventing anything of the kind occurring under the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bil l that I called the Prime Minister's attention to the case.
