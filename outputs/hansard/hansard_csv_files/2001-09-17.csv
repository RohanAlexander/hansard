54,Mr Speaker (7.30 P.m.),"Friends, I related purposes.The following answers to questions were circulated: Transport and Regional Services Portfolio: Procurement Policies (Question No. 2384) Mr Sidebottom asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Is the Minister’s Department, or are agencies within the portfolio, large purchasers or consumers of office paper. (2) How are Commonwealth procurement guidelines being adhered to by the Minister’s Department and agencies within the portfolio. (3) What methodology or weighting criteria does the Minister's Department and agencies use to determine the importance of the core principles which underpin the procurement guidelines, namely (a) value for money, (b) open and effective competition, (c) ethics and fair dealing, (d) accountability and reporting, (e) national competitiveness and industry development and (f) support for other Commonwealth policies. (4) What weighting criteria are used to implement the mandatory provisions in the guidelines which state that agencies must be able to demonstrate that Australia New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers have had a fair opportunity to compete. (5) In inviting suppliers to tender for the provision of goods, are suppliers advised that they must offer ANZ goods. (6) If the Minister’s Department or agencies within the portfolio do not have weighting criteria for determining the principles, will the Minister take steps to ensure that they provide an appropriate means to demonstrate their compliance with Commonwealth procurement policy. I am advised by my department as follows: (1) Taken collectively, the Department and portfolio agencies are low to moderate consumers of paper. (2) Within the transport and regional services portfolio, only the Department and the National Capital Authority (“the NCA”) are required (under Regulation 8 of the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997) to have regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. Nonetheless, other major portfolio agencies, such as Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have drawn upon the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines in the establishment of their own procurement manuals. Both the Department’s Chief Executive Instructions and the NCA’s Financial Management and Administration Manual require officers to observe the requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. The Department is establishing a central contract advisory unit to oversee major procurement activity and to ensure the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines are followed. The NCA has an administrative Tender Board which reviews, advises on and approves all tender recommendations for contracts in excess of $50,000. (3) The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines treat the core principles equally. Neither the Department nor the NCA weight the core principles, but do use weighting systems, dependant upon the circumstances of each procurement activity, that achieve outcomes that are consistent with the core principles. The primary focus is on achieving value for money, consistent with the other core principles. (4) See answer to question 3. It should be noted that procurement by the Department and the NCA is generally sourced from within Australia and New Zealand. (5) In the case of the Department, not normally, but in appropriate procurement activities such a course of action would be taken. In the case of the NCA, no. (6) Both the Department and the NCA currently have regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, which do not require weightings.",64,ANZUS Treaty Australia Has Shown Once Were Young They Were Old They Were Chris
55,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Second Sydney Airport: Location (Question No. 2414) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2046 (Hansard, 27 February 2001, page 21302), during the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ second reading speech in the House of Representatives on the Airports Bill 1996 was it stated that (a) no sales Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) should occur until all environmental impact statements processes were completed and the future of Sydney West Airport resolved, (b) the Government was determined not to sell Sydney Mascot and Sydney West Airport until such time as the environmental impact studies have been satisfactorily completed and decisions made in relation to that and (c) the Government would not be putting on the market Sydney Mascot and Sydney West Airports until such time as the election commitment made by the former shadow Minister for Aviation, Senator Parer and reiterated by the Prime Minister was fulfilled. (2) Is the primary purpose of the Airports Act, in light of the then Minister for Transport's second reading speech, not to sell KSA until the future of Sydney West Airport is resolved. (3) Following, and as a result of the environmental impact assessment conducted for Badgery’s Creek and Holsworthy sites, does Sydney West Airport mean the Badgery’s Creek proposal. (4) When will Sydney West Airport at Badgery’s Creek be built. (5) In respect to part (1) of his answer to question 2046, does the 13 December 2000 announcement mean that, for the purposes of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act (a) the proposal of Sydney West Airport located at Badgery’s Creek is thereby withdrawn by the proponent, (b) the proposal has been officially withdrawn by the proponent, (c) the withdrawal has been officially issued in writing by the proponent to the Minister for the Environment in the prescribed manner, (d) the withdrawal, in light of his announcement made on 13 December 2000, means that there is currently no proposal for Sydney West Airport before the Minister for the Environment. (1) (a), (b) and (c) The Second Reading Speech by the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development on the Airports Bill 1996 reiterated the Government’s election commitments relating to the issue of aircraft noise in Sydney, including that: Sydney and Sydney West would be withdrawn from the airport leasing process until there was a solution to the aircraft noise issues there; the east west runway was reopened; and a full EIS was undertaken on Sydney West Airport (2) The Airports Act contains no provisions in relation to the timing for the sale of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. (3) The Government announced that it will retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek site and will legislate to protect the site from incompatible development in surrounding areas. (4) In December 2000, the Government announced that it would be premature to build a second major airport in Sydney, and that it would further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. (5) (a), (b), (c) and (d) The Government’s position on the Second Sydney Airport Proposal at Badgerys Creek was made clear in its announcement of 13 December 2000 on Sydney’s future airport needs. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2415) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a media article on 27 February 2001 in the Australian Financial Review by Mr Steve Lewis titled “Airport sale may have to wait for poll”. (2) Will he furnish a copy of the terms of reference to Salomon Smith Barney in respect to the proposed sale of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA). (3) Will he furnish a copy of the scoping study prepared by Salomon Smith Barney in respect to the proposed sale of KSA. (4) How is a proposed sale of 25% of KSA consistent with section 18 of the Airports Act.",65,Questions On Notice
56,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) How can a partial sale or lease of KSA be part leased in light of the provisions of sections 11 to 22 inclusive of the Act. (6) Is the paramount consideration on a decision for the construction of Sydney West Airport the ability to cope with increasing aircraft traffic until the end of the decade, in light of his statement of 13 December 2000. (7) Is the capacity of Sydney Airport consistent with the aims expressed in the second reading speech of the Airports Bill 1996 in which the then Minister for Transport indicated that solving Sydney’s aircraft noise problem was the paramount consideration prior to sale of KSA. (8) Have terms of reference for Bankstown, Hoxton Park and Camden Airports also been issued; if so, to whom. (9) Are there overseas airport operators interested in the purchase of KSA; if so, who. (1) (2) and (3) In relation to the matters raised in the article, the Sydney Airports Scoping Study and its terms of reference are confidential as they contain commercially sensitive material, the release of which could damage the Commonwealth’s interests. (4) and (5) Following its consideration of the scoping study report into the sale of Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (SACL), the Commonwealth Government has decided to sell Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) by a 100% trade sale to be completed in the second half of this year. (6) The Government announced in December 2000 that it had concluded that it would be premature to build a second major airport for Sydney. It would be under-utilised for many years. The Government will further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. (7) The Government has addressed the aircraft noise issue by providing for a substantially more equitable sharing of noise compared with the arrangements in place prior to March 1996. (8) On 29 March 2001 the Government announced that following consideration of the scoping study report into the sale of SACL that the other Sydney basin airports at Bankstown, Camden and Hoxton Park will be sold by a 100% trade sale in the second half of 2002. No terms of reference for the sale have been issued. (9) An invitation to Register an Expression of Interest to bid for KSA was advertised in the Australian press on 23 April 2001. Responses to that invitation are confidential. This is a requirement of the rules of the sale process. Age Pension: Pharmaceutical Allowance (Question No. 2537) Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Is the pharmaceutical allowance paid to a couple who are in receipt of an aged pension less than the accumulative value of the allowance as paid to single pensioners. (2) How does the Government justify that calculation when medication is prescribed to individuals rather than to couples. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No, the rate of Pharmaceutical Allowance for Aged Pensioners is $5.80 per fortnight for singles and couples combined. Both singles and couples (families) receive a total of $150.80 Pharmaceutical Allowance a year. (2) Pensioner couples receive the same amount of Pharmaceutical Allowance ($5.80 per fortnight) shared between them as a single pensioner. This is because of the way the Allowance interacts with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) safety net. The PBS has been designed so that the greatest subsidy is given to those with chronic illness or greatest financial need, while ensuring that all consumers’ out of pocket prescription costs are limited by a safety net. The fact that the same safety net applies to single people as well as families, reflects the aim to have a straightforward system.",66,Questions On Notice

58,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Family And Community,,67,Questions On Notice
59,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the folSingle pensioners, pensioner couples and pensioners with children all receive the same amount of Pharmaceutical Allowance and all receive free pharmaceuticals after they reach the same safety net threshold. In pensioner couple families, half the Pharmaceutical Allowance is paid to each member provided that each is a pensioner (or older long term allowee). Generally, for concession cardholders, PBS medicines cost only $3.50 a script. However, once a cardholder or his/her partner or family has purchased a combined total of 52 PBS prescriptions in any calendar year, the rest are free for that year. Job Network: Selection Criteria for Providers (Question No. 2550) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: In relation to the purchasing of Job Network Services, will he explain the formula used for calculating a provider’s “Q” or quality rating number, including the criteria used and the weighting given to each criterion. Tenderers responding to the Job Network Services Request for Tender issued on 11 June 1999 were required to address three selection criteria for each service they tendered to deliver. The selection criteria were: (1) Demonstrated capacity to deliver outcomes for (the particular service) eligible clients in the labour market for which they are tendering; weighted 55% (2) Effective methods to deliver assistance for (the particular service) to the client group in the labour market for which they are tendering; weighted 30%, and (3) Demonstrated capacity to operate in a similar environment to Job Network; weighted 15%. The Department assessed and rated each criterion. A single quality score for each labour market region tendered was calculated by combining the individual scores for each criterion in proportion to the designated weighting. Airservices Australia : Terminal Control Units (Question No. 2560) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) With respect to the feasibility study into the consolidation of Terminal Control Units (TCUs) by Airservices Australia, (a) when will the study into the technical and logistical issues associated with the possible consolidation of TCUs, including a cost and benefit analysis, be completed and (b) will the report be made public: if not why not. (2 When did the study commence on the feasibility of consolidating the remote TCUs at Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and Cairns into the major control centres at Melbourne and Brisbane. (3) As part of the initial feasibility study, was his Department and office involved: if so what was the advice from his Department and office about the consolidation of the Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and Cairns TCUs and if consultation did take place, on what date did it occur and what was the nature of the consultation. (4) When and how did he advise Airservices Australia that the Government did not want to proceed with the consolidation of the Cairns TCU, and what was the basis of the Governments justification in giving this advice. (5) Given the decision to instruct Airservices Australia not to proceed with the consolidation of the Cairns TCU, why hasn’t the Government given Airservices Australia a similar instruction not to proceed with the consolidation of the Sydney, Adelaide and Perth TCUs. (1) (a) The feasibility study was completed in January 2001 and has been placed on the Airservices Australia intranet site with access by Airservices Australia staff. (b) The study is an internal working document and it is therefore not appropriate to publicly release it. It has been provided to all staff and relevant unions. (2) The study commenced in August 2000.",67,Questions On Notice
60,Mr Brough,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,68,Questions On Notice
61,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Neither my Office or my Department was consulted during the initial feasibility study. (4) On 13 February 2001, I advised the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia that the proposal to close the Cairns TCU was inconsistent with the Government’s decision that that there would be no further withdrawals of Commonwealth services from regional Australia. (5) The Sydney, Adelaide and Perth TCUs are not affected by the threshold issue of the Government’s overarching policy on regional Australia. Airservices is continuing to consider a range of issues associated with the possible consolidation of its TCUs. Airservices has advised that safety of operations and consideration of the potential impact on stakeholders will be paramount in this process. It is only after this work has been completed that the matter will be considered further to determine whether the project should progress. Melbourne Airport: Noise (Question No. 2644) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) Is he aware that there has been a substantial increase in flights over residential areas as a result of increased air-traffic at Melbourne Airport. (2) Is he aware that a significant number of these flights are between 11pm and 6am, a period which is under curfew at Sydney and Adelaide Airports. (3) Is he aware that many residents have complained about the increase in aircraft noise, as a result of the additional flights into and out of the airport, especially during the night hours. (4) Is one reason for the increased flights over residential areas the very large increase in the use of the southern route of the north-south runway at Melbourne Airport. (5) Is one reason for the increase the inadequacy of the east-west runway, which has been declared too short for many large aircraft. (6) Would an extension of the east-west runway mean that there would be fewer landings and takeoffs on the north-south runway, and therefore a significantly reduced noise problem for residential areas. (7) In light of the planned and predicted increase in flights into Melbourne Airport over the next few years, will the Government act to deal with this problem by giving a high priority to the extension to the east-west runway at Melbourne Airport so that it can reduce the number of flights over residential areas. (1) Airservices Australia has advised that Melbourne Airport has experienced traffic growth in the last twelve months from some 40000 movements during the first quarter of 2000, to some 45000 movements during the first quarter of 2001. While the Preferred Flight Path arrangements associated with the Melbourne Noise Abatement Procedures have been maintained, this growth has inevitably resulted in an increase in flights over areas of Melbourne. (2) Airservices Australia has advised that night activity numbers for Melbourne Airport between the hours of 11pm and 6am were 3949 for the first quarter of 2000 and 3865 for the first quarter of 2001. Melbourne Airport was designed to operate on a 24 hour basis. There are land use management arrangements in place around the Airport; noise abatement procedures which aim to minimise aircraft noise impacts and there is a consultative committee which provides a forum for a range of stakeholders. (3) Airservices Australia has advised that comparative quarterly complaint figures to the Melbourne Noise Enquiry Unit on Melbourne Airport activity shows 29 enquiries in the first quarter of 2000, and 26 in the first quarter of 2001. (4) Airservices Australia has advised that the answer to the question is no. Runway usage is subject to prevailing weather conditions and aircraft operational requirements. Both impact upon the use of preferred runways as defined in the Melbourne Airport Noise Abatement Procedures.",68,Questions On Notice
62,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Comparative quarterly runway usage statistics for arrivals on Runway 34 (from the south) and departures on Runway 16 (to the south), expressed as a percentage of total movements, were as follows for the first quarter of 2000, and for the first quarter of 2001: 1st qtr 2000 1st qtr 2001 Arr 34 22.8% Arr 34 22.9% Dep 16 19.1% Dep 16 21.6% (5) Airservices Australia’s advice is that the prevailing wind essentially determines runway direction but some heavy long-haul aircraft have an operational requirement to use the north/south runway. (6) Airservices Australia has advised that a longer east/west runway could increase its utilisation by departing heavy long-haul aircraft. (7) A decision to build extensions to runways or construction of new runways is a matter for the private operators of the airport. Any such proposal would, of course, be subject to the requirements of the Airports Act 1996. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Corporate Governance (Question No. 2646) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 June 2001: (1) What guidelines were established for the interaction of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Board and management following the briefing from Professor McNamara of Bond University on the respective roles of the Board and the Chief Executive of public sector companies and authorities and the interaction between the two. (2) Was his office or Department consulted in the finalisation of these guidelines; if so, (a) to what extent and (b) did he approve them. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice: (1) and (2) The question appears to relate to a corporate governance seminar specifically organised for Board members and held at Bond University on 16 April 1999, which covered a variety of issues including the interaction between the Board and the Chief Executive. Professor McNamara of Bond University acted as a presenter/facilitator and arranged the seminar, but other presenters/facilitators were also involved. The principal documentation resulting from the seminar was a comprehensive Board Manual, which specifies the role and responsibilities of the Board, and supports the Board’s commitment to best practice in Corporate Governance. Other developments resulting from the seminar included a fully revised Charter for the Board Audit Committee and development of a set of Board Expenditure guidelines. As such these are matters that quite properly lie within the Corporate Governance responsibilities of the CASA Board under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and CASA’s Corporate Plan.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Risk Analysis (Question No. 2663) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his response to question No. 2311 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 25772), is the risk of being killed in an aircraft crash in the order of 4.5 chances per million per year for fare paying passengers as testified by Professor Jean Cross on 22 September 1995 to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. (2) Since March 1996, how many times has he publicly stated concern for the safety of fare paying airline passengers. (3) Did Professor Cross testify to the 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney that aircraft crash risk for some residents in 2010 was forecast by Kinhills in the Third Runway EIS to be around 100 in one million, or more than 20 times higher than the risk for fare paying passengers, and twice as high as he advised in his response to question No. 2311. (4) What is the most recent aircraft crash risk analysis for Sydney Airport for the year 2010 and on what number of aircraft movements and mix of aircraft types is that aircraft crash risk analysis based. (5) Has a risk analysis been undertaken to assess the aircraft crash risk to residents on the ground associated with aircraft movements at Sydney Airport in excess of 353 900 movements per annum. (6) Has a risk analysis been undertaken to assess the aircraft crash risk to residents on the ground for risk associated with changing the aircraft mixes at Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport. (7) How many times since March 1996 has he publicly stated concern for the safety of residents living under the flight paths of Sydney Airports parallel runways. (8) Is (a) the risk of aircraft crash for residents living close to the airport not separate from, but in addition to, the risk of being killed in a road accident and (b) road traffic congestion associated with Sydney Airport and Port Botany disproportionately heavy in Sydneys inner western suburbs. (9) Will the risk of aircraft crash for residents rise with small aircraft being moved out of Sydney Airport, and aircraft traffic increasing over time up to the maximum operational capacity of the two existing parallel runways; if so, by how much. (10) What risk assessment studies have been undertaken to assess whether the introduction of small jets at Bankstown Airport would compromise the operational safety over residential areas around Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport; if so, (a) what are the names of those studies and (b) will he table these studies in the House. (11) Have any military aircraft joy rides been proposed to operate out of Bankstown Airport; if so, will he provide details in the House; if so, when.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2671) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his response to part (1) of question 2309 (Hansard, 24 May 2001, page 26023), has the Sydney Airport Noise Insulation Project complied in full with the Australian Standard for Aircraft Noise AS2021, and has the projected increase in airport capacity been reflected in a review of noise contours and hence those eligible for the noise insulation project. (2) Will he provide a capacity forecast specifically for Sydney Airport in 2010, taking into account the implications of the removal of small aircraft from Sydney Airport. (1) The issue of compliance with Australian Standard AS2021-2000 is addressed in my reply to other parts of question 2309 (Hansard, 24 May 2001, page 26023). The boundaries for eligibility for insulation under the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program were reviewed in May 1997 to reflect anticipated noise exposure for the airport based on the Australian Noise Exposure Concepts associated with the Long Term Operating Plan. Since that time boundaries have been reviewed on the basis of noise exposure reflected in annual Australian Noise Exposure Index maps for the Airport. (2) The Government has guaranteed regional access to Sydney Airport through arrangements under the Slot Management Scheme and I am not prepared to provide a forecast based on a hypothetical example. See also my answer to part (a) of the honourable member’s Question No. 2493. Great Barrier Reef: Commercial Coral Collection (Question No. 2676) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Is the Coral Fishery on the Great Barrier Reef to be closed; if so, what (a) consultation has been undertaken with interested parties and (b) impact will the closure of the Coral Fishery have on jobs in that industry. (2) Is the impact of the aquarium trade on the Great Barrier Reef minimal. (3) What is the impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef from cyclones, soil run-off, freighters and tourists. (4) Do marine aquarium hobbyists contribute significantly to the viability of the Great Barrier Reef. (5) Is a significant level of research and education undertaken by marine aquarium hobbyists. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. The commercial collection of coral on the Great Barrier Reef is to be phased out. (a) The determination that commercial coral collection is an ‘inappropriate activity in the World Heritage Area’, was discussed on 8-9 March 2001 at the Management Advisory Committee that Queensland established to provide advice on its “Harvest Fisheries”. There are two commercial coral collector representatives on this Management Advisory Committee, both were present at the March meeting. The matter was also discussed at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Fisheries Reef Advisory Committee on 29-30 March 2001. A commercial coral collector is a member of this advisory committee. (b) There are 36 collectors with licences/permits to harvest coral in Queensland. These collectors employ people to assist in collection and in managing the husbandry of the live collected coral prior to its despatch to market destinations within Australia.",73,Questions On Notice
68,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,74,Questions On Notice
69,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anI have asked for advice on how to phase out the commercial collection of coral in a sensitive manner and over a reasonable period of time so as to minimise any adverse economic impacts. (2) The commercial extraction of coral by hammer and chisel is not consistent with the environmental values for which the Great Barrier Reef is listed under the World Heritage Convention. (3) The physical impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef from cyclones, soil run-off, freighters and tourists are as follows: Cyclones Cyclones can cause significant disturbances to the marine environment through physical wave action on reefs and shallow systems and fringing mangroves. Significant cyclonic impacts are generally site specific. If the system is healthy, recovery is usually relatively rapid. Sediment and nutrients and pesticides Fifteen years of research has shown that water quality in the near shore regions of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) is declining due to polluted runoff from the Great Barrier Reef Catchment (GBR Catchment). This pollution results in declines in coral growth, survival and recruitment and can impact on the health of seagrasses. Pesticides (eg. diuron) have also been found in sediments at levels that can be detrimental to seagrasses. Blubber samples from 29 dugongs carcasses stranded along Queensland coast revealed organochlorine residues in 21 of the dugongs. These findings are of concern given the implications of these compounds to immunological and reproductive abnormalities and failure. Octachlorinated dioxin concentrations were also found to be highly concentrated in dugong fat tissue compared with marine mammals elsewhere. Shipping Shipping operations present two forms of risk to the GBRWHA. These are: Pollution derived from normal ship operations; The normal operation of a ship leads to number of different waste products that can impact upon the marine environment. These wastes include oil, chemicals, sewage, garbage, toxic compounds released from anti-fouling paints (such as TBT) and ballast water. There is potential for exotic marine pests to be translocated in ballast water or through hull fouling. In general terms the impacts tend to be greatest in areas where shipping is concentrated at offshore anchorages and around berths in ports, although discharges of oil and garbage have the potential to cause impacts some distance from the point of discharge. Pollution and environmental damage as a result of shipping accidents. The poor navigation, operation or maintenance of ships can lead to grounding, collision, and mechanical or structural failure of a vessel. These forms of maritime accidents can lead to direct damage to coral reef structure and the spilling of fuel and /or cargo. The impacts resulting from these events tend to be acute and may be long lasting depending upon the type of pollutant. Between 1985 and 2001 there have been 20 groundings in the Great Barrier Reef. Damage assessments were conducted on four of these incidents and all had substantial reefal damage in the area of impact. At least two of these groundings were not on coral reefs. Tourism Marine tourism has expanded significantly in the last twenty years with improvements in transport and technology. Tourism in the GBR is primarily located in the Cairns and Witsunday Areas, which account for 90% of visitation to the Reef. Tourism impacts tends to be site specific associated with direct coral damage from infrastructure and visitor activities. Evidence from the impacts from tourism varies between sites. At many sites these impacts are minor and recovery is swift. Where tourism has contributed to significant localised coral damage at popular anchorages in the Whitsundays, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority/Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has instigated a system of public moorings and no anchoring areas to minimise anchor related damage. (4) No. (5) No. Roads: Funding (Question No. 2683) Mr Price asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) What is the definition of Roads of National Significance. (2) What criteria are used to chose between different projects involving Roads of National Significance. (1) and (2) The Government funds a program of Roads of National Importance. The guidelines for the program indicate that Roads of National Importance will promote regional and national development by: (a) encouraging inter-regional and international trade in goods and services; (b) improving national competitiveness by maximising transport efficiency and reliability; and (c) allowing for quick adjustments to the pattern and nature of trade in response to emerging national and international opportunities. In choosing between projects the Government considers the merits of the particular project, the level of funding available and the needs of the communities affected. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (Question No. 2703) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: Further to the answer to question No. 1143 (Hansard, 9 May 2000, page 16097) regarding licensed aircraft maintenance engineers, (a) what is the current extent of the shortage of licensed aircraft maintenance engineers, (b) what is the status of any measures taken or in train to redress this shortage and (c) are there any plans to facilitate importing licensed aircraft maintenance engineers, including making it easier to have overseas qualifications recognised in Australia; if so, (i) what is the detail of this proposal and (ii) when will it be issued for public discussion? (a) There is a recognised shortage of licensed aircraft maintenance engineers (LAMEs) in Australia, including regional areas, and also overseas. In Australia there are currently approximately 5800 LAMEs compared to 4500 in 1990. The increase has not kept up with the increase in activity in the aviation industry. In fact the ratio between the LAME and the aircraft fleet changed from 2:1 in 1970 to 1:2 in 1990, and this trend has continued since 1990. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) prepares skill shortage assessments of most, albeit not all, trade occupations on an annual basis. Aircraft maintenance engineers were not included in the year 2000 assessments, but have been included in the 2001 program. Information on the current status of shortages for LAMEs is not available, but (b) Considerable work has already been done to restructure the training framework for LAMEs and other aviation maintenance personnel to align it with the Vocational Education and Training National Competency Based Framework. The Australian National Training Authority (ANTA), the Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services Industry Training Advisory Body (MERSITAB), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and the aviation industry have undertaken a major overhaul and modernisation of the training syllabus for aeroskills, ie. aviation maintenance skills. The new structure will provide progressive Certificate and Diploma status for aviation maintenance personnel. At the same time CASA, in close consultation with the aviation industry, is drafting new Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASRs) covering requirements for issuing maintenance personnel licences (CASR Part 66) and requirements for maintenance training organisations (CASR Part 147). The new training structure will align with the CASR requirements. The new CASRs will harmonise with international standards and practices, including the US Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) and the European Joint Aviation Requirements (JARs).",74,Questions On Notice

71,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Under the National Industry Skills Initiative announced by Dr David Kemp, Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in late 1999, an Engineering Skills Task Force was established. A sub-committee of the Task Force is developing an Action Plan to provide strategies to address the shortage of LAMEs and other aviation maintenance personnel, including ways to address skill shortages. The Federal Government will also be spending $4.1 million over four years to expand aircraft engineer training in regional Australia by supporting the development of a new aircraft engineering college at Tamworth Airport, called the Australasian-Pacific Aeronautical College. (c) The current Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs) provide for the recognition of equivalent licences issued by a competent foreign authority. This provision will continue under the new CASRs. The new regulations will be circulated under a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in October 2001. Following acceptance of the proposal, the regulation should be in place by 2002. Also see (b). Where possible, Trades Recognition Australia (TRA) has assisted in the quick turnaround of applications for the assessment of aircraft maintenance engineers for migration purposes.

(2) The advertisement appeared in the Bendigo Advertiser on Wednesday 6 June, Saturday9 June, Wednesday 13 June, Saturday 16 June and Saturday 23 June. A similar advertisement appeared on STAR FM Radio 10 times in the week commencing 3 June 2001 and 20 times each in the weeks commencing 10 June, 17 June and 24 June and on 3BO FM 10 times in the week commencing 3 June and 20 times each in the weeks commencing 10 June and 17 June. (3) No. Telstra’s Board and management are responsible for the day to day running of Telstra’s operations. (4) The Government is committed to not proceeding to the full privatisation of Telstra until it is satisfied that arrangements exist to deliver adequate services to all Australians. In particular, the Government’s immediate priority is to get more services into rural and regional Australia. Telstra's statements that it intends to continue to operate in Bendigo reflect Telstra's long-term commitment to the provision of telecommunications services to the people of Bendigo. (5) Similar advertising has not been run in other regions.",76,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001

Other TCW regions adopted different advertising strategies. (7) Telstra regrets that it does not have this information available as at 1996. As at June 2001, Telstra employed 332 staff in Bendigo. Telstra advises that employment for the Loddon Mallee region is not available, however Telstra staff in the Central Victoria region, including Bendigo, at June 2001 was 548. Second Sydney Airport: Land Acquisition (Question No. 2713) Mr Price asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) How much of the land required for the proposed Sydney’s Second Airport at Badgerys Creek has been acquired and what has the land acquisition cost been to date. (2) Is any land still to be acquired; if so, how much and what cost. (3) Has there been a recent valuation of the land acquired to date, if so, when was it undertaken and what was the valuation amount. (1) The Commonwealth has acquired all of the land for the airport design described as OptionA in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Second Sydney Airport Proposal at Badgerys Creek completed in 1999, except for that portion of The Northern Road which crosses the site. The Commonwealth has also acquired 12 potentially aircraft noise affected properties in the Badgerys Creek vicinity. The expenditure by the Commonwealth on the acquisition of the land and associated improvements for airport purposes has totalled some $137 million. Negotiations on three compensation claims arising from the compulsory acquisition of properties on the site are still continuing. The cost of acquiring the 12 potentially aircraft noise affected properties was some $7.2 million. (2) There is currently no proposal by the Commonwealth to acquire further land at Badgerys Creek for airport purposes. However, there are eight outstanding offers by the Commonwealth to acquire, on a voluntary basis, potentially aircraft noise affected properties in the Badgerys Creek vicinity. The owners of these properties have chosen not to take up the Commonwealth’s offer at this time. (3) The most recent valuation was obtained in September 1999 for financial reporting purposes. The land and improvements at Badgerys Creek, which were acquired for possible airport purposes, were valued at $38.5 million as at 30 June 1999. This valuation was made on the basis of the land being zoned for airport use. The potentially aircraft noise affected properties acquired by the Commonwealth were valued at $4 million as at 30 June 1999 taking into account the impact of a future airport. Sydney Basin Airports: Sale (Question No. 2715) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Further to part (2) of the answer to question No. 2493 (Hansard, 7 June 2001, page 27668) why is the lessee being given first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 km from the Sydney Central Business District. (2) Does this contractual right surrendered by the Commonwealth deny Sydney Airport aircraft noise affected residents any relief from aircraft noise emanating from that airport.

74,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Giving the new owner of Sydney Airport the first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney Central Business District is intended to provide an appropriate degree of commercial certainty to the new owner in regard to the possible future development of new airport capacity in the Sydney region. It will also facilitate future compliance with the provisions in the Airports Act 1996 dealing with the issue of common ownership of Sydney Airport and Sydney West Airport. (2) The sale arrangements for Sydney Airport will not prevent the development of a second major airport for Sydney if a future Federal Government decided that such development should proceed. (3) The purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Second Sydney Airport Proposal was to examine the potential environmental (including social and economic) implications of building and operating a domestic and international airport at Badgerys Creek. The EIS did not make recommendations on whether or not the airport should be built. (4) The Government’s primary means of addressing the aircraft noise issues associated with Sydney Airport has been to provide for a substantially more equitable sharing of noise through the implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan and by continuing the aircraft noise insulation program. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2736) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 12 June 2001 titled Airport bids growth conundrum. (2) Does the article state that the three key bidding groups for the $4 billion Sydney Airport sale will be lodging indicative bids late next month based on some 14 times earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of about $280 million; if so, does he agree with the estimates made in this statement; if not, what is his estimate of Sydney Airports earnings before tax. (3) Does the article also state that figures contained in the information memorandum being circulated among bidders makes it clear that the two value drivers will have first right of refusal over any new airport being built in Sydney and unfettered access to 68 per cent of the airports revenue; if so, does he agree with the estimates in this statement; if not, what are the value drivers for Sydney Airports sale price. (4) Is it expected that the growth in international passenger numbers will be as forecast in the information memorandum, that is by between 3.4 and 5.6 per cent from June 2001 to the 2016 financial year, after growing by 3.2 to 6.2 per cent over the next five years; if not, what are the correct relevant forecasts for passenger number growth at Sydney Airport. (5) Is he able to estimate the environmental impact of this forecast growth on (a) aircraft noise from aircraft movements emanating to and from Sydney Airport and (b) the ability to implement the Long Term Operating Plan. (6) Based on the forecast growth of Sydney Airport, must Sydney West Airport be built and operational before Sydney Airport may be leased; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) and (3) It would not be appropriate for me to comment about press speculation on the amount of, or basis for, the estimated sale price for Sydney Airport. (4) The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the second Sydney airport proposal forecast that total passenger movements (excluding international transits) into and out of the Sydney basin would grow at an average rate of 4.2 percent per year in the ten year period to 2009-10 and 2.8 percent per year from 2009-10 to 2021-22. International passengers at Sydney Airport currently make up about one third of total passengers through the Airport and therefore measures of potential growth in this sector of the market are not representative of overall demand. (5) (a) and (b) The Long Term Operating Plan has been designed to take into account future growth at the airport. Since the main demand pressures are focussed on the peak hours, it is expected that",78,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001
75,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:there will continue to be less busy periods when the noise sharing modes involving operations on the east-west runway can be used. (6) The Government concluded that Sydney Airport will be able to handle the anticipated growth in air traffic to the end of the decade and that it would be premature to build a second major airport. Hague Conventions (Question No. 2743) (1) Has any State objected to Australia’s instrument of accession to the 1973 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance Obligations, which entered into force on 1 August 1976 ? (2) Will he bring up to date the information that he gave concerning conventions in the Hague Conference system in his answers to questions No. 906 (Hansard, 24 November 1999, page 12599) and No. 1009 (Hansard, 17 February 2000, page 13865) ? (1) No objection to Australia’s accession has been made. (2) Australia has ratified or acceded to nine Hague Conventions. Most recently, in October 2000, Australia acceded to the Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance (2 October 1973). The Attorney-General’s Department’s work on Hague Convention matters remains focussed on: administrative work required under Hague Conventions to which Australia is already a party (including the Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad (1970) and the Convention on International Child Abduction (1980)); public consultation and participation in meetings of a Special Commission of the Hague Conference which is drafting a new Convention on Jurisdiction, Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters; and work with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies on ratification of three other Hague Conventions: The Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (19 October 1996). A Bill to implement the Convention has been drafted and is being considered by a Commonwealth/State working group. The Bill may be introduced in the current sittings of the Commonwealth Parliament if drafting resources allow. The Convention on the International Protection of Adults (2 October 1999). The Attorney-General’s Department has published an Issues Paper and will be consulting relevant State and Territory authorities on the question whether Australia should ratify the Convention. The Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra Judicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (2 October 1973). The Attorney-General’s Department will be consulting relevant State and Territory authorities on the question whether Australia should accede to the Convention. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2782) 28 June 2001: (1) What are the boundaries of the property which will be sold as part of the sale of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and, in particular, do the boundaries include an area of roadway; if so, what area of roadway is included within the boundaries of the sale.

79,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) and (2) The current sale process for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport involves the sale of the Government’s shares in Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (SACL). SACL holds a 50 year lease (with an option to extend for a further 49 years) for Sydney Airport which was issued by the Commonwealth in 1998. As is presently the case, the ownership of the property comprising Sydney Airport will remain with the Commonwealth after the sale of SACL. There are a number of roads within Sydney Airport, many of which are accessible to the general public. It is presently a requirement of the lease that SACL maintains these roads to an appropriate standard. This will continue to be the case after SACL is sold. Of particular relevance is the road known as Qantas Drive which is located on land that forms part of the Sydney Airport lease. This road is an important public thoroughfare and I have given assurances that the current access arrangements for Qantas Drive will continue when the airport is privatised. The sale arrangements for SACL will include a covenant preventing the imposition of a toll or other road charge on vehicles using Qantas Drive, or unreasonably restricting access of vehicles to Qantas Drive. The eastern extension of the M5 Motorway, which is currently under construction, will cut across a small section of the Sydney Airport lease on the western periphery. It is proposed that this small section of the airport site will be sold to the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority who have responsibility for the current extension of the M5 Motorway. Illegal Immigration: Prospect Electorate (Question No. 2792) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) How many foreign citizens has his Department found working illegally in the electoral division of Prospect in (a) 1998, (b) 1999, (c) 2000 and (d) 2001. (2) What are the names of the employers or labour providers in the electoral division of Prospect who employed foreign citizens who were not authorised to work in Australia. (3) How many illegal workers had each employer engaged. (4) What range of sanctions and penalties can be placed upon an employer or labour provider found to be employing illegal workers. (5) What sanctions or penalties has the Government placed upon each of the employers and labour providers in the electoral division of Prospect who was found to be employing illegal workers. (6) What action did his Department take with the illegal workers. (7) Were illegal workers in the electoral division of Prospect detained and subsequently deported. (8) In each case, was the cost to the Commonwealth of the detention and deportation recovered from the illegal worker. (9) Following the 1999 Review of Illegal Workers in Australia, will the Government implement the three-tiered approach to sanctions and penalties for employers who engage illegal workers as outlined in recommendation 3.6 of the review. (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7) and (8) Statistical information is not available by electoral division. (4) It is an offence under the Crimes Act 1914 to knowingly aid or abet, directly or indirectly, the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. This includes employment of illegal workers. The penalty for such an offence would accord with those set out in Section 235 of the Migration Act 1958 being a fine not exceeding $10,000. (9) Following the Review of Illegal Workers in Australia (RIWA) report, my department conducted extensive community consultations on implementing the recommendations. These consultations revealed a lack of awareness of how to check work rights. As a result it was decided to implement the RIWA recommendations in phases. The first phase includes measures designed to enhance employers’ and labour providers’ awareness of their obligations, and to provide support to employers and labour providers in checking",80,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001
80,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:work rights and interpreting visa labels. The sanctions legislation will be implemented in the second phase. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Curfew (Question No. 2805) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) Has he read an article that appeared on page three of The Australian Financial Review dated 4 July 2001 titled Sydney Airport offers in the air. (2) Is his Department considering a recommendation to alter the current curfew times for Sydney Airport to 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.; if so, can he furnish particulars of any proposed legislative amendments to the curfew legislation currently in force for Sydney Airport; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) No. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Additional Runways (Question No. 2806) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) Has he read an article that appeared on page 18 of The Australian Financial Review dated 20 July 2001 titled “Airport gets pick of three plans”. (2) Are there three plans for extra runways at Sydney Airport; if so, what are those plans and will he table copies of these plans in the House. (3) Is one of the plans to construct two further parallel north-south runways starting on Botany Bays southern shore just north of an area of preserved sand dunes and running parallel to a spit known as Towra Point; if so, will he furnish details; if not, why not. (4) What will be the aircraft movement capacity for Sydney Airport if the plan by Dr Bill Bradfield for the IAC Aviation Consultancy is introduced at Sydney Airport. (5) Will he support the Bradfield Plan proposals; if so, why. (1) Yes. (2) to (5) The Government has no plans to construct additional runways at Sydney Airport. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Additional Runways (Question No. 2807) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 August 2001 (1) Has he read an article that appeared on page 6 of The Australian Financial Review dated 21-22 July 2001 titled “New runways wont raise bids”. (2) Is there a proposal to increase the number of runways at Sydney Airport; if so, what are the details. (3) What impact will the permissible expansion of the number of runways at Sydney Airport have on the sale price of Sydney Airport. (4) What impact will the decision to permit extra runways to be constructed at Sydney Airport have on the timing and likelihood of the construction of Sydney West Airport.

(2) Further to the answer to part (2) of question No. 2600, will he table a copy of the advice from Airservices Australia that Bankstown Airport operations can be configured so they will not be an impediment to the implementation of the remaining elements of the LTOP such as the trident and power-off approaches; if not, why not. (3) Further to the answer to part (2) of question No. 2600, (a) when he refers to the Environment and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does he mean the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, (b) can he define what necessary clearances means, (c) can he define precisely what provisions of the EPBC Act will apply to provide the necessary clearances; if so, what does this laypersons term mean in respect of the statutory provisions of the Act, (d) when will these matters be referred to the Minister for Environment and Heritage in accordance with the requirements of the legislation, (e) does the decision of the Government on 13 December 2000 to use Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport for Sydney Airport constitute an action that triggers the provisions of the EPBC Act and (f) does the act of redesigning the airspace trigger the provisions of the EPBC Act; if so, what are those provisions. (1) (a) Over the 12 month period July 2000 to July 2001 27.5% of total movements at Sydney Airport were to the north. (b) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (3) of question No. 2442. (2) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (2) of question No. 2600. (3) (a) to (f) The Government’s decision on Sydney’s future airport needs specifically refers to making Bankstown Airport available as an overflow airport for Sydney. When a detailed proposal for upgrading Bankstown Airport is put forward by a future owner of the Airport this will need to be referred to the Environment Minister if the nature of the proposal triggers the statutory requirements for referral laid down in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2809) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) What grants or other payments were made to employer organisations by the department or any of its agencies in the 1997-98 financial year.

In addition to the consultation requirements set out in the Airports Act 1996 for the preparation of a master plan, the airport lessee must, within 90 days of the Minister’s approval: publish a notice in the newspaper stating that the master plan has been approved, that copies of the plan are available for inspection and purchase by members of the public during normal office hours while the plan is in force and specify where the plan is available for inspection and purchase; make the master plan available for inspection and purchase as notified in the newspaper. (3) Any actions that trigger the provisions of the Airports Act 1996 and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999 will be assessed as and when required. Sri Lanka: Ambassador to Australia (Question No. 2811) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: Further to part (8) of his answer to question No. 2737, (Hansard, 9 August 2001, page 29669) can the Minister say why the appointment of Major-General Janaka Perera as Sri Lankan Ambassador to Australia is acceptable to the Australian Government; if not, why not. As I stated in Parliament on 18 June 2001, this appointment was carefully considered and this did not establish any basis from which the Australian Government could challenge the Sri Lankan Government’s advice that his is a worthy and suitable appointment. Veterans: Gold Card (Question No. 2818) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: Will he grant a Gold Card to servicewomen who were members of the Women’s Australian Air Force during World War II; if not why not. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) Australian servicewomen and servicemen have equal access to compensation and health care benefits. Eligibility criteria for World War II veterans is dependent upon qualifying service in Australia’s Defence Force (ADF) between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945 and the age of the veteran and not the arm of the ADF in which the service was rendered. Ex-members of the Women’s Australian Air Force are eligible for a Gold Card, providing they meet the eligibility criteria detailed in the VEA. A Gold Card is issued to all World War II veterans of the ADF and Australia’s merchant navy who: are ex-prisoners of war; or served in the ADF between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945, who have qualifying service from this period of hostilities and who are aged 70 years and over; or receive a disability pension at or above 100% of the general rate; or received a disability pension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978. Government policy on qualifying service has been in place since the 1930s. Under the former Repatriation Act 1920 and then the VEA, qualifying service has always meant that the person served in a theatre of war or has incurred danger from actual combat with hostile forces of the enemy. It is appropriate that those who served under these conditions should be given priority care. The Government recognises that many veterans were willing to serve anywhere but did not have a choice as to where they were sent. It also gratefully acknowledges the service provided by World War II veterans of Australia’s Defence Forces without qualifying service.",83,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001
86,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:These veterans can still be granted a Gold Card in circumstances where their individual level of warcaused disability is such that the issue of a Gold Card is warranted. Many of them have been issued with Gold Card because they are in receipt of disability pension at or above 100% of the general rate, or at the special rate (Totally and Permanently Incapacitated) or are in receipt of Extreme Disablement Adjustment. Alternatively, a White Card may be issued to these veterans to provide medical treatment for accepted specific war-caused disabilities. Hoxton Park Airport (Question No. 2825) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: In the Governments lease arrangements for Hoxton Park Airport, what contingency provisions apply with respect to (a) the future development of Badgerys Creek International Airport which would necessitate the closure of Hoxton Park for air safety reasons and (b) future land use and zoning arrangements at the Hoxton Park site should the airport ever cease operations. There are no contingency provisions with respect to (a) the future development of Badgerys Creek International Airport including any that would necessitate the closure of Hoxton Park for air safety reasons or (b) any future land use and zoning arrangements at the Hoxton Park site should the airport ever cease operations. The lease provides for the continued operation of Hoxton Park as an airport. Education: Wesley College Satellite Campus (Question No. 2828) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) Is he aware of the proposed partnership between the Shire of Boddington, Boddington State School and Wesley College in the development of campuses in Boddington, WA. (2) What support will the Government provide to this project. (3) What discussions has he had with the WA Minister for Education to ensure Federal and State cooperation in the development of the project. (1) I am aware that Wesley College is considering establishing a satellite campus in Boddington and my office has recently responded to a letter from Mr Peter Bradbrook, Chief Executive Officer, Shire of Boddington about the matter. I have also personally responded to an enquiry on this matter from the Hon Judi Moylan MP, Member for Pearce. (2) As an independent school, Wesley College is free to establish a new campus. In regard to support from the Commonwealth, Wesley College is currently in receipt of Commonwealth General Recurrent Grants (GRG) funding for eligible students at its existing South Perth location. If it wished to seek GRG funding for students attending a new location at Boddington, it would need to apply to the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs for approval. The main requirement for Commonwealth approval for GRG funding is that the campus is recognised by the Western Australian Minister for Education for the level(s) of education and location(s) for which Commonwealth funding is sought. In regard to capital funding, non-government schools such as Wesley College are eligible to apply for funding under the Capital Grants Programme. The Commonwealth does not provide grants directly to schools for capital projects. For non-government schools, it provides block grants to block grant authorities (BGAs) in each State and Territory. If Wesley College wants to pursue capital funding for the project, the school should contact the Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia (AISWA) Capital Grant Association for information about the application procedures for Commonwealth capital funds.

My response to Parliamentary Question 2752 advised that the National Review of Nursing Education will report in early 2002. Any recommendations from the Review, including any it may make about the impact of HECS, and subsequent courses of action will be considered once the results of the Review are available. Education: Languages Other Than English (Question No. 2853) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Is participation by young Australians in the learning of languages other than English a critical issue for Australia’s cultural and economic development. (2) Should the Government do everything possible to encourage the teaching of languages other than English, especially facilitating the teaching of children from non-English backgrounds in the languages of their original heritage. (3) Has the teaching of languages other than English at universities been seriously cut back, with more than 100 positions in language teaching disappearing in the past 5 years.

90,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,86,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001
91,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Have the total points given for the knowledge of community languages in some States, such as Victoria, been drastically reduced, and does this discourage children of non-English speaking backgrounds from pursuing the study of the language of their background. (6) Have languages in Victoria, such as Turkish and Croatian, had the allocation reduced from 250 points to 100 points for the VCE. (7) What is his response to the above issues, and what does he intend to do to promote secondlanguage learning in Australia. (1) The participation by young Australians in Languages Other Than English (LOTE) programmes is indeed an important consideration in Australia’s cultural and economic development. LOTE is one of the eight key learning areas in the National Goals for Schooling in the TwentyFirst Century. It is an area of considerable national significance, which impacts on Australia’s economic competitiveness in the global market and contributes to social cohesion throughout our multilingual and multicultural community. It is an area of education to which the Commonwealth makes a substantial contribution. (2) The Commonwealth’s commitment to languages education is marked by the significant investment it makes through the School Languages Programme. In 2001 this amounts to approximately $50 million consisting of: $20 million under the LOTE element; and $30 million under the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools (NALSAS) Strategy. The LOTE element of the Schools Languages Programme supports the study of languages in schools and in after hours ethnic schools. Its objective is to assist schools and school communities to improve the learning of languages other than English. LOTE element funds are paid to education authorities in the States and Territories who then allocate the funds as strategically as possible. Under LOTE element funding education authorities provide support for community language programmes in insertion programmes in schools and in after hours ethnic schools. The purpose in funding community language programmes is to maintain the languages and cultures of students from a language background other than English and to increase students’ awareness and understanding of those languages and cultures. The second component of the School Languages Programme, the NALSAS Strategy, aims to improve Australia's capacity and preparedness to interact internationally, in particular, with key Asian countries. It is a collaborative initiative of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. The Strategy assists government and non-government schools to improve participation and proficiency levels in language learning in four targeted Asian languages – Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin), Indonesian and Korean– and to develop Asian studies content in key learning areas. (3) The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not collect data on university staff numbers at the disciplinary level. Student load in the ‘Languages other than English’ discipline, however, has declined by 876 Equivalent Full-Time Student Units (EFTSU) (from 9,811 to 8,935) between 1996 and 2000. (4) There has been no reduction in the level of Federal funding for the School Languages Programme. There have been some administrative changes to provide additional flexibility for education authorities in the use of funds. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2001-2004 combined funding for the former Community Languages and Priority Languages elements into the Languages other than English (LOTE) element of the school languages programme. For the last four years education authorities have had the capacity to move funds between the two elements under broadbanding provisions. The rationale for simplifying Commonwealth control over inputs was to provide more flexibility for jurisdictions to allocate funds so that decisions about the most strategic use of funds are made as close to the ground as possible. Ultimately, the way in which funds are allocated is a matter for education authorities in States and Territories. (5) Rather than being discouraged, students in Victoria are choosing to study languages in increasing numbers. Between 1997 and 2000 there has been an overall increase in the number of students",86,Dewrsb Will Be Able To Provide Such Information Late In 2001
92,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:studying languages at Year 12 level – 9,232 in 2000 compared with 8,253 in 1997. Matters such as the allocation of points in the VCE are for the Victorian education authorities to determine. (6) Education authorities have the responsibility for making decisions about their curriculum and assessment programmes. Therefore, the allocation of points for specific languages in the VCE is a matter for the Victorian education authorities. (7) The Commonwealth actively promotes second language learning in Australia through its significant investment in the Schools Languages Programme.
