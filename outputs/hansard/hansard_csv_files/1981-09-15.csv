AgainI quote from the speech in 1975: In the whole of the six years this Government has The Government's economic strategy will be designed to never got near that figure for growth. After bring down the rate of inflation. growth appeared, as it did in the first half of the last financial year, the Government, in this Much nonsense has been talked about this Budget, moved quickly to stifle it. Let us look at Government's economic strategy on inflation, that. The expectation for the next year of gross mostly, of course, by this Government. In the secnon-farm product growth is 3 per cent to 3t per ond half of 1975 the rate of inflation ran at 11 per cent. I think that is an inflated expectation becent. Six years later, in 1981, what is the promise cause the decline in growth rate in the second half in this Budget? The government promises-this is of 1980-81 appears to have been fairly severe. I a conservative statement-an inflation rate of know that the figures are still provisional but from 10.75 per cent for next year. From all the evithe figures for the second half of 1980-81 it dence we have it will certainly rise beyond 11 per appears that the economy, which the Governcent, possibly to 12 per cent. All the suffering and ment is about to contract, was already contracting all the costs of economic stagnation have yielded in the latter half of 1980-81. Yet the thrust of the these sorts of gains. Little was achieved on the Government's budgetary policy this year is to inflation front in 1976-77. There were some marcontract an economy which was already contractginal but significant gains in 1978, 1979 and 1980 ing. This Government has no solution to inflation but the inflation situation is now deteriorating. other than to contract the economy. The GovernThe Government's answers to the problems are ment has now embarked on a policy which will quite contradictory. On the one hand it has a set of contradictionary policies, a reduction of the inflationary spiral beginning at intolerably high deficit and a tight monetary policy, but on the levels of unemployment. other hand the deficit reduction is pursued primarily not by reducing outlays but by increasing A major element in this policy disaster is the taxes, by policies that will directly and indirectly deficit fetish which has gripped this Government. fuel inflation. These taxing policies will directly Reducing the deficit has become an ideological and indirectly fuel inflation. For example, the priobsession, an end in itself, irrespective of policy vate tax of health insurance which is regressive outcomes. Three assumptions have underlined and inequitable, was designed, pretty unsuccessthis obsession. I will deal with these fairly briefly. fully as I have shown, to reduce the deficit. It will They are as follows: Firstly, that there is a positive contribute at least a 0.75 per cent increase to the correlation between low deficits or Budget consumer price index figure over the next year. surpluses and low rates of inflation; secondly, that This is directly inflationary. The sales tax inthere is a positive relationship between low creases, regressive and inequitable, designed to deficits and low interest rates; and thirdly, that as balance the expected losses from the oil levy are the public sector is cut back the private sector will the thin edge of a wedge to provide a general consomehow expand. All three assumptions are unsumer tax. These increases will be directly inflatrue. First of all, as Dr Barrie Hughes has conclustionary to the extent of at least 1t per cent, deively proved, there is no inverse relationship bespite what the Government says. These are tween low deficits and high inflation. He states: directly inflationary ways of reducing the deficit. Indeed between 1975 and 1980 as deficits got bigger, inflation fen, and as the deficit was slimmed, prices growth stirred The 22.2 per cent increase in pay-as-you-earn up again. tax receipts must increase pressure on wages and salaries and thus on prices. It must produce that This financial year's' domestic surplus will be pressure on wages because these receipts, which accompanied by the highest rate of inflation in are being taken in with this hefty income tax grab, four years. Similarly for interest rates and the are not being used to boost the social wage. If we deficit. Over the past three years, as the deficit has could boost the social wage with this money we fallen, interest rates have inexorably risen. Quite might be able to reduce the pressure on wages. contrary to the underlying assumptions, as the But this money is not being used to provide unideficit has gone down interest rates have gone up. versal health services, it is not being used to proFinally, the third absurd assumption is that as the vide better education resources, it is not being public sector contracts the private sector will exused to extend public transport, it is not being pand. Public private sectors are mostly not comused to improve social welfare and it is not being petitive but, on the evidence of Australian history, used to provide better public housing. Therefore it are mainly complementary.

These will be the indirect inflaand economic planning. The nonsense underlining tionary effects of this deficit reduction approach. this Budget and the whole economic strategy has been aptly summarised by Hugh Stretton in a After six years two things should be obvious to brief article. He states: all on the inflationary front. Firstly, it is absurd to attack inflation indirectly through a deficit policy In a world in which productivity reflects education, skin that directly as well as indirectly fuels inflation. and research, we are told to cut public production of all three. Yet this is what the Government is doing.

In the post-Labor. years we were busily paying off the disposable income figures reveals the extent to Australian Labor Party's debts, as I have had to which a large number of people in our community are taking cash for their services and taking cash describe it in my electorate. We had an enormous deficit. Each year it had to be funded. The for goods that they sell and are not declaring their Treasurer might be able to help me but I think at income from that source.
