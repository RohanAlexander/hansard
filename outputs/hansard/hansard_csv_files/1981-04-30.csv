I speak of countries such as Turkey and Iceland. We are not far ahead n seems to me that the principle boils down to of them.

The man has not bility, give it to the States. Now it is being thought his way through the implications of what proposed that this is all necessary on the pretext he is proposing. of achieving small government as if, innately, small government were a virtue in itself. Firstly Is the public sector all that bad? There are the Prime Minister claimed that the Government people in this country, literally millions upon had been responsible for reducing the size of the millions of them-not just the poor, not just the public septor in this country. The measure that working class but the middle class-who can really counts is the proportion of gross domestic never hope to achieve independence and real freeproduct going to all public authorities in dom in this country to experience a decent quality Australia. The reason is simply this: The Government has resorted to rigging the public account of life unless there is a greater role by government in a range of responsibilities such as health, edubooks. n has been pushing commitments out of cation, welfare and urban improvement.

Even in the Budget sector the promineral development we hear so much of-the portion of gross domestic product, on average, in boom, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce the five years of Fraser Government is higher than ( Sir Phillip Lynch) likes to call it.
