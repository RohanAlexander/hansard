15,,"Mr HUGHES I wish to know frommixed one of law and fact. The law has been examined; the facts are being in-quired into. Treasurer a question in reference to the following statement contained in a letter published in this morning's Argus. Speaking of our proceedings, on Thursday in reference to the selection of a Capital Site, the writer saysMr Deakin is too simple. Sir William Lyne, who should have warned him, was only too pleased for another shuffle for his Tumut. He had nothing to lose, but everything to gain, as a venture, to not only placate his constituents, in Australia? but also to enhance the value of properties he has personal interests in thereabouts. I wish to know whether the latter statement is true. If it is not, does the Minister intend, seeing that corruption is implied, to take action in the matter? sinuations of this kind have been made against me that I now take no notice of them. I have read the statement referred to, but, as a matter of fact, I do not own an acre of land within hundreds of miles of Tumut, and never did. The nearest place to Tumut at which I own land is Katoomba, where I have two or three allotments, and that, as honourable members know, is hundreds of miles away. In no other place have I any interest of any kind. NEW PROTECTION. Prime Minister promised to lay on the table to-day a memorandum embodying the Government policy in reference to the new. protection. Is the paper ready? sible to complete it to-day, and I am not sure that it will be ready to-morrow, but hope to present it then, or on Thursday, at latest. Its preparation has proved difficult. DUTY ON COTTON HOSIERY. Prime Minister seen an article in to-day's Age regarding the state of the cotton sock and hosiery manufacture? Is it not possible to afford relief to those whose industry has been so seriously injured by the action of this House? fought strongly for the continuance of the old duty, and was supported by most of the members on this side of the Chamber; but as the proposal was rejected on more than one occasion, nothing can be done until the Tariff is once more under consideration. Minister of Defence whether there is any justification for the rumour that the Government intend to send a number of men to England to enable them to gain experience in the manufacture of small arms, so that they may be in a position to perform similar work in connection with the smallarms factory which it is proposed to erect the matter is purely a departmental one. It has not yet become a Cabinet question. But it occurred to me that in carrying out work of this description it might be wise to send competent menwho possessed a considerable training in this particular branch of industry to Great Britain, in order that they might perfect themselves in it, rather than to import too many workmen in connection with the small-arms factory which it is proposed to establish. This is the basis of the rumour, and the position will remain unchanged until further investigation takes place, which will not be for some little time. Before any steps of that kind are taken the House will be informed of them. the' Prime Minister whether he is in a position to make any further statement in regard to the Federal Capital site. Last week he promised that he would make such a statement. made without fail to-morrow afternoon. presenting the Minister of Home Affairs, Whether he will inform the House1.

Will he say whether this' is a correct presentment of the position; and, if so, what are the reasons for this action ? authorities in the various States were accepting responsibilities-amon g them the conduct of Cadet camps-for which Parliamentary sanction had not been given, and, believing it to be unwise to spend money which Parliament had not voted, I directed, in general terms, that the Commandants should be informed that very good reasons must be given for the anticipation of Parliamentary votes to insure the approval of expenditure. had some bearing on the state of things to which the honourable member has called attention; but I shall read the newspaper paragraph in question, and, having informed myself more thoroughly in regard a more definite answer later. ter of Defence, ufon noticeWhat will be the difference in total annual cost between a militiaman, under existing regulations of pay, accoutrements, arms, & c , and. the proposed cost of a National guardsman under the new proposals, and how is the difference in detail made up ? orable member's question is as follows:The cost per head of militiamen, excluding arms and accoutrements, but including administration and instruction under the present system is about ^20 per annum. The cost under the new system of a member of the National Guard' is estimated at about Â£ 5 per annum. These figures in both cases exclude stores, field artillery, ammunition (reserve) works and buildings, and repairs. The cost per head of arms and accoutrements remains as at present. The existvate) is Â£ 6 Ss. per annum. The great saving, under the proposed scheme, becomes obvious from a comparison of the two systems, in one of which, as proposed, the men are dealt with locally in large bodies, and in the other, as at present, in small detachments widely scattered over the Continent, or, by reason of the small numbers in each centre, in concentrations which entail bringing men and liorses excessive disunits.

The term "" citizen forces"" is retained to include all forces not permanent. The term ""National Guard"" would seem to be a suitable name to be given to the manhood of the Commonwealth under training for national defence. The only country in which, so far as I am aware, a similar title is in use is the United States. ister of Defence, upon notice1. Has not the numerical .strength of the Militia (Military Forces) been always regulated Ijy the vote of Parliament available for the -purpose ? 2. Could not the numerical strength of the Militia have been easily increased if funds had been available ? 3. Have any strenuous efforts been at any time necessary to secure the number required? -orable member's questions are as follow:1. The numerical strength may not exceed the .numbers provided in the Appropriation Act. 2. Tn some localities and corps probably it could be, but speaking generally-no . See remarks, Hansard,, page 441, in which it is stated that the number obtainable would not materially affect the comparison between, say, 20,000 men engaged in training as specified and 800,000 men who, although having the same national ancl legal responsibilities with regard to defence, are making no effort to prepare. 3. Yes. The Militia are always short of the number provided for, the percentage short varying throughout the year from 10 per cent, upwards (officers about 20 per cent.). Great efforts Commission, by Mr J. P. Jones, of . Melhave to be made before the annual camps to fill up vacancies, and, in the past, regiments have been known to have taken men to camp who have not even completed their short recruit drill, thus obtaining a good paper statement. During the last camps 2,600 of the troops had three months' service, or less. length of service in the various States shows that not less than one-fourth of the strength goes out, -and is replaced every year. The proportion is really greater, because the average service is increased by a proportion of men with considerable service. The existence of this large casual element means that a considerable number are passed out after one year's service or less. Such training is comparatively useless. 441-442, Hansard. A moment or two ago the right honourable member asked me across the chamber whether pay was included in the amounts which I have quoted. tion would necessitate my making a much fuller explanation. It would also require mv statement to be qualified. Minister, upon notice1. Whether paragraphs Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Admiralty Despatch of 20th August last, are an accurate summary of the views communimonwealth Government on Australian Naval Defence? 2. If they are not an accurate summary, in what particulars are they inaccurate? 3. If they are an accurate summary, what is the reason an announcement by the Government on the subject of the despatch has not been made ? honourable member's guestions are as follow : 1 and 2. Yes. 3. The report of the Imperial Conference containing a clear outline of the Government's views of Naval Defence was laid before Parliament last year and discussed incidentally in the House both during my enforced absence and afterwards. Such an important matter as the establishment of an efficient system of Australian Naval Defence demands f u l l consideration, and, though the last Admiralty despatch is an important contribution to that end, even now a good deal remains to be defined before complete proposals can be submitted to Parliament. The Government have not felt called upon to x make an announcement with regard to part only of their Naval policy, preferring to wait until it can be dealt with as a whole. of Trade and Customs, upon notice1.

I do not often transgress by making a long speech, but I feel that there are some matters in this Bill on which I may be able to give Parliament some special information. I fear that on FridayI may have done the Minister an injustice by omitting to point out what occurred on 2nd April, 1908, when I brought before him in this chamber certain of the regulations clare what persons shall be exempt from service which I had previously referred to. I then whom pointed out that under those regulations it bear arms or perform military service shall be was simply impossible for men in certain exempt upon such conditions as may be precorps to obtain promotion from the ranks. scribed.

The offender is a committee, not a man. tion does not carry out the intention of the Act, I shall see that it does. So the matter was brought fully before the Minister at that date, and he gave that definite promise, in consequence of which I caused to be sent to him within a week draft regulations which would carry out the intentions of the Act, and which he himself, in a subsequent discussion, admitted would' fulfil the intention of section 11 of the Act of 1903 to permit men to rise from the ranks. Yet those regulations have not been altered, and so I again point out that the Minister's desires, and the will of Parliament, have not been carried out, although the Minister has officers who are responsible for seeing that that is done. The Minister seems to be served by .his Board very' badly. I tried also to show that regulations framed under the present system are absolutely incomplete. I will give instances. I suppose that during the last fortnight all honourable members have received a circular from certain religious organizations with regard to the position of conscientious objectors, complaining that it is very unfair that any man whose religion forbids him to bear arms-such , for instance, as the Quakersshould not receive consideration. I replied to that circular by pointing out that section61 of the Defence Act met that positionThe Governor General may, by regulation, dein the Defence Force, provided that personsthe doctrines of their religion forbid tofive years, and the Military Board has beentious objections to service.

53,Mr Crouch,"I have not attendedmember says that is so, I see no reason to doubt it. The Minister, in his second reading speech, spoke of the cost of uniforms. I refer to this matter more particularly because the Prime Minister, in December last, when bringing the Government scheme before the House for the first time, expressed the opinion that the expense -of uniforms was far too great. LieutenantColonel Legge, who, I understand, drafted the memorandum on the land defence of Australia, discusses in it the cost of. uniforms. I hear that some honourable members have expressed the intention of seeking to have khaki specified in the Act itself, seeing that the regulations are so absolutely ineffective. But its insertion in the Act will render impossible some simpler and perhaps more suitable uniform, if discovered in future. Eighty pages of these regulations, which I hold in my hand, apply to questions of -dress only, in spite of the statement that a simple khaki uniform was to be adopted. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence dealt with this question, because, they said, it was impossible for some men to take commissions on account of the expense involved in obtaining uniforms. Under the heading of "" Infantry Officers,"" I take the following as an example of these regulations :Tunic -Scarlet cloth, with white cloth collar and cuffs (except as specified below). The collar -ornamented with f-inch lace along the top, and gold Russia braid at the bottom. Regimental badges as described in Appendix IX . (a). The cuffs pointed with f-inch lace round the top, extending to 7^ inches, and a tracing in gold -Russia braid Â£-inch above and below the lace, forming an Austrian knot at the top, extending to 9^ inches from the bottom of the cuff, and a small eye at the bottom. Eight Commonwealth buttons (39 lines) in front. The skirt -close behind, with a plait at each side, and edged with white cloth i-inch wide. The front and collar and skirt plaits edged with white -cloth i-inch wide, twisted round gold shoulder cords, lined with scarlet; Regimental buttons (26 lines) at top. We get pages and pages of that sort of thing from the Military Board, while they neglect to submit a scheme of defence, or a proper system of military organization for the Commonwealth. Apparently they have no time to waste on things of that sort. The regulation was issued on 12th November, 1906, under the hand of the Secretary to the Military Board, and is practically made compulsory in the following terms: Officers will, however, be permitted to continue to wear the uniform at present in their possession, which should be gradually replaced by the uniform now prescribed. Commanding officers will be responsible that the clothing and necessaries of the soldiers under their command are complete and in good order. passed, was not permission given to officers to retain their old uniforms? was promised that a change should be made, but this regulation says that the uniform shall be "" Gradually replaced by the uniform now prescribed."" This shows distictly that instead of there being an endeavour to meet what was the desire of the Parliament at the time when the Act was passed, an altogether different state of things has been permitted. of all this? Minister is completely blocked by a number of "" passive resisters"" who simply refuse to carry out what he has expressed his intention of having done, and what is the desire of this House. The people of this country do not want this sort of rubbish. They want our soldiers to be clothed in a simple kind of uniform which shall be inexpensive, and the officers to wear a uniform which will be fit for field work, and will give good service. I do not say that the Minister is responsible for what I have described, but if Parliament gives a distinct indication of its wishes it is time that the men who are employed to do the will of Parliament see that practical effect is given to them. Colonel FOXTON -Surely the Minister, is responsible for the regulations? member must surely know that unless the Minister has technical knowledge he has to accept the advice of his subordinates. I am sure that the Minister has tried to comply with the wish of Parliament in regard to officers' commissions. He was good enough to get the Inspector-General, the Chief of the Military Board, and the Secretary of the Department, to meet me, and it was agreed that every man should be given the right to rise from the ranks, and that the cumbrous system of competitive University examination should be done away with. member a seat on the Board?",15,Defence Bill Second Reading

""the right honourable member show that he has no sympathy with me in this matter. why the honourable member was there. there until I secure what I want in the matter. permit, the honourable member will be there. permission. The next question to which I wish to refer is the marriage regulations. It will be remembered that about two years ago a case was brought up in Parliament in which a man was not allowed to get married until he, and the lady whom he wished to marry, had been paraded before an officer. At that time the Minister promised to see that the practice was altered. Things have improved, although, at the present time, a member of the Permanent Forces may be married and may be a man of good conduct, but yet he is not allowed .to live outside the barracks. He is nof allowed to go home to live with his wife, and to sleep with his wife at night. I think that is very wrong indeed, not only to the man, but to the woman. The Minister will see on page 171 of the Regulations, Regulation 71, the following provision :Soldiers are not to be allowed permanent passes to sleep out of Barracks except those (1) should stand aside, or look into a shopwho are on the married establishment and who arc of good character; and (2) widowers with children if approved by the Commanding Officer. The marriage establishment consists of 10 per cent. only. That is a very bad state of things, and one of which the' House should take notice immediately. It is a matter that one does not care to speak about, but the Minister should not only issue an order, but, if matters are not improved in two or three months, he should see that what he desires is done. in barracks. only affect about twenty-five men. Colonel FOXTON -If what the honourable member desires were carried out, all the men would get married. ister that it would be a very good thing indeed. Another matter to which I wish to allude relates to the regulation with regard to the practice of saluting when in plain clothes. I believe that, as a matter of disI was wondering cipline, it is right for men to salute .when they are in uniform. But it is wrong toinsist that a soldier in plain clothes, when he meets an officer in the street, shall becompelled to salute, particularly in this community.., where all citizens are equal before the law. Colonel FOXTON -I s the honorable member speaking of the Permanent Forces? thing to compel a member of the CitizenForces, in plain clothes, to salute an> officer; but the practice in regard to thePermanent Forces is really one that degrades the uniform. I say so for this reason-that if a member of the Permanent Forces in plain clothes does not salute anofficer, the punishment may be that he is. not permitted to wear plain clothes for oneor two months. Therefore, the wearing, of the uniform becomes a penalty instead' of being a source of pride. Every soldier ought to be proud of his uniform. But, although the regulation does not apply to the Citizen Forces, I can tell the House that not very long ago I was attending a military class, where the main point of the lecture was that, if one met a senior officer when in plain clothes, one ought to salutehim. The advice given by this officer was that if one did not desire to salute, one window until the senior officer had passed. That seems ridiculous, and of course I amnot going to give names; although it would be a good . thing to do, soif the Minister desires to have them. But in this community, where every man has equal rights before the law, wedoÂ» not want to import ridiculous practices of that kind. WhatI have said shows that",16,Defence Bill Second Reading

75,Mr Crouch,"Yes. There is nothe pages of the Book of Snobs seem to require an appendix. ter to which I wish to refer is ' the right of members of the Forces to express their views in the press. I know there i's a good deal of jealousy in this House as to the right of a member of the forces to speak or write about matters connected with the service. In my opinion, however, if there is no breach of confidence, or if what is said is not prejudicial to the service, all members of the forces should have an equal right in this respect. It appears that any officer at head-quarters may write to the newspapers as much as he pleases; so much so, that It is scarcelypossible to take up a Sydney newspaper without finding an interview, for example, with Brigadier-General Gordon. I should like to know whether the Minister is responsible for the following statement by that officer, and whether the scheme there outlined is to be included in the expenditure on account of the proposed new state of affairs?That is not all. We are putting the wages in the hands of the people. I consider the Government should build model buildings for their workmen, as private firms-the great gunmaker, Krupp, of Germany; Lever Brothers, of Sunlight Soap; and Cadbury, of the chocolateshave built them. Then they should build a model town of little homes and gardens within the limits of thc municipality of Lithgow, so that their employees should enjoy the best conditions of living possible. I would have the Government make no profit, but just get from their tenants the interest they have to pay on the capital borrowed. You see, they will be quite sure of tlieir tenants and of the best class of tenants. would be in possession of a set of employees who would not be at the beck and call of any rise in the value of land, or in rents, caused by any circumstances that may happen. They would be satisfied that they had good homes, sanitatation, gardens-yes , and even amusementsplaygrounds, and swimming baths-provide d at a reasonable cost; and I think that if that is the case there will be very little trouble with the employees in the future. If any did not care for those conditions they could go elsewhere. That interview was under the heading of "" The New Arsenal Garden City for Workmen."" My own hope is that the suggestions there offered will be accepted by the Minister; and it must be remembered that the words quoted are those of the head of the State forces and the representative of the Department of Defence in New South Wales. It would appear, indeed, as though one particular officer could scarcely change a button on his uniform without the fact gaining publicity in the newspapers, if we may judge from the folAnother matlowing extract relating to the Victorian head-quarters staffMajor Bruche now has complete charge, undei the State Commandant, Colonel Stanley, of tinfollowing matters :(1) Preparation and revision of defence ' scheme.

(7) War establishments I have no objection to such information being made public, but the same principle ought to apply from the top to the bottom. A little while ago I suggested that every man in the forces should be per1 mitted to send in a written report containing his opinion of the Government defence scheme. That suggestion was acted upon.. but we find that the reports, instead of going direct. to the Minister of Defence, have to be sent through the District Commandants. Any criticism, therefore, on the District Commandants, or on the present system of administration, has to pass those officers; and we can well understand what would be the result of any adverse comments. The honIn that way the Commonwealth orable member for Adelaide has several times asked for the production of those reports without success; and, although there is a deep feeling of dissatisfaction throughout the forces, I should be very much surprised, indeed, to find any adverse criticism in the oneswhich were forwarded. Honourable members may remember that I made a request some time ago that the regulations under the Bill should be submitted for consideration by Parliament in order to ascertain woe--"" ther they are drawn and administered in the democratic spirit we desire. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the whole of the work done by Parliament in passing a defence measure is rendered absolutelv nugatory by regulations which are prepared and administered by bureaucratic officials. For that reason I am sorry that the Housr will not appoint the Committee which I suggested, and which I shall make anothereffon to have brought into existence. now like to draw the attention of honourable members to clause 4, wherein it will be seen that the word ""garrison"" is struck out, meaning that the Field Artillery will in future be permanent. ought to remember that, according to the proviso in sub-clause 58B, clause 8, the Field Artillery may be trained for a term not exceeding twenty-eight days. hope to get. matter because, when the original Act was before us, I strongly opposed the introduction of the word "" garrison,"" and the honourable member for Maranoa recently quoted what I said on that occasion. There 5s no doubt that in the case of the Field Artillery, which means scientific knowledge, it will be impossible to make men efficient with sixteen days' casual attendance for training. Colonel FOXTON -As a matter of fact they will train a great deal more. train the full twenty-eight days, I still say that the Field Artillery is the weakest spot in the defence system of Australia; and I am quite of the opinion of the Inspector General, who saysThe personnel of the Field Artillery is good, and much interest is taken by all ranks, but without increased opportunities for proper training and practice, it cannot be expected that they will reach that high standard of efficiency which the Imperial Forces serving in Australia shall modern Field Artillery should attain. The Field Artillery have good guns and ammunition, and yet they are not a success; and they will not be a success until the provisions of the Bill are carried out, and we have permanent men for a Field Artillery as well as for Garrison Artillery. Tn view of the limitation of the training to twenty-eight days I remind the Minister of Lord Wolseley's comments on the fact that, under the territorial scheme in England, the Field Artillery was to be trained for only fortv-two days. On the 20th May last I asked the Ministeri f he had noticed a cable relating to Lord Wolseley's criticism, and whether the Government agreed with it, and he replied that he approved of Lord Wolseley's remarks. not anvthing like forty-two davs' training. lery, under the territorial scheme, the training is forty-two days or six weeks. for artillery under the BiU is gceater than that under the scheme of the territorial army iti England. The Minister lery. In any case, if Lord Wolseley thinks that forty-two days yearly is'not sufficient surely we may take it that twenty-eight days is not by any means long enough to meet the requirements of this very much neglected arm of the forces. for the territorial army is fifty-seven days in two years. It is further proposed in clause 7 of the Bill thatThe regulations may prescribe(a) That members of the Defence Force voluntarily serving with the Imperial Forces outside Australia sha.ll be subject to the Army Act; That is quite unnecessary, because, according to a decision of Chief Justice Higinbotham, of Victoria, the Army Act applies in Australia. Section 176 of the Army Act includes amongst the persons under the Act, all non-commissioned officers and men serving in forces raised beyond the limits of the United Kingdom or India. I consider, therefore, that paragraph a of the proposed new section 54A is unnecessary; but I must state my objection to paragraph b which readsSubject to any Imperial Act-that members of be subject to this Act. I venture to say that we are not disposed in Australia to have persons serving in the Commonwealth Forces subject to an Imperial Act. Under section 51 of the Constitution we have the absolute right of control over the Naval and Military Forces in Australia, and should we agree that Imperial officers and men serving in the Commonwealth Forces may be subject to the Imperial Act, we should be giving up a right which it would be very unwise for us to yield. I am very sorry that such a proposal has been made in the Bill, as I consider it involves an abrogation of our rights under the Constitution. I should like the Minister to say what is meant by the word ""personally "" in the proposed section 58jNo person shall be permitted to serve personally in the Defence Force who is found by a prescribed Court(a) to have been convicted of any disgracef u l or infamous crime, or (J) to be of notoriously bad character.",17,Defence Bill Second Reading

I shall consider the use of that word ""personally."" to sub-section 2 of the proposed new section 58L dealing with the allotment to corps. It readsSuch a number as are required shall first be allotted for training in the Naval Forces. Does that mean that the first 18,000 or 20,000 men offering are to be drafted into the Naval Forces? If the Naval Forces required 5,000 men, for instance, I suppose the honourable member would not object to their being enrolled. man to choose his own arm of the forces. Many would not personally care to. serve in the navy at all. Is it intended that if a lad of eighteen years is the first to come forward and offer his services, he is to be enrolled in the Naval Forces? I shall note the use of the word "" first."" the matter considered at a later stage. I wish now to direct the attention of the House to the last annual report of the Inspector-General of the Military Forces. I ' find from it that he has submitted two reports which have not been presented to Parliament at all. "" He saysI encloseAppendix A-copie s of my interim reports (these give in f u l l detail the comments and criticisms which I considered it my duty to make) Appendix D-repor t of Inspector of Ordnance and Ammunition (interim reports with my comments, have been forwarded during the year). Has the Minister any objection to lay these interim reports on the table? they are exactly. I shall look them up. the present disorganized' condition of the forces .is not the fault of the Inspector General, and that i'n one report he has strongly advised the Minister that one of the District Commandants should be immediately retired. Is the Minister in a position to deny that? it. that the Inspector-General has made no report in which he has advised the Minister to retire a District Commandant? a fact. I have no knowledge of it, and if such a report had been submitted, I should certainly know of it. House to understand that the Inspector General of the Forces has condemned the scheme of a Council of Defence. As a matter of fact, he says that the Council of Defence is not doing its work. He reports, under the beading "" General Staff ""I consider that the time has now arrived for the organization of a General Staff similar to that which has recently been instituted in Great Britain. The duties of the General Staff Officers would primarily be(1) Study of Military Schemes. (2) To advise on strategical distribution of Forces. (3) To advise on general Military Policy. . That includes exactly the work prescribed for the Council of Defence appointed under the Act of 1904. The Inspector General of the Military Forces points out in one of the first paragraphs of his report, dated 28th February, 1908, that the Council is not doing the work it is paid to do, and is supposed to do. Otherwise he would never recommend the creation of a new body for thei purpose. He sends in reports, and I should like to know wbo takes any notice of them. I have quoted from his report the recommendation in favour of the appointment of a General Staff to perform the work which the Council of Defence ought to perform, and does not. It should be remembered that I am quoting from the report of the senior officer of our Military Forces, the man who would have to lead them in time of war. Under the heading ""District Head-Quarters Staff"" he reportsI have devoted much time to inquiring into the work of the Administrative and Instructional Staff, and found that there was a great deal too much office work being done. Much of this could be dispensed with. This would permit of the services of the District Staff Officers being more f u l ly utilized for instructional purposes, particularly in the theoretical and practical instruction of senior officers.",19,Defence Bill Second Reading

96,Mr Crouch,"I should like theThat still remains the same. On the subject of inspections by Commandants, he recommends that these inspections should be carried out independently of the inspections by the Inspector-General of fhe Military Forces. But the practice is still continued of carrying out their inspections at the same time. He further reportsSome months ago I recommended that the posts oi Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland be held by officers of the Citizen Forces, whose duties would be mainly in connection with camps of training, and that the routine work now carried out by the Deputy Assistant QuartermasterGeneral's Department be distributed amongst the remaining Departments of the District HeadQuarters, the Senior Ordnance Officer, and the District Paymaster. The three officers of the Administrative and Instructional Staff now holding appointments as Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General in these Districts could then give the whole of their time to instructional work, which would include forming and conducting Classes of Instruction to prepare Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers for examination and promotion. I consider that the time of these three permanent officers is to a great extent being in the Commonwealth forces at least two wasted. These officers still hold their offices, and 1 presume their salaries will appear on this yeap's Estimates. salary in each case is hundreds of pounds, and yet the Inspector-General of the Military Forces reports that the time Â« f these three permanent officers is, to a great extent, being wasted. of the Commonwealth most of the time? puty Assistant Quartermaster-General in carries out its instructions in an extraordiVictoria is not out of the Commonwealth. nary manner.

I have .not referred to the matter publicly before, but I was very glad to hear what the honourable member for Laanecoorie had to say as to the way in which that review was-no t organized, but disorganized. Nothing which the honourable member said was too severe. Men were kept hanging about for hours; they were told to parade at 9.30 a-m. for a march past at 2.30 p.m., and were compelled to stand for hours on sodden ground. Then again the arrangements for the supply of food to the Americans went wrong. There was no programme. The experience gained by the review at Sydney should have enabled the whole arrangements to be properly carried out, but as it was a state of disorganization prevailed. On the following day, however, the usual "" office puff "" was published.

Another complaint that I have to make is that this House does not obtain straightforward information. I have already shown that the Minister is very badly served by his officers. Statements are made to him, and not being conversant with technical details he accepts the information that is placed in his hands. When he makes a promise in this House it is reported in Hansard and some one in his Department reads that report. That, at all events, is the practice in other Departments. pose, is the only one in the Department who does read Hansard? able member would be surprised to learn how many men in the Defence Department read Hansard. They put in a great deal of their time in that way.. the Minister, and there should be in the Department an officer, charged with the duty of seeing that promises made by the Minister in this House are carried out. Instead of that, we find that, as I have shown, a promise made by him as far back as mid April last has not yet been fulfilled. I also wish to show that the House has been frequently misled by information supplied in answer to questions, and I am glad to be able to quote chapter and verse in support of my contention. Two or three days after the opening of the present session I asked the Minister of Defence the following question1. Did the Victorian District Commandant recently issue an order, the effect of which was that at the recent Governor General's levee, the most junior officer of the Permanent Forces took precedence over militia and volunteer officers, many of whom were senior to himself. That was a straight question, and the reply I received was reported as followsfurnished me with the following replies ih the inatter1. No. The District Commandant is Colonel Stanley. I have here a copy of "" District Order, 1908, No. 35, by Colonel J. Stanley, Commanding,"" issued only a few days before my question was put, and in paragraph 5 of which the following statement appears1. It is notified, for information of all con-' cerned, that His Excellency the Governor General of the Commonwealth will hold a levee at Commonwealth Government House on Friday, n t h inst., at 12 noon. 2. Commanding Officers will arrange to form up officers under their command in order of seniority, and the officers of each unit will pass His Excellency in order of precedence of corps, vide Kegulations I'art II . , paragraph 6. The District Head-Quarters staff will precede followed by the Field Force staff, the P.P. fortress staff, and Brigade staffs in that order. And so on. Under this order a junior officer of the Permanent Forces would take precedence over a senior officer of the Militia Forces-ove r men who were in manv cases senior to the District Commandant himself, and it caused a great amount of offence amongst the militia and volunteers. The honorprecedence mere humbug? The point we have to consider is whether the information suppliea to this House in answer to a question put by rae was true or false. wrong about the order? were made it was decidedly wrong. wrong with the procedure? The' permanent staff passed the Governor General in a bunch, and the. officers of each corps followed in their order.' wrong about that, but if the answer supplied to my question was false we have good cause for complaint. On another occasion I asked the Minister, as reported at page 435 of Hansard for the present session, whether a circular had not been issued by which a right enjoyed by men under the regulations, to complain in writing to the final military authority, had not been varied. I quoted a circular issued by the chief staff officer, refusing to permit warrant, non-commissioned officers, and privates to minute papers, and I inquired, "" Is this practice still continued in the Department.""

May I point out to the Minister that even the English system with which there was general satisfaction when the Defence Bill of 1904 was brought in, and of which our system is a far too slavish copy, is breaking down. Writing on the 16th August, 1907, the military correspondent of The Times saysThere is thus much which appears to cause the new command to be regarded as one of doubtful wisdom, and we have to seek the real motive and excuse for the creation of the new appointment in other considerations. The Duke of Connaught was appointed Inspector-General of the Forces on ist May, 1904, and his duties were regulated by an Order in Council a few days later. In a higher military sense the appointment has not given the results expected. His Royal Highness has not been invariably well treated. Nor has our Inspector-General. He has not been kept sufficiently in touch with the proceedings of the War Office. His' reports, reputed to be of much value, have not seen the light and the public has no knowledge whether the recommendations which have followed his inspections have or have not been carried out. There has been little or no visible influence upon the organization and administration of the Army arising from his inspections and reports. One Minister, no longer in office, went so far as to suggest that the Duke should alter one of his reports. The presence of the Inspector-General, of the Chief of the General Staff, and of the General Officer Commandingin-Chief at Aldershot at the Essex manoeuvres in 1904 led to such confusion of authority that we have been practically unable to hold great Manoeuvres ever since. It is clear that, when a new Inspector-General is appointed, his duties must be revised and his sphere of influence be more accurately delimitated. Here we come at once into a region of conflicting opinions upon the higher governance of the Army. The Secretary of State's colleagues of the Army Council should be the first chiefs of the Army; they should combine authority with patronage and power, and delegate inspection to one of their own members. An Inspector-General with a seat on the Council would strengthen this governing body and would There is to be one speak and act in its name. There is evidence that in England the system that we followed is-already producing results which show how unsatisfactory it The chief of staff-agains t is. Our conditions are widely different from those of England, but because it adopted a Council of Defence, we followed its example without having the same conditions or the same ability to draw upon. The late Minister of Defence experienced the same trouble. Shortly before he left office, he expressed his opinion on the systems existing in the Department. With reference to the Ordnance DepartmentHe expressed considerable annoyance at the tardy manner in which his instructions have been attended to respecting the local construction of 36 ammunition waggons for the new i8Â£-pounder field artillery guns. He 'remarked, '"" We have a sample waggon here, and I pointed out some modifications that could be made, and ordered the work to be proceeded with as soon as possible, but apparently nothing has been done. I must find out what is responsible for this delay."" I do not know whether the present Minister has found that out. Colonel FOXTON -When did Senator Playford make that statement? tor Playford about four or five days before he left office-a t any rate, at-a time when he was able to speak freely. NowI desire to draw the attention of the House to the condition of the Ordnance Department, and to the way in which a quantity of work which could be 'done in Australia is given to England. I would like to see a Committee of the House on the control; status, and pay of the members of the Ordnance Department.

144,Mr Crouch,"It was made by Senadefence work at Newport received 2s. 6d. per day from the Defence Department in addition to his railway pay for supervising defence work. Yet all this work was supervised hy the Defence Department's own officer, the I.O.M., whose salary is ^540. * 8g8 machinery to n I ) the extent of about Â£700 was purchased and placed in the Victorian Ordnance Stores in order to do all departmental work, but even then, and even now, it is continued at Newport, whereas if the Department were to do its own work, all cost for"" supervision, use of tools, &c, could easily have been avoided, by engaging one or two extra men by the Defence Department. The only extra cost would then have been their wages. One list of work, that of alterations to sights, cost Â£577, while an outside contractor, Mr Galopin, offered to do it for Â£160. As a matter of fact, Newport people did not want the work, and they suited their own convenience with reference to charges. StateGovernment charges more for the work than it is worth? half times as much as the price at which it was tendered for by an outside conrractor. matter before, but shall have the case looked into. The instruction is that the requirements of the Department, both for the present and for years ahead, must be met here, so far as that can be donp. The following English orders could easily have been made in Australia at a merely nominal advance pn English pricesControl gear, breech mechanism, 9.2, cost .Â£1,000. Automatic sights, S-inch breech conversion, Chase-hooping 6-inch guns, 9.2 inches, 8 inches, and 6 inches; spare breech blocks, conversion of eighteen 12 pr. guns, cost about .Â£8,000. Stores, comprising fuze-keys, tube extractors, Federation. magazine hammers, chisels, & c , &c. Manufacture of shell. Manufacture of eighteen pr. gun carriages. Here, in Sydney, a number of 6-inch guns have been converted into quick-firers, and all were sent to England to be done, while a similar gun for Tasmania was converted into a Q.F. at Newport, another proof that this class of work is well within our capabilities with a little addition to our present equipment. The engineering work for the Defence Department is at present suffering through being so much decentralized, and that which we are doing in Sydney is nearly all on guns which have been condemned as obsolete by the Defence Committee and the Military Board. There is work now being done at Newport for Western Australia and Queensland. If all Defence work could be centralized in a proper establishment where the manufacture of small arms ammunition could be carried on, also the manufacture of stores, heavy gun ammunition, gun carriages and all other gear required by the Department, not only would there be a great saving possible, but there would also be a great gain to the Department in having its own officers gaining experience in that direction. The Defence workshops have been criticised by a retiring officer as an expensive luxury, but when the Newport accounts, and the English orders are taken into consideration, this so-called expensive luxury could easily be converted into a commercial and active industry, giving more than value for any outlay incurred. It would be hard to break down opposition, as there are people in the Department whose interests are best served by orders going abroad. I see from the press that Armstrong's representative in Australia is a Col. Stanley. I don't know if that is our ColStanley, but, if so, how can we expect' to manufacture our own material when such men are representatives of English firms? It would be interesting to know if there are other firms, such as Vickers, Maxim, & c , with"" representatives in Australia. One point with reference to the conversion of the Tasmanian gun may be worth mentioning, and that is, that the extra remuneration given for supervision to the fitter in chargeof the work was Â£ 3 6 . This amount could have been saved had the work been done in the Defence Department's own workshop. If we are having done in England work which could be done in Australia, we are making a great mistake. I am also informed that the carpentering and engineer-ing branches of the Ordnance Department are largely employed upon private work for officials. For instance, it is stated that I shall not give the. names mentioned in my informant's letter as to which, if the Minister refers the matter to a Committee they can test its truth carefullyA got a Colt's gun overhauled. He brought this from South Africa. He seems to have disposed of it to Sir Rupert Clarke. A man, named Henderson, was engaged on this for several days.

The honourable and learned member for Angas, addressing a farmers' league in South Australia, is reported to have s a i d He was no alarmist, as he said before, but they must recognise the awakening of the East; and while strengthening local defences, think of their obligations to the Imperial Fleet. With Japan alert and vicious and armed, the control of the' Pacific to be yet asserted; China, answering the call of the West to test its latent strength; India made restless by the weakening of traditional faiths, and the fertilization of' the native mind with Western thoughts and ideals, there were possibilities that might make a deep draught upon their undoubted reserves of strength. If the East ever became the centre of conflict and power, it would be for them, who represented the Northern races in strange seas, the civilization of Europe^ some 12,000 miles from its source, with the spirit and devotion of their forefathers, to guard the sacred fire. I have also been supplied with a paragraph from Sir Tollemache Sinclair's work, Russia and Japan, in which the writer says that, during the negotiations with reference conference and the scheme embodied in the to the Japanese treatyOur British Government sent one of their best soldiers to visit Japan, and after a considerable stay there, and a thorough inspection of their military system, he made a repon, of which a copy was given to the War Office in London, in which it was stated that the tropical portion of Australia was considered by Japan as her natural heritage, and that in every school the [13 OCT., 1908.] Bill. 104c soldiers from their earliest enlistment were educated to' view this position as their inevitable possession, and that all were taught the neces-' sary military methods to acquire it, if ever an I am very glad to hear occasion arose.

I feel that the attempt by America to exclude the Chinese is largely paralleled by our own efforts in that direction.

A German pastor who recently returned from England has declared his conviction that if Germany desires peace she will have to build ships, and there is not the slightest doubt that if Australia desires peace she must prepare for war.

Samson-who , in order to injure his enemies, pulled down a temple, but in so doing destroyed himself. The honourable member for Flinders should heed that warning. To those honourable members who vote against this measure and who thereby attempt to prevent the initiation of a national system of defence, the people of Australia will yet have much to say. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.43] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has occupied the attention of the House for a considerable period, but even those who, like myself, are unable to arrive at his conclusions, will admit that he has given the House a considerable amount of information which cannot fail to be of value in the further discussion of this Bill. I do not propose to follow the honourable member in his excursions into the domain of administration by the Military Board. Colonel FOXTON -It is somewhat foreign to the discussion of a Bill of this kind; but it would be most useful if indulged in when the Estimates of the Department were under consideration. Before dealing with the Bill itself, I propose to refer to one or two matters mentioned by the honorable member-matter s of which I have the Field Artillery-wit h which I have been connected for nearly forty years-ha s been proved to be the weak spot in our defence system. With that statement. I shall deal when I come to speak of the existing Defence Force. I shall then give reasons why that branch of the service is weak, and I shall suggest what I conceive to be the remedy for that weakness. I regard the charge of misfeasance which the honourable member has made in connection with the I regret the amendOrdnance Department as a most serious one. Several Honorable MEMBERS -Hear, hear. upon it. Colonel FOXTON -It is only right that the fact should be recorded that honourable members regard that' charge as a really serious one. ber for Corio has said too much or too little. Colonel FOXTON -Quite so. The man upon whose authority the statement was made is either telling the truth or he is a gross libeller. If he is employed in the workshops and has supplied false information, he ought to be summarily dealt with. If , on the other hand, his statements are true, the officers who have privately benefited by making unjustifiable use of the Ordnance workshops ought to be severely dealt with. In the interests of the public service and of the Defence Force, the matter ought not to be allowed tp rest where it is. knows that, about three years ago, it was proved that an officer had misappropriated a large quantity of coal belonging to his men. But what was done in that instance?' The offender was merely removed to Sydney, where he has since been treated with the greatest leniency and consideration. Colonel FOXTON I do not see that that circumstance affects this question at all. I oould quote instances of a similar character which have occurred in Queensland.

But, roundly speaking, the system was practically the same throughout Australia, having been arrived at through experience by the various Governments and Parliaments as the one best adapted to the conditions of life in this continent. That meant the development of what has since been called the militia from the old volunteer forces. The fusion of tlie States commands took place immediately after Federation, and then came the present Defence Act, based, as were also the Defence Acts of nearly all the Colonies, upon the Act passed in Queensland in 1884, at the instance of Sir Samuel Griffith, with the assistance of Sir George French, who was then Commandant. That was the first occasion, so far as I know, upon which,' in any British comniunity, the principle of compulsory service, as we have hitherto understood it, was.passed into law. Happily it has not been necessary so far to put that law into force, and, I believe, it never will be. I allude, of course, to the sections of the various Defence Acts, and of the present Commonwealth Act, which make every adult male between certain ages, in case of danger of wa.r, compellable to serve his country in the ranks. Most thoughtful men agree with that, although there are exceptions, such as those referred to by-the honourable member for Corio, who have addressed honourable members by circular, urging that they have conscientious scruples against bearing arms. We know that certain religious bodies have such scruples, but, can shoot well he is just as good whether excepting them, and excepting, also, thorough "" wasters "" I do not wish it to be understood that I am classing those religious bodies with the "" wasters,"" by whom I mean certain people who are utterly careless of these matters, and who would shirk any responsibility for the defence of their country if they could, quite irrespective of conscientious scruples -mos t thoughtful men will agree with the axiom laid down by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, that every able-bodied man in the community should be compellable, in case of emergency, to assist in the defence of his country. sent Act. Colonel FOXTON -Yes. Of course, it may be said tiiat both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have gone a good deal further, but a man cannot actually join in the defence of his country unless there is an attack upon it, so that, after all, they are stating nothing more than"" what appears in the present Defence Act. The next axiom which I think most people accept-a t all events, those do who accept the first-is that it is necessary to train the adult male population, or, at all events, to see that they have been sufficiently trained, before they reach manhood, to enable them to bear their part in the defence of the country when called upon, in such a way as not to go into the ranks as the merest raw recruits. dreds of thousands of them will have to go into the ranks without tuition in case of emergency. Colonel FOXTON -Of course that would be so under the present Act also in the event of war or invasion. I shall show later on that a. very large proportion of the present adult male population would be in exactly the same fix. so five or six years hence, if this Bill were passed. Colonel FOXTON -They cannot all be killed off in five or six years. possible to train the whole population of Australia at once. Colonel FOXTON -As the Minister said, the man behind the gun is useless without training. Many men, and I believe many members, think thati f a man he has had military training and been taught his company drill as if he has not. That is an absolute fallacy. Such men would be a mere horde. They must be organized. They must understand their duties in the field, and be able to carry out intelligently the orders they may receive. missioned and non-commissioned officers. Colonel FOXTON -Quite so. The whole force must be a complete military machine or organization based on what has been found to be best by the experience of centuries.

Theoretically, the best way to obtain the most effective results would be to make every man a soldier. That would afford the best means of defence for any country, but it cannot be done. ' more than a decade elapses before armaRespe'ct must be had for our industries. The business of the country must be carried on, and so most nations have solved the difficulty by establishing standing armies of paid soldiers. The Prime MinisterI cannot lay my hands on his exact wordslaid down the principle that it was undesirable that a certain selected set of men should be paid for doing work-that of defending the country-in which everybody should share. The Minister of Defence, elaborating that argument, spoke of only 20,000 men in the Defence Forces, doing the work of 800,000. going training."" Colonel FOXTON -I s it necessary that the 800,000 should be all trained? If it came to a question of actual warfare they could not all be put into the field. Every able-bodied man in the community cannot be made a soldier. make as many of them soldiers as the Boers did. They took the bulk of their men. Colonel FOXTON -The Boers in the field did not amount to anything like 800,000. When it comes to actual fighting, admitting that we cannot put our whole population into the field, we must adopt the principle of paying certain men; for I do not suppose that any one wants a soldier to fight for the defence of his country without being paid. So that it is merely a question of degree-of the extent to which any community is willing to make sacrifices for the purpose of having a portion of its male population specially trained for defence purposes. orable member select the men? Colonel FOXTON -In my opinion the voluntary system will answer, supplemented 'by certain early military training. If we train every man in the community in the manner in which it is proposed under this Bill that men shall be trained, we shall undoubtedly have a very large number of men away from their civil occupations, whilst, in my opinion, a sufficient amount -of training can be secured without such sacrifices. It is generally accepted as a principle that preparations for war should be governed by the reasonable probabilities of the immediate future rather than by remoter possibilities. That is especially true in regard to armaments. Not much ments in any branch of the service become obsolete. Every ten years or thereabouts, we get a new pattern of gun, and a new drill. The same remaork is also true to a very large extent, in regard to personnel; because, although we cannot train our men sufficiently in a short time, still a few years' training is quite sufficient to enable a number of men to become very useful soldiers. The Bill before us deals both with naval and military matters. The salient feature of it is compulsory service. A little later on I shall draw a comparison between the designation ""universal training "" given to the system proposed in this Bill, and ""compulsory service."" The Minister of Defence has described the relative cost of the scheme under -which we now work, and that which it is proposed shall become the law. I cannot imagine how so large a number of men as it is proposed to train, can be have to trained for the outlay indicated by the Minister. Of course, I have no means of checking his figures. It must be purely a matter of speculation from my point of view. But the question of cost is not confined to the actual outlay by the Treasury. We have also to add the value of the labour of the men who are to be taken away from their civil avocations to attend camps for three weeks in each year. Even if they were paid 17s. 6d. per week each, to arrive at the cost to the country, we have to add to that amount the sum which they would have earned had not their services been required for military training. have been plaving football. in Australia that is not closed for about a month every vear. Colonel FOXTON -But can the honourable gentleman guarantee that the training will take place at the particular time when the factories a.re closed ? Easter and Christmas time, when nearly all factories are closed. Colonel FOXTON -We must take into consideration some factors of considerable importance which have not been sufficiently dwelt upon.

213,Mr Mauger,"It can take place atgeographical position. Every one knows that the insular position of Great Britain has been the greatest protection she has had against attack in the past, and it will be so in the future. We are much more insulated than Great Britain is. It would be far more difficult to conduct an oversea invasion of Australia than of Great Britain, owing to the enormous distance that would have to be traversed by the attacking power, and the extensive line of communications that would have to be kept up. It also has to be remembered that we are an integral part of a great naval Empire. It seems to me to be inconceivable that during this generation or the next there should be the slightest fear of an invasion of Australia. fence at all? Colonel FOXTON I do not advocate that. T should like to quote from the report of the Committee of Imperial Defence upon a scheme of defence for Australiapage 5In considering this subject, it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between hasty raids dependent for success on surprise and rapidity of execution rather than on the number of troops employed, and larger operations aiming at a prolonged or permanent occupation of Australian territory. rial Defence postulate four cruisers and 1,000 men j but I direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that there is such a thing as national existence. Colonel .FOXTON I will come to that point. The report goes onThe oversea conveyance from a distant base of operations of a military expedition if strong enough for the latter purpose, and its continued supply with munitions of war when landed, would only be possible to a power which was mistress or the seas, and was able to destroy or mask all the hostile ships that might at any time be in a position to interrupt the communications of the expeditionary force. The attacking power would have to be absolute mistress of the seas. As long as our connection with ""Great Britain lasts, and we remain under her segis, we can rely upon it that so long as she had ships which could roam the seas they would intercept the line of communications of any invader. So long as Great Britain maintained the command of the seas, no power would have the temerity to attack us. Britain failed to retain that command? Colonel FOXTON -If t h British Navy e were wiped off the face of the earth-because that is what it comes toI do not know what would Happen. But so long as there are British ships to intercept a line of communications, no armed occupation could be maintained. No such expedition has ever been carried to a successful conclusion unless this condition has been fulfilled, and some of the greatest military disasters recorded in history have resulted from failure to secure or retain the assured sea command which is essential for the prosecution of an oversea campaign. I will go so far as to say that if the Boers had had a fleet which the British Navy had failed to wipe off the seas, we could never have carried on the campaign in South Africa, because we could not have relied upon supplies coming forward. The campaign would have had to be abandoned. It is not necessary that the protecting squadron should be in any way commensurate with the invaders' naval force as regards strength or numbers; but as long as the protecting power has ships on the sea which are at liberty to intercept the line of communications, any continuance of an occupation of Australia would be impossible. If the Empire were engaged in war with a European Power, or with two Powers, what should we have to provide for? Assuming for the sake of argument that, instead of the British Fleet having blocked up the fleets of the hostile powers, the latter had overcome and rendered the strength of the British Navy to such an extent inoperative that they were able to make an invasion, still, if Britain could keep ships afloat, and at liberty to roam the seas, the enemy's lines of communication would unquestionably be disturbed and interfered with, and, as I said before, a continuance of the invasion would be impossible. Can any one conceive it possible that during this generation or the next, no matter what advance may be made by other European powers in naval construction-eve n though Great Britain were to be utterly outbuilt-the British Navy will get so far behind, relatively speaking, as not to be in the position I have described? fence of Australia rest on Great Britain? Colonel FOXTON I am not saying that it should. And the converse of what I have indicated holds good. A hostile power may, notwithstanding the present enormous preponderance of the British Fleet, still be able to avoid the British cruisers, and to make raids on our shores;",31,Defence Bill Second Reading

No nation would dare to risk it. suggest for one moment that we should depend entirely on the British Fleet for our defence. Colonel FOXTON I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has ever borne arms? Colonel FOXTON I have done so for a great many years, thus giving, at all events, an indication of my personal feeling that it is desirable for Australia to be in a position to take part, not only in her own defence, but in the defence of the Empire. We are aware that no Australian militiaman, or, for the matter of that, no member of the permanent forces, is compelled to serve outside Australia; but, in the event of Great Britain being involved in war, and there being any necessity for such a step, I am quite sure the manhood of Australia would flock in tens of thousands, as they have done before, for voluntary service of the Empire elsewhere. take to train an average Australian bushman, and make him a good soldier? Colonel FOXTON A very much shorter time than would be necessary in the case of almost any other man on the face of the earth. to make competent officers ? Colonel FOXTON A good deal depends on the man; and I am afraid that the Minister has unwittingly touched the weakest spot in his Bill. period longer. Colonel FOXTON -Are officers to be taken away from their vocations for a longer period than three weeks at a time in each year? to ask the Minister for a good deal of information on points of that kind. There is another factor we have to consider in connection with the training of Australians a factor already touched on in the interjection of the honourable member for Barker-and that is their natural aptitude for military exercises. I have never met an oflicer or non-commissioned officer brought from the Old Country for instructional purposes in Australia, but \vho has said-and I have made a. point of asking questions on the subject-that he was astonished at the facility with which Australians appeared to grasp instructions. I do not -Whatever the reason may be I cannot say -it may be that it is a superior education, or the freer life-bu t in my experience the testimony is unanimous that in six weeks, or not much more, an average Australian can be trained to as great an efficiency as would require twelve months in the case of an ordinary English recruit. AN Honorable MEMBER -Australian s are more resourceful than the average Englishman. Colonel FOXTON -There may be something in that, but, whatever the explanation may be, the fact remains. To revert for one moment to the British Fleet, I desire to point out that, although there has been a redistribution, which has been commented on by the Minister of Defence, and also by the honourable member for West Sydney, as indicating a weakness on. the part of the Admiralty, the leading members of both the great political parties in Great Britain have declared, and continue to declare-and Mr Winston Churchill reiterated only two days agothat the British Government are determined to maintain the two-power standard. And, in my opinion, it is no indication of any weakening of the naval strength of Great Britain that the fleet has been concentrated in the North Sea and the neighbourhood of the English Channel; the movement is for strategical purposes, and with a view to increased strength for the purpose of striking. The only two naval powers in the Pacific at this moment worth considering, from*the British point of view, are Japan and the United States, one of which is our close ally, and the other, though, perhaps, not actually an ally, is on the most friendly terms with Great Eritain. I am afraid I shall have Colonel FOXTON A âyounger brother, if he is big. According to the policy which has been laid down by all great commanders, fleets are for the purpose of ""wiping out"" or ""bottling u p "" the enemy's ships in order, for the one reason, if none other, that our own transports shall have free access to the enemy's shores. Where can the naval strength, of which Great Britain could possibly have reason to take notice, be said to lie at the present time? Is it not in the North Sea and European waters?

Colonel FOXTON -That was not the only place until the conclusion of the treaty It might be difficult for the Mother Counwith Japan and the crippling of the Chinese fleet. Formerly there was a powerf u l Chinese fleet, and a Russian squadron at Vladivostock, and we were not on the best of terms with Russia; but now it may be said,rfor all practical purposes, that there are only two great naval powers in the Pacific, with each of which Great Britain is on the most friendly terms. tain is concentrating her naval forces! Colonel FOXTON -Naturally , not as I conceive, for the purpose of merely protecting Great Britain from invasion, but for the purpose of striking early and crushmember wish to know? ing blows at the fleets of possible enemies. NowI come to a question, which is undoubtedly somewhat delicate, but which T do not propose to shirk. I have already -said that I cannot conceive that, during this or the next generation, we shall be in any danger of invasion. So far as one, humanly speaking, can see into the future, our connection with the Mother Country will certainly last that period, and we shall have the benefit of the protection of the British Fleet, or, as it may become known later, the fleet of the Empire. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that we in Australia have decided on -a policy which may, and, in my opinion, not improbably will, raise one of the most.difficult questions which the British Empire hqs yet to face-the great race question. We have declared that we shall 'have a White Australia-that we shall have no Asiatics here-and there is no probability of our abandoning that policy. other hand, Great Britain has teeming millions of subjects in India, and alliances Believing, as I do, in compulsory training and friendly relations with other great Asiatic nations; and we have already had an instance in South Africa of the delicate nature of the negotiations undertaken in connection with the coolie question. Whatever the future may have for us, it seems v to me that there might be an endeavour on the part of, let us say China, for the sake of argument-no t next year., in the next ten years, or even the next forty years, but possiblylater-assumin g that that nation wakes in the sense that Japan has awakened, to force its way into Australia in exactly the same way as Great Britain forced its way into China ih the past. Therein lies the necessity for our taking strong measures for the defence of this country. try to recognise and give complete effect to our desire in regard to such a matter. One cannot possibly foretell what might happen. We can only imagine the possibilities, and it is the possibilities, even though they may be very remote, with which we have to deal, or to make provision for. Coming to the B ill , let me say that the Prime Minister in December mentioned that the details of the Government scheme when it appeared would be f u l ly made known to honourable members. Has that prediction been fulfilled? I think not. Colonel FOXTON I wish to know a great many things. 1 wish to know what the regulations are going to be. So far as I can see, the honourable member for Corio has very aptly said that this Bill may be regarded as a blank cheque to be given by Parliament, to be filled in according to the sweet will of the Government. I am disposed to regard the Bill as a framework on which to hang a uniform. There is a great paucity of detail in the measure, and if the honourable gentleman who introduced it will permit me to say so, there was paucity of detail in the speech in which he mo'ved the second reading. Colonel FOXTON I know it was, but it was mostly "" hifalutin."" Believing, as I do, in compulsory training within certain limits On the Colonel FOXTON I propose to tell the honourable gentleman before I sit down. within reasonable limits, 1 am disappointed with the lack of detail in this B ill .

Colonel FOXTON I shall deal with that when I come to consider the position of the existing Military Forces. I think that the Minister ought to have hesitated before he attempted to say that our present forces are confined to 12,000 men. Colonel FOXTON -O r to 15,000 men. But the honourable gentleman's interjection has anticipated what I propose to say.. Corio ridiculed the condition of the present forces. Colonel FOXTON -No, the honourable member attacked only the administation. That has nothing to do with this Bill, for the same administration might be continued under this measure. If this Bill is intended to provide for service, it is undoubtedly compulsory service, and why not say so? Why should the Government shy at the words "" compulsory service"" and, by speaking of "" universal training,"" seek refuge in something which bears very much the appearance of a subterfuge? I have shown that the training proposed would not be universal. I should have added that all bad charr.cters are to be exempted. Under the proposed new section 58J, a man would only have to prove that he had been convicted of any disgraceful or infamous crime not be allowed in the British Army. Colonel FOXTON -What is a disgraceful or infamous crime? A man need only show that he is a bad character to' be exempt from training under this Bill. The training proposed is not universal; but it is compulsory, and we have it now from the Minister of Defence that it is also intended that, it shall be service. There are only two important points in which what is proposed differs from the compulsory service of the Swiss nation. ' First of all it is not intended to pay our men, whereas the Swiss do pay their men. They do not call it pay. It amounts to 7^d. per day. Colonel FOXTON -Sevenpenc e three farthings, as a matter of fact. First of all, the Swiss are paid, and in the second No, nation in which all the place the Swiss service is very much more irksome and a greater tax upon the individual than that proposed in, this Bill. Those are the two main points on which the systems differ, and, 'after all, it is only a difference in degree The service in each case is practically the same, the only difference being that in Switzerland the men are now called out for sixty-eight davs a year, whereas here it is proposed that they shall be called out for eighteen days per annum. In all other respects the BillI said 15,000. provides for compulsory service. service of the Continent. Colonel FOXTON -Certainly not; but it. is only a difference in degree. Why should not this scheme be described as one for compulsory service? Why have not the Government so described it? Is it for political reasons? Is it because the Government do not care to face the country with a scheme described in those words? ter? Compulsory service is mentioned in the Bill. Colonel FOXTON -The Bill. provides for what is described as "" universal training,"" and on the authority of the Minister, who states that this organization will be a going concern, I say that compulsory service is what is aimed at. Let us see if this' organization would be sufficient for the purpose for which it is intended. What about the officers? And here we find a weak point in the Bill.

Colonel FOXTON -But, as the honourable member for Corio has most justly pointed out, it is constant intercourse between an officer and his men that makes a corps.

One is naturally inclined to cast his memory back to the dissensions and the difficulties which arose out of disagreements between the General Officer Commanding and the Minister. a Defence force, whether it be naval or military, must be under the absolute control of a Minister responsible to Parliament. It required a great deal of tact on the part of the various Commandants as they were called in those days, and probably also on the General Officer Commanding, who preceded the institution of the Board, i i order to avoid-thoug h in some instances they did not avoid-conflict s with theic Ministers.

As an officer in command of a battery, I felt that the responsibility was thrown upon me of avoiding the danger to life which was caused by the very unsuitable horses provided under the hire system. I wrote very strongly upon the matter, with the result that the Queensland Government purchased a number of suitable horses. They cost, I think, from Â£ 8 0 0 to ,Â£1,000.

That is so much time lost, and militates against the training of the men. and over again a request has been made that a different system should be adopted, and that the horses for the field batteries should be purchased, at all events in some of the States. possible for me to say where the fault lies, but the fact remains that a recommendation to this effect has been made and has not been carried out. Defence is aware also of a disability applying to the Field Artillery in Queensland on account of the lack of an artillery range, at which the annual practice and instructional and competitive practices can take place. For two years the Queensland batteries fired no shell whatever. It can scarcely be expected that satisfactory results can be obtained under such circumstances. A proposal has been under consideration for many years for the acquirement of a range on Crown lands on the north coast line, at no very great distance from Brisbane. ported on very favourably, and the land has been reserved from alienation by the State Government.

The honourable member for Corio has mentioned the omission of the word ""garrison,"" from clause 4 of the Bill, which leads one to believe that it is the intention of the Government to have permanent field batteries. That is not a policy which has hitherto been favoured by the Defence Department. So far as I am aware, none of the expert authorities have recommended that there should be a permanent Field Artillery. of training by means of cadres. Colonel FOXTON If that is all that Over is intended, I have no objection; but if the Government launch out into the establishment of a permanent Field Artillery they will involve the Commonwealth in an expense which they can scarcely realize. faced, even if it is expensive. Colonel FOXTON W it h an additional period of training, which is to be provided, The Minister of I understand, this year-the period being twenty-eight days, instead of sixteen days, as has hitherto been the case-prope r horsing of the batteries, and suitable ranges, I feel confident that the Field Artillery will be all that could be desired. The Minister of Defence has told us that one-third-of our militia forces are recruits. Now the period of service is only three years. I do not know what he means by a ""recruit,"" but I assume he speaks of ' .tbose who have done one year's service or less. But when we remember that the period of service is The scheme has been reonly three years, and that in the ordinary process one-third of the men retire every year, it will be seen that we are constantly augmenting the number of ' men in the country who have undergone some amount of training. to Australia. Colonel FOXTON -Exactly; and that I heard recently that an is where I take exception to the Minister's figures when he alleges that we have only 15,000 men upon whom we can rely. I recollect that when I commenced to enrol Having regard to the men in a field battery under the Queensland Act of 1884, after the lapse of about five years, the numbering on the roll had risen from oneI myself as commanding officei being the first one-to about 350. I should say that from 80 to 90 per cent, of the men who had passed out of the ranks during a period of about six years It can also be acwere trained men. Most of those men were thoroughly well trained and, in case of emergency, would be available. Scarcely any additional training would be required to make them efficient again. sands of men of that kind"" are there in Australia ?

So that it is a mistake to say or argue that .those who attend camps are the only men -who can be relied upon for the defence of Australia. fallacious argument. Colonel FOXTON I think the Minister mentioned that about 80 per cent, of -the men in the ranks attend camp. The remaining percentage is largely made up -of men who are probably thoroughly efficient, but who are absent through illness -01 through being engaged on some distant employment, or who for some other reason are unable to attend a particular camp. They lose their efficiency for the year, but that does not say that they become inefficients. It must not be assumed that they are inefficient because they are technically non-efficient. They may actually -be the most efficient men in the corps. their training. Colonel FOXTON -They have not <3one the whole of their training for the vear, but probably they have attended drills and parades throughout the year, and for several previous years, being unable to attend camp through some incident which they might regard as a misfortune. I venture to say that a considerable percentage of those who fail to attend camp can be classed in that category. member think that a considerable number of men drift in and out of the regiments, ancl are of the casual sort? . Colonel FOXTON -There may be many of that class. Some men go th/ough .a part of the recruit course, and then drop out, perhaps, because they do not like the training as much as they thought they would. But I desire to emphasize the fact that the statement that we have only 15,000 practically efficient men in the Commonwealth is altogether misleading. I should rather place the number of trained men at 100,000. has no justification for that estimate. He has no figures. Colonel FOXTON -Unfortunately , I have not. I do not know that it would be possible to obtain official figures which would be reliable. To obtain them would involve turning to the records of the States for the last fifteen or twenty years or more. Only in that way could we obtain a record of the services of the men who have been passed out of the various corps of the Commonwealth, and who have become thoroughly efficient during their period of service. With a little extra training these men would be brought right up to date. men whom we train for three years, and who drop out at the rate of one-third every year; that is only 5,000 a yeara very small proportion of the population of Australia. Colonel FOXTON -If 5,000 trained men drop out every year, the number very soon mounts up. In ten years 50,000 men will have passed through the ranks. will have changed several times. There' have been three complete changes within the last decade. Colonel FOXTON Tactics have changed, but company drill and battery drill remain very much the same. Besides, within a week, a man who has been through the ranks can be made as efficient as ever he was. A few drills will put him right. He will be quick to draw comparisons, and probably will recognise the improvements which have been made. The honourable and learned member for Corio knows that scores of movements-a t all events, it is so in field artillery drill-hav e been abandoned as useless, everything being now in the direction of simplification. The Minister said that it will not be possible to largely increase the strength of the militia if provision is made for it on the Estimates; but if certain changes, which, I think could be made with advantage, are adopted, it will not be difficult* to increase, and, possibly, double the present force. We could certainly maintain as many as it is desirable that we should have under arms, having regard to our needs or surroundings, and the possibilities of the immediate future.

Colonel FOXTON -No. At present, if a man does not go to the annual camp, he can, by attending extra drills at other times during the year, earn the camp pay of eight days; but if attendance at camp is to be a. crucial test of his technical efficiency, camp pay should be ear-marked, so as not to be earned in any other way than by attendance at camp. efficient if he has not attended the annual is the result of a resolution passed by this continuous training. acted that if a man does not attend the been discussed here.

Then there is Â£ 8 for a mess uniform, which is optional. He need not get dress boots-JQI unless he likes. There is a great coat at Â£ 4 ios. All he has to do is to have his next great coat of a particular pattern. article, whether worn for military purposes or. otherwise. and if he wears it with His plain clothes he is guilty of an offence. Colonel FOXTON -Many do so, nevertheless. The same remark applies to the waterproof cape; while full dress, Â£ 9 15s., is also optional. Those amounts deducted from Â£ 3 9 16s. 6d. leave the reasonable sum of ^13 us. 6d. which also includes Â£ 4 for a sword. I gave only Â£ 2 5s. for my sword.

Colonel FOXTON I know many young fellows who join in that way, and' their uniform costs them nothing outside their actual pay. They get it gradually, and their first outlay is not more than Â£ 1 2 or Â£ 1 3 . The Minister appeared, in many of his remarks to have given himself a brief to belittle and disparage the present forces. 1 admit that he did say that the country owed much to the members of the present forces. He praised them, sometimes almost to an excessive degree, but he marred it all by many of his references to the inIt is a very serviceable efficiency of the forces and their paucity of numbers. Colonel FOXTON I do not agree with the honourable member. He may be l^erfectly correct as regards the official figures put before him as to the number of men who are technically efficient for a given year, but to say that all those who are non-efficient are inefficient is . incorrect.

He saidHonorable members who had an opportunity not know that there was anything mere of seeing the gorgeous spectacles on the occasion bearing on the subjectof the visit of the American Fleet, must have been struck by the view of decent, respectable, inoffensive gentlemen, appearing arrayed like escapees from the Mahdi's harem. It is astounding to me that men should desire to get into such uniforms. I can understand men in China, in times gone by, assuming great masks in order to frighten the enemy, or gorgeous costumes being resorted to by savages, or the rain-makers of A f r i c a ; but I cannot conceive that any rewith ? spectable, middle-aged man, who has lost his waist, can desire any such costume. .T do not know whether the reporting staff have been kind to the honourable member by omitting from his speech something whicli was still .more offensive, or whether he 1 himself, feeling that he had overstepped the bounds of good taste, expunged it from the report; but, as a matter of actual fact, he went so far as to say that in doing so officers were ""making asses of themselves."" member appreciate a little humour now and then ? Colonel FOXTON The honourable member again anticipates me. The honourable member for Flinders said he had been unable to find much information in the Minister's speech, but that he had found that the Minister had been humorous. If that was the humour referred to by the honourable member for Flinders, it is very -simple and easy to be humorous at the expense of individuals who have not the right -of reply, and to hold them up to ridicule. the system. The individuals do not come in. Colonel FOXTON -The public can judge what the honourable member intended from his own words. the officers under his administration. Colonel FOXTON -That is so. Every honourable member must, of course, decide for himself the degree of good taste that he will employ in any speech he makes in this House, because, provided that he does not transgress the Standing Orders, he is distinctly within his rights in holding outside people up to ridicule. In that respect, the Minister was entirely within his rights. Colonel FOXTON -Certainly .

I . have seen some of his colleagues displaying their figures in that garb, and two of them at least had lost their waists, to use the graphic language of the honourable imember. Had he them in his mind's eye when he referred to escapees from Mahdis' harems? The honourable member told us that the only calling in the world that required no training was that of critic. that. It was said a long while ago. Colonel FOXTON member repeated it the other night. I thought he might have added politicians; but, at all events, it seems that critics, like poets, are born and not made. The only consolation I can give those men, who very naturally take exception to the reference to them and their uniforms, is that the Minister of Defence, as critic, was "" born that way,"" and cannot help it . to the end of the clothes question, any how ! Colonel FOXTON -The Minister is, undoubtedly, a very eminent critic of clothes, but I hope that, when he deals with the question again, he will not use language of the kind. I have already said that I am in favour of compulsory training within reasonable limits, and the Minister very naturally asks what I conceive those (limits to be. Having regard to the intelligence and special aptitude which the Australian youth has for military exercises, I -suggest that his training as a cadet should -commence, say, at the age of twelve, though the exact age is not very material, and continue day by day and week by week until the age of sixteen. Then he should be given three or four weeks' training annually-and we ought not to shirk the word "" compulsory"" any more than we do in connection with education in its ordinary branches-fro m sixteen to seventeen, and from seventeen to eighteen, f o l lowing as nearly as possible the idea which permeates the B ill .

Colonel FOXTON -Yes; and my belief is that under such a system there would never be any scarcity of militiamen. Doubtless a large number of the young men would regard themselves as having given enough of their time to military service, but, as I have said, a very considerable proportion would have become so imbued with' the military spirit that they would desire to continue. would the honourable member suggest?

Under such a system as I have outlined, there would always be applicants I hope we have now come waiting for enlistment, especially if , as was done in Queensland prior to Federation, there was a small amount of deferred pay due after three years' service-a n arrangement which proved a great attraction. The Department could then afford to discharge any man who did not display all the necessary qualities, or neglected his drill and general training. With a peace footing of 20,000, the Minister of Defence could, by a mere stroke of the pen, raise the number to war strength, the whole of the machinery being already provided. member suggest as war strength?

359,Mr Ewing,"Wher e would the officersColonel FOXTON -On e advantage of the scheme I am suggesting is that practically no more officers would be required than those in the militia at peace strength. The rank and file could be increased, and some additions made to the non-commissioned ranks; but, practically, the same officers would serve for the increased strength. there is required 5 or 7 per cent, of officers. Colonel FOXTON stance, if a battery of 75 were increased to a strength of 130 or 150, the same officers would suffice; and that is really, in my opinion, the true solution of the difficulty i'n regard to military organization in Australia. With such a system, we should always have an effective militia, providing it were properly equipped; and I must say that, so far as my experience in Queensland goes, the equipment at present-anc l the credit for this is largely due to the Minister-is infinitely superior to that under the control of tlie States. see that Senator Dobson has pretty muchthe same idea as I have expounded; but, apparently, he favours the continuation of the senior cadet training, under compulsory service, to the age of nineteen. 1 should retain the militia in its present, or some similar form, and recruit it, as I have said, from the youths who have been trained up to the age of eighteen. does not object to the compulsory principle ? Colonel FOXTON in accord with that principle up to a certain point; and its recommendation to me is that, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, the labour of a youth is not worth so much to himself or to the country as it is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, and, therefore, his civil avocation in life is 'not interfered with to the same extent. The extra training of one week per annum during the following five years, up to the age of twenty-six-year s in which a man may have taken on himself the burden of matrimony, and have other mouths to feed-woul d not seriously hamper his civil and industrial life. By such means there would gradually be created, in the course of fifteen or twenty years, just as the Minister desires, a reserve of partially-trained ,n?.en, who would be most valuable as recruits if it were deemed necessary to raise t.he strength. serve, as I say, though not practically recognised as such; at any rate, at the end of a generation, the whole of the male population would be trained up to a certain point, and such a force would prove extremely useful, though. years might have elapsed since the actual training. not voluntarily go into the militia be enWhatever the strength, rolled as a reserve?

An honourable member made a similar suggestion to me a little time ago, and pointed out that members of trade unions constantly apprise the secretaries of any change of address, but I reminded him that it was to the personal interests of the men to keep the officials informed, seeing that otherwise they would doubtless place themselves under some disability. If we remove all personal incentive, we shall The honourable member find the reserves to be simply reserves on paper, though I do not think it would matter much, seeing that, under the present No ; I am entirely Act, in case of war or danger of war, a man may be called upon to serve wherever he be found. penalties, just as there are for non-registration of births, deaths, and so forth?

367,Mr Crouch,"The reserve in VictoriaOne objection I have to the Bill is that referrecl to by the right honourable member for East Sydney, namely, that all youths over the age of eighteen are to be entirely exempt from the eight years' service at some age. Colonel FOXTON -If it is desirable to commence the training of the whole of the male population as soon as possible, why not make the youths of nineteen serve seven years, and the youth of twenty serve six years, and so forth? cially impossible, because it would mean 250,000 young men, between the ages of eighteen ancl twenty-six, to be trained the first year. 27,000 or 30,000 men, and whoever is in office will have a big job before him. between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. Colonel FOXTON I admit that there is something in the point raised. But those numbers in training will have to be faced in later years, and it does seem to me to be anomalous that a lad who is nineteen years of age when this Bill passes should be exempt from, the whole of the military service required. the honourable member for Adelaide says, we must begin somewhere. another objection to the Bill, which would remain, even if I were prepared to go as far f.s the Minister, or as the honourable member for West Sydney, in the matter of compulsory training. What have the public to say on this question? mously in favour of the principle. Colonel FOXTON -Are they? is against it. Colonel FOXTON I can. The Minister of Defence and the honourable member for West Sydney, who are advocates of the principle, have described it as revolutionary. so if the attempt is made to put it into practice. revolutionary, but I admit that there is plenty of work to be done before the principle can be given effect. Colonel FOXTON -Whethe r the honourable gentleman said so or not, it undoubtedly is revolutionary. It means the introduction of a principle which the Minister certainly admitted that, so far as he is aware, has never hitherto been introduced in any British community. Colonel FOXTON -As I said in opening my speech, one of the greatest principles with which the proposal would interfere is that of the liberty of the subject. It is proposed, under this Bill, to impose disabilities and onerous duties upon the individual, under very serious penalties for default, and to that extent to deprive him of his liberty. In the circumstances, I say that the Bill should not be passed until the people at a general election have been given an opportunity to express an opinion upon it. upon it. Colonel FOXTON -They have not spoken upon it any more than they have spoken upon the increase of the salaries of members. Neither of these questions was before the country at the last election.

379,Mr Mauger,"Why should not a manspeak out on such a question as the compulsory education of children up to the age of fourteen or fifteen years, how much more necessary is it that we should ask the people of Australia to speak out on this question of compulsory military service up, even in tactics, and their training has for adults before we attempt to deal finally with it? The Prime Minister, in his utterances prior to the last general election, gave no hint that it was the intention of the Government to submit a scheme for compulsory military service. The honourable member for Batman has said that thisprinciple was before the people of Australia, and I should like him to indicate in some way how and where it was put to them. I never heard it mentioned in any election address in Queensland. The electors of Batman may have spoken on this important question, but I venture to say that the people of Australia were not asked to vote upon it. If I were asked conscientiously to say whether the majority of my constituents are in favour of compulsory military trainscheme would work first, and have this as ing, such as is proposed in this Bill, I candidlv admit that I should not be able to say whether they are or are not. might safely say that they are. Colonel FOXTON -That they are in favour of this Bill? Bill, but in favour of universal training. Colonel FOXTON I believe that they would be in favour of such limited compulsory training as I have myself indicated, up to the age of eighteen. But having regard to what I consider the nonnecessity of going furtheV at the present time, I do not believe that they would say they are desirous of having compulsory military training extending from the age of eighteen up to the age of twenty-six years. it is proposed only to keep the men in touch. Colonel FOXTON -And that very ineffectively-to know where they are one week in the twelve months. ber would have nothing at all done. Colonel FOXTON I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. I say that we can do all that we require by enforcing training up to the age of eighteen years. Lads who join the militia at the age of eighteen, and who have been through cadet training, and especially those who have been officers or non-cornmissioned officersof cadets, are found to require little moretraining except, perhaps, in the technical-, branches of the service. They are well been excellent up to that point. I havein mind at the present time many young men who, joining the militia forces from the cadets, immediately took a prominent"" place in their corps, and very soon attained to commissioned or non-commissioned rank. Training up to the age of eighteen years could be made very effective indeed. I sincerely hope thai the Government scheme will be modified in the way I have indicated. Surely we can. rest where we are for the present, andadvance by steps to the ideal proposed in this Bill, with all the onerous duties and penalties it would impose on a family man if it should really be found in practice that it is necessary to go so far ? Surely we can see how a less advanced our objective for twenty-five or fifty years, hence if necessary, adopting in the meantime something which will be a step in the direction in which we desire to go, without imposing onerous burdens on the adult population? We could thus maintain amilitia numbering 15,000 or 20,000 which we could always increase to a war strength of, say, 40,000, which Major-General Hutton estimated as all that would be required for the defence of Australia in any possible circumstances. WhilstI am in favour of compulsory military service and training, though not, as I have explained, to the extent advocated by the Minister, I feel certain that if the second reading of the Bill is passed there will be very little prospect of modifying its provisions in such a way as_ to commend them to me, and I shall therefore feel bound to vote against the second reading. member approves of the principle? Colonel FOXTON I approve of the principle up to a certain point, beyond* which I do not at present think it necessary to go. There is another objection. I foresee as plainly as possible that if the Bill* gets into Committee an effort will be made to introduce into it a provision that themen serving or being trained in the proposed organization shall be paid for their services.

My suggestion is that just as we do not pay a boy while he is attending school to receive the ordinary scholastic instruction which is provided for by the State fourteen vears. Colonel FOXTON -Just so. we say it is necessary in the interests of the community that a boy should be educated up to a certain point, which is provided for by the State authorities, so Tsay it is quite competent for the Commonwealth Parliament to step in and say to the same boy when he has reached fourteen or fifteen years of age that it is necessary that fie shall receive further instruction in military training in the interests of the community at large, and he must therefore continue his compulsory education which for Commonwealth purposes is nof yet complete until he has reached the age of eighteen years. That appears to me to be a perfectly fair proposition, and obviates entirely the difficulty of paying for the services rendered. The proposal would then be one purely for training up to the age of eighteen years, and up to that age those undergoing the training would not be members of any military organization, but merely persons attending a training school to learn what would be required of them when they joined the military organization. ing in the time during which they would otherwise be loafing around the country -for generations to come, still we must recogColonel FOXTON -As the honourable member implies, the proposal would affect the time, which is the turning' point with many lads, when they become either respectable citizens or larrikins, and when a little care, discipline, drill, and attention from the Commonwealth might prevent their becoming the latter. involve no disorganization of business. Colonel FOXTON -That is of course most important. As I have said, up to the age of eighteen the work pf a lad would not be of the same value to himself or to the community as it would in later years. I should like, in conclusion, to put myself right, in case anything I may have said in my allusion to the Asiatic question and our danger from that quarter, implies that I have doubts as to the protection upon which we might rely from the Mother Country for many years to come. I hope and believe, and I suppose it is a belief shared in by every member of this House, that we have laid the foundation, if we have not already made some advance in the building up, of a great nation. We have definitely determined, as I have said,, that this nation shall be a white one.' But as somebody else to protect us?

Colonel FOXTON -Surely it is sufficient that we propose to do if.' I challenge: the Minister to show figures to the contrary.. Surely the fact that in Queensland we, in atypical corps there, passed through thebooks 350 men in six years, when thestrength was only sixtyrfive, is an indication that there are thousands of men who are. competent to step into the ranks at any moment and assist in the defence of the country. But to suggest that anything I have said implies that we desire to depend"" upon others for our protection is distinctly to misrepresent me. is no guarantee of anything better. Colonel FOXTON -A t all events, we have determined that our nation shall' be awhite one. And, although, as I believe, thedestinies of this country are bound up with those of the Mqther Country, andi will be nise the fact that in the distant future we may have to fight for the policyto which 1 I have referred, and the purity of' our race.

The leader of the Opposition has told us that we are quite safe under the British flag, that so long as we remain part of the British Empire tliere is no need to fear, and that the consideration of this question should be delayed, as there is no need to take any action. And the honourable member for Brisbane has said that he practically agrees with that statement. In the first place, I want to point out that one of the two questions before the country was that of defence. Colonel FoxroN -Of compulsory training? was before the country. Colonel FOXTON -It always is. try has met with general approval, not only throughout Australia, but throughout the world. I shall now quote my authorities for that statement. last, the Aberdeen Free Press wroteAn invasion of Australia is not a far-fetched idea. That is not the opinion of the honourable member for Brisbane or the leader of the Opposition. In March last the Pall Mall Gazette wroteAustralia is more exposed to danger than any other part of the Empire. In February last The Times wrote of the scheme in these wordsAustralia is at last set on the way to a selftold us that it is as strong to-day as ever respecting manhood. In March last the Standard wrote about this scheme as followsThey will have every reason to be proud of their National Guard.

The Times wroteI f Mr Deakin ""and his colleagues succeed in passing this great measure they will win imperishable renown, and will give the old country a lead that is badly wanted. which the honourable member has quoted is a Tory one. line with the honourable member, let me quote from certain of the Sydney newspapers of which he thinks so much. In November last the Sydney Morning Herald wroteAustralia has never fostered a desire to evade her share in the scheme of national defence, and still less is there any tendency on our part to make hard bargains with the Mother Country, and so secure cheap naval protection. We are willing, and even anxious, to do our share, and we object very strongly indeed to the charge that we in any way seek occasion to do otherwise. Such tactics on the part of well meaning people, who would like to see the naval contribution raised, have done enough mischief already, and it is time to put them aside and face the naval problem. On the 30th September the Sydney Morning Herald wroteLittle exception will be taken, we think,, to this side of the Government's proposals. Indeed, the principle of compulsory service, as now defined, will be generally acceptable. In February last the Sydney Evening News wroteBut the principle of compulsory service is a In February sound one, not only from the point of view of defence, but for many other reasons. It is democratic because it applies to all, rich ancl poor, without any distinction. I have shown that this scheme is approved in the Old World as well as in the new. I did not quote the Age or the Argus because they are Victorian newspapers, I turned to the newspapers of Sydney just to see what they thought of the present scheme. . I desire to refer now to the question of the supremacy of the British Empire. The leader of the Opposition has it has been. While I believe that that statement is correct, at the same time we have to recognise that other nations are falling into line, and that in the Old Country there are those who, like the leader of the Opposition, believe in the good old policy of free-trade. would come. separate Tariff proposals from Defence proposals; they are interwoven, so much",52,Foxton Whateve R The Gold Braid On It

In Germany the workers are f u l l y employed, but in Great Britain, under a policy which throws men out of employment, it naturally follows that a large proportion of them will not be equal to the demand made upon them in the battles of the future. The working classes of Germany are in a far better position than are those of England. Men there are being trained and educated in such a way that, according to Mr Percival Hislam, when war takes place, the German will be able to hold his own with the Britisher on land or sea.

Shortly afterwards a new Minister of War took office, and his first move was to make use of the Naval League, with the result that its membership soon increased to 250,000, and it was not long before the vote of Â£10,000,00 0 for naval purposes was agreed to.

The question was not submitted to the electors. opportunity to put before the electors the political questions which he thought important. training a plank in the platform of any party ? there are now planks which were not there a couple of years ago. Australian defence was a plank in my platform. The honourable member for Brisbane could not find any leading man of large experience in military affairs opposed to compulsory military training. tary men can the honourable member quote in favour of this scheme? for Brisbane had a good authority against compulsory military training, he should have quoted him. Colonel FOXTON rather on my own arguments than on the opinions of others. House of Commons appointed to inquire into military matters, after holding eightytwo sittings, and examining 134 witnesses, came to the conclusion that for the effective defence of Great Britain some system of compulsorily training every citizen of military age and sound physique should be adopted to prepare for emergency. Lord Roberts, who, I suppose, will be regarded as a high military authority, favours compulsory military training, and so does Lord Milner. speaking at Kensington, England, a little time ago, said, respecting the proposals of the Deakin MinistryI take the report from the United Service MagazineHe seems to think Should the proposals foreshadowed by Mr Deakin become law then Australia is bravely facing its responsibilities to itself and to the in front of the Mother Country in their manner of taking a man's part in the protection of their homes and in the endeavour to help maintain the great Empire to which we all belong, they are setting a worthy example, not only to the Mother Country, but to the whole of the That, British Empire. Let me now quote an Australian opinion. Bishop Stretch, speaking at the annual gathering of the clergymen of the Anglican diocese of Newcastle, in March last, saidWhile, then, to some it looks as though compulsory training were a hardship, to me it presents itself thus : thc community expects that in time of danger all able-bodied men will rally to their country's call, and I feel sure they would. It becomes the duty of the country to give to all men a training in arms which shall save courage from being the mere suicide of ancient Greece. It is said that gymnastics of some sort were rendered almost obligatory by the liability of every citizen to military and naval service at a moment's notice. August Bebel, the German Socialist, is quoted as saying that home defence is a duty for all who are capable of fulfilling that duty. Mark the word "" capable."" It means now a good deal. I regard it not as a duty foiced upon men, but as a training given them in anticipation of a duty which I know, and you know, they would gallantly accept, even though it spelt death. But our desire is that it should spell victory and national safety. Every one not under a physical disability should know how to ride and swim, shoot and trench, and also know some trade. I believe the training could be so planned as to do away with larrikinism, and to add to the physique of our race. It could be combined with valuable technical education and agricultural knowledge. Though we pray earnestly against war, we do not wish, if war comes, to see our manhood die for lack of knowledge. It seems to me universal training in the use of I preferred to rely arms may well be regarded by Christians as the strongest assurance that we shall not be lightly attacked. honourable member's leading military authorities ? as a Bishop and not as a leading military authority. member has quoted only one authority who is in favour of "" some "" scheme of military training.

One authority has stated that no less a sum my attitude towards the amendment of the than Â£100,000,000 might have been saved in connection with that war. of the leading authorities in connection with the South African war. What is the objection to compulsory military training? So far as I have been able to gather, the people who are under that system to-day are amongst the best citizens in the world. Harold Cox, the Secretary of the Cobden Club, of whom the deputy leader of the Opposition knows so much the gentleman. ber has read of him. Upon his return from a visit to Switzerland some little time ago Mr Cox spoke most favourably of the military system in operation there. of Other principles of which the honourable member does not approve. accept him as an authority, but upon others I do not. Cox say? moment I cannot find the exact quotation to which I alluded. But Mr Cox makes one statement concerning the compulsorymilitary system with which I do not agree. He adopts an attitude somewhat similar to that of the leader of the Oppositiona sort of '' Yes-no '' attitude. He affirms that it is the duty of every man to render a fair day's work for a fair day's wage, and that it is the duty of every citizen to pay the taxes legally imposed upon him. But he adds that if its citizens do that, no nation need Have any apprehension as to its future, quite irrespective of whether or not those citizens can handle a rifle. Upon that point I disagree with him. As a humble member of this House, and as one who took an active part in excluding foreign goods from the Commonwealth with a view to providing employment to the artisans within our borders, I have felt it my duty to emphasize the desirableness of erecting a fence around Australia, Â»o that our people may be permitted to dwell in happiness and security. to offer a few observations upon this important question, and I shall at once define honourable member for Flinders, which has my cordial support, and reads thusThat all words after the word "" T h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words"" in the opinion of this House, the defence of Australia depending primarily upon control of the sea, it would be unwise to commit* the country to any scheme of compulsory universal military service until Parliament is in a position to determine the naval policy of the Commonwealth."" going to follow his leader? good and wise one, surely I am to be commended for so doing. By universal consent the Navy is our first line of defence. Under the Government scheme, and according to the figures quoted originally by the Prime Minister and repeated by the Minister of Defence, the proposal is to spend Â£260,000 on naval defence' as against Â£1,545,000 on military defence. If the Navy is our first line of defence, obviously there is a striking contrast between the amounts which it is proposed to allot to the two branches of the service.

In adopting a scheme of defence we must be more than careful that we shall accomplish something more satisfactory than has obtained in the past. The primary object, of course, is not the training of young men-althoug h that is an important secondary consideration-bu t is to secure that measure of defence which will give us a sense of security and safety against any foe that is likely to attack us. It is laid down among the obligations of the British Empire towards us that the British Fleet guarantees Australia against invasion in force, and against attacks by any considerable squadron of armoured vessels; that, in the third place, the exigenhim. cies of war may require the withdrawal of the Australian Imperial Squadron, while, fourthly, Australia cannot be guaranteed against attack by unarmoured commerce raiders up to four in number but the loss they would inflict would not be of more than secondary importance. Consequently, according to the statement of fact thus put before us by the official Year-Book, weliave simply to prepare ourselves against attack by unarmoured commerce raiders up to four in number. I discover in the Prime Minister's speech some fallacies, which appear on the face of them to be obvious. saidWe Each young man will be called upon to spend an average of sixteen days per year, not in drill rooms or on parade grounds, but in local camps. Later, he said What we must and do trust to are not titles and rewards, but voluntas service freely given, covered by the honourable member for Flin a patriotic discharge of a duty to his country, That appears to be a contradiction of what the honourable gentleman first said. He speaks of a compulsory universal training and in the next breath says that the Government trust to a voluntary service freely given. I find it difficult to reconcile those two statements. How can a service be compulsory and voluntary at the same time? children to school freely, patriotically, and question is whether men who have possibly cheerfully, under a compulsory education wives and young families dependent upon system ? both compulsory and voluntary, the age of are earning 8s., 9s., or 10s. a day, and miracles is not past. The Prime Minister, compelled to serve their country in this way dealing with another most important aspect of the case, saidI shall come to that The proposals of the Government w ill, it is calculated, give an establishment of at least 83,000 always in training, supplemented each year by 30,000 men, an equal number passing into the reserve. In the eighth year this will mean over 200,000 men available. How are those 200,000 men who are to be available for service to be maintained at anything like the sum which the Prime Minister mentioned ? He went on to saythatThe total cost of this is estimated at less than ^250,000 more than is at present expended. I give the Prime Minister credit for not having made this mistake himself. He was misled by the figures placed before Had he been furnished with the correct figures he would have shown that that would be accomplished, not for Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 more than we pay at present, but for something like Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 or Â£ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 more.

That mistake was not made. all to be properly equipped, for the Prime Minister says further that they will be availablewith f u l l provision for arms, ammunition, and He equipment for field artillery and cavalry, organized for service within the Commonwealth.

It would be impracticable, because too expensive, to mobilize them and drill them even in the ineffective manner proposed. One of the difficulties surrounding this matter is suggested in the speech, of the Prime Minister. He said that the British Admiralty were not satisfied with the contribution made for the upkeep of the British Navy, and that a section of our people were not satisfied with the bargain from our side. That remark applied to the Naval Agreement of 1902. The"" Prime Minister's statement was correct in one respect. tory, inasmuch as the evidence contained in the report of the Colonial Conference shows that the Admiralty expected a larger contribution from us than they were getting under the previous Naval Agreement. It was, however, ultimately settled that the payment by Australia should be Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. The Prime Minister having submitted that aspect of the case, the question arises whether the measures which have been outlined by the Government embody such proposals as are likely to be more satisfactory to the British naval authorities and to the British people themselves than were the conditions previously existing. We naturally assume that as the Cabinet contains such a large amount of wisdom, its members have carefully considered ihis matter in the drafting of a B ill which is to be submitted to Parliament for the express purpose of giving a larger measure of satisfaction to the The honourable naval authorities in Great Britain, and also to the people in Australia. The Prime Minister in his speech went on to say that I f men are compelled It was intimated in the clearest terms that so far as the British Parliament is concerned it would make no further demands of any kind upon us in connection with the Imperial Naval defence. The statement of the Prime Minister, SirH . Campbell-Bannerman, that naval defence ana foreign affairs must go together, was made at If those 83,000 men were the opening of the Imperial Conference in April last. That axiom exactly summed up the eifect of the debate in the Commons. But what were the facts leading up to that determination? When that statement JOHN FORREST -Thos e who want was made the Prime Minister had intimated that the people of Australia were not satisfied to continue the payment of the subsidy of Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. I should like to know what authority the Prime Minister had for making such a statement. I believe that the Australian people were proud to make the contribution. It was not so much as we felt we were entitled to pay, but it was something respectable in proportion to what other portions of the Empire were contributing. We have to remember in this connection, that if Great Britain is to continue to maintain a two-power standard navy, it is absolutely essential that the various parts of the Empire should come together and assist the British people to carry the great burden of expenditure which such a policy involves. I venture to say that the proposals which have now been made to this The agreement was not satisfacHouse will not be more satisfactory to the British people or to the naval authorities. The Prime Minister sought to justify his position in these wordsAt the very outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Minister of Great Britain met us with a frank avowal that the British Government preferred no claim for money in relation to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together. If honourable members appreciate the force of that .axiom, they wil l see that it implies much both now and in the future. It implies that, for the present, seeing that we",58,Foxton No Not Early Empire In Showing Their Willingness To Be

I wonder what will lae the feelings of the foreign gentleman -wh o presides over the destinies of the Melbourne Age when he sees what we are going to get ini the way of a navy. foreign gentleman who presumes to sit in judgment on Britishers day after day. The policy outlined in the Prime Minister's speech does not purport to give us a navy, but merely improved harbour defence. A great many people in VictoriaI do not know so much about the other Stateshave been carried to the seventh heaven of enthusiasm by the expectation that we are going to form the nucleus of a navy. But is it practicable to establish even the nucleus of a fleet? What are the feelings of the people likely to be when it is discovered that, not a fleet, but only an improvement in harbour defence is to be accomplished? As to compulsory service, I venture to say that, when it comes practically before the people, and it is known that the young men throughout the land are to be compelled to serve until twentysix years of age, there will be such a revulsion of feeling that the present Government, if in power, will have very short shrift. I may be right or I may be wrong in my conjecture, but that is the opinion I hold as to the reception that will be given overlooks the fact that what he refers to to the measure when the people rightly grasp has been in operation for some time. its meaning and import. The policy, if carried out, will mean enormous exthe honourable member what is the view of pansion and increased taxation, so that it will be almost impossible to pay old-age pensions. And besides, it seeks to bring about a condition of things which has never yet been successfully adopted by British-speaking people. I have already dealt with the question of pay in the military service; but there is a most important proposal in the speech of the Prime Minister having reference to the pay to be given to those who enter the naval service. The Prime Minister saidThe wages for a complement of thirty-three men at naval rates, including a colonial allowance of 3s. a day, but without victualling, would amount to ^4,500. The question is whether we can adopt a different rate of pay from that in the The Melbourne Age has British Navy, and still carry out the project which the Prime Minister placed before us. That is really a most important question; and the honourable gentleman pointed out that a small navy is bound to be a failureI have not the exact words before me-that in the British. Navy the men are transferred from ship to ship, and serve under different conditions, so as to get a thorough grasp and knowledge of tbe work generally. In our small navy, we could not do that, and consequently it is absolutely necessary for the perfection of the training of our naval forces that our men shall be from time to time transferred from the ships of our fleet to those of the Imperial Navy, there to r&jeive a measure of training which we could not give them ourselves. We will suppose that for their services in our fleet they are receiving Australian rates of pay, and that it is something in excess of what they would get in the Imperial Navy. Honourable members will admit that there is likely to be some grumbling on their part if , when transferred to .the Imperial Navy, they are asked to accept less than they receive while in our service. On the other hand, if it is proposed that they should continue to receive the Australian rate of pay while serving with the Imperial Navy, what is likely to be the feeling of British sailors when they know that men infinitely inferior to themselves in naval training are receiving for the same work a higher rate of pay?",60,Foxton No Not Early Empire In Showing Their Willingness To Be

I am merely stating what the position is.

It is clear that he pay. That must be obvious, and I am gave the matter no consideration when he backed up in the opinion I have expressed propounded his question. We cannot possibly by what I have read from what may be hope to exchange with the British Navy, regarded as the latest and final despatch if we are going to adopt a higher rale of of the Admiralty authorities, that it is impossible to give our men transfened to the ships of the Imperial Navy a higher rate of pay than that prevailing in the Imperial Navy. orable member has read the Prime MinisPrime Minister told uster's speech clearly. He did not say that the transfer would be an obligation, but an expenditure of ^250,000 a year, a force tomerely that it would be of advantage. misrepresented what the Prime Minister said. I certainly have no desire to do so. I now have the quotation I desired to make, and I give honourable members the exact words used by the Prime Minister. He saidI have grown more and more deeply to realize siderable increase the risks of our attempting to create a small force solely of our own, in which the men and officers would have no hope for experience or ter. advancement except within its bounds.

The consequence is that the Royal Navy is a most progressive weapon, always up to date, and its men constantly in practice. That is the Prime Minister's statement, and if it does not involve an opinion that the proposed transfer is a necessity, I r k aot understand the English language. obligation. It merely suggests that the transfer would be of advantage. The Prime member venture to say that we can afford suggestion of the kind. pay.

Then the despatch contains some very carefully thought out instructions indicating how far the control of the Admiralty is likely to extend. Instead of our having a force which we shall be absolutely free to do what we like with, and which will be absolutely under our own control, we find that it will be subject to a good -many directions which the Lords of the Admiralty lay down as essential in order to secure that oneness which is necessary, because, as the sea is one, and tlie Empire one, the Fleet should be one, and under command of one authority. distance beyond our territorial waters, they are to be immediately placed under the command of the senior naval officer upon the station. So much for our own control. It may be true that the present system of defence is not as effective as we could wish it to be, but I venture to say that it is not carried out to the best advantage. It is certain that, for lack of funds, men who were willing to enroll themselves in our militia, have not been enrolled. There has been in the past an evident dread of incurring any increased expenditure to make our Military Forces efficient. That is one of the reasons for their inefficiency, but when the inefficiency is discovered, we have people who say, ""Let us burst up the whole thing, and go in for an entirely new arrangement,"" although the new arrangement proposed will cost us four or five times what the existing system is costing.. Are people prepared to face tliat position? I come now to another consideration, When, under this Bill, we have taken our men in hand, and drilled them for the prescribed number of days, are we then likely to have a very efficient force? They will scarcely become a consolidated whole, as we are not likely to import the rifles and ammunition necessary to thoroughly equip an army of 200,000 men. What would be the use of the men without proper equipment? in that respect the scheme is likely to fail. But is it necessary, from an Australian point of view, that we should attempt to do anything like that which is proposed in this Bill? I am thoroughly in accord with those who say that we should be in a position to Mr Palmer. defend ourselves; but as Great Britain guarantees to defend us' from an attack in force, all that we have to dread is a raid tempt to land here a> comparatively small body of men. To meet such an emergency what we need is not a huge, unwieldy army of partially trained men, but a few men so thoroughly drilled that if necessary they could take up the role of instructors and drill the additional troops required for our defence. We all remember how rapidly the men whom we sent to South Africa were brought under discipline. True, thatdiscipline was not perfect; no one imagines that the members of our contingents were drilled like Tommy Atkins. The training to which they were subjected was very imperfect, but the verdict of the officers in charge of the Australian contingents If our ships venture'out a certain in South Africa was that they were a most useful body of men, and useful, more particularly because they had not been over drilled, but had been educated to take the initiative to an extent that made them a most valuable arm of the service in the Boer war. If there is to be an attack in force upon our shores, the class of warfare will be somewhat similar to that which took place in South Africa. The tactics that were so successfully adopted by our men there will be followed here, and in such an emergency I have confidence that our men will prove their worth. I have very great faith in the bravery of Australians, and believe that with comparatively little drilling they would be ablebecause of that initiative which has become characteristic of Australians-to play a worthy part in driving back any force that might escape the lynx eyes of the Imperial Navy, which is our first line of defence. I hope that the amendment will be carried, for, to my mind, it suggests the right mode of procedure. Realizing that the Imperial Navy constitutes our first line of defence, let us consider, first of all, what expenditure will be necessary to enable us to support it. Having determined what that expenditure is likely to be-and I venture to say that it will be considerably more than even the .Lords of the Admiralty It is obvious that have laid down-w e shall have some idea of what we can afford to spend on the military side. In that matter, the Government have not left us entirely without a lead. In 1906 the Prime Minister said that an expenditure of Â£1,650,000 per annum was altogether beyond our means. We now have before us a scheme which, at his own low estimate -a n estimate which common sense rebels against as being inadequate-mean s an expenditure, not of Â£1,650,000, but of Â£1,740,000 in the first year, and in the third year, of Â£1,800,000. If the Prime Minister was on sound ground when he said that we could not possibly face an expenditure of Â£1,650,000 per annum, what justification can there be for a proposal to expend Â£1,800,000 in the third year of the operation of this scheme? To what extent is that expenditure likely to increase when in the eighth year the number of men available will have gone up to 200,000? That is a conundrum which cannot be mathematically worked out, but it is worth consideration. If the people only ponder oyer it they vill obtain some indication of the taxation they are likely to be called upon to bear' in order to carry out a scheme which, in the first place, is unnecessary, and, in the second, is likely to lie ineffective and inequitable in its operation.
