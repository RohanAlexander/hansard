I remind the honourable member he should remember that during the whole period I was going on to point out how it is apparent of the Fraser Government the top tax rate stood from the Minister's second reading speech that at 60c. We brought that down to 49c. What is we are targeting that money at people who do more important to this debate is that the bottom need it. I was picking up the point made by the tax rate during the Liberal years was 30c. As we honourable member for Bradfield, who raised are talking about people on low incomes, I rethe point of order. I noted when he was speaking mind the House that the bottom tax rate is now that he referred to higher taxes. I am responding 24c. It is all right for the honourable member to him, yet now he takes a point of order. I am for Bradfield to lecture this Government about telling him why there are higher taxes and why how we should go about eradicating poverty. we are getting more taxes now. This Government has done more than the preI have listened to members of the Opposition vious Government ever did in all areas of social on a number of occasions. They talk about Aussecurity, as well as in industrial policy and taxtralia as a high taxing country. In actual fact, it ation reform, to bring about improvements. Inis not true.
