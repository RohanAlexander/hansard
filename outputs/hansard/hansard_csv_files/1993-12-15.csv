The road transport industry doing it with the cooperation and support in has established a reputation for being very principle from· each of the states. It is also innovative in reducing costs.

That gives state ministers a buyer's decision from one country to anthe comfort and confidence to proceed with other. Yet the net result of this government's this type of legislation. decision in its budget of August of this year In talking about introducing this legislation was to push up the cost of road transport in in their own states, state ministers will know Australia, therefore reduce our ability to be full well that, in the process of adopting competitive in the live cattle export market. national uniform laws in the road transport Not only has the government put up the industry, they will have the ability and authcost of fuel excise but it has also put up the ority to make exemptions that are specific to cost of sales tax. The effect of that is to add their state to deal with their particular state's about $2,400 to the cost of purchasing a problems. But this is an area of microtruck. So each year road transport operators economic reform.

But this increasing the fuel excises and sales taxes that government since it came into power just on were brought down in the budget. 11 years ago has raised fuel excises from 6c We support the bill because it benefits the a litre to 31 c a litre for un leaded and diesel industry.

In fact, I have not met transport, particularly road transport, as an a truck operator who thinks that they are not opportunity to get more money for its coffers. anything else _but that. Despite that huge increase in taxes over the Fuel excises are a rip-off because the past few years, road transport is still competigovernment is not contributing more funds to tive against rail, shipping and aviation.
