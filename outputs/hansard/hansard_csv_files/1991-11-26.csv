As has already It is also interesting to note, in the light of the been indicated in the debate in this House, the reported comments of Senator Tate, the origin of this Bi111ies in the 1988 report of comments of Mr Peter Gordon, a solicitor the Australian Law Reform Commission representing sufferers of medically acquired entitied Grouped Proceedings in the Federal AIDS, that this legislation would not assist Court.

In the draft explanatory memorandum set out in the Law Reform Commission's report No. On the other hand, one can read this Bill as 46 of 1988, the Commission indicated that saying that because there is no direct proposed section 31 (1) would relieve the reference to costs in the Bill, and because the group members from liability to pay the costs court is able to order costs against the losing on the part of any other party and impose that party, in fact a court could order costs against liability on the principal applicant.
