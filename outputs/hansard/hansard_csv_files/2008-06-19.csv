During the last election campaign, the Rudd-Swan government 20 times led the Australian people to believe that it would be able to address the rising cost of petrol and groceries. Yet six months into the term all of these things have risen in cost. The government continues to tout promise after promise, yet the delivery time appears to wax and wane and, indeed, appears to be optional. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, looking at the CPI during the December and March quarters, food rose by 2.1 per cent, housing costs rose by 1.9 per cent, health increased by four per cent and education costs increased by 5.2 per cent in the first six months of the Rudd-Swan government. All of these increases add to the pressure of balancing the family budget at home. Combined with that, consumer sentiment since November, when the government was elected, is at its lowest since 1992, when Australia was plunged into a banana republic situation by then Prime Minister Keating with a recession that apparently we ‘had to have’. We have a budget that has just been brought down that has included $19 billion in new taxes and, looking forward to the next four years, has increased expenditure by $15 billion over what the previous government had. The Rudd-Swan government touts an inflation-fighting budget by reducing expenditure, yet, looking through to the next four years in what are called the forward estimates, the opposite is the case. Fuelwatch is being brought in as a stunt to try to convince the Australian people that the government is doing something about watching fuel, when in fact all it is doing is watching the price go higher and higher. Four of the significant economic government departments all warned against it. The Minister for Resources and Energy warned his colleagues against it, and yet still the government persists with this charade. ABC Learning has indicated that it will put up its childcare fees by a staggering 10 per cent, which will consume all of the 30 per cent to 50 per cent increase in the rebate for childcare centres. The Deputy Prime Minister stood in the House and said that she will ‘watch’ what childcare providers are doing. We need this government to do more than just watchheaven forbid, we actually need them to act. Mr Michael Walsh Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.33 am)-On 17 May I joined a group of junior cyclists from the Parramatta Cycling Club and rode from Parramatta down to Liverpool to meet up with 16year-old Michael Walsh. While we had been riding down from Parramatta, which is about 50 kilometres, Michael had ridden from Melbourne over the preceding six days to raise money for cancer research as part of the Relay for Life. When we joined Michael at the beginning of the M7 he had 50 kilometres to go back to the Castle Hill Showground, and I have to say that MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Notices Tinian Israeli Conflict In Terms Of Regional

After six days on the bike on his own, he was not going to let any of us lead him into the Castle Hill Showground. The event was all Michael’s idea, an extraordinary undertaking for a 16-year-old. It was his idea. He put together the team that made it happen. He enlisted the support of the school at Castle Hill and Excelsior Public and both helped to raise money. In fact when he rode into Castle Hill, the students from Castle Hill High School as an act of support had all dyed their hair red to match Michael’s. It was a great greeting from the crowd at Castle Hill Showground. Denlo Subaru sponsored the Relay for Life and donated a Subaru Forester for Michael’s parents, Jenny and Terry, to use as a support vehicle. I was lucky to be invited. I was riding around Parramatta Park one morning and met Michael. He knew I had done the ride from Melbourne to Sydney a couple of months earlier, also raising money for medical research, so he invited me to do the last 50 kilometres. It was an absolute pleasure to support such an extraordinary young man in what was a phenomenal undertaking-for the information of people who do not ride bicycles, it is about 150 kilometres a day, each day, on his own. It is much, much harder to do it on your own than it is to do it in a bunch. But even more than the feat of doing it is for a 16-year-old to come up with that idea and to actually make it happen. He rode out of Melbourne and through Albury, Wagga Wagga, Wollongong and Goulburn on that 900-kilometre route. He stopped at schools and community groups all the way who supported him and made donations to the cause. It was quite a phenomenal undertaking. I also know he went out and cycled 100 kilometres the next day so that he would not miss the opportunity to have done 1,000 kilometres in a seven-day period. Once again, a great job by Michael: not just the ride but also the idea and making it happen. I also congratulate his parents, who spent probably quite a nerve-racking six days following Michael along some fairly rough highways. Herbert Electorate: St Anthony’s School government to know and I want the Australian people to know that I support the students at St Anthony’s school at Deeragun who care for other students. Last week I received 82 individual contributions from the students, and they were very thoughtful contributions indeed. They are coloured in as a mechanism to ensure that the students made their point: that they care. They care about child poverty; they care about child health; they care about the millennium goals that the world has set, to be delivered by 2015. I particularly want to thank Sophie Lulham from 3D at St Anthony’s school, who made a very colourful contribution, and Thomas Boscacci from 3DMrs Hickey’s class-for his contribution. It certainly touched me and I want to say to St Anthony’s school: you have my full support and I believe that you will have the support of all of the members of the Australian parliament. There are eight UN Millennium Development Goals, but the school is particularly interested in millennium goal No. 4, which is to reduce child mortality. Not only do we have to think about that across the world; we also have to think about it in our own country. We have to think about what all of us can do to improve the lot of children as they face the world of the future. To St Anthony’s school: thank you for sending me this particular certificate.

Around 250,000 young people are expected to attend, making it the largest youth event in the world and even bigger than the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The week-long event will be attended by Pope Benedict XVI and provides an opportunity for Catholics from Australia and around the globe to celebrate with others and learn about their faith. As well as the pilgrims, the event will involve more than 8,000 volunteers, 2,000 clergy and 500 cardinals and bishops. There will be a lot of robes on show. The event combines creative outlets like music, visual arts, debates and forums, theatre and street performances. World Youth Day is also supported by official ambassadors, like Matthew Hayden, Jarred Crouch, Jimmy Little and many others. The event was established by Pope John Paul II in 1986 as a way to reach out to the next generation of Catholics, to demonstrate confidence in them and to rejuvenate the church. I want to say how impressed I am that so many young people from Australia and all around the world have put up their hands to attend. These are people who want to learn more about their faith and explore ways to serve their church and, more importantly, to serve their community. Australian society is much better for the existence of the Catholic Church. In fact, I shudder to think what life would be like without the Catholic Church. For starters, I do not think my mum would have had 10 children. What would it be like without the great Catholic contribution to education, without the Catholic efforts to support the homeless and the indigent, without the great Catholic commitment to hospitals and to health and aged-care programs throughout our community, and obviously without priests and other counsellors who offer hope and support to millions throughout the world? People of faith can and do make a positive difference to Australian society. I hope that, as the thousands of young people get together to learn and be inspired by World Youth Day in Sydney, they will then return to their schools, their places of work and their communities and also make a difference. I particularly want to recognise four young people from my local parish, St Brendan’s, Moorooka, who will attend World Youth Day-Phoebe Fitzpatrick and three brothers of refugee background who came to Australia from Ethiopia some years ago. They are Bay, Yimesret and Metasebia Gebrewald. All four young people are active members of my local church and are eager to make the world a better place. I especially thank the Southern Deanery for their fundraising efforts in supporting the attendance of these terrific young people at World Youth Day. There will be many events in the community, including the greeting of the pilgrims at the international airport on Thursday, 10 July; the Heart of the City event in the middle of the city on Saturday, 12 July; and masses on Sunday, 13 July. I am sure it is going to be a wonderful time. MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Statements By Members
181,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (9.39 Am),"In just 26 days, thousands of young people willWorld Youth Day Fishing Industry member for Moreton on his contribution. I think it is wonderful that His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI is visiting Australia. It would be tremendous if the government would have a special Friday sitting of the parliament whereby His Holiness could be present and members of the Australian parliament would be able to recognise this very important figure. I am sure the government would have no quarrel from the opposition were such a Friday sitting to be instituted. Having said that, I do intend today to talk about a very important industry to the Sunshine Coast and to Australia generally, and that is the prawn fishing industry, which currently fears it may be forced to close down by Christmas as a result of several factors, the main ones being the rising cost of fuel and competition from cheaper imported products. The total import of fish products, including prawns, into Australia topped $1 billion for the first time in 2005-06. Crustacean imports, consisting mainly of prawns, made up $256 million of that. Thailand and New Zealand dominate the import market for edible fisheries product, but increasingly there has been importation from China and other parts of Asia. We believe that the Australian product is the very best product. But, because of the difference in price between the Australian product and the imported product, increasing numbers of Australians are buying the imported product, causing a situation where our local industry is threatened. It is no surprise, of course, with the rising price of groceries in Australia that consumers are indeed endeavouring to save money in any way they can, even if that means buying inferior prawns or other seafood products. The pressures on the local industry are a major concern for prawn fisheries in my electorate on the Sunshine Coast. Many families depend on the prawning industry. They have been feeling the pressure for some time, and now the increasing price of fuel, which is getting to astronomical heights and has experienced what can only be described as ridiculous price hikes in recent times, has added to what could be a final nail in the coffin. Other issues the industry says it has been facing over years are the destruction of natural waterways that are an important link in the breeding chain of prawns; the closure of parts of the fisheries north of Fraser Island; and the relocation of vessels affected by the closure to other ports, thereby increasing demand on existing fisheries. Last week I spoke to Sunshine Coast representatives of the industry. They advised me that they are concerned about losing their homes and their livelihoods, and there have even been thoughts of suicide. The government needs to look at the situation of the prawn industry. I ask that the government look with favour on the plight of these Australians who make such a wonderful contribution to our economy. (Time expired) Liquified Petroleum Gas Vehicle Scheme ticularly in relation to my electorate of Forde. I have talked on a number of occasions about the diverse nature of my electorate-the high-density urban areas in the north and the rural holdings to the south-and how difficult it is for people to move around the electorate, given that our road infrastructure is fairly poor.

183,Mr Raguse (Forde) (9.45 Am),"I rise today to talk about the LPG Vehicle Scheme, parwithin the electorate of Forde, but there is poor road connectivity-and public transport, of course, is almost non-existent. So it probably comes down to more of an issue of mobility. While I have been advocating for a better plan for public transport, we know now that the effect of global oil prices is getting to the stage where people are finding it very, very difficult, particularly in electorates like mine and the many other large electorates across the country, where there are large distances to travel and there is a lack of public transport. WhatI have decided to do, certainly in my electorate, is to further promote this scheme, which gives rebates to people who want their vehicles to run on LPG. There is a $2,000 rebate for conversions of new or existing petrol vehicles and a $1,000 rebate for new vehicles that are built to run on LPG. A conversion will cost people around $2½ thousand to $3,000. So the $2,000 rebate does go a long way towards it but there is a certain amount of money that needs to be provided. But the average trip within my electorate is long-it can take an hour or an hour and a quarter to drive across the electorate. And, as I said, there is a lack of public transport. SoI encourage conversion to LPG, certainly as a short-term measure, although we know, when we look at the fuel industry and at alternative fuels, that we need to put in place a longer term plan. But essentially this will give some people relief right now. The daily news is about the high prices of fuel being experienced in capital cities, and that is not a good thing, but in electorates like Forde, where people are absolutely dependent on their cars-quite often, in a family, two cars-it is very serious. The cost of these conversions becomes more viable when you look at the average distances that are travelled within my electorate. Probably within three to six months people will recoup the difference between the rebate and the cost of the conversion to gas. I am encouraging people in my electorate to look at this as an alternative, certainly as a short-term measure. Consequently we will be running out a number of public displays that the LPG industry are going to provide to us to give good information and allow people to look at the financial considerations of making such a conversion. This is an initiative that the government has supported and I am very much supporting it, certainly for the people of Forde. I encourage people to look at this as a financial option for them. Your Water Your Say for water recycling from the Gunnamatta outfall. At present 150 billion litres of waste water is discharged off our coast every year. That is 340 to 350 million litres every day. I have said that recycling should be the priority ahead of desalination. There may be a place for desalination-there are examples around Australia-but in Victoria we need to clean up our coast, recycle that water and end that waste first. Against that background, it is deeply concerning that what we have seen in relation to the opponents of the desalination plant near Wonthaggi, at Kilcunda, is a ruthless attempt to suppress their capacity to maintain their opposition. In particular I refer to the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has pursued Your Water Your Say, a local community group, for costs through the courts. This group is now facing bankruptcy. Reports are that they are likely to face costs of $200,000 or more for putting up a challenge through the EPBC Act or the relevant federal environment act and taking that through the courts and that they have now had an award of costs against them. This is a group which had one solicitor on its side, against a barrage of QCs, juniors and solicitors paid for by the government. The government had an award of costs for every dollar MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Statements By Members
184,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (9.48 Am),"I have previously spoken about the priority in Victoriaand has sought to reclaim every dollar. This is a David and Goliath battle where Goliath has wheeled out the club and is threatening to bankrupt ordinary citizens-who had the right to express their views, who had the right to take this matter through the courts, who have been treated with utter disdain and who now face the prospect of collective and potentially individual financial ruin. This is not the way we do things in Australia in relation to honest protest. It is a dangerous precedent. It is one which is extreme in its measures. It is unfair. It is unjust. It is an attempt not just to defeat people-the government has the right to challenge and to represent its views-but to bring protesters to their knees and to do so in a way which destroys their livelihoods and puts at risk their capacity to maintain and protect their families. I call on the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to show some sense, reverse this position and release the call for costs. (Time expired) Shortland Electorate: Northlakes Public School Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.51 am)-On 20 May I visited Northlakes Public School to spend some time with the young people involved in the Active After-school Communities program. I would like to say that this is an outstanding program. It provides primary school students with a chance to take part in a free, structured physical activity program. It is a very important program because at the moment we have an obesity epidemic within Australia, and making sure that children become active when they are younger is one way of combating this. BeforeI go into the details I would like to thank the principal, Greg Simmonds, for his involvement in the program and I would particularly like to thank Scott Elkovich, because he is the coordinator who arranged for me to visit the school. Scott is particularly committed to this program, to physical activity and to young people. The program supervisors, Melanie Fairman and Daniel McDonald, were also at the school. I would have to say that their commitment was obvious and the way they related to the children and the interaction that was taking place there had to be seen to be believed. The young people were involved in a number of physical activities. They were activities that were improving their gross motor coordination. They were activities that were improving their cardiovascular fitness. The one thing that was really interesting about it was that they were having a lot of fun. BeforeI watched them in their activities I spoke to the young people and I asked them, ‘What is so good about this program?’ The first thing they said was that it was fun. Then they said, ‘You exercise and get fit,’ which I thought showed a lot of insight from these young people. They also said they related differently to the teachers because the teachers were fun to be with when they were involved in the program. They were a number of the issues identified by the young people as being important about the program. It is also an opportunity to change the national culture that has developed over recent years with young people watching too much television and spending a lot of time playing video games. I would like to encourage principals in all schools to make the commitment that Greg Simmonds of Northlakes Public School has and to become involved in this program, because it is a wonderful program which has benefits for the school and benefits for the students. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Western Australian Gas Explosion land, off the north-west coast of WA. Operated by Apache Energy, Varanus Island is an oil-, condensateand gas-processing hub and generates 30 per cent of WA’s domestic gas supply. The Varanus gas explosion is having dramatic social and economic consequences in Western Australia. Apache Energy says that it will be two months before gas supplies are partly resumed at its Varanus Island gas plant, and it could be six months until full recovery is made. The WA CCI has estimated that 14 per cent of 83 companies it surveyed recently may halt operations because of the energy squeeze. The member for Forrest informs me that it will affect the majority of businesses in her electorate. This one pipeline rupture has created a crisis, with large, medium and small businesses being forced to either secure alternative energy supplies or close their doors for the interim and stand down staff and contractors. On Tuesday, 17 June WA Premier Alan Carpenter appeared on local television channels to soften Western Australians up to the possibility of power restrictions and urged everyone to cut their power consumption. However, WA businesses are furious over the daily lottery of power rations. Businesses are being told as late as 6 pm whether to expect power the next day. Some are being forced to close their operations on days when they are not allocated power and are being forced to stand down staff. As Robert Taylor said in the West Australian on Wednesday, 18 June: No government wants a regimen of cold showers and lights out in an election year but at what point do jobs and livelihoods become the priority? The Carpenter government’s favourite media outlet, the West Australian, is also now applying pressure on the Premier to reveal what really happened on Varanus Island to cause this explosion. You see, three weeks after the explosion occurred, Western Australians are still in the dark on what caused it, although one may speculate that this is because a lapse of judgement by the state government played a part. Industry speculation about the cause is rife and we all eagerly await the real facts. What we need now is for both the state and federal governments to prove that they have the ability to apply an impromptu crisis management plan to solve the gas problem. I propose that the Commonwealth government work in conjunction with the WA state government to enact emergency legislation to force Woodside and its partners to divert some of its exports to the local market at the same price as the gas not supplied. I also put forward that, in order to prevent such future emergencies from occurring, the two onshore oil and gas fields at Woodada and Dongara, north of Perth, be set aside as gas storage for future emergencies. It is now glaringly obvious that the state government has no crisis plan in place and that WA is in dire need of strategic gas reserves. This strategy is common in Europe and in the USA, with appropriate fiscal systems set up to reward the reservoir owners. Mr Carpenter does not have the vision or the commercial sense to see this. Mr Carpenter has allowed the havoc to continue in WA industry. The tourism crunch will come this weekend, as hotels are forced to shut down due to linen shortages, while Mr Carpenter sits around and advises people to switch off their lights.

It was not the first time that I have attended this particular ball. As a matter of fact, Bernadette reliably tells me that I have been five times-with her, of course! This night, like the others, was an enormous success; on this particular night they raised $175,000 for that charity. This event, however, is only one of the activities of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation. This organisation, which was started in 2000 and which comprises many of our leading local businesspeople such as our paediatricians and our local health providers, very much runs with a business like approach to raising funds for the charity. The charity seeks, as the name implies, to develop all the necessary medical and technical support to assist the paediatric treatment of kids in Macarthur. Astonishingly, since 2004 the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation has bought over $1 million worth of medical equipment to enhance the level of health care offered to local children being treated in Campbelltown and Camden hospitals. In addition, it continues to support numerous other children’s community health programs and to conduct research and establish preventative programs for children’s health issues, specifically in Macarthur. As a result of the outstanding work of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, quite frankly the need for local parents to transport sick kids for medical treatment anywhere outside our region has been significantly lessened. This has been the fantastic contribution that this particular charity has made to the welfare of the children of the Macarthur region. The Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation is creating opportunities to enhance the quality of life of children in Macarthur, and I believe it is building a better future for everyone. This is the premier charity within our region. Like all other charities, it is supported by amazing people, and without those people it would not be anywhere near as successful. I mention Paul Sinclair, who has been a local pharmacist for the last 21 years. He is chair of the board of Kids of Macarthur and he is also chair of Myrtle Cottage, which provides care for the frail and aged, as well as providing respite care for families with dementia sufferers. Denise McGrath is the CEO of Kids of Macarthur; apart from having a very bubbly personality, her dedication and drive underpin the success of this organisation.

188,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (10.00 Am),"I am pleased to rise today to speak onCommonwealth legislation that underpins the national regime for the regulation of gas pipeline infrastructure. Specifically, the bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Act 2007, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977-the AD(JR) Act-and the Trade Practices Act 1974, or TPA, to correct the year of enactment of South Australian and Western Australian legislation from 2007 to 2008. CanI just say in regard to that that, whilst the delay in the enactment of that state legislation is disappointing, it should not be seen in any way as a lack of commitment by those states to this important reform and to energy market reform as a whole. The new legislative regime will apply to the National Gas Law and the National Gas Rules in all participating jurisdictions to create a harmonised national gas access regime. The Commonwealth and all states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, have agreed to introduce legislation known as the applications act to apply to the National Gas Law as law in their own jurisdictions. Western Australia will pass complementary legislation to give effect to the NGL. The Commonwealth applications act is the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the AEM Act. It was amended in 2007 to apply, among other things, the National Gas Law in the Commonwealth’s offshore jurisdiction through reference to the anticipated South Australian and Western Australian legislation. The South Australian lead legislation implementing the NGL, and the WA complementary legislation, will be passed in 2008 rather than 2007. The Ministerial Council on Energy has, in the main, worked cooperatively and effectively since it was established by the coalition government in 2001. There are always a number of issues to be thrashed out when bringing together ministers from different states and, on occasions, of different political persuasions. I am referring here not just to the Liberal-Labor divide or the parochialism of states and territories but, rather, to the personalities involved. Over the time that I chaired the McE-some six years, with each meeting an interesting experience, to say the least-it is fair to say that there was an eclectic mix of personalities round the table. The first few meetings probably took the cake. One would wonder how, from those first meetings, we ever succeeded to take this issue so far so successfully. We saw a commitment from the ministers involved-perhaps with one exception; I do not think Kim Yeadon ever saw it as anything other than an opportunity to score points, firstly, off the Commonwealth and then off his Labor colleagues. I would probably suggest that without his confrontationist attitude energy market reform may have got off to a better start. Kim aside, I think every minister who came to that table came, yes, with state interests in mind but certainly with a view that energy market reform is something that needs to be pursued, and that, as we see from this legislation, is continuing to make progress. I must take this opportunity to lament the highly politicised nature of energy market reform in New South Wales. I guess it comes from that state not making some hard decisions earlier on. But I do hope that the reform in that state continues, because if it does not the sort of investment we need to see in the energy industry-not only in New South Wales but in Queensland, Victoria and of course right around Australia-will simply not happen. There is no role for government in the ownership and operation of energy assets. That is a thing of the last century. That is a way of operation when there is market failure. Energy market reform is a critical factor in ensuring that Australia provides a sound economic environment for companies and corporations to make investments in energy that will not only enable them to make a MAIN COMMITTEE return but also, of course, see the investments made in such a way that we will have the energy security that we need in the future. There is probably no better time to talk about energy security than now, when we see the disaster that has beset Western Australia. In the main, it was due to an accident, but I am not going to delve into the wheres and whys of that. But it does highlight a couple of issues. It highlights, firstly, that Western Australia has allowed, through this current Carpenter government, a situation to arise where it has no alternative supplies of domestic gas. The way you encourage supplies of domestic gas is the same way you encourage alternative sources of electricity or power stations-that is, you allow the market to work. You allow the price to reflect demand and, in the case of gas, you allow the price to reflect the world price. Interference in that market by the Carpenter government has certainly caused a lack of investment in domestic gas supply in Western Australia in the last three years, and there are lessons to be learned from that by the federal government. This current proposal of the Minister for the Environment to interfere in the normal commercial development of gas fields insisting that there be only one gas hub in the northern Western Australian Kimberley region again puts in danger the commercial and normal development of energy resources in Australia. I urge the government to take stock of that position and realise that, wherever government has interfered in the energy market, whether it was in the 20th century or now in the 21st century, disaster has inevitably followed. There are bad investment decisions and there is the requirement for taxpayers to pick up the tab. This is certainly an area which, if left to its own means, can make the right decisions to ensure that Australia has the right energy solutions. Energy market reform is very much a part of that. The ministerial council, as I said, was focused, over the six years that I chaired it-and I understand under the current Minister for Resources and Energy it has continued along that path-on developing a framework for an efficient and effective national energy market in Australia. I say in conclusion that the opposition will be cooperating with the government to assist in strengthening the energy market program under the ministerial council and delivering the economic gains that are available from such reforms. Without those reforms, the energy market in Australia and the infrastructure and investment we need to sustain it will simply not happen. ment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 before the committee is one element of the National Gas Law. The National Gas Law is a significant piece of cooperative economic reform that will bring the economic regulation of gas transmission and distribution pipelines under the national energy market governance arrangements. It also implements reforms contained in the Ministerial Council on Energy’s response to a 2004 Productivity Commission review of the gas access regime. The National Gas Law will reduce the regulatory burden on industry, improve service provider certainty and protect the long-term interests of consumers by introducing a new light-handed form of regulation that regulators may apply by empowering the Australian Energy Regulator, as the national regulator for gas access, to improve the consistency of regulatory decision making by allowing for merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal of key regulatory decisions, by introducing strict requirements for timely regulatory decisions and by increasing information transparency.

189,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.09 Am),"The Australian Energy Market Amendtives for new pipelines, incentives which were established by the Ministerial Council on Energy in June 2006. The Ministerial Council on Energy is seeking to achieve a truly national gas access regime by enacting the National Gas Law by 1 July this year. So that the National Gas Law can correctly commence at that time, it is necessary for this bill to be passed in the winter sitting. I note that at the last Ministerial Council on Energy meeting the Minister for Resources and Energy strongly emphasised the need for the reform program to proceed expeditiously. Since that meeting we can see that the government has made significant progress on energy market reform. The National Gas Law is before the South Australian parliament-I think passage is expected in coming days-and this will see gas pipelines brought under national regulatory arrangements, improving the climate for investment in the sector. The government is also well into the process of establishing the Australian Energy Market Operator with responsibility for electricity and gas. This Labor government recognises that energy security is paramount to the continued well-being of all Australians. The government is putting in place arrangements that will guide the strategic decisions we need to make and prepare us for threats to our energy security. It is also clear that adequate, reliable and affordable provision of energy requires vigilance against threats. While appropriately focused investment will improve energy system resilience, we also need to manage the implications of accidental, environmental or intentional disruptions. At the start of this week I had the opportunity, along with the minister and others, to receive a briefing from the Shell company concerning energy futures. The material that they put forward was very challenging. I will just point out to the House a couple of extracts from their publication Shell energy scenarios to 2050. In the foreword it states: Never before has humanity faced such a challenging outlook for energy and the planet. This can be summed up in five words: “more energy, less carbon dioxide”. And, in the introduction: How can I prepare for, or even shape, the dramatic developments in the global energy system that will emerge in the coming years? This question should be on the mind of every responsible leader in government, business and civil society. It should be a concern of every citizen. Shell’s analysis is essentially that the world can no longer avoid three hard truths about energy supply and demand. The background, as they point out, is that the world population has more than doubled since 1950-it has more than doubled in my lifetime-and is set to increase by 40 per cent by 2050. The Shell publication continues: History has shown that as people become richer they use more energy. Population and GDP will grow strongly in non-OECD countries and China and India are just starting their journey on the energy ladder. The three hard truths are: firstly, a dramatic change, a step-change, in energy use. The Shell publication states: Developing nationssuch as China and Indiaare entering their most energy-intensive phase of economic growth as they industrialise, build infrastructure, and increase their use of transportation. MAIN COMMITTEE So we have demand going up. Secondly, supply will struggle to keep pace. Shell states: By 2015, growth in the production of easily accessible oil and gas will not match the projected rate of demand growth. While abundant coal exists in many parts of the world, transportation difficulties and environmental degradation ultimately pose limits to its growth. Meanwhile, alternative energy sources such as biofuels may become a more significant part of the energy mix-but there is no “silver bullet” that will completely resolve supply-demand tensions. The third point they make-the third hard truth-is that environmental stresses are increasing. They say: Even if it were possible for fossil fuels to maintain their current share of the energy mix and respond to increase demand, C02 emissions would then be on a pathway that could severely threaten human well-being. Even with the moderation of fossil fuel use and effective C02 management, the path forward is still highly challenging, remaining within desirable levels of C02 concentration in the atmosphere will become increasingly difficult. The issue confronting us all, and Shell posed this for those of us who are policymakers, is how we meet such a monumental challenge. I want to encourage the government to put energy and endeavour into the issue of feed-in tariffs. We have been having a bit of a discussion this morning about the gas explosion in Western Australia and the security challenges that that encompasses. One of the things that I think is necessary for us in terms of our being able to secure energy supplies in the future is greater production by distributed energy as opposed to centralised energy arrangements, which are more vulnerable to attack or to breakdown. One of the elements coming out of the Ministerial Council on Energy is the issue of smart meter rollout. The Ministerial Council on Energy has made available a cost-benefit analysis and regulatory impact statement for smart meter rollout. They are available for public comment. A communique from the Ministerial Council on Energy, which was held on 13 Juneso, very recently-said: Ministers are committed to development of a consistent national framework for smart meters in the National Electricity Market, supporting distributors to be responsible for the rollout of smart meters. Ministers noted there continue to be some uncertainties about the costs and benefits of smart meters in some jurisdictions and that different staged approaches are being taken to support the further development of smart meters. Smart meters are to be rolled out in Victoria and NSW, with over five million smart meters expected to be deployed before 2017. Queensland and some other states and territories will undertake extensive pilots and business cases prior to a further national review of deployment timelines in 2012. So that is the background. This bill is about energy market security. I think the recent Western Australian explosion should be concentrating our minds on this issue. In relation to my view that there needs to be greater consideration given to the idea of feedin tariffs, let me point out to the House that present non-renewable power producers are being subsidised by society and the environment, which is paying the costs of global warming via drought and other extreme weather events. Feed-in tariffs can reflect the real cost of carbon. They can be based on either so-called avoided costs of non-renewable power producers or the electricity price charged to the end user, supplemented by a bonus or a premium in order to account for the social or environmental benefits of renewable energy. The intention is to encourage individual homes, factories and building sites to become mini power plants, meeting their own power needs through the production of renewable energy which does not emit global warming emissions. The vision I have is of communities where MAIN COMMITTEE energy production is distributed rather than centralised and is therefore genuinely sustainable indefinitely. Renewable energy targets are important. They encourage large investments in renewable energy by companies, but they do not encourage localised distributed energy systems in the way a feed-in tariff does. A study of the summer, peaking electricity systems of California noted that power from PVs is produced disproportionately, at times when the value of electricity is high. Evaluation of solar PV electricity production that uses only the average wholesale cost of electricity will tend to undervalue the power, so the benefits to the owners of solar PV in reduced electricity bills do not reflect the true, time-varying value of the power that the panels produce. I think that a feed-in tariff will build community awareness. It will answer the question so many families ask: what can I do? It will drive the cost of solar PV down. Solar PV generates power when it is most needed. It evens out the power load, it reduces the extreme peaks of the hot summers, and PV output over summer peak load weeks has been shown to correspond well to system load at regional nodes in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Solar PV also avoids transmission losses and avoids the need for poles and wires infrastructure. There is, for example, information from the Electricity Supply Association that $24 billion of electricity network and generation infrastructure is required to meet Australia’s growing power needs over the next five years. Anything we can do to reduce the need for that infrastructure is clearly worthwhile. Infrastructure costs are being driven by the need to meet demand peaks. In that respect, I think a lot of the talk about the need for baseload electricity is misleading. We need to provide economically rational signals to customers, and sometimes this does not happen. The Queensland government estimates that, for every air conditioner installed, the electricity industry has to spend an extra $13,000 on more poles and wires to manage the load. Clearly, we can do better than that. It is also something that generates jobs. Ten years ago Germany had a solar PV industry of a similar scale to Australia’s. Now Germany has an industry of 110,000 jobs, generating 15,000 megawatts of solar PV power. Australia has fallen behind. It is estimated that in 2005 the solar PV industry here was responsible for just 1,300 jobs. So there is plenty that we can do in this area to do better than we have been doing in the past. There are design issues, of course. There is the question of price, the question of duration, the question of means of metering and the question of degression rate. I commend to the House some of the work that has been done by organisations like the Moreland Energy Foundation in my own electorate and by BP Solar in New South Wales. In the ACT we have a private member’s bill from Mick Gentleman, and indeed the states have been looking at various arrangements in relation to feed-in tariffs. I think one of the things needed and one of the things that the government recognises is that there is a need for a national system, rather than different states going in different directions. But if we are to provide energy security in future, if we are to meet challenges like the gas explosion which has occurred in Western Australia, if we are to seriously tackle greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, then things like feedin tariffs and encouraging people to meet their own electricity through the production of distributed energy are very important. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 has been brought into clear focus by the events MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
190,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (10.22 Am),"Certainly the Australian Energy Marketthat have occurred in Western Australia. These events show quite clearly how dependent any modern nation is on energy, how fragile our energy supply can be and the potential for knockon effects throughout the entire economy. In Australia we spend around $50 billion a year on energy. Our energy exports are worth some $24 billion per annum. These figures take into account coal, oil, natural gas, electricity, renewables and other forms of energy. As a society we require ever-increasing amounts of energy to maintain our high quality of life. By 2020, domestic demand for energy is expected to increase by some 50 per cent. In 2002, a report entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market was handed down to the COAG Ministerial Council on Energy. The report found that Australia’s energy markets could benefit from greater national consistency of governance and regulation. The ministers agreed that further reform to the sector would lead to greater investment in Australian energy needs by lowering the cost and complexity of regulation and by providing investors with greater certainty about regulation. The council also found that reforming the energy system would lead to greater competition between providers and would encourage the further development of natural gas and renewable energy sources. It was envisaged that the proposed reforms would also help to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. To replace the variety of governing bodies and regulators that control Australia’s energy markets, two new statutory bodies were created. The Australian Energy Market Commission has the responsibility for rule making and market development. The Australian Energy Regulator, or AER, has the responsibility for market regulation. The AER is a constituent part of the ACCC but operates as a separate legal entity. Initially, the reforms were applied to the national electricity market, but they are now being expanded to include national gas infrastructure. The latest round of reforms will bring gas access regulation into line with the regulation of the electricity sector. As a part of the reforms to the gas access regime, the industry has put forward a proposal for a bulletin board that will provide information about gas services and assist in response to emergencies-a very timely notion at this point in our history. The bulletin board will be an important step in creating greater transparency within the market. These reforms have been planned with the cooperation of the energy sector, the state governments and the Commonwealth, and advice and input have been received from the ACCC and the Productivity Commission. These changes have not been advanced without detailed and careful consideration, and I believe they will make a difference to Australia’s energy future. As we move towards a carbon constrained economy, gas will play a vital role in the provision of our energy needs. The Australian energy market reform process will provide incentives for investment in this important area. Companies will benefit from a light-handed regulatory system, regulatory certainty and improvements to the rules around cost recovery for investment in expanding existing gas infrastructure capacity. Although the reform process will be of benefit to the companies involved, I should note that the Rudd government has taken steps to discourage investment and exploration in Australia’s gas fields by introducing an excise on condensate. Condensate is created as a result of pressure and temperature changes brought about by the pumping of natural gas from a gas field. Gas reserves are generally more profitable if they contain a mix of gas and condensate. MAIN COMMITTEE The Howard government worked hard to secure an additional 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed for oil and gas exploration, and this tax grab by the Rudd government can only discourage potential investors from exploring this new territory. You must always be careful to observe what this government does, rather than listen to what it says. Natural gas is a vital component in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions. It is inconsistent that the government would introduce a tax that will discourage exploration for this resource. The main objectives of the gas market reform are enshrined in the National Gas Law. Underpinning the National Gas Law are six principles that will guide the development of the regulation framework for gas pipeline access. The first principle is that a service provider should have reasonable opportunity to recover the costs brought about by complying with a regulatory obligation or requirement. This is essential to ensuring that service providers will continue to undertake further investment in gas infrastructure. The second principle is that service providers should be provided with effective incentives to promote economically efficient investment in and provision and use of pipeline services. The third principle ensures that the regulator takes into account previous determinations by the ACCC about existing pipeline infrastructure. This ensures that a company’s previous investment in pipeline infrastructure is recognised and taken into account when making regulatory decisions. The fourth principle ensures that prices and charges for the provision of a specified service allow for a return in line with the risk taken to provide that service. The fifth principle ensures that the Australian Energy Regulator will take into account the cost and risk of overor under-investment by a service provider in the network. The final principle ensures that the regulator will take into account the possibility of overor under-utilisation of a service provider’s network. These principles will guide the development of the regulatory framework and ensure that service providers are not disadvantaged by the reform process. At the heart of these reforms is the consumer. A key objective of the Australian energy market reform is the promotion of the long-term interests of energy consumers. As the effects of the market reform begin to flow through to consumers, we should see improvements in the price, quality, reliability and security of supply of natural gas. Although these reforms are primarily economic in nature, if the gas market and access to pipeline services are economically efficient, the flow-on effects will undoubtedly be positive for consumers. In keeping with the goal of providing improved consumer outcomes, the National Gas Law will permit the Australian Energy Regulator to publish regular reports on the financial and operational performance of service providers. This will add transparency to the industry and will be of great benefit to gas users and consumers. In order to safeguard the reputation of service providers, the providers will have the opportunity to do a review of the performance reports before they are released to the public and to request changes to the reports, based on factual evidence. Australia has large reserves of natural gas. This resource will become more and more important to our energy security as we move towards a carbon constrained society. Gas generally produces fewer carbon emissions than coal or oil based energy production methods. As such, it is essential in the fight against climate change. Making gas more accessible and attractive for consumers and encouraging further gas exploration are important objectives, and these reforms will help meet those goals. MAIN COMMITTEE The legislation under debate today is a minor technical amendment which reflects changes in the timing of the implementation of this legislation. I believe that these energy market reforms will have a positive impact on the energy sector and I offer no objection to the passage of this legislation. another important step in the creation of a modern Australian energy market. Whilst the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 goes specifically to the regulatory issues on gas energy, it is worth reflecting on where Australia has come from and where it is going in relation to the creation of a national energy market. It is also worth commenting, first of all, on the importance of our national energy market. The creation of a national energy market is of importance to every single Australian. Australia must have an efficient, integrated, properly regulated, transparent energy market. The energy industry affects every other industry. It affects, in one way or another, every Australian job. It affects our homes and our lives. It will affect significantly the future of our climate and our environment. We have come a long way from the time when there was relatively little regulation over our energy industries. And, as an aside, I have to say that the regulation of our industries is a clear case of where some of the rhetoric coming from the other side is exposed. It is an example of where the rhetoric from the other side is exposed as nonsense. The flat-earth free marketeers on the other side are always saying how we should do away with government regulation and let everything flow free, uninhibited. I think clear, detailed and comprehensive regulation such as that we are developing today is just what the energy industry needs in Australia today. This multilevel regulatory environment is what will make our energy production, distribution and retailing much more efficient, safe, environmentally friendly, and equitable. In my view this sort of detailed and clear regulation is critical to the future of our planet. Energy is the key determinant of Australia’s future economic growth and prosperity, yet global warming threatens to change all aspects of life on earth. It is a conundrum that must be regulated. We must come a long way from the days when there was only regulation around government monopolies. We are moving into a new world where there is a comprehensive framework of regulation to create a national Australian energy market. The Ministerial Council on Energy is at the moment developing a cooperative legislative regime to regulate access to gas pipelines on a national basis under national regulatory and rule-making bodies.The Australian Energy Market Agreement commits all Australian jurisdictions to developing and applying legislation as a part of that regime. The linchpin of the new system will be the National Gas Law. The National Gas Law will be established in South Australia and then applied through application acts in all other participating jurisdictions. Western Australia will pass complementary legislation too. The development of gas industries through this legislation is reaching a point of maturity, and I welcome this. Australia is indeed a lucky country when it comes to gas. We have very significant reserves. It is very important to our industries and it provides a more environmentally friendly alternative energy source. I think Australians are just coming to understand the importance of gas to our industries, and our growing reliance on it. What is happening right now in Western Australia is making us all take note. The gas plant explosion and fire on 3 June has cut 30 per cent of WA’s domestic gas supply, leading to thouMAIN COMMITTEE",135,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
191,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.31 Am),"The amendments in this legislation aresands of workers being laid off. Perth’s skyscrapers and shops have shut down their lifts and turned off lights in an effort to save energy. The Royal Australian Navy has been called on to hand over 16 million litres of diesel for emergency electricity generation. This situation will have a flow-through to our national economy. That would surprise many; it certainly made me sit up and take notice. In fact, what has happened in Western Australia has made everyone sit up and take notice. I think it says that we should be taking the legislation before us very seriously and that perhaps we need to look more closely at assessing the financial and human risks of this burgeoning industry. I think that will happen and that in the future we will see much more robust risk assessment and new, best practice risk mitigation measures to protect this industry and related industries. Australia’s gas resources and reserves are very, very significant. We are still discovering how extensive they are. Just within my region, in Bass Strait and the Otway Basin, discoveries are still being made. If we play our cards right-if we get the legislative regime right, if we get the regulation right, if we get the investment right-this industry has enormous potential. Our gas resources mean we can become an international leader in R&D in the methane economy. I note that the CSIRO are doing an enormous amount of work in this area, partnering with industry in a number of gas related production areas that hold considerable promise. The CSIRO are trying to work through technical issues and form future strategies on converting gas to liquids, on converting hydrogen from natural gas, on gas processing and on syngas manufacture. The CSIRO have developed networks, companies and research bodies across Australia and around the world. So the gas industry has a very big future in Australia, and it is important to get the regulatory environment right. Under the Australian Energy Market Agreement, the Commonwealth parliament has to pass laws to apply the National Gas Law in the offshore area and external territories. More importantly, the Commonwealth has to consent in legislation to the conferral under state law of functions such as those of the National Gas Law on three Commonwealth bodies: the Australian Energy Regulator, the National Competition Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal. This is done through the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Act 2007. I want to say a few words about the National Gas Law, which I have previously mentioned. The Gas Law is a critical bit of cooperative economic reform that will bring the economic regulation of gas transmission and distribution pipelines under the national energy market governance arrangements. The National Gas Law provides a clear, transparent and certain regulatory environment for the industry. It will better protect the interests of consumers. Not only are we coming up with good regulatory reform for our energy sector but we are getting on with the job of implementing it. The National Gas Law is now before the South Australian parliament, with passage expected in coming weeks. This will see the first gas pipelines brought under national regulatory arrangements. We are getting on with reform and creating the national energy market at a pace. The Ministerial Council on Energy has achieved a significant milestone in the government’s energy market reform agenda through amendments to the national electricity law; the rules and regulations for this come into force on 1 January 2008. The regulation of electricity distribution now operates under a truly national framework administered by the Australian Energy Regulator. We have also achieved significant progress in addressing barriers to renewable investMAIN COMMITTEE ment and demand-side management in the national electricity markets. COAG is developing a national framework for transmission reliable standards. The government are putting in place arrangements that will guide the strategic decisions we need to make and prepare us for any threat to our energy security. I am sure the volatility of the Western Australian suppliers will add food for thought. In short, our Labor government are planning and implementing a reliable, affordable and more environmentally sustainable energy sector. We are looking ahead to see how we can develop a framework that will enable us to make decisions about our energy usage to grow our industries, create jobs, build stronger communities and at the same time take into account the pressing imperatives of climate change. This bill is another important step along this path, and I commend the bill to the House and congratulate the minister for his foresight. Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008. In doing so I congratulate both the current minister and the Ministerial Council on Energy on coming together to put in place a national system. Even though in the minister’s speech he said that there are only minor changes in the bill, these are significant for energy across the nation. But I also recognise the former minister, the member for Groom, who led that committee for something like six years, for the work that he too put in on this national scheme. I think this is very important. Obviously gas is going to be an important ingredient in our future. I am pleased to see the member for Parkes here as well because our electorates are next door to each other and there is currently natural gas being found in certain localities. Santos has an exploration licence, the first for that company in New South Wales, and they will be drilling some pilot holes in locations in our electorates. So there could be substantial resources of gas as well. I was also involved some years ago with the formation of what was called the central ranges gas pipeline committee, which looked at how to get natural gas from Dubbo to Tamworth. That has been successfully achieved. It took quite some time, as most things do, and there were some difficulties in terms of competition policy. I think this legislation goes some way to addressing this. In some areas of the nation there is not massive competition between various pipeline authorities or private sector investors. That was a problem with both the state based IPART, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales, and the National Competition Council in relation to what could be charged by the provider of the pipeline. But, having said that, that pipeline is in place now and it is proposed that another pipeline come out of Queensland. There are various exploration activities going on. Eastern Star Gas is pumping gas near Narrabri as we speak. The importance of this legislation is that it creates in a sense a national law, and that is a good thing. I think it is very important for the future of this nation, particularly moving into the carbon trading era and global warming, that we establish some national guidelines. There is one thing that the current government has to come to grips with if it is serious about global warming and some of its policy initiatives: it has to stop sending mixed messages to the electorate in terms of what the agenda really is. I will give two examples, one more recent than the other. The first example is the change of heart over the rebate for investment in solar energy panels. I listened intently to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in question time a couple of weeks ago when he said that the market was overheated, that it was going MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
192,Mr Windsor (New England) (10.42 Am),"It is with pleasure that I rise to speak to thebetter than we thought it would and that therefore we had to means-test the provision of the rebate. I think that is an appalling message to send to the wider electorate. It says: ‘Look, we think it’s a good idea and we’d like to encourage you to do it, but don’t take us too seriously because Treasury runs the place and it is not as concerned about global warming as maybe the minister, the Prime Minister or others are.’ It is a mixed message to the community. The other mixed message is one that I have been noting for quite some time. The previous government set up a sort of grandfathered arrangement in terms of renewable energy. It failed, in my view, particularly in terms of biofuels. We have this absurd statute-which is still there; the current government has not removed it-where in 2011, I think, if you are a biofuel producer in this nation, you will be taxed as though you were a fossil fuel producer. Is the message that ‘we are trying to encourage renewable energy’-is that the message we are trying to get out to the broader community? Alternatively, is the message that ‘if you produce a renewable energy source’-in this case, biodiesel or ethanol in certain blends-‘we will see you as a source of revenue’? I have heard the absurd argument-and the former Treasurer used this argument a number of times-that to remove a fossil fuel tax from a biofuel would be seen as a subsidy to the renewable energy marketplace. What an extraordinary use of economic language to come out with that sort of nonsense. Are we trying to encourage renewable energy-wind, wave, solar and biofuels? I think the previous speaker spoke about the fact that there would have to be a whole range of contributors if we are to deal with the issues that we are told global warming represents. If we are concerned, we have to stop sending these mixed messages to the community. The government says-and the words sound nice-‘We’re serious. We want renewable energy. But if you do that then we will tax you, so we do not really want it.’ We saw a similar farce go on in terms of superannuation-‘it is a good idea-save for your retirement’. It was encouraged by all, and then it was utilised by various governments, of both persuasions, as three sources of taxation-as a source of revenue. The original intent was for people to save for retirement, which the punters could see quite clearly. I think this is a great idea. Let us have national legislation on a whole range of these issues, particularly with an emissions trading scheme around the corner, but let us have consistency of the message. Do not mix the messages. I would like to reflect on this in relation to the emissions trading arrangements that are being contemplated by the government. There is a degree of confusion-and it is in some cases deliberate-between those who purport to represent renewable fuels. I am very pleased to see my colleague the member for Ryan enter the Main Committee. I know he is very interested in renewable fuels. Most people would know that the people of Ryan are extremely interested in renewable fuels-hopefully at lower prices. There has been a mixed message in the energy versus fuel debate. There have been food riots in various countries of the world. What role does Australia have to play? What can we do? Should we be using agricultural land for the production of biofuels, for instance? Is that moral? Overlaying that-and this is what I would like to talk about today-is the imminent carbon emissions trading scheme. We are not quite sure how that will work. We are not quite sure how that will allow or not allow for agriculture because of the purported emissions of agriculture. It is a conundrum that we really need to address. MAIN COMMITTEE I will use an example, and a few members have heard this example before. Walgett is in the electorate of the member for Parkes, but the Walgett wheat grower is a very good example of agricultural production in Australia. It is roughly 500 kilometres from a port. It produces prime hard wheat, which requires nitrogen. We are told that nitrous oxide is part of the problem in greenhouse gas emissions. High rates of nitrogen are required to get the protein for that food grain to enter the food chain and to get a global price premium. That is the marketplace today. If you overlay an emissions trading scheme, a number of things will happen. I think the parliament needs to look at the implications. The Walgett wheat grower under an emissions trading scheme will leave a carbon footprint. Due to climate change, the Walgett wheat grower in recent years has made a massive change in farming technology. The member for Parkes would be aware of the no-till techniques that are used now. I spoke to the Prime Minister about this a few weeks back. That represents an enormous adaptation to reduced rainfall. We are being told that there is going to be reduced rainfall in parts of Australia, and that could have an impact on our productive capacity. There have been similar changes in some of the grazing technologies across Australia, where similar benefits can accrue. That change means for the Walgett wheat grower effectively 150 to 200 millimetres more rainfall. That has been proven by the Department of Primary Industries and the CSIRO. It is available moisture to the plant. The old techniques of cropping used at Walgett, when it was highly marginal, meant that cultivation would take place continually and moisture would be released into the atmosphere. You would then be waiting for rain, and you would cultivate and let a portion of it go. By having a protective mulch of the previous crop’s residue on the surface, you keep the moisture in the ground. That has a whole range of other microbial and moisture infiltration impacts. Also, it impacts on the capacity to naturally sequest carbon in our soils. In some of our soils-that is, not all of our soils and not all at the same rate-it could have a significant impact. The Walgett wheat grower’s carbon footprint is much reduced on 20 years ago; nonetheless, he is still using energy to produce his crop. He leaves a footprint when he takes his crop from the farm to the silo. We have just been through the wheat marketing debate. He leaves another footprint when the train picks up the wheat from the Walgett silo and takes it to the Newcastle port. Then he will leave another footprint when the wheat goes in a boat from the Newcastle port to, say, Egypt-where we will attempt to feed the starving millions. So there are a number of footprints. I do not know how that process is going to be treated in an emissions trading scheme. I do not think we are fully aware of how commodities traded internationally are going to be treated-bearing in mind that part of the grain in that boat is carbon in the form of starch. So what does all that mean in terms of those issues? We have an oversupply in grain and we sell it overseas because we cannot consume it here. We exchange some of that money for another boatload of oil to bring back to Newcastle which is then put on a train or a truck to be taken back to the Walgett wheat grower so that he can go around in circles again and produce the trading arrangements to buy the energy, the oil. Surely-and people have heard me on this topic a number of times-we have to send a consistent message about this and look at other options to the absurdity of doing that. We need to look at ways of converting grain into energy sources at source rather than creating all these carbon footprints, particularly when the grower will be landed with the cost of that footprint. MAIN COMMITTEE The international trade component may have some special dealing with that, but the transport movements cannot. If we are going to have a carbon footprint or an emissions trading scheme, we have to include transport. It is ridiculous for us not to. It makes a nonsense of the message we are trying to send. I would urge the government to look very closely at those issues. Now, some would say, ‘Yes, but we need to provide for the world.’ Australia produces 1¾ per cent of the world’s grain trade in a good year. So we are not the big player. We cannot feed the world. We are not the big player that people make us out to be. We are big in the wheat export market, but we are very small in terms of the total grain production in the world. The other policy implication that relates directly to energy and to carbon, if we are going to have carbon credits et cetera in the system, is land use. Let us say the Walgett wheat grower changed his land use to growing species of pasture, for instance, where the cellulose in the perennial grasses-that is, they are not planted every year-is not cultivated at all and it emits lower rates of nitrogen, which we are told is part of the problem in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and he harvests that material. This is what they are looking at doing in the United States with a plant called switchgrass. The grass is converted at very good rates from the cellulosic material into cellulosic ethanol. That immediately removes the food versus fuel argument, because it is not a food product that you are converting into an energy product, but you still have the land use issue. By doing that you remove all of the transport movements, the various carbon footprints that they would have in terms of emissions, but you also potentially have a massive impact on the capacity to sequester carbon into the soil and convert it into humus and organic matter. Switchgrass has a very deep root system. It has been shown that it was the natural grass of the American prairies. How serious are people who are arguing in this food-fuel thing about returning to nature if they are going to keep imposing a fossil fuel tax on the production of a renewable fuel? I get back to that point that I made earlier that we have to get serious about the mixed messages that are here. Another point that I have raised in the other place a couple of times is: what about the starving millions? What do we do to help them? One of the things we could do to help them is sell the technology or give the technology that the Walgett wheat grower has been developing over the last 20 years. When I say Walgett, he could be in a whole range of places: Western Australia, South Australia, on the Darling Downs, or the central tablelands of Queenslandbut give that technology to those people in those dryland farming areas. I have previously used the example of the country of Sudan, which is at war with itself. It has 100 million acres of land similar to that at Walgett. It has the capacity to produce six times the grain that Australia produces. There is no need to have this farcical transporting of food across the world when we can teach these people to produce their own food through modern technologies. If we are serious about global warming, and I think most of us are, we have to make sure that the message we send is consistent. The other issue I raised with the Prime Minister recently was for more research to be done into the measurement and retention of soil carbon under different cropping and grazing technologies. There may well be a way of developing systems where natural sequestration of carbon is part of the emissions program. Benefits may or may not go back to farmers in terms of some of the pricing or stewardship arrangements, but there would be real recognition of the MAIN COMMITTEE contribution that agriculture could make, not only to the energy debate, through biofuels, but through soil health and soil sequestration. I think there is a role for agriculture. Those who are involved in agriculture say: ‘Under the first blush of Kyoto, agriculture is not in the deal. So let’s hope it will always stay out.’ They are kidding themselves; it will be part of the deal at some stage. Rather than, in a sense, being taxed on the negatives, I think we have to do more homework on the potential positives and put agriculture in a pre-eminent position. (Time expired.) Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008. This bill makes minor technical amendments to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Act 2007, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. This legislation finalises a cooperative legislative regime that regulates access to gas pipelines on a national basis. Under national regulatory and rule-making bodies the Australian Energy Market Agreement commits all Australian jurisdictions, state and federal, to developing and applying legislation as part of this regime. This bill will ensure that the necessary Commonwealth legislation is in place to give effect to the National Gas Law. This process has the full support of the Ministerial Council on Energy and represents a bipartisan, cooperative and natural approach to regulating access to gas pipeline infrastructure. The Natural Gas Law will reduce the regulatory burden on industry, improve service provider certainty and protect the long-term interests of consumers by (i) introducing a new lighthanded form of regulation that regulators may apply, (ii) empowering the Australian Energy Regulator as the national regulator for gas access to improve the consistency of regulatory decision making, (iii) allowing for merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal of key regulatory decisions, (iv) introducing strict requirements for timely regulatory decisions, (v) increasing information transparency and (vi) maintaining the greenfields incentives for new pipelines established by the McE in June 2006. This is all about ending the blame game. We are entering into a new phase with a new government with new ideas and new ways of doing business. We are moving away from the old federalism of: ‘It’s not our fault; it’s their fault’. We are moving into a new era. We are moving into a new era of cooperation-of consensus between federal and state governments. This is ending the blame game, which was definitely a hallmark of the last 11 years of the coalition government. So that is coming to an end. I can honestly say that I have worked well in my time previous to this on Mackay city council and enjoyed good working relationships with people on both sides of the political spectrum. We always looked for consensus and outcome and were outcome driven. When it comes to energy, this is all in the national interest. We have to look at the common good and we cannot have self-interested parties involved here. We have to work for the common good of the whole nation in our energy needs, and that is particularly so here as well. Something that I experienced in my role in Mackay city council was working with state members Tim Mulherin, the member for Mackay, and also Jan Jarratt, the state member for Whitsunday. We had excellent working relationships with those state members. But, unfortunately, the National Party member who held the seat of Dawson prior to me was obstructionist, quite frankly, and consistently so over the last 11 years. It was like trying MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
193,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (11.02 Am),"I speak today in favour of the Australian Energyto drag a horse to water and make it drink. There was just total non-cooperation. That is why the people of Dawson decided to vote for change. They decided to vote for new ideas, and they are looking for outcomes and results for the common good of all people, regardless of political persuasion. People on the other side need to remember that 10.2 per cent is in no way a safe seat when such obstructionist behaviour is taking place. I thought I would remind the member for Fadden of that. I would like to mention Col Meng, the current mayor of the new Mackay Regional Council, which has taken in two other councils-the council of Sarina and the council of Miraniand is now a regional council of over 100,000 people. I am looking forward in the upcoming weeks, on 29 June, to meeting with Col Meng, the new Mackay regional councillor. He will be hosting part of the community cabinet. Kevin Rudd and the cabinet will be coming to Mackay, and we will be meeting together with the local regional council and the state members and their representatives and we will be working together for the common good of all in all outcomes. That includes new ideas on energy. The seat of Dawson is an exciting place to be. We have some great prospects, particularly with resources and mining. For example, the Queensland Resources Council has said that by 2015 we will need an extra 15,000 resource workers in Queensland, and one in four of those will be in the seat of Dawson. Bowen is halfway between Mackay and Townsville. My seat stretches from South Mackay to southern Townsville; it goes right up to the Ross River, and right in the middle is Bowen. Bowen is a town which is going to boom into a great city. There are a lot of good things going on for Bowen at the moment. Just 20 kilometres north of Bowen is a port called Abbot Point. It is one of the few natural deep water ports around the coast of Australia. Currently we are exporting 21 million tonnes of coal out of there. The Queensland ports corporation has briefed me, and we are looking forward to expanding that from 21 million tonnes a year to a goal per year of 50 million tonnes in the foreseeable future and long term 110 million tonnes. This is going to add to the bottom line of this nation. We are exporting our resources, our energy-producing fuels. That is good news for Bowen because there is an accommodation crisis, as there is around the nation, and people are coming in, workers are coming in, and we are having to build. It is good for the economy of Bowen, good for the economy of Dawson and good, very good, for the bottom line of this nation. This Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, understands that basic key infrastructure is essential in facilitating the movement of these resources out of our country as a major export across the seas to China, Japan and India, to name but a few. I want to focus on Bowen, because it has actually been used as the site of part of Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia, which will be released in November of this year. That is going to add value to the whole nation as well, and Bowen is going to be showcased because a lot of the film was actually shot there. That is going to add to international tourism. International tourism is going to come into Mackay, the Whitsunday Islands and Bowen. So Bowen has an exciting future-right in the centre, right in the heart, of my seat of Dawson. Another thing that is going to be going well for Bowen is that I am lobbying the Prime Minister, all the cabinet and my fellow MPs hard and advocating the need for the Aluminium Company of China to come and set up at Abbot Point. It is the ideal place to have an aluminium refinery. The reason? It is 20 kilometres to the nearest residential town of Bowen, so MAIN COMMITTEE there is a natural buffer zone where these activities can take place. SoI continue to lobby; I continue to advocate. I have spoken to representatives from the Chinese embassy and have made it very clear that they are welcome and we would love to have them at Abbot Point. I want to make that very clear and put it on the record here today. These things do not happen unless there is cooperation, unless there is consensus and agreement-one thing I have made very clear. The previous mayor of Bowen, Mike Brunker, happens to be the new mayor of the new Whitsunday Regional Council, which now takes in what was the old Bowen council. Mike is absolutely passionate about Bowen because he has been connected with the mines in Collinsville and his family are in the mining industry. He is passionate about having a baseload subpower station somewhere between Bowen and Collinsville, which is about an hour west of Bowen. Again, we need a baseload power station and from the research and background reading I have done on the science innovation committee, I suggest, that hot rock thermal power is the most highly sustainable energy supply which can go up to baseload subpower station levels. Solar, wind and wave power just cannot reach those levels without absolutely massive saturation of whatever is being put forward; whether it is wind propellers or wave motion, it takes an incredible amount of set-up. But we have hot rock thermal in abundance in this country. I am pleased to say that it is possible between Bowen and Collinsville. We need that baseload power station not just for all the energy industries that are going to come in to North Queensland but to power up North Queensland. I know the member for Kennedy, Bob Katter; I have to say I have had some very fruitful discussions with the member for Kennedy. An opposition member-A good member. up North Queensland. When he heard me in my first speech in parliament say, ‘We need a baseload power station to power up North Queensland,’ he came to see me straight away and he said, ‘Thank God we’ve finally got someone with vision who’s passionate about making these things happen’-like him. This is going to happen across the political divide, and this is my point. The previous government did not have the spirit of cooperation that this new government has. We are committed to being outcome driven for the common good of all people. That is the big difference, they are the new ideas and this is the new consensus That is why this country, over the decades ahead, will benefit from a great Labor government. Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister is a visionary and he is forward thinking. That is why he has brought down such a fantastic budget, which builds on infrastructure. Because basic key infrastructure has been totally ignored for the last 11 years, it has been left to this government to fix up the failings of the previous government-because you have to have good basic roads and you have to have good basic rail in order to transportin silence. country. That is going to deliver to the bottom line of the economy of this country. Once we get the basics fixed up, which the other mob failed to do over 11 years, and get that income stream going, then we can invest in better health, better education and much better overall MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments

197,Mr Bidgood,"our resources, our coal, to the ports and make it a major export for thissustainability for our energy industry. It is when a government has vision that people thrive. It is when there is no vision that the people perish. You should never forget that, whatever side of politics you are on. You must have vision. You must have a goal as to where you are going. I would just like to say that Bowen is an exciting place to be, right in the heart of the seat of Dawson. But, as you look to the north, you look to towns like Ayr, for example, a major sugar town in the Burdekin. Again across the political divide, I have spoken to the state member, Rosemary Menkens. I actually had a meeting with her and our Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, whom I took to Ayr. I rang up local community leaders-who are not on our side of politics-and I said, ‘Come and have a chat, because we need to talk about key things to do with sugar and how we can add value.’ Do you know what? There was consensus. Consensus works; it works. Those people said, ‘Wow! We thought that now that you were in government you’d just exclude us.’ I said: ‘No. We’re going to be inclusive, we’re going to be outcome driven and we are going to be consensus driven for the common good of all. We’re not going to be divisive. We’re going to build this nation. We’re a party of nation builders. That is what we are about.’ We have exciting plans in Ayr. People came to the minister, Tony Burke, and we had had a discussion with about 25 people. We had farmers there who are farming 500,000 acres of sugar cane. They were saying, ‘Look, with the world prices for fuels and everything, we’ve got systems which we’ve seen working in Brazil and we could convert this sugar into ethanol.’ There are other plans, for bioenergies coming out of sugar and for cogeneration, particularly at the racecourse mill in Mackay, where the member for Capricornia, Kirsten Livermore, and I have been briefed. They have been working on a plan for 10 years, a feasibility study, but it was not viable until this last year, when global energy prices rocketed through the roof beyond the control of any national government. Now we in the seat of Dawson are well placed to add value to sugar and to meet energy needs. Cogeneration at the racecourse mill in Mackay is now a real possibility. It is a real possibility because the government are listening. The government are saying: ‘How can we help you? How can we make this happen?’ We now have a plan that is viable, and it is going to be an exciting time as I look forward to those mills presenting their cases to this government. I am excited about it because they are going to add value again to the bottom line. They are going to meet the energy needs of the local community as well. All these things are very important. We have spoken about how we can add value to sugar in terms of energy and ethanol, cogeneration and bioenergies. We have spoken about that in Mackay and in Ayr. We have also spoken about that in southern Townsville, in Oonoonba, Stuart and Idalia. Also, Xstrata have been saying to me, ‘We need basic upgrades in port facilities, in road and rail infrastructure.’ It is this government which has come on board, having made a promise during the election. It is beginning to deliver, as the budget outcome, $95 million for the Townsville port access road. That is guaranteed, and in this financial year it is delivering the first $20 million to get the project started. That is basic infrastructure which is going to help with energy and access to the global market for exports, adding to our bottom line. In conclusion, I speak in favour of this bill. Things like this only happen and work when you have a new vision for the country, a new vision with new federalism in mind, away from the old divisive ways of divide and rule and the blame game. We are moving forward to add MAIN COMMITTEE to the bottom line of this nation, to the economy and to the energy needs of not just this country but also the world. Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008. This is essentially a technical bill. It aims to make minor amendments to existing Commonwealth legislation that will underpin the national regime for the regulation of gas pipeline infrastructure. The bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Act 2007, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to correct the year of enactment of South Australian and Western Australian legislation from 2007 to 2008. The federal opposition supports these minor technical amendments to enable the implementation of the cooperative energy reform agenda between the Commonwealth, the states and all stakeholders. It is a bill that goes to technical provisions but the concept or theme at the heart of it is energy security. I know the people of Ryan that I represent will be interested in aspects of energy and some of the statistics on energy, given that they are Australians who want to make a contribution to the environmental solution and at the same time ensure they have living standards and opportunities for themselves and their families. So in the context of this bill I want to talk a bit about the nature of energy. Energy is the fuel of life. It makes plants grow. It keeps animals alive. And in our modern world it drives devices ranging from medical equipment that sustains life to sophisticated technology that takes space shuttles up into space. That is in a sense what energy is all about. Today, of course, people around the world exploit energy in many different forms. Essentially, fossil fuels-that is, oil, coal, natural gas-account for around four-fifths or 80 per cent of our total energy consumption. That is a significant share that has largely been unchanged for the last century or so. These fossil fuels dominate because they are seen to be cheap and abundant and they are able to be transported from their source into homes and businesses around the world, so the means of transportation of these sources of energy also makes them economically efficient. Different energy sources are used in different sectors. Motorised transport, for instance, is fuelled pretty much by oil and, as we know, when the price of a barrel of oil goes up it has ramifications throughout the world, from the most advanced economies and the most sophisticated cities to the developing economies and the most remote villages in those developing countries. So it is very timely that the leading ministers and governments of the world can come together at this time to discuss how we might address the rising price of oil. The energy used for heating is a mixture: gas, oil, wood, coal and other sources. For electricity generation, fossil fuels provide around 60 per cent of the global total, while nuclear and hydro-electricity contribute 15 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. On the other hand, renewable electricity sources, such as solar, geothermal and wind, are growing fast but still constitute only a small percentage-about two per cent-of the global total. Of course, all of us would like to see renewable energy sources increase, and I will be pleased to touch on that a little later in this presentation. Around 1.5 billion people still cook and heat their homes using traditional biomass sources such as wood and animal dung, so we must not forget that biomass still has a space in this energy debate for so many people around the world. Indeed, it is a source of life itself for so many of our fellow human beings, especially in developing economies where so many people still live in villages in remote parts of those countries. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
198,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (11.21 Am),"I am pleased to speak in the parliament today on theLet us ask about the consumption of energy. I am sure that the constituents I represent in Ryan will be interested to know the make-up of energy consumption. Whether energy comes from fossil fuels, nuclear, hydro or renewables, we use it in three broad sectors: industry, transport and buildings. Industrial uses such as mining, manufacturing and construction consume around 30 per cent of the global total; personal and commercial transportation consumes some 20 per cent; and residential and commercial buildings take up some 16 per cent for heating and cooling, lighting, appliances and the provision of water and sewerage services. Interestingly, a significant 27 per cent of the energy generated across the world is lost during generation and transmission, so we do not really get the most out of the energy sources that we have available to us. In my view, energy security, or the lack of energy security, is going to be one of the biggest issues of our times. Energy security for people around the world is right up there as an issue for the great leaders of this century to address. I foresee energy security, affordability, diversity and reliability as one of the top handful of issues that have the potential to cause serious, indeed profound, geopolitical challenges for the leadership of the major countries of the world. I think it is incumbent upon all of us now at the beginning of the 21st century, when we still have time, to lay down the architecture of an affordable, secure, reliable and indeed diverse energy system that will address varying demands-from those of the most sophisticated cities, such as New York, Sydney, Shanghai and London, to those of the emerging cities of the world whose energy demands will increase as their populations grow and become more prosperous. The world as we know it cannot go on at the rate and pace of Western energy consumption today. Our voracious appetite for all things that are energy intensive, from big cars to big houses to big boats and to big planes, cannot be sustained. I think that all of us deep down know this, and yet for many of us collectively as a society, as a community, whilst we know this, we still choose to ignore it. Indeed, some of us choose to bury our heads in the sand at the mounting challenge that is coming our way in terms of adjusting our lifestyle and the way that we use our energy for our day-to-day purposes. Yet, equally, I do want to say very strongly that in the world as we know it we cannot just switch off all our lights, and we cannot just stop using our motor cars, and we cannot go on strike against planes and we cannot stop flying. Doing these things is simply not on the cards for our 21st century world of business, commerce, enterprise and global interaction. We cannot be Luddites. We live in a world where opportunity, prosperity, technology and the brilliance of our scientists and our engineers will surely be able to provide a way forward that achieves a balance between sustaining our community and environment whilst at the same time providing an appropriate level of lifestyle where we can enjoy nature and its opportunities and not live in darkness. We cannot turn the clock back. We cannot all go and live in caves, as some of the extreme environmental groups would have us do. In fact I do not even call those who advocate such things environment groups, such is their intellectual bankruptcy and extremism. The bottom line is that energy supply, security, affordability and diversity is a very complex issue and this is why, going to the theme of energy and energy sustainability, I want to express great dismay at the way that the new Labor government has approached a source of energy which I think can go a long way, in the years and decades ahead, towards bringing about that balance and that sustainability that we all must try to achieve. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to talk in this context about solar energy. We all know that the budget that was recently delivered by the Rudd Labor government delivered a real blow to the solar industry, to renewable energy, and certainly it delivered a blow to the constituents of Ryan, who very much want to make a contribution to the environment and energy debate by taking up solar. BeforeI go into some of the details of that budget and the government’s attitude, I want to make a statement about solar, and I quote from a book produced by a renewable energy company that manufactures solar panels, Suntech. It has got a very interesting quote there which I find to be profoundly interesting and insightful. I quote from its production entitled Powering a Green Future, where it says on page 30: The sun delivers enough energy in one hour to meet global energy needs for an entire year. I would have thought that that is an eye-opener for sceptics about solar and, indeed, for those who think that solar can in no way make an impact on our renewable energy diversity mix. It is a very interesting quote. As an aside, Suntech is an innovative company that is manufacturgrong Shi, is at the forefront of the international debate on renewable energy and of course, in particular, solar. The energy received from the sun has enormous potential, and somehow we must get the greatest minds in our country and from around the world to find a way to channel that vast source of energy into a form where it can be used substantially beyond its already significant contribution in the homes and businesses across our country. As I said earlier, I think the federal budget really showed the true colours of the Rudd Labor government on the energy diversity mix and trying to contribute to the energy debate across this country. As everyone will know-and certainly everyone in my electorate of Ryan now knows-the government’s policy was to make it more difficult for many people to access the solar panel rebate the Howard government brought in during its time. I know that it is not fashionable to think highly of the Howard government when it comes to environmental initiatives. Interestingly enough, the solar panel rebate, which was very popular-and certainly very popular in Ryan-has been kept by the Rudd Labor government yet it seeks to exclude so many Australians from it. The Howard government encouraged the people of Ryan to take up solar panels with this $8,000 rebate. The Rudd government, after it came to office, decided in the budget that any household on a collective income of $100,000 was deemed to be rich and therefore in a financial position not to need the rebate. So many, many residents not only of Ryan but from across the suburbs of the electorates of this country felt that they were being singled out and excluded from making a contribution. I want to say very strongly that those in the Ryan electorate on $100,000 would not consider themselves wealthy by any means; they are struggling like their fellow Australians around the country to pay for petrol and groceries and child care. So the decision to means test the solar rebate was only going to be an additional burden and force them to prioritise this below the essentials of putting petrol in their car and buying groceries for their evening meals. So, in other words, the Rudd government’s decision to implement this threshold of $100,000 is a very retrograde step. It is not consistent with its election campaign commitment to very strongly promote the solar industry. I think that really highlights the hypocrisy. We heard a campaign commitment to a 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. This was to be achieved by significantly boosting Australia’s solar, wind and geothermal energy indusMAIN COMMITTEE",148,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments

We all know that so many of the world’s population are excluded from a full and fruitful lifestyle because, really, of fate. If we in the developing world can contribute in some large or small way then we should do that. I should say in concluding my remarks that, interestingly enough, some 30 per cent of the world’s population still live without electricity. Of the global population only one in six has access to the energy necessary for the high standards of living that we in this country enjoy. A billion people use over half the world’s energy and, by contrast, the billion poorest use only four per cent. We, in a very rich and prosperous country with a $22 billion budget surplus left by the Howard government, must surely be in a position where we can invest in technology and provide rebates and incentives that send a very strong public message and contribute to renewable energies that make our world a better place. nity to speak on this bill today. The specific bill is the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008. From the technical side of things, under the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill the Commonwealth government must pass legislation to apply the National Gas Law in the offshore area and external territories. Of greater importance is the need for the Commonwealth to consent in legislation to the conferral of functions under a state law on three Commonwealth bodies-that is to say, the Australian Energy Regulator, the National Competition Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal. This was perfected by the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Bill 2007, which meets the Commonwealth’s obligations under the AEMA by amending the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 to make it the Commonwealth’s application act for the NGL regime and amending the Trade Practices Act of 1974 on the conferral of powers on Commonwealth MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments

206,Mr Trevor (Flynn) (11.41 Am),"I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportubodies by state laws as part of the NGL regime. This act also amended the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to provide for judicial review of decisions made under the NGL. The Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 is a mechanical bill to achieve this purpose. In addition to progressing the National Gas Law, the Rudd Labor government, in a new era of cooperative reform with the states, has already made significant advances in implementing its plans for energy market reform and energy infrastructure. Only recently the Hon. Martin Ferguson MP, Minister for Resources and Energy, and I had the great privilege of announcing budget funding of more than $200 million to a Central Queensland clean coal demonstration project. The funding provides $206 million for the Callide-A oxy-fuel demonstration project in Biloela-a three-stage demonstration of carbon capture and storage technologies. The project involves a retrofit of technology to a 30mw unit at CallideA power station in Biloela that will allow capture and storage of approximately 17,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year for up to three years. CCS involves capturing greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly from coal fired power stations, before they are released into the atmosphere-with the gas then injected and stored deep under the ground in geological formations similar to those which have stored oil and gas for millions of years. CCS is essential for the long-term sustainability of coal fired power generation. With 83 per cent of Australia’s electricity generated from coal, no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to clean up our coal. This project aims to demonstrate a complete and integrated process of carbon capture and storage at an operating electricity generator, and it is vitally important to the long-term future of the Central Queensland coal industry. This project will yield detailed engineering design and costing data and operational experience to underpin the commercial development and deployment of new and retrofit carbon capture technology for electricity generation. In addition, it will produce detailed geotechnical design and costing data and operational experience to support the development of geological storage projects with capacities in excess of one million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The commitment of the Rudd Labor government to this clean coal project in Biloela combines the government’s commitment to tackling climate change with ensuring the energy and industry security of Central Queensland, where I live. There are also a number of major industrial developments under construction or investigation which will see my electorate of Flynn, in particular, and the Central Queensland area boom. The sleeping giant is awakening. Some of these developments include but are not limited to: Belvedere Coal in the Banana Shire; the Xstrata Coal seam in Wandoan; Anglo Coal in the Dawson Valley; the Monto coal mining project; Alinta Limited; coal seam gas producer Sunshine Gas Ltd, teaming with Japan’s Sojitz Corporation to develop a $570 million liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone; the LNG International and Arrow Energy coal seam gas to liquid plant; BG; and seam gas Anglo Coal, a development program for the Mungi coal seam gas field in the Moura area within the central Bowen Basin-just to name a few. The Rudd Labor government recognises that energy security for the electorate of Flynn, for Central Queensland and for all Australians is absolutely paramount to their continued well-being. This bill, I am proud to say, represents the government’s unswerving commitment to addressing climate change and to the energy industry of Flynn, Central Queensland and AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lia generally. As the member representing the powerhouse of the nation, I wholeheartedly commend the bill to the House. for Tourism) (11.48 am)-in reply-In concluding the debate on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008, I firstly thank the member for Flynn for not only his informative contribution in the context of the issues currently before the chair but also what is clearly his view about the potential development of the area in which he lives and that he represents. I agree that Gladstone has a very bright future because of not only the importance of a range of industries such as coal and aluminium but also, all of a sudden, the issue of LNG. It is no longer just a west coast consideration; it is potentially a major industry for the east coast of Australia. In the very near future we could see key developments in the Gladstone region and in the Surat Basin, including the development of an LNG industry based on coal seam methane. That will be potentially exceptionally important for the east coast from the point of view of not only domestic gas but also exporting to the region in which we livewhich is crying out for energy capacity at the moment. As the minister, I am pleased that we have a member representing this key industrial area of Australia who not only well appreciates the challenges to his own region to meet these demands for development but also realises the importance of them for the nation at large and the global community. On that note, I brought this bill to the parliament on behalf of the government with the support of my colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy. The council desires that we continue our progress towards an efficient and effective national regime for the regulation of gas pipeline services. By passing the bill, the Commonwealth parliament will play a key role in facilitating the Ministerial Council on Energy’s cooperative gas access regime. This is not only of national importance; it is also about ongoing microeconomic reform in Australiasomething which was the cornerstone of the Keating and Hawke Labor governments. It is about improvements in productivity and guaranteeing that Australian industry is competitive, especially in a very tough global community. This regime will be underpinned by lead legislation enacted in the South Australian parliament, to which the National Gas Law will be a schedule. The National Gas Law will then be applied by all remaining jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth but excluding Western Australia, through legislation known as the application acts. Western Australia will pass complementary legislation with contents similar to the National Gas Law, rather than apply the National Gas Law established by South Australian law. This bill makes minor amendments to the Commonwealth’s application act, the Australian Energy Market Act 2004; the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977; and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to correct references to the South Australian lead legislation and to the Western Australian government’s complementary legislation. These amendments are required to ensure that the Commonwealth application legislation correctly applies South Australian and Western Australian legislation in the offshore area, and correctly empowers the Commonwealth bodies under the regime. The National Gas Law has been subject to a rigorous consultative process engaging all relevant stakeholders. The final legislation has taken into account issues raised by stakeholders. I appreciate the assistance of stakeholders in finalising this legislative package.

207,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Minister for Resources and Energy and Ministeroperative energy reform agenda. These issues were also subject to further discussion and report at the Ministerial Council on Energy meeting held in Canberra last Friday. I can inform the House that the bill has the full support of all my state and territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy. I would like to thank all those members who have contributed to this debate. It might seem a minor bill in the minds of some people, but I regard it as a significant economic bill in terms of where we are going on the all-important energy front. I appreciate the contributions of the member for Groom, the former Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who prior to the last election had responsibility for this area of government activity; the member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson; the member for Flynn, Chris Trevor, who I have already referred to; the member for Dawson, James Bidgood, a very good local member; the member for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman, a fellow Victorian; and also the members for Cowper, Ryan and New England. I note and appreciate the member for Groom’s support as the former minister, and I would also like to place on record my appreciation of his work as Chairman of the Ministerial Council on Energy over several years. I now appreciate, as the new chairperson of that organisation, just how tough it is herding eight state and territory ministers together to get a uniform, common national outcome, and I give him credit for sustaining that process over a number of years. I also note his remarks in relation to the development of gas and other energy resources in Australia and his warnings that government should not interfere in the normal operations of the market-views which I share. I note the member for Cowper’s remarks in relation to the removal of the excise exemption on condensate, and his unwarranted claim that this will have a disincentive effect on exploration. However, I simply say that, in my mind, the member understands the real situation on the ground. The recent budget changes which are currently before the Senate relate to excise payable on condensate and are only applicable to the North West Shelf. They will therefore have no impact on the taxation regime applying in areas yet to be explored. Therefore-and I stress this-the budget changes represent no disincentive to further exploration. I also note the member for New England’s remarks in relation to biofuels. I appreciate that he has been a constructive contributor to this complex debate over many years but I reject his suggestion that the government is sending mixed messages to the community in relation to support for renewables. The government has consistently recognised that biofuels-in particular, second generation biofuels-are part of a suite of technologies to mitigate climate change and address Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The government is wholehearted in its support both for renewable technologies, including the renewable energy target and the emissions trading scheme, and for carbon capture and storage technologies. I note the member’s comments regarding the emissions trading scheme and urge him to put his views forward in response to the government’s green paper on the emissions trading system, which the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, will release for public discussion and consideration in July. The member for Ryan made comments about support for solar activities. I simply say in response that the member should more thoroughly examine the recent budget papers and the commitments given by the government. There is a renewable energy fund of $500 million. There is also the $150 million Energy Innovation Fund, $100 million of which will be allocated for solar PV and thermal research and development, which is a very significant contriMAIN COMMITTEE bution. I would also remind him that, in terms of the development of solar and other renewables, he should not just have regard for government programs and potential grants, which will be allocated on a merit basis. He should also pay more attention to the potential impact on the renewable energy industry, and the encouragement it will receive as a result, of the introduction of the emissions trading scheme and the renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. It is a package of climate change programs, and changes to the method of operation of the Australian community, which will be of considerable long-term benefit to the renewable industry. If anything, this package will be a world-first and provide leading-edge encouragement to the renewable energy industry. Finally, I thank the member for Dawson for his comments on tourism, and I wholeheartedly support his enthusiasm for Film Australia. I appreciate the contributions of other members on both sides of the House. I think these debates are exceptionally important because they raise a range of issues of not only national importance but also local and regional importance to communities around Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. for Tourism) (11.59 am)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Crime electorate of Stirling: crime. I know from talking to local families that there is an immense sense of frustration within my community about what people perceive as uncontrolled crime rates. The reality is that it is actually very difficult to get a clear picture of the statistics in relation to crime in my electorate, because the WA state Labor government are very tricky in the way that they publish crime statistics. It is very difficult to get an accurate picture of what is actually happening with crime. However, there is one thing I can say: there is absolutely no doubt that it is extraordinarily difficult to get a police response when you require one. This is not because the police are not dedicated-they do an extraordinarily good job; it is because they are extremely underresourced, particularly in the west metro police district, which covers my electorate. Police officers are leaving the police force at a greater rate than they can be recruited, and this remains a very serious problem. At any given time in my electorate of Stirling, the police are approximately 20 per cent undermanned. This makes it virtually impossible for these hard working police officers to do the job they are required to do. Traditionally, crime is the responsibility of the state government, but I have never found that people are terribly interested in those sorts of distinctions; they expect the federal government to be involved and doing something about this problem. The former coalition government was extremely proactive in fighting crime. It created the highly successful National Community Crime Prevention Program, which funded projects across the country that made a MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Australian Energy Market Amendment Minor Amendments
208,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister,155,Adjournment
209,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (11.59 Am),"I rise to talk about the No. 1 concern of people in myreal difference. Sadly, this program was scrapped by Labor in its recent budget. This decision has been a huge loss to my community. In my electorate the National Community Crime Prevention Program funded closed circuit television projects in Mirrabooka, Nollamara and the Corrigin skate park as well as some other successful local initiatives to the tune of more than $480,000. A shocking pickaxe attack on an ATM user last year at one of my local shopping centres, the Nollamara shopping centre, brought some of this unacceptable behaviour to light. I was very pleased to secure $85,000 for a CCTV system to be implemented in conjunction with the City of Stirling to make the Nollamara shopping centre a safer place and a more profitable location for its business owners-who, quite frankly, have felt as though they have been under siege from local criminal activity. This project is now well underway, with engineering works already begun. The system will be fully operational by the end of this month-that is certainly my hope. The new system will help make the centre safer for elderly families and shop staff as well as make it easier for police to catch criminals. Local residents have told me that they just do not feel safe when they visit that shopping centre. This is because of incidents of crime-often very violent crime-antisocial behaviour, graffiti and hooning. And, of course, there are some very serious incidents, including robberies on local businesses. The CCTV system will allow local police to use footage of crime as evidence in order to identify and catch criminals and vandals. Not only will this ensure that arrests are made but also, hopefully, it will act as a deterrent to people committing crime or engaging in crime in the first place. Labor have replaced the National Community Crime Prevention Program with what they have termed the safer suburbs program. This program will provide only $15 million of funding over three years. Five million dollars a year to fight crime, I believe, is completely and utterly inadequate. It is a good indication of the way this government operate: they always want to be seen to be doing something as opposed to actually doing something. Five million dollars a year across Australia is just an extraordinarily pitiful amount for what is an extraordinarily serious problem. I am still determined though that the electorate of Stirling will see some of this money and I have been working in coordination with the City of Stirling on a $1.6 million safer suburbs plan. The proposal is now with the Attorney-General’s Department for approval. This plan includes personal alarms for residents and four extra security officers for patrols to be carried out by the City of Stirling-and this will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I would very much like to place on record that the $1.6 million safer suburbs plan is going to be extraordinarily worthwhile for my community. I am confident that it will make a very big difference. I have been campaigning very hard to ensure that this $1.6 million is allocated to my community. In pursuit of this, I will be meeting with the Mayor and the CEO of the City of Stirling in Canberra next week to discuss the details. (Time expired) Calwell Electorate: Bridgewater Aged Care Facility Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.04 pm)-I want to speak today about the residents and staff at the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility in Roxburgh Park, which is in my electorate of Calwell. In particular, I want to acknowledge the resilience and courage they have shown over the last few weeks during what has been a very difficult time for them and their families. On 20 May, Bridgewater Aged Care Facility went into administration, leaving its 98 residents and MAIN COMMITTEE approximately 156 staff facing a very uncertain future. Late last year, I had the opportunity to visit Bridgewater; it was the third or fourth visit I had made to that facility in the last couple of years. During my visit last year, I had morning tea and conversation with many of the residents and staff at the facility. I even tried, albeit somewhat unsuccessfully, to play a bit of bocce, which is one of their favourite indoor games. The staff and the residents at the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility are very generous people. They were generous with their time and their hospitality. They were just simply delightful and very kind. What impressed me the most during my visit was the sense of community that existed between residents and staff and the strong bonds of friendship that they shared. There was certainly no indication of the financial troubles to come. Indeed, when the news first emerged that the facility had gone into administration, it came as a shock not only to me but also to the local community-to the residents and the staff at the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility. What makes this news all the more troubling is that, when it comes to the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility, we are not just talking about a company or business; we are also talking about people’s homes and their place of work. We are talking about the close friendships that residents have forged with each other over the years, about a sense of belonging and of being at home and among friends that residents at this facility share. And we are talking about the livelihoods of those who work at Bridgewater. In late May many of the staff at the facility were still owed wages dating back to the period before Bridgewater actually went into administration. Yet, despite this, they continued to work and care for its residents. Their dedication and commitment need to be recognised and should be applauded. The Rudd Labor government and the Department of Health and Ageing are doing all that they can to ensure that residents at Bridgewater receive ongoing appropriate care and that staff are looked after during this difficult time. My primary concern is for the welfare of Bridgewater’s residents and staff, and I know that this is a concern shared by the Minister for Ageing. The government has appointed and is funding a clinical nurse adviser team to help the administrator of Bridgewater ensure that residents receive ongoing and quality care. Unpaid staff wages that were owed from the time before Bridgewater went into administration are being covered by the Department of Health and Ageing, which has also brought forward monthly resident subsidy payments so that staff can be paid on time by the administrator. This is in addition to the nearly $314,000 in monthly resident subsidy payments that the department has been paying to the home to care for its residents. The department has also set up a dedicated telephone number for family members and residents to call for further information and assistance, and departmental case managers have been assigned to individual families. In the worse-case scenario, additional help to cover staff entitlements may be available under the Australian government’s General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, should Bridgewater become insolvent. The department, in negotiation with the administrators, has drawn up contingency plans to find alternative and appropriate accommodation for residents. We are all hoping, of course, that it does not come to that. Just how the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility got to this position is now the subject of an investigation, and I do not want to pre-empt the findings of that investigation in any way here today. WhatI will say is that this has been a very difficult time for residents at the facility and MAIN COMMITTEE their families and has been equally trying for Bridgewater staff as well. I have written to them and have spoken about their plight in some of our local newspapers and I know that the Minister for Ageing has also been very vocal on this issue. I can report to the committee that negotiations between the Department of Health and Ageing and Bridgewater’s administrators are ongoing. This is of course a very delicate situation and I do hope that a solution can be found. Between now and then, however, I intend to continue doing all that I can to make sure that the needs and interests of residents and staff at Bridgewater are met. They are first and foremost in our thoughts. I would like to say that we are doing everything we can to assist them. I admire their patience and I admire their wisdom-in particular, the wisdom that they have shown over the last few weeks. They are a wonderful group of people and I hope that I am able to see them remain in my electorate. I look forward to future visits to the Bridgewater Aged Care Facility. Flinders Electorate: Desalination Plant Committee previously-indeed, today-and that is the implications of the desalination plant which is currently being proposed in the Wonthaggi area, specifically on the edge of Kilcunda. I have said that the priority for Victoria for water must be to recycle the 150 billion litres a year which is currently dumped off the coast at Gunnamatta, on the Mornington Peninsular. Firstly, this is waste water which pollutes the coast. Secondly, it has a health effect. Thirdly, it is a monumental waste of water which could be recycled for industry and agriculture. The state is not doing that. It is not working on this recycling plan. It has failed on that front. Instead, it has proposed a desalination plant at Kilcunda. I have talked today about the Your Water Your Say Action Group, which is subject of a costs order which is likely to drive some of them to bankruptcy. But a second element, which has been drawn to my attention in the past week, is the impact on local farmers who have only just been told that they are about to have a major, high-voltage powerline run through the middle of their farms. This line has suddenly emerged. It was not mentioned previously, was not mentioned prior to the last state election, was not mentioned in any of the discussions or community consultation and was not mentioned by successive Victorian premiers in any public advertisements. It brings to my mind four major concerns. The first of those is the value of the land and the livelihood of the farmers themselves. I spoke this week with John and Wilma Coleman of Yannathan, who are dairy farmers. Part of their land is leased out to a farmer who leases and runs a dairy project as well. They have found that these powerlines will go right through the middle of their property. But they are not alone. Vegetable farmers have got the same problem. Dairy farmers up and down this scenic landscape will also have a massive new power line-never announced, never contemplated, never discussed-and it has been sprung upon them at this last minute. The impact will be quite devastating for their property values. I know in the case of the Colemans that any land which they may have contemplated excising to provide for their future retirement will now be almost worthless. That leads to a second element: the loss of productivity. It comes in two forms. Firstly, planes will not be able to spray crops between the pylons. It affects a very large area. Of course, if you are flying near high-voltage pylons there has to be a very large clearance, and that will have a huge impact on the way in which land is sprayed. Secondly, I am advised the MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
210,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.09 Pm),"I want to raise an issue which I have raised in thisway irrigation equipment can be used will also be dramatically restricted. That has an impact on the productivity of the land-that is, the capacity of the land to produce and therefore to produce a return-and it twins with the outright drop in property values for the simple reason that people do not want to live in the shadow of extremely high-voltage powerlines. It is just a reality and a fact of property valuation in Australia. This brings me to the third point, and that is the landscape values that are at risk and are to be lost. A major powerline through the Bass Coast and potentially through Cardinia shire will run through some of the most beautiful land in Victoria. This land potentially includes the Korumburra Hills. The powerline will have to cross the hills. It will be a visual blight in an area which is famous for its landscapes and famous for its tourism and which borders and protects Melbourne from the spread of high-density living. It will do enormous damage. It was never announced, never proposed and never foreshadowed. This brings me, finally, to the fourth element, and that is the fundamental breach of the promise that we would have a plant which, if powered at all, would be powered by renewable energy. All of these promises have been broken. It is a bad proposal. Farmers such as the Colemans need to be protected. (Time expired) Battle of Crete recent anniversary of the Battle of Crete, an anniversary that commemorates the heroic efforts of Australian defence forces and the local community of Crete in 1941. The battle took place three weeks after the Allies’ loss of mainland Greece to Germany. Commencing 20 May 1941, the Battle of Crete lasted 10 days. Allied forces consisted of three British battalions, two New Zealander brigades, eight Greek battalions and six Australian battalions. The invasion was the largest German airborne operation of the war. The Germans parachuted 8,100 men onto the island of Crete. The German parachute forces suffered appalling casualties. The casualties amongst German parachutists were acute, with nearly 4,000 being killed or lost, leading to Crete being subsequently dubbed the graveyard of the German parachutists. Initially, allied advantage was lost with the Maleme airfield in Western Crete falling to the Germans, enabling sufficient reinforcements to land and overwhelm the allied forces. The battle was significant on a number of fronts. But the civil resistance of the local population was, in itself, highly significant-in the spirit of resistance to the Nazi domination and in the bond that was forged between the people of Greece and Australia. Local men and women, and even children, became involved in the battle proper. But, when the allied withdrawal commenced and the many thousands of troops were scrambling to evade capture, the local population put itself at extreme risk in assisting allied forces and Australian soldiers that were left behind. It is my belief that through this period of adversity a bond was formed between the peoples of Greece and Australia. Many Australian soldiers who were left behind were harboured by locals in villages. For every Australian soldier who was caught by the Nazis whole villages were executed in response and to give the message that this was not on with the Nazis. This did not stop the local community. They continued to harbour Australians and others from the allied forces to ensure their safety, and the resistance continued. We know that a bond was forged between the peoples of Greece and Australia through a shared desire to prevail against an invading Nazi force that proved to be a disaster for the local population. MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
211,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12.14 Pm),"I rise to draw the House’s attention to theThrough the theatre of battle and the desperate avoidance of capture, Greeks and Australians sacrificed much and suffered terribly, in unison, side by side, in the defence of the island. I am sure that the ongoing pain and loss endured by the local population throughout the period of Nazi occupation was not lost on the allied forces, which failed to maintain the security of the island to protect the people. The gallantry and the loss were recently commemorated and remembered at many ceremonies around Australia, including in my home state of South Australia. The Battle of Crete and those who perished as a consequence of war were formally honoured through the laying of wreaths all around Australia. I know for a fact that the battle is remembered by many thousands of people around Australia through local ceremonies, informal gatherings and personal reflections. Many of those who themselves pay special attention to the anniversary braved occupation within Greece-that is, many of the veterans whom I have met over the years. They can take great pride in the resilience of the Greek people and the Australian soldiers that was so evident in those dark days and in the bond that they have continued to develop with Australia, their adoptive country, which tried valiantly to defend Greece from invasion and persecution in its hour of need. I hope we continue to acknowledge the important contributions of Australian forces, the Greek soldiers and the Greek civilians in the defence of Crete against the 20 May 1941 German invasion. I hope we also continue the annual commemoration of the Battle of Crete within Australia as an event of national significance and encourage the reflection of the shared experiences of Australians and Greek nationals through the Battle of Crete, the bond forged between our two nations in a time of war and the evolution of Australian-Greek relations within the post-war period. Landcare Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.19 pm)-I rise today to alert this chamber and the House to the concerns in my electorate for the future of Landcare. Landcare is a 20-year-old community driven program with an international reputation for real and measurable environmental restoration. In fact, I was secretary of my local Landcare branch more years ago than I care to remember when Landcare was just starting off and it went through a long series of teething and education issues. We have, I think, developed in rural Australia one of the best programs there is that helps farmers manage their land in a sustainable way with a view both to the environment and to their own profitability. SoI am concerned that, with the new Rudd government, we are going to be throwing a lot away with the cuts that we are now seeing to the Landcare program. Landcare mobilised hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians to work for the environment. It was just a concept no-one had ever considered when it came about. Groups of farmers would get together and talk about what they could do for their entire mini-ecosystem and region and, as time went on, the groups got larger and larger and people got much more of a regional perspective with their Landcare activities. This was something new. This was quite innovative. But now it is accepted and there are so many really, really good examples of what it has achieved. The last budget slashed the budget for Landcare by over 20 per cent and there were no forward estimates published by the program beyond 2008-09. Nine years ago catchment management agencies were developed across all states to deliver and monitor the coalition’s Natural Heritage Trust, NHT, and national action plan for salinity and water projects on the MAIN COMMITTEE ground. I know that Minister Garrett has replaced a lot of our NHT and NAP funding with a program called Caring for Our Country, but it has involved cuts to catchment management bodies of 40 per cent. The recent Audit Office review of CMAs identifies that, without additional funding, some of these bodies would go to the wall. I do not want to see that happen and I honestly do not believe that the Rudd government wants to see that happen. We have unique and special environmental needs along the Murray. The role of the Landcare facilitators is under threat and I have received correspondence from Landcare groups telling me how they will lose their facilitators. They are absolutely essential. It is terrific for a catchment management authority to develop programs to link in with the latest science to understand farming practices, but if you do not have any extension activities, if you do not get out there and show farmers and have field days on farms and talk to farmers-this is the work of extension and I am a great supporter of it-the work you are doing in your little hub in the office in town is really quite wasted. Of course the cuts to the CMAs are going to mean that the volume of incentives shrinks quite dramatically and farmers stressed by the drought are going to have to dip into their own pockets. That is not a bad thing-I am not saying that farmers should not pay-but the balance was just right. There was enough incentive and enough farmer contribution, often in labour effort and management, to make this program work. I have received correspondence from the Corowa and District Landcare group from Bronwyn Thomas. She reminds us of the significant environmental work that group has undertaken since it was established in 1996. It is currently the most active Landcare group in the catchment. They have employed a Landcare officer. They have worked throughout the shire. With their coordinator they have managed 18 projects supported through almost $580,000 of government funding and $650,000 of community and in-kind support. It is all under threat. The Green Gully Landcare Association wrote-and these organisations have all written to Minister Garrett-‘We are seeking assistance in having our funding within our land and water management plans reinstated.’ That is from the Green Gully Landcare Association. Of course it is reflected by the Murray Valley Community Action Group which talks about those same land and water management plans in the vital irrigation districts of the Murray. The Rangeland Management Action Plan, which is in Western New South Wales, has said: How are people in remote and rural communities meant to keep going to be able to access funding under Landcare without a coordinator? What are we to tell our staff in terms of job security as June 2008 comes up? What are we to tell landholders in planning for projects with the uncertainty of Landcare? If Landcare is such a critical element of Caring for Our Country, how can it be achieved without a local coordinator? I appreciate that ministers like to start again and create whole new priorities, but the work has been done, Minister Garrett. It is all there on the table through lots of hard tough years. Please support our Landcare coordinators. Please consider reinstating the funding so that we can keep going with our valuable extension work. Renewable Energy initiatives in the renewable energy and solar industries. Here we have a government that has a real and abiding interest in promoting the use of renewable energy through the implementation of a 20 per cent mandatory renewable energy target by 2020. In electrical energy terms, MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
212,Mr Symon (Deakin) (12.24 Pm),"I speak today in support of the Rudd government’sthat is a target of 45,000 gigawatt hours. We must be serious with renewable energy initiatives if we are to achieve a 60 per cent cut in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Renewable energy will play a critical role in achieving these cuts, as well as providing substantial employment opportunities, particularly in regional Australia. The 2008-09 federal budget includes many measures to support the renewable energy industry and sustainable homes and communities. These include budget measures such as a the Renewable Energy Fund, which provides $500 million over seven years to specifically expand and accelerate the development, commercialisation and deployment of a range of renewable technologies in Australia, and budget measures such as the Energy Innovation Fund, which will invest $150 million over four years to focus on developing clean energy research and development capabilities in Australia. Of that amount, $100 million will be allocated for solar thermal and photovoltaic research and development, including the establishment of an Australian Solar Institute, and $50 million will be committed for research into clean energy technologies in areas such as energy efficiency, energy storage and hydrogen transport fuels. Support for sustainable communities comes from a commitment of more than $500 million for schools and communities to encourage them to reduce their impact on the environment, including through actions to reduce emissions. The government is supporting practical action in our schools to tackle climate change by providing grants of up to $50,000 for schools to install a wide variety of energy and water-saving measures. In fact, the Rudd government has allocated $480.6 million over eight years to ensure all schools can become solar schools. That is over 9,000 schools that will benefit from reduced energy and water bills. I am certain this initiative will play an important role in raising awareness of clean energy technologies in our children at school and in the wider community. Under the Solar Cities program, $18.8 million is being provided to develop new Solar Cities trials in Perth and in my home state of Victoria, at Coburg. Solar Cities will also demonstrate how new approaches to energy efficiency, such as solar power and smart meters, can combine to provide a sustainable energy future in urban Australia. Importantly, the Solar Cities projects will demonstrate the advantages of solar energy to those low-income households that are not able to afford an investment in other forms of energy-saving measures. Support for sustainable homes is backed up by the government’s election commitment to provide rebates for the installation of solar power systems in up to 3,000 households per year over five years. But demand for the solar rebate has been so strong since it was doubled last year that the government has decided to double the number of rebates to be paid in 2008-09. It is now up to 6,000 rebates. Our total commitment of $150 million remains unchanged and, in fact, we have brought forward $25.6 million in this budget for the Solar Homes and Communities Plan to achieve in three years what the previous government set out to achieve in five years. We are rolling out low-interest green loans over the next five years of up to $10,000 for up to 200,000 families to install solar, water and energy efficient products in their homes, and we are providing rebates of up to $500 to install energy efficient insulation in up to 300,000 rental homes. These measures come on top of support for existing programs, including a $1,000 rebate for households to switch to climate-friendly hot water. If we are going to get serious about tackling climate change, we have to take energy and water efficiency into the mainstream and enable households to reduce emissions at least cost. Government support for the solar power industry is at record levels. In addition to funding for MAIN COMMITTEE 6,000 rebates over the next year, we will start putting solar power systems on every primary and secondary school roof in Australia through the National Solar Schools Program. That will drive a significant amount of demand for solar installations across the country. There are more than 9,000 schools, as I said, where a two-kilowatt solar system is a minimum. That will start on 1 July this year. Given the size of the government’s support for the renewable energy industry, including the solar power industry, I believe that the outlook for solar and renewable energy across the board has never been brighter. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.29 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Churches (Question No. 111) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 26 May 2008: Over the last 15 years, what Commonwealth funds have been made available for renovation or refurbishment to Catholic and Anglican churches across Australia. I can advise the honourable member that in the last 5 years the Australian Government has made available just under $24.5million to Anglican and Catholic places of worship for restoration and/or conservation works. Approximately $500 000 of this amount was granted under the National Heritage Investment Initiative, with the remainder being provided through special appropriations by the former Government. While additional funding has been provided for these purposes in the preceding 10 years, this funding came from a range of programs and details are difficult to readily access. Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card (Question No. 116) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 3 June 2008: In respect of the Budget decision to tighten eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card: (a) how many people currently have this card; and (b) what is the financial total in benefits to these card holders. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) There are currently around 277,000 holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. (b) The total in benefits for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holder may vary due to a range of factors. These include the number of prescription medicines or Medicare services they require and whether they have a home internet connection for Telephone Allowance purposes. Some State and Territory Governments and third party concession providers may offer additional concessions to these card holders. The Australian Government’s main purpose in issuing concession cards is to provide access to concession rate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription medicines and certain Medicare services, at a cheaper rate. Holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card can receive Seniors Concession Allowance of $500 a year and Telephone Allowance of $88 a year, plus a further $44 a year if they have a home internet connection.",161,Adjournment
