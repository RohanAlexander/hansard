Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the prevailing high price of petrol in Australiai, what is being done to encourage (a) the discovery of mineral oil or petroleum; (5) the making of power-alcohol or any other satisfactory substitute for petrol? to the honourable member's qliestion is as follows:(o) The Commonwealth Government have offered, subject to certain conditions, a reward of £50,000 to any person, firm, or company who discovers petroleum oil in commercial quantities in Australia. One of the conditions is Quite a number of that it must be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister for Home and Territories that oil to the extent of 50,000 gallons has been obtained, and that the bore is still flowing freely and producing oil in commercial quantities. The full text of tlie conditions are shown in the Gommonwealth Gazette of the 2nd January, 1920. The Government havo also, at present, under consideration certain other proposals regarding the question of the development of oil prospecting in Australia. (6) This question has been receiving the serious consideration of the Government, and will be one of the first matters to be dealt with by the newly-appointed Director of the Institute of Science and Industry. Prime Minister, upon notice1. Did Mr Justice Powers recently invite the federated unions to place their views before him with regard to the basis upon which the Harvester judgment was founded? If so, will the Minister cause to be paid expenses incurred by the comto the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I am informed that Mr Justice Powers didnot invite the unions to place their views before-him, but told them that, if they insisted on challenging the correctness of the Statistician's figures and the Court's findings, and contending that the findings of the Basic Wage Commission should be adopted, His Honour would be bound to give them an opportunity of submitting arguments to show that the basic wage should be increased, but that that would not be done until after all the claimants in thc list had had an opportunity of obtaining awards on what the Court recognised was a fair basic wage, and that it would only be done after notice to employers' federations and federated unions. 2.

The Prime Minister of South Africa has also intimated that he will suhmit claims in connection with this matter as soon as possible. When definite information on the points at issue has been obtained, I will make the information available to honourable members. for Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Wlhether it is his intention to report to Parliament concerning the alleged export of inferior and unwholesome jams, preserved fruits, and flour from Australia? 2. Docs he intend to initiate prosecutions where it can be shown that unwholesome and inferior goods have been exported? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. It is not intended to make any general report. If , however, the honourable member will cite any particular case a report will be obtained. 2.

Is a 10 per cent, tax imposed by the Com, monwealth on all prizes won in Tattersall's sweeps, and collected by the Taxation Department from the promoters of the sweep at Hobart? 2. If so, will he cause a return to be prepared showing the amounts collected yearly for the past five years? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The tax originally imposed on cash prizes in lotteries was at the ordinary rate applicable to the income from property of the winner. The rate of 10 per cent, was imposed from 1st July, 1916, and was increased to 13 per cent, from 25th December, 1918. The rate was further increased to 14 per cent, from 30th October, 1920. Prior to the year 1918-19 the tax was collected from the prize-winners, but thereafter, under the authority of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1918, the tax was collected -from the promoters of the lotteries, as agents for the winners. 2. No statistics are available of the amount of tax derived from the ordinary rates applicable to the income of thc winner. The amounts collected under the special rates in respect of prizes won in Tattersall's sweeps are as follows:191718-Collected from taxpayers £82,484 1918-19-Collected from promoters 71,381 lSlO^O-^Collected from promoters 96,349 Works and Railways, upon notice1.

Pending such consideration the ordering of machinery had to be deferred. It is now considered advisable to vary the original proposal and to decide that expendiproviding additional machinery at an estimated cost of £45,000 for the manufacture of worsted goods, for which the demand has steadily grown during the last twelve months far beyond the existing capacity of the mill. As the latter proposal does not involve the erection of additional factory buildings, action has been taken in the House of Bepresentatives to rescind the resolution of reference to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and Treasury authority has been sought to order the necessary machinery forthwith. 3.

The Chairman of the Expropriation Board does not formulate the policy of the Government with regard to the admission of persons to the New Guinea Territory. Administrator of the Territory advises that the location of employees of the Expropriation Board is at the present juncture very unsettled, and suitable accommodation for families does not generally exist. I am informed by the chairman that the other members of the Board concur in his ' RIF LE CLUBS: ADMINISTRATION. views that it is impracticable to provide accommodation all round for families and employees of the Board unti l (a) the repatriapresenting the Minister for Defence, tion of Germans is completed, the difliculty of upon noticeplacing and replacing new men and consequent moving about of men overcome; (6) the new employees have had an opportunity to judge by him against the administration of rifle vhether their location and circumstances warclubs being transferred to the civilian branch rant the climatic and other risks to women and of the Defence Department? children; and (c) all employees of the Board can be treated alike in the matter of permisbeen paid to each of the rifle clubs associasion to take their families to the New Guinea tions in the respective States of the ComTerritory. 3.

Not always. The existing accommodation, when wholly available, w ill not provide separate lodging for the families of half the married employees. 5. The administrative officers and others mentioned in the question are on a different basis from the Board's employees. Administrative officers are mostly stationed in settlements ; but the* Board's staff are, to a great extent, on plantations, and arc also at first liable to frequent transfers at short notice. 6. Every married man engaged for the Board understood prior to engagement, and agreed to a condition, that he could not take his family to the New Guinea Territory just at present. 7. It is believed that the Board is acting cautiously and wisely and in thc best interests of the wives and families of its employees. The position w ill , however, be considered by the Government in a manner as sympathetic as the circumstances of the case permit. As soon as it is possible to give a general permission to employees of the Expropriation Board to bring their wives and families to the Territory that permission w ill at once be given.

May, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) asked the following questions:1. Whether the Government has yet received its quota of the profits in connection with the wool top operations in association with Messrs. F. W. Hughes and Co.? 2. Whether the profits of the Federal Government amounted to £500,000? 3. What profits did the company named make in connection with the same transaction which was arranged with the Prime Minister? 4. What quantity of wool was dealt with, and what was the value of same in its raw state? I promised to make inquiries in connection with the matter, and now desire to inform .the honourable member that the Government have had no dealings with the firm of Messrs. Ft W. Hughes and Co., but is a party to agreements with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Co. Ltd., which some years ago took over the business of F. W. Hughes and Co. Litigation is now pending in the High Court between the Commonwealth, the Central Wool Committee, and the pany are in question, and as the answers to the questions involve going into matters which will subsequently come before the Court for judicial determination, the Crown Solicitor advises that, in the circumstances, no further information on the matter should be furnished. April, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor), the honourable member for Calare( Mr Lavelle), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) asked the Prime Minister questions concerning the operations of the Australian answers to the honWheat Board.

43,Mr Laird Smith,"On Friday lastI am now able tofurnish the following replies :1. Works and Eailways Department expenditure,£87,486; Navy Department expenditure, £17,589. Total, £105,075. 2. Works and Eailways Department -Tli e expenditure consists of work in connection with sewerage, power station, coal elevators, water and fire services, hot water system and boiler house, laundry, drying rooms, warrant officers' and petty officers' residences, roadsand footpaths, and dredging, &c, and several minor items towards completion of various buildings. Navy Department -This expenditure consists of manufacture and erection of power and auxiliary plant required for lighting purposes and for power for workshops, used in connection! withtraining of Naval ratings. Also expenditure on adapting certain buildings at Flinders Naval Depot for the accommodation of mines. 3. Works and Eailways Department, £665,261; Navy Department, £57,794. Total, £723*055. 4. No. 5: Flinders Naval Depot is now occupied, and expenditure will depend on the experience being gained and' on future naval developments. It is, therefore, not possible to lay down arbitrarily the amount of money required for the proposed works. 6. The reply to the first portion of the question is in the negative. It is intended at present that Flinders Naval Depdt should be used as a training establishment only, but future developments and the result of the approaching Imperial Conference in London may make it necessary to modify this policy. 7. The expenditure incurred on new works at Geelong up to 30th April, 1921, was £2,728, and expenditure on repairs and maintenance, &e., £1,288.

Consideration resumed fro m 6th May (vide, page 8212);, on motion by Mr That duties of Customs and duties of Excise [vide page 726), first, item, be imposed. veryconsiderable time has elapsed' since we had the pleasureo f hearing the M in * introduce the Tariff which is shortly to be considered by usingreater detail. For the present, T understand that a. general discussion is proeeding upon some more or less fundamental economic principles:, and it is from t h a t aspect that I desire to express just a few scattered thoughts, having special ref erenc©> to the address of the Minister delivered when the Tariff was first laid on the table. The Minister, inthat address, took the House seriously, and the country seriously, and, I dare say, he is ta beforgiven if he takes himself a Httletoo seriously. He based hisspeech upon an undertaking given by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in his policyspeech, at, Bendigo; in. the course of which:, latter speech, a promise was made that the Tariff would be introduced as part of' the Government's policy, which Tariff' he. hoped would be satisfactory to the manufacturer. I fear that sufficient time hasnow elapsed to satisfy the optimistic Prime Minister that, whatever else may be said, for his Tariff, he has not succeeded* thereby in entirely satisfyingthe manu;facturer; so that this Government which; is, and always has been, f r u it f u l ' in' promises, has lived' longenough since the introduction of the Tariff to find, anotberprophecy unfulfilled . It is very probable-that the Prime Minister, a convinced Free Trader; in a. Government, the majority of whose members are; equallyconvinced' Free Traders, has now proceeded to England not caring the pro1 verbial '--'tinker's cuss"" whether the manufacturer is satisfied or not. He has p r o bably observed also, if he has taken sot much trouble, as the Minister for Tradfe and Customs doubtless has, that, at -all. , 1 1 events, the Tariff has' notreduced the cost-",26,Naval Bases Expenditure At Flinders
44,Mr Brennan . (Batman) [3.40],A,27,Geeene
45,Ister For,"Trade-and Customs( Mr Greene)of living, and that it has not reduced the cost of government. But, after all, who would barter the roseate colouring of the Minister's rainbow speeches for cheap boots, or cheap bread, or anything merely material of that kind? Labour's policy, as enunciated by our leaders, and, indeed, 'as stated in our platform, is effective protection, the worker to get his full share. That importsatisfied are fallacious and unsound. So ant addendum seems to have been omitted! from the programme of the Government. It was not entirely forgotten in the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs, because if I may so speak without offence to him, he had the audacity to sav that the Government would doubtless be putting into operation the rich advantages' and opportunities whi';h would have resulted if only labour haa not stood in the way of an'amendment of the Constitution proposed for the people's acceptance at the last general election. That was rather a cool statement coming from a Minister who belongs to a party, and speaks for a Government, which, in the most persistent and unashamed way, has stood resolutely and consistently, if it is consistent in anyFor that reason, the stupid and iniquitous thing, in its opposition to the efforts made from time to time by the party of which I am a member to make the Constitution a more flexible instrument responsive to the needs of the people. And because, forsooth, many of us perceived or thought that we perceived the true merits of this proposed temporary tinkering with the Constitution for political electioneering purposes, from which, during the last week or two, and because we declined to accept any such temporary half-hearted proposals for dealing with the basic machinery of government, the Minister, while ad0 mitting that the Constitution needs amending, instead of frankly laying the blame at the doors of the responsible persons, calmly assured us, in introducing the Tariff, that Labourhas hampered development,' and that some of its followers were opposed to the temporary tinkering to which I have referred. Labour, at all events, standing for effective Protection, has not forgotten the claim of the wage-earner, nor has it , I believe, forgotten or neglected the claim of the consumer or the user of commodities. Like the advisers and counsellors of a out our unchaste political leaders. All past monarch-I think HenryI -who Mr Brerman. sent a little boy to his presence to announce the death of his son on the White Ship, this Government has sent into this House its most youthful and most gracious member, with a winning smile, to initiate a policy in which the majority of the Government do not helieve, and supported by arguments which the greater number of the members of the Government are much for the great principle of Cabinet solidarity and responsible government. The conversion of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to what may be called a tactical acceptance of the principles of Protection dates back ta that period when he was eagerly embraced by the Tory High Tariffists of Great Britain, who comprise nfost of the hereditary reactionaries of that country and all the international bigots who were mainly instrumental in first provoking, and afterwards promoting, the war. It was a necessary consequence of his vindictiveness towards the Central Powers, an evil which he could not, consistent with that policy, avoid, that he should dd a great deal of harm to the people of this country. policy was pursued of cutting off our noses to spite our faces in regard to trade with Central Europe. We have done, so far as lay in our power, our ignoble part in starving the women and children of the Central Powers, and incidentally we have robbed ourselves of some of the best markets of the world for our wheat and wool, and have led ourselves into a quagmire we have been making frantic efforts to extricate ourselves. There were many almost perfect flowers of speech in the Minister's oratory. They were not quite fresh; still, they were fragrant, seductive, and, like the scent of the rose, reminiscent of other and, perhaps, happier days. Somewhere I seem to have heard before the expression used by the Minister that "" we must develop this great continent and exploit its unexploited resources."" He might have added that we must people these unpeopled spaces, cultivate these uncultivated lands, fence our unfenced paddocks, milk our unmilked cows, plant the unplanted mangel-wurzel, dig out the undug rabbits, eradicate the uneradicated stinkwort, prickly pear, and bot-fly; and, I was about to add, but will not, chase these things, although true, are not quite relevant to the Minister's main theme. In order to do those things in great measure, and w i th great success on national lines, we must have population; and it has been well proven already that by the processes of natural increase and immigration from the British Isles there w ill be no substantial, certainly no revolutionary, change in our population within the next quarter, or perhaps half, century. So far as immigration from other countries is concerned, the Government have deliberately discouraged that by, on the one hand, a policy of gross breaches of f a it h with the people of other lands already settled here, to which I have made frequent reference before; and, on the other hand, by a policy of land monopoly-no t perhaps that the Minister is immediately concerned with the latter, although he which in State and Federal politics has already been the worse offender in that respect. unhappily, that we must develop this country by spending money. not challenge the Minister's judgment as an expert in prodigal spending; on the contrary, I think public opinion will acquit him of any niggardliness in spending the people's money. the seem to suggest that this Tariffi n volves, according to his own view, the laying out of money in Australia for the purpose of promoting local industrieswhich we all desire-by way of subsidy, apparently, from the general public. with the raking in of revenue. cerned with the spending than the saving of money. We do not people a continent in the same way as we set a table for a dinner-party, and when we have everything ready invite our guests to attend.

The secondary industries, in which we are all so deeply interested, and I , particularly, having regard to the electorates I represent, follow upon the primary industries; and it is a very absurd policy to make -your structure wider than the foundation upon which it rests. The Minister said, in speaking of our unexploited resourcesThere is as much sense in growing our greasy wool here and exporting it, and bringing it back from overseas in'the form of clothes, as there would be in growing our wheat and exporting it, and having it gristed abroad and imported into Australia in the shape of flour. There is just as much sense in leaving ou? fields untilled, and the soil unbroken, as there is ih leaving our iron deposits undisturbed and importing the iron and steel we require. belongs to a party It is just as sensible, from the AustraUan point of view, to import all the flour we require for feeding our people as to leave our The Minister said, rather iron deposits undisturbed and our blast furnaces cold. Whatever may have been our position in the past, we cannot afford to put I do up with this waste for a single day longer. All very true, but in these as inother matters people follow the line of least resistance, and do what pays best. That On may be sordid and dreadful, but it is other hand, his statements true. The Minister, although he Las shown himself to be a good father and a wise counsellor, has not given any reason why the farmers in the Mallee should be diverted from growing wheat to exploiting our great. steel resources, or setting up factories for the pickling of goat skins and the making of knittin g needles and tacks-to mention some of the industries quoted by the Minister.

' TheMinister, labouring a hoary, economic fallacy, deplored the waste involved in sending money out of the country, but my concern for the people of my electorate, and, incidentally -ma y I say, though I -may not be believed-for the people of the Commonwealth as a whole, is not so much as to what is sent out of the .country, but -as to what is got in return for its expenditure tolerable evil of .the cost of living.

The Minister, in showing the need for spoke of our losses in the war. said nothing-becaus e it would not have been relevant-of our losses in human lives; he was speaking of out material losses. He went on to point out that our shores were girt about with -enemies, and that although the seas were kept partly open by the British Navy and -our. own, we were greatly hampered by the absence of factories for supplying the 1 requirements, for the making of which, had we been wise, we should have provided in anticipation of the war. The honourable gentleman, however, confuses -a defence policy w i th an economic policy. If we are to have, which God forbid , a repetition of the horrors of f u t i l e war, and if this country is to be beset with enemies, we must prepare to live for a time without communication w i th the outside world. While so circumstanced, we must, like the Swiss Family Bobinson and Bobinson Crusoe, make the best of our isolation. suggest that we should live in time of peace under war conditions? wish to put the pickling of goat skins and the making of knittin g needles and tacks on a war footing? » Does he desire, not as a sane economic policy for normal peaceful times, but as a defence measure, that we should make the sacrifice which he seems to suggest is necessary of maintaining artificial industries in time of peace as a guarantee against invasion and loss of communication with the outside world ? The Minister also pointed out that, if we had laid down some scores of keels we could have got over the great difficulty of carrying our produce across the seas in time of war and after, assuming the seas to have been kept at least partially open. now speaking, of course, of a State enterprise; and it comes, again, rather curiously from the Minister to instil the policy of Labour, which is, State-owned amd State-made ships. w i ll the Minister vtell me how far his prophecy regarding the ships to be constructed during the past twelve months, under his Government, has been fulfilled ? something about Cockatoo Island Dockyard and about the discontinuance of Commonwealth shipbuilding. In facjt, I seem to have heard enough to convince me that State shipmaking Australia self-contained, building by a Government which He does not believe in State shipbuilding is not likely to be a very great success. Still, it is Labour's policy, and all I would say to the Minister when he tells us-speakin g of our tremendous national debt-that we must have more backs to carry the burden, is that we also need more brains to distribute the burden. We have., as he reminded us, tremendous national resources. The Ministeri n stanced our steel works, and pointed out the danger of dumping. ' As to these national assets, which neither he in bis wisdom, nor others in theirs, have exploited to their fullest extent-the people not having the capacity or the desire to .exploit themI would suggest that, since he has become so very optimistic in regard to the operations of State-built ships, he might promote a policy of State-controlled and State owned steel works. But my concern is that the Minister, who seems to dread the But does the Minister octopus power of the importing monopolist just as much as I do, is quite ready to Does he hand over his powers and his duties as trustee of the nation from the importing monopolist to the manufacturing monopolist, without any superintendence on his part, or on that of his Government. I am .one of those who believe that the national resources of this country should be controlled by the nation for the nation, and that the Government should be trustees for the whole nation. Of course, I will be told by the cynics that they can quote many examples of State-controlled enterprises, in this and other States,' which have failed. As a matter of fact, it is generally found on examination that the contention is mere political claptrap, deHe is signed solely to discredit some one political party or other. But even if it were true that there had been failures, I would never confess to having so. little confidence in a really representative GoBut vernment as to admit that we could not undertake to control or manage State enterprises w i th advantage to the State."" As trustees, the Government have recourse to funds, which is one of the first I seem to have heard necessities for what the Minister himself calls continuous operation and mass production. They have recourse, also, to' the best brains and the richest experience the world can furnish. And, therefore, I must not for one moment be taken to suggest that Australia's industries, whether secondary or primary^ should be neglected in favour of foreign trade. that, where there are potentially great industries in a country, and where private enterprise, for one reason or another, has no't grappled with them, with the advantages which Nature and situation give them against foreign competition, then-if not sooner-it becomes the duty of the nation to ""exploit"" those national enterprises. Of course, I will he met with the objection that we have not the power to do much within the limits of . our Constitution. am net addressing myself to this subject on the supposition that those shacldes and gyves which we have voluntarily forged about ourselves will -be for ever voluntarily retained. matter from the view-point that at no very distant date-and upon such date as we may select-thes e unfortunate limitations will be finally removed. Minister himself pointed out that in England at present there are very sinister combinations of manufacturers, and that these have been publicly declaring, if not boasting, that by the process of combination they were able to dump their products into other countries and undersell the manufacturers of those countries, if necessary, at a lo3s. Of course, that is so; but it entirely bears out what I have been endeavouring to show, namely, that we gain nothing by supplanting one body of exploiters with another body of at least potential exploiters. adopted Labour's policy of effective Protection-whic h protects at once, if afc all, the manufacturer as well as the worker and the consumer-mus t not be regarded for a moment as assenting to the view that this Tariff, which the Minister introduced with such ornate phraseology, is going to be' a cure either for the high cost of living or for the just complaints of the working classes in regard to the reward of their labour. This is all I would urge with respect with the Minister in eloquence. I have not to our Protectionist policy, and in reat my disposal the vast .volume of mategard fo the maintenance of Australia's rial on which he made his speech; but industries: subject without cant or hypocrisy, and events, that I should make my attitude Ifr. Brennan. should not attempt, in our arguments in support of a protective policy, to hop from one foot to the other, and then to stand on our heads, while using a number of mutually destructive arguments ih regard But I do say to the whole question. Por instance, if we are prepared to say-as I am-that it is good to establish Australia's industries, and that it is also a good thing to pay fbr their establishment, we should be ready to consider also how far we ought to go in subsidizing these industries, and how far the general public, and especially the working public, should be called on to pay and should be in turn protected. That is the simple question which we have to answer. But when I the Minister labours his theme in order to pretend that he is going to cheapen commodities in Australia by making them more difficult to obtain from other sources, and by paying something addiI approach the tional to people to make them in this country, I can only refer to his remarks thereon as so much cant and humbug, and as being absolutely inconsistent with The three-fourths of his arguments, if they were to be followed logically. I have not said anything concerning the long table of individual items; but on the general question I thought it my duty to say a word or two. I do not know that anything I have said is especially directed to the winning of votes of the manufacturers of the electorate of Batman. It so happens that Batman is a great manufacturing localityone of the greatest, in fact, in the Commonwealth. I feel certain that had I contented myself with going on the platform and shouting loudly for dutiesTherefore, , 1 , as one who even prohibitive dutiesI could not have done myself any harm; but, certainly, such procedure would not have satisfied my view as to the claims of the whole people, and would not have satisfied my .own conscience. honourable member has satisfied his conscience this afternoon. proach this subject?' fearlessly and logically.

Having done that, and having divested this discussion, so far as I can, of a great deal of the makebelieve which is usually associated therewit*, I shallbe satisfied to abide by the result of our honest and united endeavours. It is such a long while since the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) made his speech in introducing the Tariff that honourable members have been inclined to d r if t from the principles which the Minister then laid down. always appeared to me, in discussing the fiscal issue, that people have viewed the matter from a wrong angle, in that they have talked about Free Trade and Protection. 'During the war, the Government plainly revealed the real angle of consideration; for they made ifc a matter of Free Trade or prohibition. And in prohibiting, as they did, some of our ordinary imports, they suggested quite a new view of the fiscal question. people are beginning to see that it is no more possible to have true Protection, as many people speak of it-bu t which is really prohibition-tha n to have Free Trade. Australia who now go to either extreme. The whole world has altered its views, to a large extent, at any rate, as a result of the overwhelming experience of the war. To-day we are aU inclined to take a more moderate view of things than we were before the great cataclysm, because, in view of the great damage and loss the world has sustained, all peoples have in some respect become more sympathetic and more forbearing towards one another than they were before the war. Asi t is a long time since the Minister about by the imposition of higher duties introducd the Tariff, I want to refer to should f a l l upon the primary producers. one or two of his remarks, and deal with them in order. Prime MinisterThe Government has carefully prepared a new Tariff. It believes it will prove satisfaceverything in this T a r i ff puts an. in tory to the manufacturers of the Commoncreased cost on the handling of this prowealth. Having said so much., I may be Very few .people w ill question .the statement that this Tariff w ill certainly please the manufacturers of the Commonwealth,. but there is another body of people in Australia whose interests ought also to be considered. Later on in his speech the Minister saidHere we are to-day with this enormous debt of over £750,000,000 It has since increasedand a population of 5,000,000 and a territory acknowledged to be undeveloped, and which we know we can only develop by the expenditure of further money. Later on he saidBreaking up a big estate 40 or 50 miles from a railway and establishing settlers on small blocks is a useless step unless we are prepared to provide those settlers with railway communication and other means of getting their produce to the markets of the world. It has And then he made a statement which has just been quoted by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan.)It is just as important that we should mine and work our iron as that we should -work our fields. Towards the end of his speech he made this significant remarkThe Treasurer believes that in the immediate future he will probably get a little more revenue Nowadays, than he has been receiving in the past, but my belief is that it will not be very long before there will be a reduced revenue from Customs and Excise duties as a result of this Tariff. I have quoted these statements consecuA n d there are few people in tively in order to show what appears to me to be the greatest weakness of this Tariff, and that is that it meets too comprehensively and completely the statement made by the Prime Minister that it is a manufacturers' Tariff. We all know that Australia came through the war solvent as the result, not of its secondary productions, but of its primary productions. Yet here in this T a r i ff the Government definitely, and with a complete knowledge of the position, lay down the theory that.all increased taxation brought The Minister tells us that it is useless He said, quoting the to burst up estates 40 or 50 miles from a railway unless we give the people facilities for handling their produce; yet , | | i duce. It is time the primary producers.",32,Geeene
56,Mr Fleming (Robertson) [4.28],"awoke to the fact that the schedule before us to-day will increase their burdens in a far greater proportion than is equitable, and to a degree which may lead to disaster. In the past they have borne the greatest burden of taxation. Before tlie inauguration of the Commonwealth, taxation was imposed upon them in a direct form for the purpose of producing funds with which to cany on governmental services, and then upon the creation of the Commonwealth Parliament a Protective Tariff was imposed which has since been increased on three or four occasions, each time falling more -heavily upon the primary producers. At the same time there has not been in the slightest degree any reduction in the direct taxation originally imposed upon them. all these heavy increases will tend to make commodities cheaper. Minister has made that statement, but I do not think it will bear inspection. He may believe in what he has said, but if that were the only issue at stake I think he would find a tremendous majority of opinion against him. The great trouble is that this Tariff places a heavier burden upon those things which have made Australia what it is to-day. Time and again fresh taxation has been imposed on the very industries which have given Australia its place in the world, and this Tariff will add still more to the cost of breaking in and improving new country, of handling it , and of getting produce off it to the markets of the world. A t the same time nothing is done to relieve the primary producers of the direct taxation imposed upon them. The proposition is entirely .unfair. Sooner or later it must break primary production down. Despite the fact that consumers have been paying very high prices for primary products, every one knows that for the last ten years primary production has not been a paying proposition. No man can go into ' the market and buy freehold land in any portion of the eastern States and make grazing on it earn him a reasonable rate of interest on his outlay, unless he works a family to death in the pursuit of dairying. If we are to have a protective Tariff we ought to do something to even it up. The protection ought not to be all onesided. It ought not to be a manufacturers' Tariff. It ought to be a Tariff fbr all production, and I see no insuperable difficulties in the way of having such a Tariff. In the past people have been under the impression that manufacturing interests only were in need of protection; but there is no reason why to-day they should not view the matter in a truer light. In his speech the Minister spoke about making Australia a self-contained nation. No more ridiculous statement could have been made in a deliberative assemjbly than to say that a nation should be self-supporting. The honourable member for Batman has exposed the position in its true light. If we produce an article we must part with it for another. We must trade. We do not want gold coming here. We do not want to be in the position in which America finds itself, flooded with gold to such an extent that it cannot trade with other countries. When we produce an article, raw or finished,, we must trade it for some other article. It is sheer nonsense to talk about the country being self-contained, and I hope that when the Minister replies he will explain what he means by talking about making a country self-contained. If he can show us how we can carry our tremendous burden of debt without exporting goods there may be something in his contention. If he can show us that we can realize on all our primary products and still not export them again, there may be something in his argument. But as long as we have to pay interest on our burden of debt, so long are we obliged to export our products. We must export in some form or another. It is impossible for this or any other country to be self-contained. means that so long as Australia exports goods it must get goods in return ? ber believe that 1 would like the Minister to show me how a country can export goods without importing others, except by receiving currency for them. We have a certain amount of interest to pay on our debt, and we must export goods to that extent, but if we want to get a return over and above the interest we arecalled upon to pay upon our debt we must get other goods in return.",33,Geeene

The Minister repliedFor instance, But, inasmuch as the preferential duty in favour of Great Britain has been raised, the duty on the general rate is in nearly every instance higher. This is one of the most important features of the Tariff, and one which makes it to some degree acceptable to those people who, on other grounds, would fight it from end to end.

All these things seem to me to indicate that in the preparation of the Tariff no due consideration has been shown for those who live outside our cities. I rose to-day to -show as clearly as I could that this Tariff is really what -the Prime Minister said, and what I feared, it would bea manufacturers' Tariff. If the Minister could show that our primary producers would be helped as our manufacturers are to be under this Tariff some of us might be prepared to support it ; but, seeing that the primary producer has to compete in the world's markets, an attempt should at least be made in a Tariff of this kind to put him on an equal footing with the manufacturer. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), in the course of his speech on Friday last, said he thought our local .manufacturers could compete with the manufacturers of any other part of the world. I made an interjection, the exact nature of which I forget for the moment, and the honourable member replied that he was not going to pass a vote of want of confidence in the working men of Australia by saying that they oould not compete with the workers of other countries. It seems to mo that the honourable member's contention was entirely wrong. Our distance from other great manufacturing countries, and the fact that we have the cheapest coal aud the best iron in the world, as well as very competent workmen, afford our manufacturers a great natural protection. handicap. handicap to the man on the land. The manufacturer alone, and not the primary producer, is considered under this Tariff. The bonorable member for Hume said There that he would not express a want of confidence in his fellow workmen, and at the same time announced that he was prepared to. vote for a high Protective Tariff. Surely, in supporting a high Protective Tariff he actually agreed to a vote of want of confidence in his fellow workmen. We have, as I have said, the cheapest coal and iron and the protection whioh is given by thousands of miles of freight. Wo know that our men can produce, when they please to do so, manufactures equal to those of other countries, and,.in the circumstances, it is absurd for an. honourable member, to say that he is not going to pass a vote'of no-confidence in his fellow workmen when, at the same time, he votes for highly protective duties. I return for a moment to our relations with the Old Country. It seems to me that we owe it to Great Britain to do what we can to encourage our rolationBhip with her by way of trade as well as sentiment, and I think that we are passing a vote of censure on.the workers of this country when we say that wa have",35,Geeene

By virtue of this, '.the Minister, with the sanction of Parliament, is allowed to make ""reciprocal arrangements With the Dominions and foreign countries; and, to my mind, this is a most useful provision. Then, there are what are known as deferred duties; that is, duties imposed now, but which do not come into operat i on unti l some f u t u r e date, and these also may be found Useful.

Again, we have to remember the lessons taught us by the war. Australia, in many lines, should certainly be self-contained. Especially is that the case, I take it , . with iron and steel and other allied items.. The iron industry should bo established here if it be-'possible, and to 'that end the country should be prepared to make sacrifices, considering that it is the basis of so many other'iridustries. I have often held up the BrokenH ill Company as an example of -how the Government should enter' into industrial enterprises. company' has shown that what is required is a business like examination of everything connected with an industry before definite steps are taken; and this is what the Government should remember before they come to this House and ask for the necessary money. At the same time, I recognise the great woTk that the Broken Hill Company is doing. I have had the privilege of going over the Newcastle works more than once, and of seeing how the works are expanding, and realizing the number of men that will ultimately be employed there* While I thus express my admiration of what the BrokenH ill Company is doing, and while I intend to do what I can for the industry, I submit that we must be exceedingly careful not to give that strong organization too much of a hold over the iron and steel and the"" many allied trades in Australia. dumping from Belgium. pointed out, the Tariff Bill provides binders at £100, for next year's delivery; against dumping, and I commend the proand I am sure that a Massey-Harris or vision, Australia, in my opinion, is Well au American machine could not be purfitted for many manufactures, seeing that chased for the money.

If we are to give effect to"" the voice of the people of' Australia, as often expressed, we must impose duties that are effective from a protective point of view. There aro, as we know, many countries producing woollen' and other goods that we ""are capable of producing here, and the rates at .which, labour is paid in those countries -are not anything like the rates that rule here. That being so, such duties ought to be imposed as will make up to the local manufacturer the difference in wages. But there may be other conditions which give the foreign manufacturer a decided advantage; and it is necessary to take everything into account, and fix such duties as will give the local manufacturer a fair chance to comThis pete, in view of the standard observed in Australia. There is another danger which has' to -be guarded against. If we are not careful we may impose too. heavy a duty in the case of a certain industiy we desire to see established, and thus bring about the destruction of a still more important industry already established here. As an example, we may take the agricultural industry. Farmers in Australia must be treated fairly. It is absurd to think that they are able to pay any price for their implements of industry; this they cannot do. If we put on such duties as allow the farmers to be exploited to suoh an extent that agriculture .becomes unprofitable, we shall destroy the best industrywe have. At the present time we cannot complain very much -While reapers and! binders, which are a typical example, are at their present prices there is no parpeople at Sunshine, .a few months ago,",38,Geeene

87,Mr Atkinson,"As I have already were taking orders for Teapers andbers sold at under £50, on terms. them then, and they were the .cheapest article the farmers bought. changing times and conditions, there is no reason why reapers and binders of all kinds should not in a short time be bought at a price well under £100, if there is reason for high prices now. In my opinion there is no need at the present time for duties on these and many other farming implements. turers are doing very well at present; but, still, the time may soon arrive when they can fairly claim Borne assistance against American and other companies. It is claimed that in consequence o i the New Zealand Parliament some years ago taking the duties off certain articles, such as reapers and binders, manufacturers in 'the Dominion were put out of business, aud. that American people now practically exploit the market, with the result that the' price there is higher in the absence of any duty or loeal competition than it is in Australia, where there is local competition. assuming it to be the case, surely there is a happy medium by which the loeal manufacturers may be encouraged and the farming . industry not .unfairly handicapped? That is all I ask for, and I think it is possible of realization. On -some of these lines, therefore, I may be prepared to support a lower duty than -that now fixed in the Tariff. However, at the present time. I merely wish to make my position clear-to show, what may be expected of me when the items are before us. Wie do not impose the Tariff merely to bolster up the interests of certain manufacturers; the benefits of a Tariff should -be as wide as the country itself. Our object in founding industries is not only to make the few people who own them rich; we desire that the benefits shall go further, and be equally distributed all through the community. A t any rate, we expect fair wages to be paid to the employees engaged in the industries. That is rather difficult to regulate under the present Constitution, but. some means must be provided for reviewing the operation of these duties. If , while the manufacturers are doing exceedingly well, their employees are not receiving a fair proportion of the profits, there must be a .Allowing' for means by which this Parliament, or some other body, can review the duties. evidently a supporter of New Protection. been. I suppose I am the most consistent exponent in this House of profit-sharing and co-operation, and upon that idea The manufacNew Protection is more or less based: I hope that when we are dealing with the items I shall .be able to help the Committee in arriving at what are equitable duties. I intend to play a free hand, and treat each item from a business point of view, regarding the. whole Tariff as if the country's business were my own. I know it is difficult to strike the happy medium in all cases, but I hope that any vote I give upon the items will be, at any rate, recommended by common sense. believe that an 'effort has been made in this Tariff to encourage the secondary industries which are so very much needed in this young land. The conditions which have existed during the last six or seven years have undoubtedly shown the necessity for not only encouraging primary production, but also for founding and fostering those secondary industries which are essential to the stability of the Commonwealth. As a result of conversations I have had with the Minister, I believe that he will be agreeable to making some of the items,' to which exception is now taken, acceptable to the interested parties. I am pledged to a policy of Protection, and' I do not think we should listen to the voices of those who desire a reduction of duties, except in respect of those commodities which it' is impossible to produce within the Commonwealth. There is much to be said for deferred duties, which will come into operation as soon as an effort is made to establish an industry. I believe that the Minister will take care, when we are dealing with the items, that the public are not made to pay ^ higher prices for imported commodities which are in general use, and are not produced in sufficient quantity in Australia.

96,Mr Francis (Henty) [5.18],"Itrade with Eastern, countries. Recently, the Commonwealth appointed Commissioners to advertise our industries aEroad. After all, unless we are prepared to advertise in the markets of the world we shall not achieve by the Tariif all that we desire. Although we number, only 5,500,000 people, we have a great capacity for production, and I believe that under a proper policy of Protection we shall be able to hold our own in the markets of the world with manufactured, goods as we do now with wool, wheat, and other primary products. Wool was the salvation of the Commonwealth during the war, and I feel that, despite all the obstacles and difficulties that confront us, the wool problem will be solved to the satisfaction of all concerned. It should be possible to build up from the wool industry a number of secondary industries, which would be' of immense advantage to the Commonwealth. During last week Parliament gave consideration to a means of marketing the accumulation of 2,700,000 bales of Bawra wool without detriment to the oncoming clip. It has been suggested that it would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth to arrange to sell the wool to Germany on extended terms of credit. If we are badly in need of customers, it would pay us to deal with them, on almost any terms.. It seems to.me that it would be more satisfactory to the Australian people if , instead of selling the wool to foreign countries, on extended credit, we were to say to our own people and others who might be encouraged to come here, "" Take these 2,700,000 bales of wool on credit, over an extended term of years, and manufacture them locally into clothing."" If that were done, we might be able to place on the markets of the world the finished article instead of the raw material as we are doing now. We havo heard a great deal about the difficulties experienced by those engaged in local secondary industries. The differences between employer and employee are generally known, there is harmony between those two interests our industries will not be the success that they should be. greatest disabilities, and an important argument in favour of the proposed alteration of the Constitution, is that most of our population is concentrated tn and about the great cities. that the Tariff will encourage the larger country centres to build up secondary industries which, will utilize the raw' mate-, rial produced in those localities. Statistics show that in the year 1918-19 the factories of the Commonwealth used £142,000,000 of raw material to which the process of manufacture gave an added value of £79,000,000, whilst £38,000,000 was paid in wages. I do not see why we should not be able to double and treble thosefigures,and make ourselves independent ' of Japan, America, and other nations to whom we are at present selling the raw material that we could manufacture here. But we must give security to people who invest their money against both industrial troubles and foreign competition. I have no desire to repeat what has been said by other members. We Lave been told in the newspapers tliis week that an ample supply' of linen is of importance to this Commonwealth. Hitherto we have got our supply of this and many other articles .from overseas,. although we oould have produced herethe raw material necessary for their, manufacture, and made our own requirements, exporting the surplus to the eastern and other markets. We are a young community, and should take a lesson from older countries. The other daya leading' Melbourne merchant said to me, ""We feel that the door has beeu closed against us, but we do not intend to lose the fine businesses that have been built up in Melbourne and throughout th*: Commonwealth. We have had a good'! spin, and have had every opportunity fossnpplying the market. Now we are going to establish cur own works bere for the manufacture of everything that we have previously imported."" Mr J. H .

These have been countries in which the primary-producing interests were important, and which, like .ourselves, had great undeveloped territories and large natural resources. But is it possible for any honourable member to say in regard to any of them, "" Here is a country which by the adoption of Protection ruined its primary producers.""?' country whose geographical situation is like that of Australia ? members to produce a solitary instance in which the adoption of Protection has prejudiced the primary producers of fche country. I do not propose to go back to ancienfc times to' show that the nations which have neglected the development of secondary industries have had to give place to those who have fostered such industries; I do not propose, fco go among fche crowded centres of Europe, because honourable members may say that those countries provide no fair analogy and that it would be impossible to draw reasonable comparisons. I do propose, however, to turn to the history of a great country which is very much like our own in thafc it was opened up by the British race, and in that it has a vast area; and like our own, again, in that ifc possessed great undeveloped resources Buch as those of ours to which' the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) referred somewhat sarcastically this afternoon.

Reading those debates, I was struck-and I now refer, not only to those of 1889, but to all those which have taken place upon this all-absorbing -topic in America-by one thing above everything else; that.is, by the similarity of the speeches made in opposition to a protective tariff w it h those which have been uttered in this House on the present occasion. eternal. that I have never read them. convey the insinuation that honourable members had read the speeches of members of the American House of Representatives and had repeated them here.; but I emphasize that those who opposed the i imposition of America's protective tariffs were imbued with exactly the same views and desires as certain honourable members of this Chamber, and that -precisely similar statements have been made in each of the two countries, namely, that if a protective policy is adopted the result w ill be the r u in of its primary producing interests. When we turn to the actual results, however, we find that, in the United States of America, not only did the tariffs not have that effect but, indeed, that the very opposite happened. I shallquote from the speech of McKinley himself when introducing the great McKinley tariff. Ho saidWe have now enjoyed twenty-nine years continuously of Protective Tariff laws (the longest uninterrupted period in which that policy has prevailed since the formation of the Federal Government). I want honourable members' to note my interpolation at this stage. My desire is to show what sort of a Tariff had existed in the United States of America during those twenty-nine years. T a r if f rate in 1850, when the population -of the TJnited States of America was not very much greater than is our own today, was 27 per cent. reduced to a little more than 18 per cent. It was raised to the average of 40 per cent, between 1862 and 18o6. I do not think the average T a r if f rate amounted to 41.63 per cent., including all the free items and everything else. In 1884, after the I hope to have the Tariff Commission had recommended a reduction of 25 per cent., the average rate was increased to 42.60 per cent. In 18S5 the duties went up to an'average rate of 47.2.1 per cent., and after that date the average rate was about 47 per cent. The measure which McKinley introduced raised the average Tariff rate to 51 per cent. that was only upon dutiable goods, and not also on free goods. the honourable member for his correction. I assure the MinisterA t any rate, the average rate in the McKinley T a r if f waa, as I have just said, 51 per cent. There are very few of our duties at present existing which approximate anywhere near to that. I have not worked out the average rates under our Tariff to-day, but it is certainly nowhere in the vicinit y of 51 per cent. about 27 per cent the end of a period during which there was an uninterrupted Protective T a r if f We find ourselves in a condition of independence and prosperity the like of which has never been witnessed at any other period in the history of our country, and the like of which has no parallel in the recorded history of the world in all that goes to make a nation great and strong and independent. We have made extraordinary strides in arts, in science, in_ literature, in manufacture, in invention, in scientific principles applied to manufacture and agriculture. In wealth and credit, and national honour we are at the front, abreast with the best, and behind none.

And then he saysTlie history of agriculture in the United States should be a lesson to Canada. AndI say it should be a lesson to Australia. But this is the testimony of a public man with the object ""lesson right alongside him, and he points the moral. He points to the history of agriculture in 'America under a highly Protectionist Tariff, and he uses that as his justification as Leader of the Agricultural party in Canada for asking the Dominion Parliament to strengthen its Tariff laws. According to the cables this morning, the Bill was introduced into the Canadian Parliament yesterday. If I cared to do so I could give instance after instance of a similar kind to show that never in the history of the world, at least so far as I am acquainted with it, has there been a single case in -which agriculture has suffered as the result of a Protectionist Tariff. On the other hand, I could give instance after instance in which agriculture has suffered as the result of a Free Trade policy, and I know no more significant .an instance than the history of agriculture in Great Britain itself. Now, I propose to put another witness into the box. witness from Argentine, where the conditions more nearly approximate to our own t stances from Argentine which would surprise the honourable member. complaining a little while ago about the cost of agricultural machinery in Australia. It costs a great deal more to buy the same machinery in Argentine. I call one moTe witness into the box. He also is the head of a great Dominion, and of .a country which has undeveloped resources like our own, and which derives its greatest wealth from primary production. I refer to Mr Massey, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. Speaking on .the 16th April, this year, he saidThe wheat position had not been handled with a great deal of wisdom. A very difficult -situation had arisen in New Zealand in regard to supply. The reason for the increased price guaranteed recently was that wheat growing was going out of existence as the result of the general increase of production and Tariff. 8293 tlie fact that it was impossible to buy the implements for wheat cultivation at less than three times the pre-war cost, and the price of machinery and wages had advanced tremendously. cally apply to Australia also. Free Trade country so faras agricultural implements are concerned, but I will be able to show that there is not a single class of agricultural machinery that does not cost more in New Zealand than it does in Australia; that is so, even in respect of the reaper and binder. position in Australia, when we will also have to go out of the business. The Minister cannot show much difference in price hero. which require a good deal of answering. Honourable memhers of the Country party have wandered all over the country making the assertion over and over again that a policy of Protection is inimical to the interests of the primary producers. I ask them for their proof. this Tariff was inimical to the interests of the primary producers, but I do not recollect having said that Protection was. do you not call a very well. I have listened to honourable members in-the corner, and I have had the greatest difficulty in ascertaining exactly what their fiscal faith is. I have tried very hard to understand whether they are Protectionists or Free Traders. Tariff benefit the primary producer? the honourable member quite a number of instances. honourable members representing country constituencies took me to-day to visit a factory, because they recognised, if the honourable member for Wimmera does not, that the protection afforded to that establishment is a benefit to a vast number of primary producers.

The first commodity produced by this factory is starch, the second is corn flour, the third glucose, the fourth maize sugar, the fifth salad oil, and the sixth a by-product which is sold to the farmer, and is very much better for the milking cow than is bran. to bring the maize to Melbourne to have it treated in this way? ber for Cowper, as he did in his speech, which I very much enjoyed, at once raises an issue which, although I admit it is important, is like the flowers that bloom in the spring-it has nothing to do with the case. I have grown maize. On one occasion, I remember, we felled the scrub and burned it off, and in the ashes, using a hoe about 1£ inches wide and 9 inches long, we chopped the corn in from one end of the burn to the other. The ground was covered with logs and rubbish, but in due time we had a glorious crop of maize, 85 bushels to the acre. We had to .pull that corn and carry every ounce of it on our backs until we could get it ta the tracks we had cut into the burn and pull it out with a sledge. And then we had to husk it , shell it , bag it , and cart benefit to the primary producer. it about 20 miles to the nearest port, whence it was despatched to Sydney. I had to send to the agent in that capital 6d. per bag to make up the deficiency between the freight and other charges and the return from the sale of the maize. SoI speak from bitter experience, and I say that those gentlemen who declare that this Tariff is not in the interest of the primary producer do not know the first thing about it, or what they are talking about. That factory which I saw to-day, and which uses 750,000 bushels of corn per annum, makes a market for the primary producers; it takes off any glut in the market' and keeps the price of the corn at the rate of 5s. per bushel, which, if I had it for my crop, would have brought me in a return of £500 instead of my being compelled to send to the agent a cheque for £15 to pay the actual loss in consigning my produce to the market and selling it there. Is this Protection not of benefit to the primary producer of maize? The honourable member who says that it is not does not know what ber for Wimmera has asked me for one instance. I have given him one. If he wants more, I can give Eim a dozen others. I have to thank the honourable member for his question.

I yield fo no man in my desire' to see the primary producer of Australia prosper. I have been too long associated with him not to desire anything of the kind. WhatI do contend, however, is that we cannot get a normal development of the body politic any more than a normal development of the human body if one part of it grows at the expense of the other. We must have a normal development if we are to get a sturdv growth. If we are to get the best out of all, we must have all sections of the community growing at the same time.

The honourable member says that primary production must precede secondary production. I ask those who know their Australia-and , perhaps, none of us know it as well as we ought to do-wher e they expect to see the greatest development of primary production. I am speaking now of agriculture, and putting aside mining.

Isi t there, apart from some mining development, that we shall ever get a thickly-settled rural population? Wherei n Australia must we expect to see it ? Honourable members know, as well as I do, that it can only be looked for in some areas the boundaries of which are fixed, to a very large extent, apart from irrigation, by natural conditions. Honourable members must recognise that we cannot get intense rural settlement in Australia except in certain well-defined areas which' are governed very largely by the rainfall and facilities for irrigation. member is now advocating centralization ? ber may have such ideas in his mind, but they are not in mine.

I would be the last to suggest that we had reached the limit of rural development. No such thought ever entered my mind, and it is because I believe there are vast spaces in this country capable of intense rura l development, provided we give them a market for their produce, that I say we can by this Tariff build up, assist, develop and diversify primary production in Australia. ber seems to regard Australia only as a great wheat field. He does not appear to have any other conception of it . I Do we exwillingly admit that wheat production is a great and most valuable Australian industry, but it would be infinitely better to scrap the wheat industry rather than that it should of itself stand in the way of the rural development and the possibilities of rura l development which Australia holds out to us. has been doing well up to the present, but the statement to which he has just given utterance was a f a t al mistake. moment, detract from the value of the wheat industry to Australia. To my mind, however, there are such tremendous possibilities for agricultural development in this country that, if one had to weigh the wheat' industry . against that rura l expansion which I believe we can have in I suppose the honourable this country, if we only shape our policy and course aright, it would be better from the point of view of Australia's interest to scrap the one and take the other.

Suppose that as a result of the creation of secondary industries, more internal transport is required, and more chaff is used for the increased number of horses, and that in consequence the average price of chaff is increased 10s. per ton. It is a poor reaper and binder that w ill not cut 1,000 tons of hay, and if the average price is increased by 10s. per ton, it must be obvious that during the life of that machine the farmer has made an additional profit of £500. Honourable members cannot escape the fact that if we create within Australia a more insistent demand for the article which the f armer produces he must receive an additional price and be definitely so much better off in pocket. That fact is so self evident as to be not worth arguing. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) asked a while ago how the development of secondary industries would help us to pay our great debt. If he will allow his -mind to follow the argument to its logical conclusion, he will see how the establishment of secondary industries in this country w ill help the farmer in carrying the burden of not only the national debt, but also the development of the country.

If we were to adopt a policy of having no secondary industries or of not encouragingfche further development of those already in existence thafc that is not the policy of the Country party. that cap upon anybody in this Chamber. I cannot understand anybody suggesting that the abandonment of a policy of developing the secondary industries, and in lieu the importation of all our goods from abroad, thus employing workmen of other countries to earn incomes which the tax-gatherers of those countries collect, can be of any assistance to the primary producers of the Commonwealth. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that what the farmer desires is not export parity, but import parity, and I am prepared to do all in my power to bring into existence that state of things in regard to all classes of primary production so f a r as it is possible to do it .

Coming back to what I was saying about the duty on Horlick's malted We put a protective milk, I wish to point out that the diversification of our secondary industries brings us closer to what the honourable member says he so much desires-that is, obtaining for the production of Australian farmers, not the export, but the import parity. The factories that are making condensed and dried milk are buying from the farmers a raw product which Treasurer hitherto could be exported, only when made into butter or cheese, and are making it into commodities which, though largely consumed in Australia, are sent from the country in much larger quantities, and for them we receive much more than we get for the butter and cheese that we send away. Thus the industry lb. is increasing the market for milk, and reducing the quantity of milk that has to be sold in the form of butter, thus lengthening the period during which the dairymen get, not the export, but the import parity for butter.

The honorahle member for Dampier referred to the duty on pickles. The growing of vegetables out of which pickles are made may be a comparatively insignificant part of bur primary production, but is it not better to employ our own population in growing vegetables for pickle-making and in making pickles than to let this work be done by people outside of Australia, and to send our own good inoney away to buy their productions? 'pickles, and are we not doing so? an enormous quantity of pickles, and it seemed to me desirable, in the interest of our primary as well as of our secondary producers, to put an end to this importation, so that we might make more pickles in our own country. member for Dampier referred to the decreasing of the Excise duty on whisky and brandy as a triumph for his argument. the Tariff on the one side and decreasing it on the other. Apparently he did not realize that while the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is permitted iu this country by law, those interested in the business have as much right to protection as the persons interested in any other business. protection.

WhatI was mation, yours was not. about to say was that during the war the Government took it upon itself to limit the quantity of spirits that could be imported into this country, and thus created a market in Australia for a very large quantity of locally made brandies. Because of that action, which we took as a temporary expedient only, the difference between theCustoms and the Excise duties, which, as the honourable member knows, is the amount of protection given to the brandymaking industry, was reduced to Is. per gallon, lit was not pretended that that difference was a sufficient protection to the industry; but we considered that while the embargo on importation was in operation, as it was until I tabled this Tariff schedule, the industry could dispense with other protection, ancl we could collect a little more revenue from it. But immediately this Tariff schedule was tabled, the embargo on importation was removed, as I promised that it should he,, and the difference between the Customs and Excise duties was restored to the original amount.

They admitted that they had no exact data upon which to base their recommendations, but they said that they thought that their information regarding iron and steel justified them in making certain recommendations about copper. The most convenient time for dealing with the matter in detail will be when we come to the item itself, and I do not propose to state now all the considerations which influenced us in settling the rates of duty on the manufactured product. The honourable member, however, overlooked the fact that there is a duty of 20 per cent, on the raw material of this industry. We knew that the copper market would continue to be liable to heavy fluctuations. The cost of producing electrolytic copper in this country is about £90 per ton, and we felt that, unless a sufficient duty were imposed on the raw material, when the market fell below the cost of producing copper in this country, local manufacturers, who would, of course, endeavour to buy their raw materials as cheaply as possible, would go out of Australia for them, instead of using locally produced copper. the copper miners, we put a pretty high protective duty on the raw material, and then gave sufficient protection to the manufacturers to preserve their industry. Our action, I repeat, was in the interests of the primary producers. I wish to refer now, and with a good deal item if they can get an imported one. of hesitation, to another way in which the Tariff may be said to be of assistance to the primary producer. I evince this has been a great improvement in that rehesitation for the reason that I do not gard during the past few years. think it is to the credit of the Australian people that there should he, as there are, breaking down prejudices of this kind, unfortunately, very many who, if they and I .am glad to say that there are quite . see an Australian name on .a manufaca number of big firms in this country tured article, will not buy it.

Nothing was further from my mind than to suggest anything personal. that it does. However, the fact remains. I was in a manufacturing establishment in Sydney the other day, and when passing the despatch room I noticed very large parcels addressed to New Zealand and South Africa. I asked, ""How is it that you sell your stuff in those countries ? Is there not a market in Australia ?"" The manufacturer said, "" Yes, there is a market here so long as I do not put my own name on my goods.

There is to be seen at the BrokenB ill Proprietary works, at Newcastle, to-day a mighty engine-as big as anything in this country, in fact-whic h is used in connection with the blast furnaces. It was manufactured at Castlemaine, and it is one of the most magnificent pieces of machinery I have set eyes upon.

Still, a lot of people are prejudiced against Australian goods and will have only imported goods. cidentally, of course, the revenue benefits and we, as a people, are relieved to some extent of the burden of direct taxation. When the Committee deals w i th the items individually I shall be able to furnish honourable members with a great deal of information of a detailed character concerning what was done during the war, and I shall be able to indicate the enormous benefit which Australia has reaped by the establishment of local industries during that period. example, there is the iron and steel industry. During the* war the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company ana Hoskins were supplying iron and steel to manufacturers in this country on the basis of many pounds sterling per ton below the price at which manufacturers in other parts of the world were supplying. and steel industry is a .great one, and we would do anything we could to help it. honourable member, the only difference between us being as to the exact degree of assistance which we are prepared to give. originally the BrokenH ill Proprietary"" Company did not want a duty on iron? make such a statement when the industry was inaugurated, but he had not gained the experience which he has to-day. If the honourable member were to speak to Mr Delprat, although he is no longer general manager of the BrokenH ill Prot prietary Company, he would learn that in that gentleman's opinion the duties which the Government propose are the lowest on which it would be possible to secure the development of our iron and steel industry and put it so substantially on its feet that in future it would be able to compete on level terms with any manufacturer anywhere. pressed himself definitely in that direction to the Minister? Australian manufacturers. One me, and in very definite terms; and I am certain that Mr Delprat would have 'no objection tb my referring to the matter and introducing his name here. I desire to refer to one or two Inother statements which have been made in the course of the debate. I shall first answer the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) and the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) in regard to the statement that we must import goods in. return for goods. I have tried to follow the reasonings of those honourable gentlemen. Why must we do so? It is perfectly true that there are some goods which we must import. There are certain things which it is not economical to manufacture here, and we must get them from abroad. There are some For goods which we do not -produce here, but which are necessary for the ordinary needs of human life. To a certain extent, we must import goods to balance goods; but that we must import goods to the f u l l extent of the value of those which we send out is a doctrine to which I cannot subscribe. Those honourable members must know that there is no country in the world which balances its foreign exchanges in that manner. The balance is never shown in that way. If honourable members care to take a neriod covering any number of years they w ill I believe that of the see that there is never to be found an exact balance between imports and exports.

But any student of economics knows that the invisible imports and exports of a country are just as potent factors in the balancing of international exchanges as are goods themselves. And, if we send £1,000,000 worth of goods to England, is not this country infinitely better off if , had Free Trade in agricultural impleinstead of Our importing £1,000,000 worth of goods, foreign investors should place £1,000,000 in capital in Australia for the establishment of a new industry? Is there any reason why this does not just as ' effectively balance that £1,000,000 worth of international exchange as the importation of goods? Furthermore, by. the creation of the industry in Australia, with the increased population it brings, and the use of our own raw material in this country, instead of exporting it , we balance so much of international exchange for all time. invested in Australia from abroad we must pay interest on it ; so that it amounts to the same thing. by the export of goods. : tended. is that the income is ' earned in Australia, thus increasing the field of taxation, and instead of having to import such a large quantity of commodities, we export a great amount of material in the manufactured form. Consequently we are far better off. NowI wish to refer briefly to agricultural implements, because my friends in the corner are more interested in them than in anything else. But what is remarkable about their objection to the duty on agricultural implements is the fact that they do not go to the neighbouring country of New Zealand for a comparison. New Zealand is a primary producing country. munity, and in many respects has the same conditions as are found in Australia. The world's markets are open to its primary producers as they are to my houorable friends. If there is anything in honourable members' arguments as to the advantages of Free Trade in agricultural implements, surely we would find those advantages in our neighbouring Dominion, which is Free Trade so far as these implements are concerned. the high price of machinery in New Zealand is crippling the agricultural industry there. What is the difference in the cost of similar machines in Australia ? I am arguing for the moment. The honourable member claimed that if we ments the farmers would be in a position to buy in the markets of the world just as they are called upon to sell in the markets of the world. He said that that would be an advantage to them. But why did not the honourable member argue his case from the point of view of the price of machinery in New Zealand? For the simple and sufficient reason that agricultural machinery there, which is supplied almost entirely by overseas manufacturers-becaus e there, is practically no'. agricultural implement making in the Dominion-is , without exception, dearer than it is in Australia. I have with me a list, the latest I have been able to get for comparative purposes, of the prices of agricultural machinery in New Zealand and in Australia. Our duties upon this machinery range from 5 per cent-, to 35 per cent. There are 85 items in the list, comprising reapers and binders, mowers, hay rakes, grain and fertilizer drills, spring tooth cultivators,maize cultivators, maize drills, disc harrows, diamond harrows, spring tooth harrows, ploughs, drills, -and quite a number of other items. The list is taken from the published price lists of the foreign companies doing business both in Australia and New Zealand, and there 'is not a solitary case in which the price is not more in. New Zealand than it is in Australia. in the freight? ference in the freight from Canadai t It is a British comwould be in favour of New Zealand as against Australia.

One of the greatest difficulties under our Tariff arrangement -has been that our duties in many instances have not been sufficiently high to give business men the definite assurance that, if they invested their money in an industry, there would be continuity of operations and such security that they could proceed to launch out. The honourable member for Swan is perfectly right if he suggests .that we get tinpot industries as a result of low duties. In such circumstances we do not give corresponding benefits to the country, but we do have a revenue Tariff. In many cases the trouble has been that we have had a low Tariff, with the result that manufacturers have felt such a lack of security that they have not been able to establish industries on such safe business lines and invest the necessary capital to properly develop them, so that there has been no resultant benefit to the community.

That committee brought in a unanimous report, so fa r as the portion I am going to read is concerned. This is what the committee saidThe Committee therefore recommended that Customs duties be imposed upon all imported iron and steel manufactures thereof. They are of opinion that a specific duty should be levied upon each class of commodity, and that ( there should be a maximum, general, and minimum Tariff. The amount of Tariff should be determined by consideration of the needs of the industry protected, and by the needs of the nation as a whole, and the amount of specified Tariff should be varied readily, according to the changing demands of national policy.
