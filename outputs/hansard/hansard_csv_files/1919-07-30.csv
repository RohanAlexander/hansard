I intend, with on© exception, to confine myself to the constitutional aspect of the question. The exception is the statement made by the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), when announcing the purchase of these ships to the House. In explaining the failure of the wooden ships buil t in America, he made a very curious statement. He said thab the Government of the United States had taken over control of the yards, and were unable to control the building of the ships. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) interjected, "" Have we not a representative there? What is he doing?"" and the reply was, "" I do not know what he is doing. He has been there for some time, and yet ships of which he was in charge have been delivered months ago."" I ask honourable members to reflect upon that answer. Doesi t indicate the capacity of the Australian Government to do any better than the Government of t h e United Statesi n ship construction? vernment. all. I enter my emphatic protest against the action of the Government or of its two or three representatives abroad, in entering into contracts for public expenditure without first obtaining parliamentary authority. WhetherI stand alone in that protest, or whether I find support for it , it is a principle which has always operated in British Parliaments, and it is very unsafe to depart from that principle. This is the second occasion on which it has been done. On the last occasion, it was nearly two years, if my memory serves me rightly, before the Government appealed to the House to justify the expenditure of £2,080,000 incurred for the purchase of fifteen ships. The purchase of those ships whilst the country was at war may have had some justification, and the House took that view; but the view that it took at that time appears to be operating upon it to-day in times of peace lies with the Housei n being unable to distinguish between its duty in times of war and its duty in times of peace. When' the expenditure on those fifteen vessels was ratified by Parliament, there were very few members in the chamber. It was either at the end of a session, or when the Budget was being discussed, and very little interest was being taken in the proceedings'. On an occasion of that kind, when the money had been spent and the damage done, Parliament was unlikely to make any fuss about -it. Honourable members can easily conceive of a condition of affairs, if Parliament is going to allow this kind of thing to go on, when a Government in possession of the Treasury bench may enter into conThe tracts for the expenditure of millions then, without consulting Parliament, relying on the precedents created by this Government to get parliamentary support later on, when the money has all been spent. The concluding of private contracts by public men on behalf of the public constitutes a very serious danger to the community. I do not care who the public men are, or what they are, or to what party they belong; to conclude private contracts on behalf of the public is fraught with grave and serious danger to this country. There is a rule of conduct laid down for the guidance of Ministers in the purchase of goods. Tenders should always be called, and Ministers themselves generally follow that policy. What would a Minister say to a public servant who dared to buy goods without calling tenders or getting competitive prices ? peatedly in the Navy Department. was Minister there. Whatd i d he say to them? it. did so, it indicates that, in his opinion, the principle I am enunciating is sound, and that no public servant is entitled to purchase goods for the public without first It seems to me that the f a u l t calling for tenders and securing free and open competition.

The Minister, after all, is only a glorified public servant, and while he is a servant of the public he should follow that good old practice. May I quote a saying with which honourable members are all familiar: How oft tlite sight of means to do ill-deeds Makes ill-deeds done! Go down Collins-street, or any other street in Melbourne, and talk to any of the men you meet about this purchase. They will all say, "" Somebody must be making a good thing out of this."" That is common talk. As a representative of the public, I say that it should not be possible to make these statements against members of Parliament, who are the custodians of the public weal. It should be impossible for the man in the street to charge members with having done anything that is not open and above-board. as a rule.. They say these things when a public man is not there. been said to my face on more than one occasion, and I dare say they have been, said to the' honourable member. face about a public man, and I asked immediately for a charge or a withdrawal, and there was an immediate withdrawal. face a man and ask him to prove his statement, no man can prove a thing that is vague and indefinite, and he would naturally withdraw at once. But. the very fact that that man harbors the idea that public men, purporting to act for the Commonwealth, are entering into private contracts out of which some commission may be paid to some one is damaging to the public life of Australia. -'Whether the suspicion be with or without foundation., that must be the result. I say quite freely and frankly that I do not believe that any public man in con'nexion with this deal has received the slightest consideration. that. public man has gained any advantage out of it ; but the unfortunate position is that I have no more authority for denying such a suggestion than has the man for making it. On the . other hand, where tenders are publicly invited, we are placed in a position of absolute independence. In those circumstances, when such a suggestion is made one can say at once, "" Public tenders were invited, and'the lowest tender was accepted."" Early in March last I heard direct from England that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) had given authority for the keels of five ships to be laid down in -a Sunderland yard. It seemed to me at the time to be such an outrage that I went direct to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and conveyed to him my information. I had been told on a previous occasion, when speaking"" in this"" House against certain action taken by the Government, that, as a Ministerial supporter, I should have gone direet to the responsible Minister and have told him what my grievance was. On this occasion, I followed that policy. I told the Acting Prime Minister of the information I had received, and when he asked my authority for it I supplied it to him. The honourable gentleman said, "" I know I had it once said to my absolutely nothing about the matter. I do not believe the statement is true, and I will send a cablegram to the Prime Minister in regard to it . "" On the same day he despatched a cablegram to the Prime Minister. I do not know that the Minister in charge of the House( Mr Groom) will permit me to read it , but, quoting from memory, the message was to this effectRumoured here that you have given authority to lay down the keels of five ships. A reply, sent on the day that the message was received, was as follows: Absolutely untrue that this Government have contracted to lay down any ships. the contents of the cablegram sent to the Prime Minister correct? have quoted is also correct. did the honourable member call on the Aet^ ing Prime Minister?

His reply is merely that the Government have not entered into such a contract. When you told me that you knew nothing at all about any such contract, I believed you, and this reply indicates to me that the Government have not entered intosuch a contract."" A fortnight or three weeks, later, Mr Larkin, the manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steam-ships, when speaking, to some merchants in London, said-, ""The Commonwealth Government are not going out of the shipping business-; they are going to continue in it . "" Whetherit would be wise or not for the Government to continue in tlie business' is a question which I slwir not discuss. point. have to consider is whether Mr Larkin, a.? aservant of the Commonwealth, made that statement on his own responsibility. If he dffd not, then on whose authority -did' he make it?' If he had no authority for it, was. it not an extraordinary statement to come from a public servant? Was it not extraordinary that a public senvant should announce a matter of Government policy?. Surely such a statement should have come from the Leader of. the Government. In the course of a subsequent interview with the Acting, Prime Minister-after taxreply from, the Prime Minister had. come: to hand-f i reminded-, him that, before we adjourned, last December,.

I reminded himtfejat I had' said: then that I would take whatever responsibility attached to. my position in voting for compulsory war loans; but I indicated at thetime that, if the Government were going tosquander millions on shipbuilding, I would' have towithdraw my promise of support. In this case, two-fifths of the capital to be raised by the new loan which Parliament is to be asked to authorize is to be devoted to a shipbuilding scheme, which, in my judgment, may not prove to be what those responsible for it think it will be. spent in a better way. the first Government venture in purchasing, fifteen vessels, but that was at a time when we were short of tonnage. We were then in the middle of the war, and it wasabsolutely necessary that we should -secure all the tonnage available But were the vessels so purchased used to carry our produce toLondon? As a matter of fact many of them were en^ g.aged in foreign trading to make a profit. The producers of Australia did not receive the benefit of that deal, but because,, of the success, which attended it , we are now to enter into, this further scheme. The whole action of the Government remindsme of the position of a man who 1 indulges in puntingat Flemington. He backs several winners., makes a lot of money,, and finally ""plunges"" on the last race; but the lioixe on which he jDlaices all his money breaks its neck, and the man has to walk home ""stony."" never "" go broke.''

I accept without reservation the Prime Minister's denial that on the date when he replied to tlie Acting Prime Minister's message, the Government had not comtraeted to lay down these ships; but will the Minister in charge of the House inform me when the contracts with Vickers and Beardmore were entered into.

They know, also, the trouble that arose as the war progressed, owing to the sinking of ships by enemy action, and the intensification of the shipping shortage all over the world. The position became such that we in Australia had to seriously consider how we could help the primary producers to export their products, and help ourselves by importing those things which were necessary. About the 12th July, , 1917, the Prime Minister made a stateA n d vote money. ment to the House, pointing out .the It seems to necessity for Australia to take some action to promote local shipbuilding in order, to meet the necessities of our situation. In addition to encouraging local building, steps were taken to have vessels constructed for us in the United States of America. Boats of any kind were being bought at the highest possible rates, irrespective of speed and tonnage; and acting wiselv, I believe, the Government made The Parliament has not certain contracts for the building of wooden ships in the United States of America. Now that the war is over, those If this Parliament were vessels ar© not suitable for normal requirements; but had we possessed them during the war, they would have rendered invaluable service to Australia. Parliament approved of the action of the Government in starting shipbuilding in Australia. That was an entirely new enterprise, and to an island continent like Australia, which is dependent for its national . prosperity on the export of primary products, an essential industry. Shipbuilding yards Avere started at Williamstown; the Government of New South Wales were Such is the encouraged to undertake shipbuilding at Walsh Island; and the Commonwealth also utilized the plant at Cockatoo Island.

Contracts for fourteen [ 4 . 6 ] I ask the other vessels were placed, some w it h retrospective private firms throughout the Commonwealth.

Tho activities of the Conference are of very great importance to Australia, and neither the Government nor Parliament can overlook that fact. Combinations in shipping are not of recent growth. Even before the war they were becoming an Empire problem of very serious import. During the war tonnage was greatly reduced, and on the declaration of peace the Shipping Conference developed and consolidated to a remarkable extent. The Conference lines comprise the following: Gross register. Peninsular and .Oriental Steam Navigation"" Company Royal Mail Steam Packet Company ... ... ..: 1,675,696 Cunard Steam-ship Company Limited Furness, Withy, and Company Limited Ellerman Group ... ... 913,116 Alfred Holt and Company T. and J.

Total The majority of those companies have one or more lines trading to Australia. lian agent of the Conference is the ma'whom the Government appointed to deal with shipping, Sir Owen Cox. or not that is correct; but I am dealing with the proiblem which Australia has to face. Since that list of Conference lines was prepared a Japanese line and the Eastern and' Australian Company have been added. Let the House consider what that shipping monopoly means to the producers and the exporters of primary produce. with their five ships, to beat that combination ? ships. We are hoping that the competition of them, and the ships we are building locally, will have a considerable effect upon shipping freights. Nobody knows better than does the honourable member how the Conference operates in influencing trade into its own channels. These lines work on a deferred rebate [415] system, under which shippers are compelled to sign a declaration at the end of given periods to the effect that they havo not shipped any cargo by vessels outside those controlled by the Conference. I shall mention to the House an illustration of how even Governments may be compelled by the Conference to toe the mark. The Government of Victoria booked"" a certain amount of space on the Commonwealth ship Bulla, but owing to the fact that they were notified that they might lose a considerable sum of money in deferred rebates, they withdrew the shipment from the Commonwealth line. That is an illustration of the operationsof this Combine. I have shown the circumstances which faced the Government. ... 1,833,020 Shipping was short all over the world.

The policy of the Government is to continue the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and to build larger and faster vessels for our oversea trade, so that the producers of our exportable primary products shall be assured satisfactory shipping facilities at reasonable rates.

187,,"A r e you not glad Mr KELLY If they are overstockedcan decide whether or not the circumstances under which the trusteeship of the House has been flouted justify this flouting until those people who have made the bargain for us have returned to answer for their stewardship. I am glad the honourable member for Henty took the earliest opportunity to move the adjournment of the House; but we would be going too far if , having made a protest against this inroad on our authority, we now came to an ex parte conclusion on, perhaps, the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr bringing up this subject on a motion for Tudor), whose business it is to be a provoker of the' public peace in this place. We would be going too far, I say, if we were to go beyond this protest, and demand anything definite or conclusive in the absence of the people who have been acting on our behalf. I suggest,' however, that the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Groom) might be able very easily to satisfy the Chamber as to the of one statement he made, which was certainly a considerable surprise to me. When I first saw the statement in the newspapers that these ships were to be bought, I saw one of the Ministers in regard to it. As the conversation was not one I had announced I was going to make public, I do not intend to repeat what the Minister said to me. WhatI said to him was, "" The chances are that all Australia will want to enter on the shipping business as a means of finding out, if for under the circumstances, it is no wonder no other reason, whether our products are being charged fair freights; but there is a constitutional and an unconstitutional way of doing things, and Parliament should be first asked before large sums of money are expended."" The Minister agreed with me, and, beyond that, I shall not disclose what he said; but I came to the conclusion that he did not know then what had been done. I was under that impression until the Acting Leader of the Government ( Mr Groom) made his statement to-day that not only the Prime Minister (Mv. Hughes), but Ministers here had been hand in glove in the particular business. There is one way to clear the matter up, and that is by in England. Personally, I cannot underthe Acting Leader of the Government laying on the table of the House, at the earliest moment, all the messages that have passed between the Government and the delegation abroad respecting this deal. If that be done, I shall be amply and utterly satisfied, and the House should be satisfied and content to wait patiently until, in a few weeks, the Prime Minister returns to give his personal account of his stewardship. quite approve ©f the action of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Boyd) in the adjournment of the House, for, had he not done so, it would have devolved on some other honourable member to take the step. The merits of the proposal to acquire shipping .for Australia need not be debated now, for the question before us is simply the constitutional question of the right of the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, to incur expenditure without the sanction of Parliament. The accuracy only parallel case of which I know was the purchase of the Suez .Canal shares by Lord Beaconsfield; and it will be remembered that, although the possession of these shares was considered of vital importance to the nation, the British Parliament condemned that statesman for purchasing them without its sanction. It appears as though, not only the Commonwealth Parliament, but the State Parliaments in Australia, are forgetting their responsibilities to the people; and, that the community generally do not pay proper respect to parliamentary institutions. In all the Constitutions granted to Australia there is preserved the right, of Parliament to sanction expenditure; indeed, in the early days, the Legislative Councils, or Upper Chambers, were not given any voice in the expenditure of public money. However, at present, Parliament has to sit idly by while Ministers of the Crown enter into contracts of this kind without consulting' the Parliament to which they are responsible, although it is quite evident that, some weeks ago, the Government could have given us information in regard to what was being done stand why the Government should show",38,Shipbuilding Government Contracts
188,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.45],"I6uch secrecy regarding their acts 'of administration. wealth Government have ever so withheld information from Parliament, and I am afraid that the day is not far distant when we shall regret the fact. The liberties of the people depend on the constitutional control by Parliament. So long as I am a member of the HouseI shall oppose the relegation of any of the authority of Parliament to any individual Minister or member. Mr# your voice being raised in protest when the Prime Minister bought ships without the authority of Parliament. kind will not assist the Acting Minister for the Navy to save his face at the next election. He knows that before the Prime Minister took action members generally were aware of what was to be done. The country was at war when those ships were bought. The position is vastly different now. The Government are starting to build a fleet with the war virtually at an end. There is no analogy between the two cases, and the Acting Minister for the Navy is simply making himself ridiculous in the eyes of the intelligent electors of Australia. I rose to assert my Opposition to the unconstitutional manner in which the public funds are being spent. Until the members of the House awake to a sense of their responsibilities in regard to the finances, I am afraid the people outside will have a very poor opinion of them. It is not Parliament as an institution, but the creatures who occupy seats in Parliament, that are being condemned by the people outside. The institution of Parliament still stands high in the esti, niation of the people. It is those in power, and those who are the principal moving spirits behind the men in power, with whose conduct of affairs the people of Australia are not satisfied. I hope what has taken place will be the means of waking some honoraible members up to .a sense of their responsibility towards the ' expenditure of this country. One of our chief complaints as an Opposition has been the method of expenditure on the part of the Government. Their actions in Tegard to certain Bills before the House -will condemn them in the eyes of No previous Commonall those gentlemen who run our financial institutions, and have a knowledge of financial matters. . In a case of this kind, the crime is equally great whether the amount spent is £1,000 or. £10,000,000. Parliamentary control has been so loose, and members have been so indifferent to what has been going on, letting everything slide, that the Government have got intotlie habit of spending money in this way.. They began with hundreds and' thousands; then they got into hundreds of thousands in regard to some of their activities, and now they are spending millions. There is no knowing where it. is going to end. The representatives of"" the people in Parliament have no right to neglect the duty of watching the expenditure of public money. This money has to be raised, if not from taxation, then by means of loans, and already the charge on the people by way of interest on loans is a very serious item. and-by. raised in Parliament to prevent the unborn generations from being punished for the sins of this Parliament. That will never be done without the protest of their, humble representative from East SydneyI do not suppose that if I talked for an hour on this question the deeds of the Prime Minister would be altered. The ships would still go on being built, 'but that does not alter the fact that the Government have gone about the business in an utterly unconstitutional way. The people must know which of the representatives whom they have returned to Parliament to watch the expenditure of public money have disregarded their duties. The present system is most loose and unbusiness-like, particularly in view of the fact that, when the country made the mistake of returning the present Government to power in the general'elections of 1917>. we were told that there -was a lot of business men amongst the successful partyGod save Australia from business men like them, if this is their style of conducting affairs.

I am emphasizing the constitutional clbligation that rests upon the Government in time of peace. Personally, I am anxious to give the Government the most generous support, and it is with reluctance that I condemn them for what I regard as a flagrantly unconstitutional act. They have not demonstrated to the House that the emergency was of such a character that they had no other alternative but to commit themselves to the purchase of the ships without consulting Parliament. we shall not get the ships for more than two years. an emergent' question, and secrecy was of the utmost moment, Parliament might at least have been consulted in secret, although I do not advocate secret meetings of Parliament.

F o r a first-saloon passage the charge was up to £160 ; for a secondclass, passage the-charge was up to £130'; for the steerage the charge ranged from £47i toi £84: That' was why the company sought to crowd the crew. 1 There was not a porthole in the forecastle which could be opened, because they were on the level with the waterline.

I refer to Mr Balsillie. His record in the Department was not a good one, and it was not fair if he had uncontrolled power to purchase without calling for tenders. The claim is made that the shipbuilding firms are too busy. I have taken from the London Directory a list of seventy-five shipbuilding firms. There is only one way in which we can control Parliament, and that is by giving the creators of Parliament, the people, an opportunity of seeing whether we are do-' ing our duty or not. ""We are not doing our duty or earning our pay if we allow any Government to go into recess for six months. Had Parliament been sitting we would not have experienced the profiteering which has been so rampant and rife in our midst.

It is very easy to insure the farmer 4s. per bushel for his wheat, pay the miller a fair price for gristing it , and compel him to sell flour to any one who asks for it . and gaol him if he refuses, or dares to sell above the price fixed by the Government.

An untruth was uttered when, in reply to a question put by me, it was said that Mr Angliss got his meat from the municipality. If tenders had been called, every tenderer would know that the meat sent out by the municipality of Melbourne is examined microscopically, and in every other way, and that the livers supplied to our seamen by Mr Angliss would never go out from municipal abattoirs as fit for human consumption. There are no greater profiteers than the shipbuilding firms. Having lived in Belfast, I know that the firm of Harland and Woolf, than whom there is no finer shipbuilding firm in the world, do not accept contract's, but simply charge the cost of material and labour, adding 10 per cent, for supervision. that is their percentage charge at the present time. the charge during the war was 12^ per cent. times their charge was 10 per cent., and they would not turn out anything but a well-constructed vessel. informed that the Government entered into the contracts for building wooden vessels against the advice of their experts.

I conclude my remarks by saying that there is no honourable member opposite who would I .would like tendare to go on a political platform and say, "" We w ill do away with tendering.

The war loan expenditure of the Commonwealth is estimated for the year ending 30th June, 1920, at £52,000,000. On 30th June last the Treasury held war loan moneys amounting to about £18,800,000. The difference between these sums must be found by way of loan, and amounts to £33,200,000. 2. Towards meeting these requirements the Government has decided to float another loan in Australia of £25,000,000, which will appropriately be termed "" The Peace Loan."" The nominal rate of interest will be 5 per cent, per annum, but a bonus, to be given with the first incent, per annum on the average for the whole period of the loan. 3. The principal will be repaid at par on 15th December, 1927. 4. Subscriptions to the Peace Loan will ments will be payable as follows:10 per cent, on application. ' 10 per cent, on 3rd November, 1919. 20 per cent, on 3rd December, 1919. 20 per cent, on 6th January, 1920. ' 20 per cent, on 4th February, 1920. 20 per cent, on 4th March, 1920. 5.

There is at present before the House of Representatives a B ill for obtaining compulsory subscriptions to war loans, the maximum amount required in any financial year being six times the average income tax paid by the individual or company during the last three years. Persons whose taxable incomes are £250 per annum or less are not subject to the provisions of the B ill , and those who have served with the Naval or M i l it a r y Forces during the war are exempt in so f a r as their incomes from personal exertion are concerned. w i ll not apply to any one if the £25,000,000 is obtained by voluntary subscriptions, but in the event of a shortage the Treasurer would require the Commissioner of Taxation to call for additional subscriptions. vided for which may consider any objections by the persons from whom subscriptions may be demanded, and the Board must take into .account the amount, if any, invested by the objector in previous war loans, or paid in the purchase by h i m from the Commonwealth of war savings certificates. pelled to subscribe an amount to the loan he w ill be automatically subject to a fine equal to one-third of the amount of the compulsory subscription. be paid to the Consolidated Revenue, but for the amount of his subscription he w ill get bonds or stock. 8. When the' loan closes the Government w ill bring before the House any amendments necessary to deal with the position then existing. 9. In order that facilities may be provided for persons who have not ready money the Government has again arI f that amount be not obranged w i th the' Australian banks that they will.make advances to customers at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum to all persons who show that they have a reaI n the sonable prospect of repaying the money within eighteen months. The-banks w ill advance up to 90 per cent, of the bonds subscribed for, and w ill not ask for any security other than that of the bonds themselves. 10. The Government is creating an organization similar to that which was used for the last loan, and a Central Committee has already been brought into being in each of the State capitals. The Government confidently relies upon the good work of these bodies. 11. In placing this matter before the HouseI venture to hope that the loan, which is smaller than either of the two previous flotations, w ill be f u l l y subscribed without resort to compulsion. I appeal to all Australians to again show Under the B ill , compulsion that the interests of the country are vital to themselves as individuals and to once more find the money necessary to meet the expenses of the great war, now happily ended.

A law-suit is pending between the Commonwealth and the wool-tops manufacturing companies in regard to the profits resulting from the agreement -between the parties, and while it is sub judice we cannot discuss it. the'mover of the amendment is assuming that the Government will receive certain profits, and he suggests that in this Bill we should do a most extraordinary thing, That is that we should now attempt to give a bonus for the purpose of increasing the wages of men employed in a certain industry,, because these men are out of -employment. Every one sympathizes with men who are out of employment, but it is the wrong way to Temedy that misfortune by inserting a clause in a Bill to pay to the men employed by a private firm a bonus in tlie shape of a percentage out of the profits derived by the Commonwealth from that firm. It is true that the Commonwealth is to share some of the profits made by. this firm, but is it to be laid down as a general principle that when, a certain industry is dislocated by whatever cause the Commonwealth is to be obliged to appropriate outof the Consolidated Revenue a bonus to various, people employed in it?

The' firm to which he has referred has ceased operations because there is a dispute with the Oommonwealth Government, but other firms are carrying on. The honourable member's proposal is quite alien to the general purport of the Bill, and, if carried to a logical conclusion would mean that where tbe Commonwealth received profits from an undertaking not be under an obligation to pay a bonus to the workmen employed in it. The proper principle is that these men should be paid a decent living wage according to the laws of Australia. regret that the Minister( Mr Groom) takes up a hostile attitude to the amendment. If Ministers have any sympathy for the employees in the fellmongering industry they ought to show it in a practical way. It is. true that the proposal of tbe honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) is an almost unheardof one, but it is quite in keeping with the isterial side the other night say, "" The spirit of the times. the world is that people who are obliged to work for wages are 'not receiving a fair share of the product of their labour. Those who take an interest in social problems are endeavouring to discover a method by which we may do away with social unrest and put an end to strikes. In this case the Government are to receive out of the profits of certain companies 50 per cent, for the first year, and 66§ per cent, for subsequent years, during which the war-time profits tax is in operation. The people who have been working in connection with the agreement, the fellmongers, wool-scourers, and men and women who have been making wool tops, have been paid a very poor rate of wages, and have submit to the loss of wages when out of employment. If any one should get something as a result of the Government's licence-fee-as it is called-o r share in the profits made, these employees who have to do the especially disagreeable work of fellmongering are entitled to a war bonus. I have seen a certain The laudable object which the branch of fellmongering described by a chairman of an industrial Court as work that no human being should be called upon to do. It is most filthy work. The employees of Messrs. Whiddon Brothers Limited and the Colonial Combing, 'Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited are mostly fellmongers and woolscourers. Why should the Government indulge in profiteering? It was a purely profiteering scheme, by which these companies were to get 6s. per Ib. for their carried on by it, it would wool tops during the war as against 2s. 6d. per lb. which they were getting prior to the war. when he was Treasurer, did the same in regard to sugar. day hoped to make a profit of about £500,000 out of the sugar industry, but the honourable member will agree with me when I say that the workers in the sugar industry have far better conditions than those under which the fellmongers work.

They simply ask the companies to pay their dividends into their banking accounts, and do not think of how those dividends are produced. apply to every one. that it applies to some wool tops companies, who are extremely careless as to the welfare of their employees; and if it suits them to close down their works for two or three months they do so, although it means putting their employees out of work.",57,Pairs

There is no reason why Parliament should not order that a proportion of the profits to he placed at the disposal of the Government shall be distributed hy a Committee elected by the employees. It is understood that the Commonwealth Government is to receive £300,000 or thereabouts as a result of the partnership with Messrs. Whiddon Brothers Limited and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited. What objection can there be to payine 20 per cent, of that amount as a war bonus to the employees engaged in the industry? The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) can correct me if I am wrong in saying that many of these employees have not earned on an average £1 per week all the year round. a rich and wealthy Commonwealth is to -take about £300,000 under its agreement with the companies, and declines to pay a war bonus to the unfortunate employees of the companies from whom it will derive this money. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) made mention of sugar. When pressure was brought to bear on the Government by rural representatives in this House, Ministers freely surrendered profits are? the £500,000 which was to have been made out of the sugar industry, and handed it ing period, prior to the trouble, the estiback to the sugar cane-growers. lieve that they have also handed back a ment, in the case of one company, were considerable portion of the profits made £2S0,000, which, I believe, is the sum out of the Wheat Pool.

I do not say that is Bolshevism, but it is the impression of honourable members opposite; and if we are to stop direct action and revolution, tbe Government every member of Parliament and every employer will have to take a greater interest in the welfare of people who have to work for wages, and who do not know for a month ahead where their living is coming from. A l though profit-sharing may not be a solution of our industrial difficulties, there will, no doubt, be a good deal of it on the part of many employers who desire to improve industrial conditions and remove the hate that is growing up between employer and employee. The Government should set an example. its own employees well. Government tries to treat its employees in the Civil Service well, and those employees have better opportunities of bringing their case before the Government than have employees in the fellmongering institutions.

An effort has been made to meet the growing desire on the part of employees to have some voice in the management of the industries in which they are engaged; and surely no exception can be taken to that. I have heard that an endeavour has been made by a mining company to induce its employees to take an interest in the company's welfare by setting apart a portion of the shares under a trust, with the view of handing whatever, dividends they may earn over to a committee elected by the employees to decide to what purpose the money shall be applied -whethe r it shall all, or only a portion of it , be divided amongst the employees, the other portion being devoted to any particular service the employees may con^ sider necessary.

The honourable gentleman must' know from his reading of history that there was a. time in Russia, not so long prior to the revolution, when a squire could say to a young woman in his employ that she must marry a particular man estate, possibly many miles away, and the woman had no voice in the matter.

Our evolution is slow, and: experiments have to be Mr Biggs. , : I ! i , .' tried, and, if of no value, abandoned; but it would be an easy matter for the I Government, instead of taking the whole £300,000, to hand a portion of it to the employees. I believe the Government are even prepared to give a war bonus to the seamen on strike, who, in my opinion, are entitled to it . If that is so, employees in various other industries, including fellmongers, wool scourers, and wool-top makers are equally entitled to consideration. Most of the employees in the industry are young women engaged at a small wage, and only intermittently. They are likely to be, and are, thrown out of work for weeks and months at a time; and it would he a magnanimous act of grace on the part of the Government to allow a portion of the profits to be distributed as I have suggested. trust that the Minister( Mr Groom) will give further consideration to the amendment. I do not agree with the honourable gentleman in the view that, if the proposal be carried,, then every one who makes a claim against the Customs Department, on account, of theheavy duties, will be entitled to a rebate.

In consequence of the high cost of living and the reduction of employment during the war, there are people in distress in all parts of the Commonwealth. During the war period quite a number were not f u l l y employed. Those who were engaged in the production of wool tops were in receipt of a low wage, but they worked f a it h f u l l y , and should be rewarded. If they had declined, to work without an increase of wages, some people would have found fault with them, but because they were If the Government cannot see loyal j and gave of the best that was in them, with the result that out.of their industry the Government have reaped large profits, they are not to be recognised in any -way.

If those profits rightly belonged to the Government, there might be some good ground for_ such a claim in view of all that we hear as to -the desirableness of cooperative forms of industry. I wish, however, to place before the Committee an entirely different view as to the ownership of profits. The Central Wool Committee has undertaken a great trust on behalf of the wool-growers of Australia. It operates as and the a Government instrumentality, inasmuch as it was constituted at the wish of the Government, and by the desire of the growers. In relation to ,the contracts which have been cited by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), the position of the Central Wool Committee is that of a trustee of the raw materialthe wool-whic h Ibelongs' to the growers, and not to the Commonwealth. No acquisition B ill has been passed transferring from the growers to the Government the interest in that wool.

I read in the press that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) had stated that his firm had inaugurated a policy of profit-sharing.

In regard to the contention of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that after thegrower has parted with his wool to any manufacturer, he has no right to claim any profit that results from manufacture. If that principle were allowed to creep in , imagine the chaos that would result through the original producer endeavouring to secure some of the subsequent profit. The farmer sells his wheat to the miller, and the latter makes a certain profit on his flour. compulsorily distribute portion of that profit among the employees in the flourmilling industry and another portion to the wheat-growers? However, I wish to make myself clear as to the matter of profit-sharing. In view of the fact that we hav.e to get through the B ill in a limited time, I shall not imitate the honourable member for Capricornia, who gave his ideas in regard to profit-sharing.

Burchell) is in favour of the principle of the amendment, but I suppose party government 'is against his giving effect to that which, on any other occasion, he would endorse. I am surprised at the reply given by the Minister( Mr. Groom), that the adoption of the amendment would mean the granting of a principle which could not be regarded as compatible w it h good government. The workers in this industry are, to all intents and. purposes, employees of the CommonOn any broad issue of profit wealth Government. It must be admitted that they have contributed to the making of the profit which the Government w ill share. Consequently, they are also entitled to a share of that profit. Twenty per cent of the £2S0,000 which the Government expect to receive from the wool tops contracts would amount to £60,000. If the amount were £50 or £100 I suppose many honourable members would have no hesitation in accepting the principle that the workers engaged in producing the profit should share in it , but the sum of £60,000 would appear to. them to be too much to distribute among a limited number of workers. I would point out, howIsi t proposed to ever, that these employees have been out of work for a considerable time. The Commonwealth and State Governments have paid large sums of money out of the Consolidated Revenue to relieve distress among the unemployed. In my opinion, money derived by way of taxation should be devoted to administration only, and the relief of distress among unemployed should be provided for out of the accumulated profits of industry. .

367,Mr Wallace (West Sydney) [9.7].,"not fall on the whole community. The claim is set up that the adoption of this amendment would create a precedent. Revolutions which are now in progress in various parts of the world have come about through the acquisitiveness of employers in trying to make huge profits and drag their employees down to the very lowest depths of degradation. On the other hand, in Australia, since the signing of Peace, many big firms, who made excessive profits during the war, but were afraid to give increased wages to their employees because by doing so they would establish a precedent or create trouble among employees in other establishments, looked upon the declaration of Peace as an opportunity for giving to their employees bonuses and other considerations which they would not dream of giving at other times. The Commonwealth Bank, which' made large profits during the war, has given its employees a bonus. The British-Australian Tobacco Trust gives exceptional conditions to its employees. A man who has served two years in the factory is granted a certain number of shares; he is given other conditions that do not obtain in the ordinary sphere of life. For the payment of 2s. 6d. for every £100 advanced he can get a house. these things? they must do something of the kind to stave off the industrial revolution which is menacing them if they do not do so. The only objection I have to the BritishAustralian Tobacco Trust is that, notwithstanding these concessions, to their employees, they are still piling up huge profits. Many firms in Sydney have given Peace bonuses to their employees. The British Government, realizing the invernment come in? dustrial unrest confronting them, have put forward a proposal to give the employees control of industries. They con-, tempi a ted taking over certain shipbuildemployer; and all the revenue the Going yards in the north. the offer. suggested it, but I understand that the unions refused to take this concession; and I know their reasons, just as I suppose the honourable member does, because he was connected with the industrial movement prior to coming to this Parliament, and must appreciate why the time is not opportune for the workers to take control. As I have often said, we might as well put the engines of the Mauretania into a North Shore ferry boat-the hull is not there to hold the machinery. So it is with the workers, until such time as we are educated to take control. As a collectivism I believe in the Government controlling industries and selecting the executive; but the workers are entitled to the f u l l product of their labour, and in this the Government should give a lead to private companies and employers. For instance, the Government might say, "" Under the circumstances, we cannot give you 20 per cent, of this huge accumulation, but we can say that out of all profits in the future the workers shall have that percentage."" Mr F. W. Hughes shared his profits with the employees the Government would do the same with their 50 per cent, share. ment of the honourable member earlier in the evening may appear all right, but from an economic point of view it is absolutely valueless, because the farmer or producer, when he has sold his wool, has completed his part of the bargain, and has no further interest in it. It might as well be contended that the man who sells the grass-seeds to grow the herbage for the sheep should be entitled to a share of the surplus profits from the wool. During the process of manufacture the profits belong to the individual engaged in the manufacture. , stands in the position of supervisor or vernment derives should be from the ordinary channels of taxation.

There is a pool among the ship-owners, and if an arbitration award would be £4 per week, if paid, they pay the men £3 12s. 6d., and the difference goes to provide the comforts I have mentioned. I do not say that that is a good precedent to follow, but I do not see why the Government, with this huge sum of money, should not do something. No one will deny that the workers have contributed to the earning of this money; and, as already pointed out, they have not averaged £1 per week during the last twelve months owing to the trouble between the Government and the company.

The profits which are under discussion are not revenue yet, and, according to the' agreement, the Government may not make them revenue, because it states that 50 per cent, of the profits shall be held at the disposal of ,the Government.

Just in the same way as wheat is sold to the local manufacturer generally at a lower price than could be got abroad, because it is to our own people and for local consumption, so we have allowed wool to be sold to the local manufacturer.

Owing to a disagreement between the Government and one of the wool-top companies, the workers in the industry are out of employment, and have been for some time. We now say that the profit derived by the Government should be distributed amongst them; but the wool-growers, who have done so well, would deny them even this little consideration. We have a f a i r claim, and it is one to which the Government must give heed. The sale of corn-, sacks was controlled in the interests of the farmers, and was there any suggestion that the profit of £100,000 should be returned to the bagmakers in Calcutta? No; it has been given to the farmer without a word 'of objection from any one. That was quite right. But when a profit of £250,000 was made out of rabbit skins, it was not returned to the trappers. not honourable members see the class distinction in those two instances? amendment before the Chair is a plea for the worker, who has given of his best to the industry, and if honourable members cannot regard this claim other than with a distorted vision, they need not wonder if we have Bolshevism in the country. The farmers have not done so badly during the war. Neveri n their history have they had such a good, steady price as they obtained during the war period, and the Wheat Pool has protected them from the cormorants who would have preyed upon them.j. The proposal that the profits earned by the Government on the wooltops contract should amongst the employees is equitable. w&s largely due to the fact that the farmers were overcharged for their bags. ber aware that the workers in the fellmongering industry are poorly fed and clothed owing to the fact that they have been robbed by the profiteers ? If the farmers have been overcharged, they are the victims of their own class and k in dthe men whom they have returned to Parliament. In the South Australian Parliament, and in this Parliament also, to some extent, the farming interests are represented by those persons who "" f a r m "" them either legally or commercially. If the Minister( Mr Groom) wishes to do a fair thing he will accept the amendment, or approve of the spirit of it , and indicate to the Committee in what way he will be prepared to hand back to the workers in the wooltops industry the whole of the profits in the same way as the profits on cornsacks were handed back to the farmers. [9.50] -If the amendment were a genuine proposal to divide amongst the employees some of the profits made in the wool-top manufacturing industry, the issue would be simple.

There is some ground for the contention of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr paid for greasy wool, much of the scoured Rodgers) that this money to the producer of the wool. would have been better pleased if the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), when Treasurer, had reached out. for the whole of the difference between the pre-war price of wool and the price secnred by the industry during the war. If that had been done, our financial burdens might have been considerably eased without the pastoral industry being placed in a worse position than it was in when the war started. I am not able to vote for the amendment, but I will strongly support any proposal that the Government should in some way remedy the injustice done to the workers, who have been improperly and unnecessarily deprived of their means of livelihood. -From both sides of the Committee a request has been made that consideration should be given to the employees in the wool-tops industry, and if the Acting Attorney^General( Mr Groom) cannot accept the amendment, it is competent for him to promise, on behalf of. the Government, that the employees will participate in any profits that are. paid into the Commonwealth coffers. It is quite true that many large employers, pricked perhaps by conscience, have been almost forced to pay out to their employees some of the large profits made in war time In New Zealand, every Budget introduced since the war commenced has provided for an amount of nearly half-a-million pounds to be distributed amongst State employees for services rendered during war-time. As the Government are participants in the profits made in the wool-tops industry, they are of necessity partners in the industry, and it is their duty to share some of those profits with their employees. cannot agree with the contention that portion of the profits should go back to the wool-grower. He is now receiving a splendid price for his wool, and I have not heard one pastoralist in this or any other State express dissatisfaction with the price received for either greasy or scoured wool. It must be remembered that over and above the splendid flat rate belongs wool has been sold to local manufacturers I' at prices up to 42d. per lb. Other wool is sold at prices ranging from 70d. to lOOd. per lb. on the other side of the world, and 50 per cent, of all profits made by the Imperial Government on the re-sale of wool is returned to the Australian growers. iWhy should they now seek to grab some of the money that ought more properly to be paid to those engaged in the fellmongering industry! If the amendment is not appropriate to the Bill, the. sense of the Committee is favorable to the payment of a bonus, or some other monetary recognition to the employees in the wool-tops industry. admit-that the wool-grower has no further claim upon wool sold to local manufacturers, but this distinct contract was entered into with a condition that the Central -Wool Committee, as trustee for the growers, retained the right to from 50 to 664 per cent, of all profits made on the sale of 1 wool tops abroad. If the wool had not been supplied to local manufacturers, it would have been shipped abroad, and the grower would then have received without question 50 per cent, of the profits on re-sale. I do not contend that the grower has the right to follow his raw material into the secondary industry, and ask for the profits made from manufacture. This is a contract in which the Central Wool Committee specifically retains half the profits under a special contract. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order!
