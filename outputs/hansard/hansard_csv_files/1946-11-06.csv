That the honourable member for Dalley( Mr in a Parliament constituted as this one is, Rosevear) do take the chair of this House as scrupulous fairness, should be observed in Speaker. the Opposition) I move:That the honourable member for Corangamite House as Speaker. The time for further proposals having expired, the Opposition) [2.37] -The Opposition has submitted the nomination of the honourable member for Corangamite , ( ^ McDonald) for the Speakership of this House, not because it entertains some such fanciful idea as that the numbers will be with it in the ballot, but because it conhonorable member for Dalley. siders that it ought to seize this opportunity to say one or two things about the C l e r k Speakership. We believe, and imagine that all honourable members will believe, that it is the function of Mr Speaker to be scrupulously impartial in his treatment of both sides of the House. All honourable members who were in the last Parliament will recall that on, at any rate, two occasions, it became necessary for the members of the Opposition to put into formal shape their protest against rulings given by Mr Speaker in that Parliament, and against what they believe; to be his partial treatment of members of the House. That iswhy we take this opportunity of submitting a candidate in opposition to the honvear). I want to say right away, so that there may be no confusion about, this discussion, that our attitude on this matter,, and the protest upon which we build it,, are not in any day due to some personal, hostility to the honourable member for Dalley, as he knows. It is not based upon, the idea that he lacks the ability to perform the functions of the Chair, because everybody on this side of the Houserecognizes his ability, and acknowledges it freely. Our complaint is not, and never has been, based upon personal grounds. It is and has been based upon our belief that, the treatment of both sides; and it is in order that we may have an opportunity of securing that treatment that we nominate the honourable member for Minister and Treasurer) [2.40] I support the nomination of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) for the position of Speaker in the belief that it is the. best that could be made. The honourable member, during his previous occupancy of the position, performed his duties most ably, and I repudiate the suggestion that be was other than impartial. During the r time that I have been a member of this Parliament no one has discharged the duties of Speaker with greater distinction, impartiality and ability than did the That'the question be now put.
