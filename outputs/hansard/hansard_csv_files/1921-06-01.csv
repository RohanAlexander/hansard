The valuation is indeed conservabe in a position to do so until some systive. tem of international credit can be arranged. I have no doubt that, under the Bawra scheme, considerable relief will be experienced, but unless more credit can be established, our raw materials will be sold at considerably below their true market value.

The whole of this information has been laid before the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook), who bas promised to interview the Associated Banks. The deputation placed before the right honourable gentleman the following proposals, which he could not see his way to accept:1. That the Federal Government approach Bawra with the object of stabilizing the value of wool included in the free wool at The holder, however, requires present held, and the clip of 1921-1922, by guaranteeing a flat rate of lOd. per lb. (which was the average price for a series of years prior to appraisement scheme, on which the flat rate of 15Jd. was based), and paying for the free wool immediately, and the wool of 1921-22 on receipt of same in store after apThe freehold praisement. 2. That the Federal Government stabilizes the position of graziers generally by creating a credit with the Associated Banks by the issue of notes, such notes to be redeemed within three or five years. The credit so established to be used in the following manner:(a) Advances to be made on the security of lands to an aggregate including . amounts already advanced by Banks not exceeding 65 per cent, of the value of the land. The Government to accept declarations from bank managers as to present day values of properties held as security, and the moneys so advanced to be on separate accounts, and not to be used iu reduction of existing overdrafts, (b) Advances up to 100 per cent, of value of certificates issued for wool ap praised, on flat, rate of lOd. per .lb. Under this it would be necessary for all wool to bo appraised by Bawra, aud certificates issued (similarly to . Wheat Pool) for the value of the clip.. The graziers, who are in had circumr stances, do not demand that the flat rate should, be lOd. per lb., but they do say that some rate should bofixed which would provide them w it h some money with which to carry on. 3. Alternatively to resolution 2, if the proposal for establishing credit by issue of notes be not favoured, that the Federal Government arrange a short-dated loan in London to Stabilize the position of graziers generally, the whole of the money so raised to be made available for the Banks' use, for advances as provided for in resolution 2 (a) and (6). 4. Should the foregoing proposals be accepted, it is necessary for immediate action, and that the Government, instead of creating a fresh Department for the management of the business, appoint a committee of business men in each State to act as' a sort of Board of Directors to pass advances, and, if necessary, arbitrate in the event of any differences arising regarding valuation of properties, &c. 5. It is further proposed that a conference be called with representatives of the Associated 1 Banks, the: Chairman, of Bawra, and representatives of the graziers-to fully, go into the matters raised by the deputation. Personally,. I do not take any responsibility for the suggested note issue or the short-dated loan in London. there is sufficient credit in Australia support men. who are absolutely and require only a little temporary sistance in order that they may r«-stock their land and carry on until they have sold their wool, or until such time as the wool position is eased. Whilst the Acting Prime Minister may be opposed to any further inflation of the note issue, and will not entertain the suggestion for a shortdated loan in London, he should, at least, make somearrangement with the Associated Banks whereby they will not foreclose on small land-holders. suggested by representatives sociated Banks that it is not their intention to. close down on the small men. Others cold-bloodedly say that times are bad, and the weakest must go to the wall. That is a brutal and vicious principle to enunciate. thirty, forty, or even forty-five years on Mr Blakeley. the land,. and finds himself, temporarily embarrassed owing to drought, followed by floods and the depression of the wool 1 market caused by international -conditions, should not be forced off his land because of temporary tightness of the money market or panic on the part of the bankers. The schedule which has been filed deals w it h forty-three cases, in all of which it has been found that the valuation of properties is about twelve years old. The properties have not been reyalued in the meantime, although, in many instances, the value of the land had completely altered. Many of the properties have been further improved, and the titles have been converted. A properry which might have been valued at £6,000 twelve years ago would to-day be worth probably double that amount. Notwithstanding that fact, the banks w ill do nothing to relieve the situation. suggest that land in New South Wales and Queensland is as valuable to-day as it was two years ago? value of twelve years ago has been doubled. A great number of conditional purchase blocks and Crown leases have been converted, and conditions have been fulfilled, which make the land considerably more valuable-10 0 per cent, more valuable in some cases. Where the title of a conditional purchase has been conI believe verted the security is ever so much betto ter. Sir John Higgins, the Chairman of solvent, Bawra, attended the deputation which aswaited upon the Acting Prime Minister, and' we suggested to h i m that Bawra should' take control of the whole of the wool. I am a f r a nk advocate of the pooling system; but Sir John' Higgins stated that unless the whole of the wool-growers were prepared to go into the Pool he could do nothing, whilst the Acting Prime Minister said that he would not compel wool-growers to place their wool in the Pool. If the wool-growers were to It has been come together and enlarge the business of the Asof Bawra, so that that body could establish credits and pay on appraisement, as was done during the war, thesituation would be considerably relieved. I believe that the pooling system' is so' good that it should be adopted always, and not only A man who has been twenty, in times of war and financial stringency.",22,Adjournment Formal
27,Mr Hill?,Does the honourable member,24,Adjournment Formal
28,Mr Blakeley,"I say that themember apply that advocacy to wheat-as well? hundreds of thousands of men are producing the same article, they should come together as a co-operative society for the selling of .their products instead of marketing them through agents like Dalgety& Co., Dreyfus -& Co., :and other big wool-broking firms. The wool-growers and the wheat-growers could market their own products, and thereby eliminate the middlemen.. If the wool-growers establish their pooling system they will be in a very much better position than they are to-day. There is no difference between Bawra holders and holders of free wool. There will 'be involved merely the matter of enlarging their business. It will be lov wool-growers generally .to say whether they shall so expand their business. But it will take 'time :to inaugurate a scheme to pool the -who'lfi of the wool of .Australia-^so much time, .indeed, that those who are being'.forced by .the banks to-day would probably find themselves removed from their small 'holdings. The Prime 'Minister of South Africa (General Smuts) adopted a totally different attitude from that .""of thp Australian Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). T quote the following cablegram from Capetown .published in the' Sydney Daily Telegraph of 28th May: Before sailing for London this, afternoon the Prime Minister made a statement on the wool position before the Assembly -He said that the Government' had been negotiating' for -the -gale of the new clip .to the British .Government, but had found difficulties. He was .not /sure Whetheri t -would succeed, and, therefore, in view of the financial situation, the Government had come to the conclusion that it would -be 'necessary 'to 'assist 'the producers torevive the scheme in'operation,-before'the war, whereby the banks, with -a Government guarantee, made advances on wool. General Smuts-said that the wool and mohair farmers would be entitled to an advance of up to '50 per cent, on pre-war prices, which would enable them to tide over the financial depression. The Prime Minister praised the liberality ef the banks, which/had agreed to accept 64 per cent, interest. pressed . on' the banks< the .grave necessity; owing to the present crisis, of not . contracting, credit for too much. Apparently, .just what took place in .South Africa in the matter of the banks forcing graziers .has occurred in Australia. The -Government .can immediately relieve the situation here if they desire. . This is an absolutely solvent industry, requiring, perhaps, not more than -a couple of millions sterling by way of necessary advances to those who are in need. It would be an easy matter to authorize the Commonwealth .Bankwhich-would act'in conjunction ""with the Associated Banks-to establish a credit which would permitthese people to-.stock up and carry-on. 'If some such assistance is not-granted the-present condition of unemployment throughout Australia 'must -become considerably more acute. In New -South Wales there are between : lOjOOO and 15,'OGM men out of work. The position in Victoria is just as bad. In South Australia there ore some 5j000 -men out, and the,re is unemployment in Western Australia, Tasmania, -and -Queensland. The shearing-season is approaching, but, unless the industry is stabilized,-quite a number Who, ordi-naTily,'would employ labour ""for shearing' will not be in a position to do -so.

The honourable mem-, ber said'that--it' provided for the compulsory ^resumption of land,!and that because of that provision it had' had the effect of depreciating land values in New South Wales. In Victoria, where there is-not aLabour Government in power, an Act providing for the compulsory.resumption of estates has .been in operation for many years. passed there, was no talk on the part of the banking-institutions of calling upon land-holders. or any one -else to reduce their overdrafts; but because such a measure, was introduced by a Labour Government, in the New South Wales Parliament, the honourable member urges that it has brought about all the difficulties under which land-holders in that State are labouring'to-day. We know, as a fact, that it has not done so. The Acting Prime Minister .( Sir Joseph Cook) also urged ' that the man' on the, land ih Queensland and New. South Wales had been subjected to the most unfortunate conditions because of legislation passed by State Labour Governments! It is to be regretted that the right honourable gentleman was unable to discuss thisquestion' without introducing party politics. He might, have well been expected to ""propound some scheme to assist the people on the land' who are in such difficulties today. Unfortunately, he made no. such attempt, but approached the consideration of the question from a purely partypolitical stand-point. able gentleman also made the most extraordinary statement that land values in New South Wales were higher twelve months ago than they are to-day. The resumption of land for soldier settlement has actually increased prices. not say 'that the Acting Prime -Minister made the statement knowing it to be false, but it certainly is wholly opposed to fact. Land values m New South Wales today are as high as they have been within my knowledge for the last fifteen years.

If they d6, .'theywill speedily discover that they are mistaken. such' a bad time,' as we are asked to believe, then values must soon decrease. an entirely different matter. The honourable member is looking at the question from the right point of view: If as a result of the most disastrous, drought ever experienced in New South Wales landowners there are in difficulties to-day,, and Wheni t was being if,, because of those difficulties, they are in many pases forced off the land, values will certainly decrease. The present situation.is due to natural causes, and what I might describe as ""bad luck,"" rather than to legislation. have been operating during the last three years, and in that way land values have been depreciated. so. said a few moments ago that land values in New South Wales to-day were as high as they had been for many years. cause land-owners who have had to 'fight drought conditions have not yet had pressure brought' to bear upon them by the' banks. ' They are struggling under serious handicaps due tt* the natural causes to which I have referred, and if the financial institutions call upon them to reduce their overdrafts before they can get on their feet again, there certainly will The right honorbe a depreciation in land values. Bad seasons and not bad legislation are responsible for the present situation. As a matter of fact, the Land Bill to which the honourable member for Dampier referred was not passed. It was withdrawn. ThatB ill ' was capable of much sendee, and I trust that it .will be improved and re-introduced, in the hope of doing something in the direction of cutting up large estates of 50,000 and 60,000 acres and over, and thus giving an opening . to -people who are now looking for land in vain. < There was one other statement made by the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the assistance which he says is always given by the private 'banking institutions",30,Adjournment Formal

113,Mr Deputy'speaker,"The honcannot properly be managed by the States individually, and on the Commonwealth Government falls the duty of safeguarding the interests of the nation. I submit, therefore, as a fair analogy, that when war is being made, as it were, on a section of our primary producers engaged in a national industry, the Connnonwealth Government ought to come to their protection and aid. We have been told that the banks -have gone as far as they can-that they are business institutions, and have to safeguard themselves. I remind honourable members, however, that the private banks enjoy certain privilege's under the -laws of this country, and, moreover, that when money is plentiful we find bank managers approaching producers and urging them to go into propositions in bank funds that would otherwise be idle. Many men have been induced by bank managers in that way to go into certain propositions, and now that the period of depression has come upon us, some of the banks are suffering from cold feet, and are doing much to injure the credit of this country hy intimating to the landholders that their credits are not good, or that they have to reduce their overdrafts. besides cold feet. say that this is a deliberate attempt to discredit La'bour Governments, and it is significant that this move was first made in New South ""Wales, a State which has as good credit as has any other in the Commonwealth. Still, it is there that we find a great move made to order men to reduce their overdrafts. order to meet this order, many of the men are forced to dispose of what I call their reproductive capital. A man may have 2,000 acres of land worth £3,000, with £1,000 worth of sheepa flock that lie has, perhaps, spent years and years in breeding up to a certain pitch of perfection. When he is. ordered to reduce his overdraft, he has to sell that flock. Therefore,, to reduce his overdraft, he leaves Ms .property bareof stock, and, consequently, bare of his reproductive capital. Land and grass, without stock to grow wool or increase in weight to be sold as fats, are of no use. The reason for the attitude of the banks -is beyond my comprehension. They stood at the back of the importers and paid their debts overseas, as we know, because the papers are full of it. When these, men ordered ten times the amount of stuff they required, and large quantities were unexpectedly delivered, the banks stepped in and met their debts overseas. The papers went so far as to say that the banks should have .shut down on the importers six or twelve months be. fore they did. It was only when these men i a d drifted into such a position that the banks saw no chance of their paying their debts, that they shut down on them, and refused further credit. orable member is making a great mistake, order to absorb there. tion came from reliable sources, as 'well as the daily press that supports the present Federal Government. If I am wrong, the honourable member's press supporters are wrong also. It seems to me that the action of the banks is designed to crucify the country at the expense of; the cities. I am one of those on the land, and am continually receiving letters from men who have been forced to sell their live stock. If this policy is persisted iiij the Government will find, big areas of land in New South Wales, as well as in other portions of Australia, without stock on them. The present holders will have no incomes during the next twelve months, and, consequently, large amounts of revenue will be lost both to the State and Federal Treasuries.

It has done what the other ' banks have done; Had it not done that it would not have ? been so successful as it has been from its inception. I do not want the impression that might be caused by the remarks of some speakers about the .'banks to go abroad as the truth, because it is not. I know what have been the misfortunes of the people of New South Wales during the past two years, and I sympathize with those who have suffered; but, everything considered, the position of our producers is, generally speaking, satisfactory. Recently, in conversation, one of the biggest machinery men in Australia told me that, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, 90 per cent, of the acceptances for machinery falling due two or three'weeks ago were met. tunes of the men in New South Wales, due to the drought, and his reply was that the way in which that 'State, as well as the others, had come up to the mark in its payments was amazing. If anything is to be done for the relief of producers in New South Wales, it should be done by the New South Wales Government. The National Government should tell the people, in unmistakable language, that this is not its business, and that it does not propose to follow a dangerous path. This Government will have enough to do to pay its own debts ; indeed, it ""will have and, being short of money, are asking to strain its resources to the utmost, now and for some time to come, to meet its own engagements. though the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook) and the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Gregory) have said that this debate is a waste of time, and that the subject that is being discussed should not have been brought before the Chamber, I hold ""that no more important subject has been, discussed here, during my term, at any rate. Realizing, as I do, the position of the graziers of Australia, and particularly of New South Wales, I am surprised tliat any member should say that the adjournment should not have been moved to discuss this subject, and to impress on the Government that it is its duty to come to the assistance of the men on the land. As I am particularly interested in the subject, I have listened attentively to all the speeches that have been delivered during the debate, and paid more than usual attention to that of the Leader of the Government. But of what did it consist? The right honourable gentleman said that he sympathized with the graziers in the present crisis, but that he could not, and would not, do anything to assist them. The rest of his speech was an attack on the Labour Governments of New South Wiales and Queensland. He endeavoured to make party capital at the expense of the graziers of Australia, not caring how many men might be forced off their holdings and on to the labour market, so long as he could do that. In speaking of the attitude of the Labour Government of New 'South Wales to the land-owners of the State, he carefully refrained from I spoke of the misformentioning that last year the Government did what no other Government has done:; it borrowed £2,000,000 to assist necessitous farmers, with the result that the acreage under wheat was increased, and has -given a generous return. That Government last year, by its action, stabilized the man on the -> land; and actions speak louder than' words. Members opposite have' spoken of the generosity of the^ banks, and have said that they did not believe that the banks were forcing men off. the land. They added that the banks themselves are having rather a bad time, their customers to reduce their overdrafts. I find from a report in the Argus that the net profits of the Bank of New South Wales for the last six months amounted to£403,932, as compared with a net profit for the previous six months of £364,219. It would appear, therefore, that while the Bank had an exceptionally prosperous time in the previous six months, it did much better during the half-year that has just closed, a dividend of 10 per cent.,, as well as an 'extraordinary bonus of 10s: per share, being paid.

128,Mr Lavelle (Calare) [4.52],"Algenerous in their treatment of graziers and landowners generally, and that they are having rather a bad time, themselves. This, of .course, is not so. A few weeks ago honourable members had an opportunity to discuss the .financial difficulties graziers from being 'forced to realize on of the wool-growers, owing to the 'fact that they are. unable .to market their wool. That debate in itself was an admission that the graziers' position is a very serious oue indeed. Figures relating, -to the stock returns in New South Wales show that at the present time there are only 25,000,000 sheep .in that Statethe smallest number recorded during the last forty-six years. The land, since the drought, is flowing with milk and honey, so far as .grass is concerned, but the graziers are unable to stock up. Many, indeed, are being forced to sell in order to carry on. Speaking with a positive knowledge of this, subject, I can inform honourable members that three weeks ago -'we sent a couple of hundred sheep to the Sydney market, the consignment including 100 cross bred wethers, well grown and in prime condition; and 90 lambs, exceptionally well grown and very fat. For these we obtained a net return of only lis. per head, whereas a couple of years ago the wethers would have realized from £2 10s. to £3 per head in the Homebush market. ""This proves conclusively that some graziers are in financial difficulties, and are being obliged to sacrifice their stock in order to meet the claims of the banks. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the banks are lending money on exceptionally cheap and easy terms. Speaking again from personal experience, I can inform honourable members that I am paying 7\ and 8 per cent, for my accommodation from the bank, so honourable members will have some idea of the real position and the so-called "" generosity "" on the part of the banks. I submit, therefore, that it is the duty of the Government to come to the assistance of the graziers by enlarging the powers and extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, if necessary, so. that the Bank may take over graziers' accounts and finance them until the wool and stock market is stabilized, thus preventing the ruin which must inevitably come to. a large number of land-owners unless something is done to help them. Every honourable member, I think; realizes. that the most -important industry in Australia is that of wool-rgrowing, and because of its precarious position at present, somedefinite action should be taken to prevent 'the their stock or sacrifice their land.

Item 136Iron and Steel(A) Pig iron per ton-British, 20s.; intermediate, 30s.; general, 40s. Honourable members are aware that I have always advocated the nationalization of the iron and steel industry in Australia, but as ifc has been proved over and over again that the Commonwealth has no power under the Constitution to do that, we have encouraged the establishment, in two instances, of big iron and steel works in the State of New South Wales. Many thousands of people are employed directly and indirectly by these works, and my concern is as to their continued employment and the conditions under which they are working. I find that since this schedule was placed on the table of the House there have been considerable changes, such asincreases in the price of coal, increases in harbour dues, and increases under Wages Boards findings, so that the commercial values of the duties set out on most of the lines produced by the two Mr Bean is editing big establishments in New South Wales have been, in some instances, reduced by 70 to 80 per cent., and in other cases completely obliterated. For instance, the value of the duty on pig iron has been reduced by 70 per cent. Instead of being 20s. British, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general, it is 6s. British, 16s. intermediate, and 25s. general. The same thing applies right down the list of similar items. Recently, there has been a considerable increase in the iniportation of steel and iron, presumably from Belgium, but it is questionable whether the imported steel has not really originated in Germany, where, as I shall show, the wages paid are exceedingly low in comparison with those paid in Australia. This material has been landed in Australia and sold at about, £10 per ton less than the price of the The intervals are diffilocal production, and if this importation continues, it is obvious that it will be utterly impossible for our own works to compete. The value of the duty on ingots, blooms, &c, has been reduced in the manner I have already described from 32s. British, to 10s. 7d. I do not propose to weary honourable members hy institutMETALS AND MACHINERY.* ing a detailed comparison in regard to the duties under the intermediate or general columns of the Tariff. It is sufficient to say that the reductions are proportionate throughout. The reduced value of the 44s. duty on bar, rod, angle, and tee steel is minus 2s. 8d.

The announcement was made following a joint meeting of the company officials and representatives of the workmen under the employees' representation plan in effect at the plant. The reduction is similar to the one being made at the Lebanon plant. A 10 to 20 per cent, reduction is also announced for the Sparrow's Point plant, effective on the same date. 6,000 men under normal conditions. In Great Britain, we find considerable reductions have been made in the wages paid in the iron trade. The Engineering and Industrial Management of the 27th January, 1921, gives the information that The n the honourable the Furness Miners Union had'agreed to accept a reduction, in wages from £ 1 2s. Sd. to 19s. 7d. per day, and that the iron ore miners in Lancashire had agreed to accept a reduction in wages of about '3s. per day. The same publication in .its issue of the 10th March, 1921, contained the announcement that the Cleveland ironstone miners had given notice that the 2s. advance per day granted in November, the war wage of 3s. per day, and the Sankey payment of 2s. per day shift would be terminated on the 31st March. The patent fuel export trade manufacturers applied in Januaryf o r a reduction of 20 per cent, in wages, and the iron and steel employers of Sheffield gave notice in March that a reduction of \ 7 \ per cent, was proposed for men working in rolling mills and forges.

Huntington, Paris, states that a French decree of 1.8th December, published in the Journal .Officiate for 27th December, re-establishes with the corresponding coefficient the import duty on rails, fishplates, bridges, and parts thereof, which was suspended by decree of 30th November, 1914, and 3rd March, 1915, in cases where such materials were required for repairs on railways, &c, necessary for national defence. The duty on heavy structural iron and steel is 12 francs per 100 kilos., with a coefficient of 3, which makes the duty now in force 36 francs per 100 kilos., or 3 dollars 15 cents per 100 lbs -£1 4 .2s. 6d. conversion on standard value of France. Both Belgium and France are trying, by heavy imposts, to re-establish their works for the production of iron and steel; and the Australian duties in relation to this basic industry are little more than revenue duties in comparison with the Tariffs in other parts of the world. are admitted free to the United States. lines may be. free to-day, but they will not be when in-: dustries for their manufacture are established. manufacture rails for State Governments, read that England is paying attention to these basic industries by imposing, in some instances, duties of from 70 to 80 per cent. For many years this Parliament discussed how the iron and steel industry could be established in Australia, and ultimately it was established; and we are in the fortunate position of know-' ing that our iron and steel works,' although young, are making good progress and developing on a firm basis. The iron and steel works in my own electorate employ directly about 6,000 people; and it is hard to estimate the number of people who are indirectly dependent upon them. could be multiplied by three or four. tion also the subsidiary industries that are collecting around the mother industries for the utilization of the smaller sizes of steel. To-day, when all other nations are trying to rebuild their iron and. steel industries, we should take steps to protect and foster ours until they are on a sound footing. I have shown the necessity for those industries, and how much they have already meant to the Commonwealth. Australia is an island continent, and if it were at any time cut"" off from the help of the Motherland, our people would be powerless to defend themselves if we were without steel works to produce the material for our armaments. A well-established iron and steel industry is the greatest essential to a country that desires to be self-contained in respect of defence requirements. We feel safer when we know that, in addition to having the finest men in the world, we are able to arm them within the Commonwealth. I do not intend to say anything further upon the first of these items, but on later items I shall move that the duties be increased by an average of 50 per cent. Eveni f that increase is made, the local products will not be on as good a commercial level as they were when the Tariff was first laid upon the table, because some of the old duties have been wiped out altogether, and in respect of other items the effective duties have been reduced by from 70 to 80 per cent.",40,Divisionvi

Mr ""WATKINS -If they compared those rates with existing Tariffs in other parts of the world where huge steel and iron industries flourish, they would he impressed hy the fact that my proposal is a relatively low one. And it is so, judged by the standard of the Tariffs which were imposed in order to establish works, of magnitude in the countries indicated. In my electorate, more than £4,000,000 has been invested in the iron and steel works. There are at present about 6,000men directly -employed, to say nothing of those concerned in attendant industries which are being grouped around the iron and steel works, and which are producing independently and giving employment to large numbers. If the Tariff stands .without the amendments which I desire, those Australian works which are just now becoming firmly established will have to carry on without adequate protection such as is being given to other Australian industries, both small and great. We must place the big parent industries upon a sound footing, so that they may withstand competition emanating from cheap-labour countries. I sincerely trust that the Minister will accede to my request. I want to see these industries, not merely firmly based, but flourishing. Unless we grant sufficient protection, we cannot expect that. boiuity, instead of making these increases in the Tariff? Everybody would pay his share then. have been well enough in the early stages, when the industries could not produce enough to meet Australia's requirements; but when steel works have reached a stage at which they can turn out sufficient to supply Australia's requirements, the matter of a bounty goes by the board. If it could be shown that we had suffered by the operation of the Tariff as a means of protection to these industries in the past, if Australians had been penalized by Australian iron and steel producers behind the shelter of Protection, I would he able to understand the desire to grant a bounty rather than increase the degree of protection. But the plea for a bounty rather than a high duty fails to attract when one considers the price of these products throughout the world. The establishment of these works in Australia, under theprotection of the Tariff, instead of being detrimental to the public interest, has saved them in the aggregate perhaps £10,000,d00. I make use of that figure in the light of what Australians would have had to pay for their requirements had they imported them during the period under review. I ask-the Minister to consider the danger confronting these, new Australian industries, not only from such sources as America and Germany, but from India, where works are now being devoted, after a period of war-time activity, almost entirely to export trade. Australia is one of India's closest markets ; and where will we be in competition with cheap Indian labour if we are not safeguarded?"" Australian manufacturers have proved that Australian steel is of the finest quality in the world. The industry is rapidly growing, and its interests -wrappe d up as they are in those of Australia itself-deman d our practical sympathy have listened with interest and pleasure to the remarks of the honourable member, and I am quite in sympathy with his objects. I have visited the great steel works at Newcastle. They are a credit to the Commonwealth. They should receive every possible encouragement by way of adequate protection. At the same time, I call attention to the danger of imposing a heavy duty all round upon iron and steel productions. We must be careful not to place a practically prohibitive duty upon certain lines of manufacture which are not yet being turned out in Australia. I cite as an example steel plates and sheets, upon which, on and after the 1st January, 1922, there are pro-"" posed to be dutiesI quote merely one size as an example-amountin g to 65s., S2s. 6d., and 100s. per ton. A certain firm in my electorate was tendering some time ago for a contract involving the manufacture of fifty-five locomotives. The firm had to compete keenly both with Britain and America. There are various lines of steel and iron products which",41,French Duties Re Established

If they have to be obtained from overseas, an exceedingly high duty upon them will naturally affect any tender such as that of the firm in question. We must protect the general machinery founders. I wish to know if the Minister will consent to withhold the' imposition of the duty if , after 1st January, 1922, certain lines are still not manufactured here? and power will be taken to extend the period if the manufacture of the products has not at that stage been undertaken. In fact, steps in that direction have already been taken. that if , by the time indicated, the manufacture of the products in question has"" not been undertaken here, a further extension will be given. [5.52] -It is our desire to see Australia become, as far as possible, self-sustaining. In order to bring that about, our infant iron and steel industry must be much more practically encouraged than in the past. Our trouble hitherto has been mainly that we have not been able to furnish from within Australia the essential raw products, or, at any rate, in requisite quantities. now being obviated. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) interjected some'minutes ago that instead of considerably increasing duties, it would be wiser to revert to the bonus system, under which the whole of the Australian people would give their share of financial assistance. itself only so long as Australia could not furnish the Australian industry with the necessary raw product. tries are to flourish and become great, and supply the whole of the Australian demand, we must be able to furnish the raw material from within. There is one difficulty which has arisen, however, in connection with providing the raw product for the iron and steel industry. To-day there are only two large interests supplying iron, namely, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. Complaints have been made by smaller men which, unhappily, are justified. The iron and steel manufacturers may say that they are not in a position to supply smaller manufacturers with their product, and the smaller men, whose operations are interfered with, have then to compete unfairly with those who are receiving supplies. » tories which could not obtain supplies. various reasons have been submitted. It was said on one occasion that the nasty workers went on strike, and that those engaged in the collieries would not handle coal. Personally, I hope that those who are inadequately paid will continue striking until their conditions are improved. able member would like to see an additional duty imposed? be better if the honourable member submitted such a conundrum to the Chinese. prietary Company may acquire an interest in some of the larger' factories in New South Wales, and then decline to supply factories in other States. but such a charge could also be laid against other companies. That is one of the damnable situations which arise under our present economic system. We That difficulty, however, is also know that the importers supply only certain people, and I am merely submitting arguments against the imposition of higher duties. I am hoping that the increase suggested by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), if adopted, will be the means of inducing other manufacturers to come to AusThe bonus system justified tralia. Eveni f they do, there is the risk of an "" honourable understanding"" being entered into with other capitalistic instiI f our industutions; but I am hoping that the measure which the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) has promised to bring before this Parliament will be the means of preventing commercial combines from operating to the detriment of the consumers. This practice is not common to the iron trade alone, because it was said that, if the spinning mills in Australia would not supply certain small manufacturers with the necessary yarn, they would have to pay a higher price for imported yarn, and would thus be placed in a very unfair position. Of course, the spinning mill proprietors said that",42,French Duties Re Established

172,Mr Mathews,"That may be so;they could not help it, as they had certain contracts to complete; but nevertheless the smaller men were penalized. We have experienced similar difficulties in many other directions. When we were discussing the last Tariff, and the duty on rope and jute was under consideration, the smaller manufacturers said that if we placed a duty on yarn Australian manufacturers would not he able to compete in the open market. I was in favour of encouraging the manufacture of yarn in Australia, and therefore had to insist on the imposition of a higher duty. We have to depend largely upon the' actions of the firms. We know that capitalism has no soul; but if the capitalists do not look after their own interests, no one else will. I am prepared to tell the manufacturers of Australia that they are foolish if they do not assist in establishing industries for the manufacture of our raw products,; but if these industries combine; to the detriment of others, this Parliament must have the opportunity of taking them over, not at their own price, but at a price acceptable to the Government. If I happen to be on the side that dominates the political situation when such action is taken, these gentlemen will get very short shrift from me, because if we are not prepared to control their operations we will be in a very bad position. 1 does not expect this Government to act in the manner he suggests.

187,Mr Mathews,"I know thathad an opportunity of closely investigating the Australian iron industry, and recently visited the works of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. My last visit was made about two months ago, and it is possible that conditions may have altered somewhat since then, but at that particular time, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited were quite ""satisfied with the duties now before the Committee. fallen out of things on the other side of the world since then. manager of the BrokenH ill steel works said that at I r o n Knob they have the richest iron ore deposits in the world, and they could produce from their deposit in South Australia 1 ton of pig iron for every ton of-ooke used. He also informed me that the next cheapest producer in the world was Pittsburg, where it took 25 cwt. of coke to produce 1 ton of pig iron, thus showing that Australia had. a preference of 25 per cent, over America. I am quite prepared to give the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited fair and proper protection provided that the public of Australia are also protected. moment that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, in competition with other manufacturers, would be penalized, I would support a higher duty, but I have not heard an argument put forward that would suggest that an increase should be made. In giving protection .to our Australian industries, we have to be careful not to create Combines, which would be dominated by a few commercial men, and which would eventually be a curse to Australia. We have only to visit the site of the steel works at Newcastle to find that the adjacent ground is divided into blocks which they are prepared to lease to other -firms for the establishment of secondary industries.

The Newcastle works of the BrokenH ill Company have been established now for a few years. I say that they were of immense value to this country during the war. I do not know what we should have done in Australia had it not been for this particular company. When the honourable member for Parkes talks of objecting to a monopoly, let me remind him that he is no more opposed to monopolies than I am. But I am not coming here to play the hypocrite, and I say that even if the BrokenH ill Company were a monopoly we should not permit monopolies established outside of Australia and carrying on their business with cheap labour to send their goods here to the detriment of the people for whom we have to find employment. the recent war has taught the people of Australia and members of this Parliament that this country must be self-contained. If it has taught us that lesson, then we must discuss this Tariff with a view to establishing Australian industries. The speecli of the honourable member for Parkes leads me to the conclusion that he does not understand the position. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated on more than one occasion that if this Tariff is passed it is his intention to have to be taken into account by us in create a Board, and if he finds through the investigations of that Board that any monopoly has been created for the purpose of exploiting the people, he will bring the matter before this Parliament and have the monopoly dealt with through the Tariff. that. the honourable member should support the sea. increased duty proposed in this case. taken very fine care to give the Committee no inkling whatever of what will be contained in the Bill he proposes to introduce.

Mr 'GREGORY -It should have been introduced before now. mitted to us we shall be able to discuss it, and to make it as effective as possible. ber think such a measure will be effective? why it should not be effective. The honourable member, no doubt, has in mind our constitutional limitations. ( Mr Greene) has said, the Constitution gives us full power to deal with Customs; and if those whom we protect do not act fairly by the people, we shall be able, by the exercise of our Customs power, to put them in their proper place. That being so, we have only to consider whether or The question is whether not the duty is adequate. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) has stated that it is wholly inadequate. It might have been sufficient for the purpose when this Tariff schedule was submitted twelve months ago, but since then there have been many changes in Australian conditions. Amongst other thing3, owing to the increased cost of living, wages have been increased. Then, again, freights have gone up, and the price of coal has increased. All these matters determining whether or not the duty is adequate. We know also that throughout Europe the workers, in many instances, have been obliged recently to take reduced wages, in order that the industries in which they are engaged may carry on. During the war the workers in other countries received much higher and we were in a better position, therefore, to compete with imports from overCircumstances, however, have changed, and labour abroad being now",46,Robert Best Th E Honourable Manufacturers Of Iron But I Am Not Going

The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has told us that the BrokenH i ll Proprietary has refused to sell its products on an equal footing to different purchasers. In order to dissipate any idea of the kind, I quote the following letter-whic h has justbeen handed to me-fro m the secretary of the BrokenH i ll Proprietary to the Minister for Trade and Customs:. In reply to the. statement made in the House of Representatives this afternoon by the honourable member for Parkes to the effect that discrimination and preference to customers in respect of supply and delivery were practised by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, I desire to state emphatically that neither charge can be sustained against my company. There we have an emphatic denial. honourable member has a perfect right to substantiate what he has said. However, there is no industry in the Commonwealth of greater importance than the iron and steel industry. It is good for us that the industry was under way when the war broke out; otherwise I do not know what would have happened to Australia. ammunition factory at Broken Hill? Mr' CHARLTON -Whateve r objection honourable members may have to this or any other company, we cannot deny that this industry was of great value to Australia during the trying period of the war. that if Australia had to be anything, it must be self-contained.

This duty was imposed twelve months ago, and honourable members who trace events during that time must conclude that what might be adequate then is inadequate to-day. desire ?. duty be increased by about 50 per cent. valorem ? members may laugh at my proposal, but what it means is an increase from 20s. to 30s. in the British preference column, 30s. to 45s. in the intermediate column, and 40s. to 60s. in the general column. I venture to say that these are not such big increases.as to justify any laughter, when we consider what has happened since the Tariff was originally imposed. For instance, relying on my memory, I may ask what has been the increase in the price of coal, which is used to such a large extent in this industry? the other side? the "" other side "" if the honourable member will wait. There has been a very substantial increase in the price of coal, and, in addition, the workers employed by this particular company, and, indeed, in all other industries, have received increases in wages, though those increases have never overtaken the cost of living. However, in the iron and steel industry the increases in wages have been -pretty heavy, and then we have to consider the increase in freights, harbour dues, and so forth. honourable member, a little while back, tell us that coal is produced more cheaply in Australia than anywhere else? now.

I find that the men who make all these protestations are the crowd who generally go to the Chinaman's shop to buy their groceries. I have made it clear ever since the Tariff debate started that I am very little concerned about the duties as they affect outside countries other than Great Britain. I should have liked to include Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa in the treatment accorded to Great Britain. I have done all I possibly could to. show how desirous I am of encouraging trade with the British Empire-that is, so far as we could do so with fair consideration to ourselves. In what I have said, I have always wanted the Committee to realize the value of the natural protection which Australia enjoys in regard to the importation of goods from outside. I do not intend to press that point so far as iron-and steel are concerned, but when we are dealing with of that sort, the question of natural protection is a very big one. It is wise for the Government to encourage an industry such as we are now considering. The only question is what nature that encouragement should partake of, and to what extent it is necessary. Nobody has shown that the BrokenH ill works at Newcastle are languishing, or that they have not been carried on at very great profit. ber suggest that we must wait until an industry is languishing before we take action? Would that not be rather late? able member will permit me, I shall show shortly, by reference to other countries, and particularly to Canada, what I mean. The BrokenH ill Company has built up this industry on first-class lines. It has as fine a plant as there is in the world. I have read its book, From Silver to Steel, and a good many of its reports. Unfortunately I have not been able to visit Newcastle to see its works there, but I believe I am correct in saying that it has one of the finest plants in the world.

That is where the trouble lies. We are asked, because up-to-date appliances are not used, and because a factory does not avail itself of all the latest inventions that in this case. it so far as some of our industries are concerned. production are not confined to. secondary industries, they apply to agriculture as well. more difficult we make it for the farmer to get his machinery in, the harder it is for him to use up-to-date methods. If Earliament were to say,. "" You must get everything you want in Australia; you must not use the inventions that are: being made all over the world,"" tbe difficulties of the farmer would be intensified. Quite a number of industrial concerns, realizing the competition they are meeting, from other countries, .are seriously considering this phase of the question. Only fhe other; night I read a paragraph in the Herald about the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, in. England, which, by installing a new blast furnace, had effected a saving in coke, wages, and. other charges which worked out at the rate of £60,000 a year compared with the expenditure on the furnace that it replaced. It is absolutely essential to consider that question in this case, for the very special reason that we are dealing now with one of the great key industries of Australia. By every fraction by which we increase-the cost of iron or steel, we are penalizing every other industry in the Commonwealth. If we make steel dearer in Australia, we must surely make dearer every implement that is required in the mine or on thefarm. to every primary product. ticularly to a key industry such as this. always been at least twice those of other coalTherefore, untilwe are satisfied, that it producing countries, and this has proved a. cannot be carried on successfully without a duty, we should hesitate before i m posing one. Surely some argument should, be brought forward to show that without this duty the industry cannot be carried on. The BrokenH ill Company has, I believe, one of the most up-to-date plants in the world. Its works are situated, right on the seaboard, and it ought, therefore, to be able to get its products in and out as cheaply as any other part of the world, including America, Canada, and Great Britain. capacity of that plant out of all proportion to the consumption capacity of the country ? although I have not gone into that phase of the question. If it is, we shall have to build up an. export trade, and I believe it is quite possible for the company to be able -to do so. A t any rate, the honourable member should realize that we cannot build up population in Australia by dragging all the people from the country into the cities* The company ought to be get-ting-coal as -cheaply asin almost any. country in the world. Our-coal miners and coal, mine-owners should, be able to produce at. a figure which compares favourably with coal, production anywhere else. They ought to be able to. compare more than,favourably, with the coal miner of England, and certainly ought to be able to compare with the coal miner of .Imerica.. If we are not doing so already,, and I do not say that is the case, it is probably due to the use of out-of-date methods.. Ai paper which I have here 7 dealing with the coal, industry, shows a remarkable difference in the production of coal in America.and in England. ber cannot go by those comparisons, because in. one case' you have a very high seam, and in .the other case a low seam, and a man can get out three times:morein one place than he can in the other. the majority of the mines in America, you probably get a bigger seam than in Great Bri tain.

The fact remains that, right through the war, wages in the United States of America were considerably higher than those paid in Australia. hours were longer. wages were considerably higher in America than here. The Review states that, according to the official British figures, in 1916 the average South Wale3 miner cut 222 tons of bituminous coal and 207 tons of anthracite coal, as against 891 tons of bituminous coal and 548 tons of anthracite coal cut by the average American miner. working in stockades in America, and would not let the union delegates enter. man is probably a great deal more independent than the workmen of other countries, and does not 'allow outsiders -to determine his conditions, as, for instance, at Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan recently. The .point I am making is that we must introduce the most up-to-date methods. be obtained at ""Newcastle to-day at £ 1 I s . 9d. per ton. In England, according to the latest returns, coal costs £ 2 12s. a ton. strike. It takes 3 tons of coal to manufacture a ton of steel,' and I question whether coal was obtainable in GreatB r it a in prior to the strike for twice the price a t which it can be got here. Then the BrokenH ill Company has at Iron Knob., in South Australia, a practically inexhaustible supply of iron ore, assaying from 66 to 68 per cent, of iron fairly free from -sulphur, and without phosphorus, whereas in Great Britain the average percentage of iron obtainable is from 30 to 36, and about the same, in Germany, and in the United States of Americai t is not more, than 38. Therefore, a ton of iron ore from I r o n Knob will yield nearly [356]2 twice as much pig iron as can be obtained from the iron ore mined in the countries iron and steel. In Australia, we have cheap coal and rich iron ore. What we should require of labour here is that its output should be equivalent to that of other countries. W it h the advantages I have named, we should be able to produce iron and steel as cheaply as, and even more cheaply, than other countries can do so. It is idle to say that, in the working the O l d Country, wages have been cut down below what are paid here. In March of last year, according to the Daily Chronicle, the rates of wages in the iron industry of England were from 20 to 25 per cent, higher than the rates paid in Australia. Wages have not increased here to the extent that might have been anticipated, more particularly when the high prices that the BrokenH ill Company was getting for its output during the war are remembered. The company did good work during the war, and gave had the men us supplies that we could not then obtain elsewnere, besides sending steel to the Old Country, which was highly commended. But the company was started before the war, without any expectation of the big protective duties now proposed. Are these duties justified ? The big profits made during the war must have helped the company tp build up reserves, and to increase plant, and thus a large industry has been created. But we have not yet got back I understand that coal can to pre-war conditions, and prices are still exceedingly high. I do not know, whether the statement made to-night, that the .company That was the price just prior to the has been supplying one firm and not another, is correct; but with the help of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and Sir John Higgins some vile Combines have been started in this country. We know of the formation of the Zinc Producers Organization, which has compelled the Mount Lyell Company, the' BrokenH ill Company, and other companies, to hand over to it all their output for the next fifty years. A Copper Producers Association was also formed. In a circular which has been .sent to members by Messrs. Lysaght, it is pointed out that £33 a ton has to be paid for local mined spelter, although the market price of spelter in England is only £24.

I do not know whether the present Government will meet a similar fate. I am only reminding the Minister of what happened in that case. The United States of America so built up their iron and steel industries that they can do without protection, and Canada, which is alongside the United States of America, and whose industries are in competition with those of the United States of America, is content with a duty of 10s. 5d. per ton on pig iron, whereas this Committee is asked to inI n regard to bar and crease the duty of 20s. per ton by 50 per cent. tal invested in Canada is from the United States of America. the Canadian Government is not dictated by the investors of the United States of America, who may have put their money into Canadian plant. I want also to remind honourable members that the Canadian manufacturers, besides having How on earth are our to meet the United States of America manufacturers in competition, have to import a great proportion of the coal required for manufacturing purposes. For instance, in 1918, they imported 45,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, duty free, and over 14,000,000 tons of bituminous coal, on which they paid a duty of 35 cents per ton, and still they are able to carry on with lighter duties than are proposed in this schedule. I .direct attention to the report of a Item 613 of the Select Committee that inquired into this particular industry, and reported in October, 1912. Mr Delprat gave some important evidence. He was askedI presume you arc going into these works, believing you can compete successfully, so far the honourable as iron and steel are concerned, with the markets of the outside world? He said "" Yes"" to this question, and was then askedI suppose you will not ask that any import duty be put upon iron and steel to assist you in your industry? To this he repliedNo. We have decided that if we cannot carry on without Government support or assistance, we shall not proceed with the.works at all.",53,Lamond J Doubt Tbe From Which We Get Our Chief Supplies Of

Some honourable members talk as though we were resorting to some wild and untried experiments, or some scheme which would prove, upon experience, to be detrinished by the Industries Protection mental to the best interests of Australia. The American people, by greater foresight than we are exercising, realized that the only way in which to build up the iron and steel industry was to impose high duties. For many years the imposition was equal to 80s. per ton. Ultimately the duty was reduced to 75s. There were two results. The first of these was that the production of America was vastly increased, and more than supplied the home market, and the second was that with the increased production, the cost to the conprietary works cannot turn out the sumer fell considerably. I am in a position to quote highly authoritative figures which conclusively demonstrate that the outcome of the exceedingly high duties imposed was not an increase in the price of commodities to the primary producer, but the very reverse. the experience of the world. America could never have established her iron and steel industries but for the imposition of high duties, because from the moment of their inauguration those activities would have been overwhelmed by importations of English products, in which country similar industries had been established for a very long while. It was due to the erection of the high Protective wall that the American industries were so flourishingly established as to attain vast proportions, while, at the same time, there was a striking decrease of prices to the consumer. And there was this complementary result^that prices of competitors in the Mother Country were also brought down. to reduce the .prices of agricultural tools and implements here? can be demonstrated very easily. We need not be much alarmed by this proposed ining that joists, channels, and girders crease of duty, since it can be shown that landed in Australia from the Continent it is not paid by the consumer. realize that the iron and steel industry is here under £22 10s. I have only given essential for Australia, and that it is the duty of Parliament to give whatever protection that industry requires. The great point emphasized by the honourable member for Dampier was that it had not been demonstrated that a duty is required at all. I shall quote illustrations to show how essential is the imposition of a duty. I draw my facts from a statement furLeague, upon whose figures I can absolutely rely. I have before me a statement showing comparative prices of British, Continental, and Australian steel products. For example, the landed price, duty paid, of pig iron in Australia is £10 15s. 6d., and the cost of producing here at local works is £9 2s. 6d. The landed price per ton of ingots, blooms, billets, &c, from the Continent is £10. With duty added, the price is £13 5s. landed here. The BrokenH i ll Prosame line of product under £14 10s. per ton. Then, with respect to bars, rods, angles, and tees, the landed cost here today from the Continent is £17, while the actual cost of production in Australia is £21 10s. The landed cost of bars, &c., That has been from Great Britain, of course^ including duty, is £19 14s., and, as I said, the cost here is £21 10s. The landed cost here of rails, 60 lbs., 45 feet in length, is £17 4s., but they cannot be produoed here for less than £17 17s. 6d. Joists, channels, and girders from the Continent cost £18 landed in Australia, duty paid, and the cost to produoe here is £22 10s. honourable member quote the British prices ? the price of our competitors on the Continent.

The honourable member has asked several-.times, ""Who is going to pay theincreased cost of commodities which will result from the higher duties for which, the Tariff, provides?"" So far as most of them go, they will be paid by the people who ultimately consume the products, affected, and in the. c,ase of the industry in which he is particularly interested,, .they .will be. paid mostly by the city' consumers, of bread. That .the honourable member should have worked himself into such a fury over the proposal to give this industry some protection, When, at the present moment, his industry is enjoying a protection that it never had before, in that it is permitted to Bell its produce here far above world's parity,seems to me not to be in the best of taste. I had, however, desired rather to direct my attention to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory). In the coarse of his : speech, the honourable member expressed the hope-^-a hope that I do not think he reallycherishes--that our conditions would be reduced to those of the countries with which we have to compete. At a later stage he said that he. wanted the -workers -of Australia, to be more happily placed than those of. other, lands. Many of our industries are competing with the products of very Iow-wago countries. Conditions in Australia are not the same as those of -any other country, with the exception, perhaps, of America,' and I , for one, do not write myself down with those who think that the ills of the Commonwealth can be cured by a general reduction in wages. I have yet to learn that.the high-wage country is.not always the best country for all the industries carried on in it, and it should be the object of our statesmen to establish the highest standard of living that is possible in all the' industries conducted here. I make that statement with the knowledge that attimes some of bur industries-require consideration from those engaged in them, and that consideration should be given member think that some industries should be built up at the expense of others? our industries should be built up at the expense of the general community, aEd unless we aro prepared to do that we shall the dear old Union Jack. never-be'a self-contained nation.

It would he a matter for regret if the people' of this country, particularly. those charged with its government, should have a quarter of a century's experience of changing conditions without being able to adapt their conclusions to the altered circumstances in which they find themselves.

Is that not a desirable objective, and One worthy of attainment'? done under the old Tariff? ber for Dampier( Mr Gregory) a little while ago quoted Mr Delprat, the general manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company as saying, in 1912, that once the iron industry was fairly established, they were prepared to meet competition from any part qf the world. Since then the whole world has been revolutionized. Neither has it been made safe for autocracy, because, crowned heads have been tumbling one after another. I remind the honourable member for Wimmera that in 1920 Mr Delprat was very emphatic in stating that unless the iron and steel industry were protected by the Tariff from dumping, his company could not possibly carry on. He was then thinking of the condition of shipbuilding. in other parts of the world.

The yards would only undertake to build at a certain rate which averaged about £35 per ton, whereas in Australia the cost was about £30 per ton. The honourable member for Dampier says there is no difference now. As a matter of fact, there is. I believe that ships, which in 1920 cost to build about £35 per ton in England, may now be built for about £10 per ton. .
