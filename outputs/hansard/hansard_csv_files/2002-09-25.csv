Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7277 Wednesday, 25 September 2002 ----Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time. Industry Measures) Bill 2002 makes a number of largely minor changes to improve the efficiency of the administration of private health insurance. In August 2000 amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 enabled health funds to establish gap cover schemes. Under these schemes health funds are able to provide no-gap cover and known-gap cover without the need for specific contracts. In relation to gap cover schemes, the current bill has two stated aims: firstly, to align, where appropriate, requirements relating to gap cover schemes with those applicable to contractual methods of addressing the gap; and, secondly, to consolidate and clarify the obligations of registered health funds to provide information to the public and the department. Among the changes made by the bill to improve the operation of no-gap schemes are the following: the bill exempts the assignment of a contributor’s Medicare benefit to a health fund from any duty or charge under state law; the bill gives the Department of Health and Ageing greater access to hospital purchaser-provider agreements, medical purchaser-provider agreements and practitioner agreements; and the bill further allows any person, including members of the public, access to lists of hospitals, day hospitals and medical practitioners with which a fund has contractual agreements. The bill also makes a number of other changes, such as: removing the responsibility for the registration of billing agents from the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, leaving that responsibility solely with the Health Insurance Commission; allowing funds to offer discounts for quarterly advance payments; and removing a prohibition on employers contributing directly to health expenses incurred by employees who have a certified agreement. These changes are in the nature of finetuning. While the measures in this bill will improve private health insurance, the government’s recent decision to allow private health funds to automatically increase their premiums by inflation will slug families for between $50 and $100 each year. The decision to allow private health insurers to automatically increase their premiums by the CPI each year is unfair to Australian families, especially those who might have believed the Prime Minister on 29 August 1996 when he said: WhatI can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified. Later the same day the Prime Minister said: ... in future any increases in health insurance premiums will need to be approved by the Minister for Health personally in consultation with the Treasurer and myself. The Prime Minister has now walked away from his ‘absolute guarantee’ that this government would approve further premium increases. There is now nothing to stop private health funds",117,Broadcasting Services The Very Valid Fear On The Part Of Members Amendment Media Ownership On This Side Of The Parliament Is That That Sort

The result is that consumers will pay more. Australian families, who listened to the Prime Minister and understood that the Prime Minister would keep that commitment, will pay more. Let us not forget every other taxpayer who will be funding the increases in the government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The government’s contribution to private health insurance is currently $2.3 billion per year. Another five per cent increase in premiums would cost the taxpayer around $115 million each year, or $460 million for four years. The government promised premiums would come down; but, as we know, they have gone upone promise before the election turning into a broken promise after the election. Unfortunately, that is all too familiar. Australians with private health insurance will have to look forward to an annual automatic minimum CPI slug from their health fund. Worse, health funds will still be able to apply for an even greater increase. There have been numerous media reports recently that health funds will be asking the government for increases next year of at least five per cent. Are these increases inevitable? Will the government give us an absolute guarantee? Already this year we have seen average price increases of seven per cent across the private health insurance industry. God forbid the government further violating the Australian people with any more absolute guarantees on private health insurance. The recent behaviour of the government on this issue has already been nothing short of offensive, in my view. This decision was cynically announced on 11 September. This was a deliberate attempt by the government to mask the bad news from Australian families. I will explain what happened. At four o’clock in the afternoon on 11 September 2002, the Minister for Health and Ageing issued a media release. She said: The Federal Government will introduce measures to make private health funds more efficient and competitive. … … … Under the new measures, health funds would be able to make annual automatic cost-of-living adjustments at or below the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to their premiums. It is incredible that the minister still tried to pretend the announcement was good news for Australian consumers. If the changes were really going to be good for Australians and their families, why sneakily put out a media release on the decision in the late afternoon when the majority of Australians were numbed by the countless television reruns of the tragic and catastrophic events in the United States of America 12 months earlier? How cynical can the government get? Australians despise this behaviour but, unfortunately, have come to expect it from the government. A further five per cent premium increase would cost many Australian families, already under financial pressure, an extra $100 to $150 per year. When the government approved the seven per cent in average premiums earlier this year, it translated to Australians paying between $150 and $250 more each year for their cover. Individual increases for some funds were much greater: a 66 per cent to 100 per cent increase in excess payments for many Medibank Private members, with nearly three million members in total; a 36 per cent increase for some IOR Australia members, with over 100,000 members; a 32 per cent increase for some Australian Health Management members, with over 250,000 members; an 18 per cent average increase for all HBF’s 800,000 members in Western Australia; and a 16 per cent increase for Medibank Private’s most popular product. Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7279 Rather than selling off Medibank Private, the government should make sure Australian consumers and Australian taxpayers get value for money from private health insurance. Whilst the opposition supports this bill because it streamlines the efficiency of the administration of private health insurance, the government’s serial practice of slugging families by stealth must cease forthwith. somewhat excited about the government’s commitment to private health insurance. The government’s commitment has been a very strong one and a very popular one in the community. It is actually very much supported by the Australian community. I am puzzled as to why the Labor Party gets excited. When we look at Labor’s track record-I lay these figures out in relation to the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill 2002, and you will see the connection shortly-in 1996, when the current government came to office, health fund membership was down to 33 per cent, with a total of 6,149,000 Australians in private health insurance. Now, in 2002, that has climbed massively to 44.1 per cent, a total of 8,705,000 Australians. That is an extra 2.6 million people who are covered by private health insurance. I think that is an indication of how popular private health insurance is in the Australian community. The government intends to continue its strong commitment to private health insurance and, through mechanisms such as the bill that the Main Committee is discussing today, to make things better for the consumers of private health insurance. The National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 allow health funds to pay a benefit in excess of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee for medical services where conditions are met through contracts or other agreements. This allows health funds to provide no gap or known gap in-hospital medical services to insured patients. The proportion of in-hospital medical services for which there was no gap increased in the June 2002 quarter. This increase followed a relatively stable March 2002 quarter and a succession of increases in every quarter from June 2000 to December 2001. It should be noted that each private episode of care may include a number of medical services provided by a number of doctors. Any of us who have been in that situation will know the plethora of bills you get after some kind of episode like that. ‘Gap’ is defined as: ... the amount payable by the patient (or out-of-pocket costs) after the Medicare Benefits and Fund Benefits have been paid. There is no gap payable where there is a ‘No gap agreement’ between the fund and the provider, or where there is no agreement but the provider charges no more than the MBS fee. In the June quarter 2002 there were 3,269,137 in-hospital medical services provided to patients, representing 78 per cent of the total, with no out-of-pocket costs. This was an increase of two percentage points from the March quarter 2002 figures of 76 per cent. The proportion of services with a known gap remained stable at four per cent over the quarter. The percentage of services with no gap varied from 72 per cent in New South Wales to 88 per cent in South Australia. Queensland fitted in right in the middle, just below the national average of 78 per cent, with a figure of 77 per cent. The average gap payment for all insured in-hospital medical services was $16.23 in the June 2002 quarter, including services where there was no gap. This figure is an increase over the March 2002 figure of $15.97, but follows four quarters in succession in which there has been a decrease in the average gap payment. The average payment for patients for services where there remained an out-of-pocket cost for the patient was $74.28 in the June 2002 quarter, compared to $67.38 in the March 2002 quarter and $73.49 in the December 2001 quarter.",119,Representatives Main Committee
342,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.08 A.m.),"Time after time my colleagues on the other side get7280 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 The changes that are proposed in this bill before the Main Committee will have no impact whatsoever on premiums and they will have no impact on the 30 per cent rebate that is currently offered to people who have private health insurance. The changes that we are going to put through are mostly housekeeping amendments, and they will ensure that the health funds give the department and members of the public access to information about contracts, which will improve the transparency of the situation. They are basically technical amendments. I am pleased to see that members of the opposition will be supporting these sensible amendments. BeforeI go on to the amendments, I would like to observe that in Townsville, which is my home patch and Australia’s largest tropical city, we have two very fine hospitals-the Mater private hospital and the Wesley Park Haven-which provide extraordinarily good private hospital services. I pay tribute to the staff of those hospitals for their provision of services to the people of Townsville and Thuringowa. The amendments that we are considering today will, among other things-and I think everyone will understand this is a sensible thing-provide that the automatic assignment of a contributor’s Medicare benefit to a health fund under an approved gap cover scheme is not liable for any state or territory duty or charge. I think all of us in the community are mindful about this element of tax on a charge or whatever, and these amendments make sure that it does not happen. If a contributor-you or I-wants to ask a health fund to provide information to a medical practitioner which will enable or assist the medical practitioner to comply with the requirement to provide written information to the patient on the expected costs of treatment covered by a gap cover scheme, another amendment will require that health fund to provide the information if requested. I think that is sensible too. A further amendment requires a health fund to comply with any request from the Health Insurance Commission for access to documents that relate to the payment of Medicare benefits to the fund under a gap cover scheme. This legislation will extend to the parties who are able to access listed funds with contracted hospitals, and to members of the public, the ability to access these lists on request. So a member of the public will be able to see the funds’ lists of contracted hospitals. Perhaps that will enable them to have better choice. Finally, there is a sensible amendment in relation to the discounting of premiums. I am not sure why we must make any arrangements on this, but there must be some reason for it. I would have thought we would allow the market to decide what it is going to do in relation to the discounting of premiums. Currently discounts can only be offered to customers who have private health insurance if they pay six months in advance and if it is done through payroll deductions or it is through a bank debit system and so on. This legislation will amend that and allow that to occur at three-monthly intervals if so desired. I think that the change will have a positive effect on consumers and the industry. There are administrative savings-as the member for Lowe noted-in these arrangements. It is eminently sensible that we put these amendments into legislation through this bill. I recognise the work that the Minister for Health and Ageing and her staff have done. Health is a very difficult portfolio but, to the minister’s credit, she responds to those very difficult issues and, where practical issues are concerned, she responds to those as well. I thank her and her staff for bringing this legislation to the parliament today.

343,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.18 A.m.),"The Health Legislation Amendment (Private HealthWednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7281 health insurance funds, governments and consumers. There are two models under which health insurance funds can cover insurance for gap payments: contractual gap agreements and gap cover schemes. There are currently discrepancies between these. The bill also aims to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to transfer the responsibility for approving and monitoring billing agents from the Private Health Insurance Administration Council to the Health Insurance Commission. In relation to gap cover schemes, the current bill has two stated aims: to align, where appropriate, requirements relating to gap cover schemes with those applicable to contractual methods of addressing the gap; and to consolidate and clarify the obligations of registered health funds to provide information to the public and the department. The bill seeks to achieve these aims by introducing the following changes: (1), a health fund that pays benefits to a doctor under an improved gap cover scheme and assignment of a contributor’s Medicare benefits to a health fund under an approved gap cover scheme will not be liable to any duty or charge under any state or territory law or any Commonwealth law that applies only to a territory; (2), health funds will be required to comply with a contributor’s request to provide information to a medical practitioner to assist the practitioner in informing the patient of the expected cost of treatment covered by a gap cover scheme; (3), health funds will be required to comply with any request by the HIC for access to documents relating to the payments of Medicare benefits to the fund under a gap cover scheme; (4), any person, including members of the public, will be able to access, on request, fund lists of hospitals, day hospitals and medical practitioners with which a fund has contractual agreements; (5), the Department of Health and Ageing will be able to access copies of registered organisations’ hospital purchaser provider agreements, medical purchaser provider agreements and practitioner agreements attached to its HPPAs; and, (6), responsibility for approval of billing agents will be transferred from the Private Health Administration Council to the HIC. The bill also introduces the following changes. The Minister for Health and Ageing will be able to determine that a scheme pursuant to a certified agreement or an enterprise agreement is not an employee health benefits scheme and therefore not a health insurance business under the National Health Act 1953. Health funds will be able to offer discounts to contributors where they pay three months or more in advance. As has been mentioned by earlier speakers, this is largely housekeeping legislation which has the support of the opposition. But as it relates to matters with respect to private health insurance, it allows me to make some comments about that area and the issues in that area as that is relevant to the bill. Private health insurance and, in particular, private health insurance premiums have been a matter of quite some controversy in recent years. We have seen premiums growing to astronomical levels and there has been grave uncertainty in the community about what is happening with private health insurance. The current shadow minister for health and ageing, Stephen Smith, has had a number of comments to make on this broad issue of private health insurance, particularly around the question of premiums and cover. I would like to quote some comments he has made on that issue as they relate to this bill. The Prime Minister once felt so strongly that increases in private health insurance premiums should require Government approval that he repeated his promise at least seven times within the space of a few hours. On 29 August 1996, at an address to the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party at the Sheraton Hotel in Brisbane and at a subsequent doorstop interview, he said: 1. “ ... in future, any increases in health insurance premiums will need to be approved by the Minister for Health personally in consultation with the Treasurer and myself.” 7282 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 2. “ ... when the Government proposes to provide a subsidy of taxpayers’ money to the tune of half a billion dollars a year, and that will be the cost of the health insurance rebates, it is entitled to be absolutely satisfied itself that the benefit of that subsidy is not being in any way exploited and the value of that subsidy, in terms of its benefits to the consumer is not going to be lost.” 3. “I will put in place arrangements that will ensure that in future no rise occurs without the express approval of the Government and that any rise in future is completely justified.” 4. “WhatI can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.” 5. “ ... Any increase from now on will have to be approved at a political level and it will only be if we are completely satisfied that that increase is justified.” 6. “AllI can honestly guarantee to you and promise you is that we will put in place arrangements that ensure that any future increases will be as a result of a political decision and only if those in charge of the decision are completely satisfied, completely satisfied, that the increase is justified.’ 7. “But I think in future, particularly where you have a circumstance that the Government is providing on behalf of the taxpayer a subsidy of half a billion dollars, the political arm of that Government is entitled to have a say in whether health insurance premiums should go up or not.’ Following from that, again quoting from before the election, Prime Minister Howard and his government said that there would be ‘downward pressure’ on premiums and that private health insurance would be ‘more affordable and attractive’ to consumers. That was in the Putting Australia’s interests first document by the Liberal Party of Australia. He also said that the Howard government’s policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums’, which is in the Heading in the right direction document, again by the Liberal Party of Australia. Already this year, we have seen average price increases of seven per cent across the private health insurance industry-with speculation this week that new premium rises of five per cent will be inevitable next year. Quite aside from the broken promises, it makes no sense for the government to walk away from approving premium increases when taxpayers are responsible for funding 30 per cent of each increase through the private health insurance rebate. Taxpayers now contribute $2.3 billion each year to subsidise private health insurance. Even the current annual CPI increase of 2.8 per cent would cost taxpayers an extra $260 million over four years for the cost of the rebate. In the circumstances, I feel that there is a range of other issues in the health portfolio that I could probably talk about at this stage, given the current state of the House. Honourable member-That would be a great relief. refer to some issues which relate in a wider sense to private health industry matters. They are matters which relate to the overall or general costing of health and which, in that respect, are still-just-relevant to the bill. The circumstances we have seen recently around the question of pharmaceutical costs and the impact that that has on the cost of the health system overalland, in that respect, the cost of private health insurance-comes to mind. This is an issue which successive governments have faced problems with over the years, as the growing cost of medicines has increased exponentially. This is not only an Australian issue; it is an international issue. It is something that is facing health economists and health systems throughout the world, and it is something which Australia has actually been able to, across government, handle better than most.",122,Representatives Main Committee
344,Mr Griffin,"That would probably provide everyone with a great deal of relief. I willWednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7283 However, we have seen a situation in recent years where costs have gone through the roof. We have now seen a situation where this government has taken action through the budget to take on this issue in a manner which I think is unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Certainly one would hope, with the current blocking by our side of the current budget measures, that this government will see some reason in the need to take a more sane and sensible approach to spending on pharmaceuticals and will adopt a manner whereby, rather than cut and then review, they review first. What has happened since the election is not what was said, before the election, would happen. The previous health minister was saying that there was not a problem when clearly there was. We said that there was, we were very clear about the fact that there was and we believed that action needed to be taken; but what this government has done in this area is quite unfair. Certainly I hope they review what they have done. It relates to private health insurance in so many ways because it relates to the overall cost of the system. I am certainly hoping something can be done about that. I commend this bill to the House. Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (10.29 a.m.)-I am pleased to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill 2002. This bill primarily deals with the obligations of registered health funds to provide information to the public and to the department about the gap. Essentially, it deals with accountability issues in the private health sector. Accountability seems to be quite a novel concept for this government, especially in the area of health. In August, the Prime Minister evaded questions from my colleague the shadow minister for health, the member for Perth. This evasion was not just a oneoff. The previous day, my colleague had also asked the Prime Minister a similar question about his dishonouring of his ‘absolute guarantee’ and ‘honest guarantee’ to the Australian people on private health insurance. I am referring to the Prime Minister’s comments on 29 August 1996, when he stated: WhatI can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified. The Prime Minister, in response to the member for Perth’s question, stated that the decision of the government to allow automatic premium price increases without the need for government approval was not inconsistent with his absolute guarantee that future premium increases would require government approval. What does this mean to the people of Stirling who have private health insurance? Last week, in a speech on structured settlements, I briefly outlined the complete policy failure of this government in health. The most galling thing about this mismanagement is the waste of resources that could have been redirected into the public health system. I refer, of course, to the actions of this government in propping up the private health insurance industry using taxpayers’ money. The first part of this policy failure was the 30 per cent rebate. As I mentioned, I received thousands of postcards from constituents asking Labor to support the 30 per cent rebate. On the surface, the 30 per cent rebate idea seemed positive-a rebate to encourage people to take up private health insurance and thus relieve pressure on our overburdened public hospital system. However, as Labor predicted, the 30 per cent rebate fell flat on its face. Any incentive that the rebate would provide for people to take up private insurance was quickly gobbled up by a greedy profit grab by the health insurance funds. When we have a government that spouts rhetoric on free market economics, I find it ironic that we are in fact propping up an inefficient industry. After the failure of the 30 per cent rebate to significantly increase participation rates, the government decided that it would change its policy from the carrot to the stick. The next pol7284 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 icy step was the introduction of lifetime health cover. This scheme encouraged people to join private health funds before a certain date or be faced with a loading on top of their premiums. It gave people until the age of 30 to join up or face a financial penalty. This policy did increase participation rates. In my electorate of Stirling, private health insurance participation rates soared to over 50 per cent for the first time in years. Before the last election, I received statistics from the peak body representing private insurance, and a veiled threat that I had better support policies that favoured private health insurance as the majority of my constituents now had private health insurance. This is the reason I am talking on this bill, which deals with some minor alterations to the National Health Act 1953 to remove unintended differences between the provisions relating to contractual gap cover arrangements introduced in 1995 and the gap cover schemes which were introduced in August 2000. As I have stated before in this debate, the majority of my constituents now have private health insurance. The only question is: how long will this number stay in the majority? Why will participation rates start to drop? The answer to this is quite simple: after being bullied into taking private health insurance, many families in my electorate are simply not going to be able to afford to continue with private health insurance. The government-approved increases earlier this year hit Western Australians a lot harder than eastern states residents. Some private health funds in Western Australia increased their premiums by over 15 per cent. This is a huge increase to the average family budget. To top this off, the Howard government released on 11 September this year a decision that will see private health insurance premiums automatically increase on an annual basis in accordance with the CPI. This will mean for next year that Stirling families can expect their private health insurance to increase between $50 and $100 per family. This is a flagrant breach of the promise made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election-a promise that supposedly gave an absolute guarantee that decisions of this nature would be made by his government, not by bureaucrats or regulators, or be done automatically. Why the sudden change of heart? The backlash that members opposite received after the government approved the massive increases earlier this year had them running scared. The decision to make automatic increases without government approval in reality is just a cynical measure to allow the government to claim that they had no say in the increase-a simple blame game. What will be the effect of further increases in private health insurance premiums? The Financial Review of Friday, 13 September 2002 contained an article by Morgan Mellish and Lisa Allen which stated in its opening paragraph: Looming rises in private health insurance premiums have prompted predictions that fund members may abandon the industry, putting extra pressure on the public system. But Western Australian state health minister, Bob Kucera, went further in the West Australian newspaper on the same day. The article stated: Mr Kucera said the Howard Government was hell-bent on supporting the private health industry even though there was a rapid decline in bulkbilling, a serious shortage of the GPs and a big drop in the availability of after-hours GP services. “What is more disturbing for the State Government is that the increase in uptake for private health insurance has not eased pressure on our public hospital emergency departments,” he said. Mr Kucera certainly picked up on the problem that the Howard government’s policy failures will create: more pressure on the public health system. The policy failure of the 30 per cent rebate meant that billions of dollars that could have been channelled into the public health system to relieve a crisis was gobbled up by an inefficient industry sector. The Howard government is always talking about industry reform in other sectors. Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7285 A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.35 a.m. to 10.54 a.m. Ms JANN McFARLANE-Before the suspension, I was saying that the Howard government is always talking about industry reform in other sectors. But, for some reason, it is avoiding the health insurance sector. There is only one true national private health insurerMedibank Private. The rest of the funds are essentially state based. There are also a large number of smaller funds. Both the member for Perth and industry analysts have identified that the sector is in need of serious reform. My colleague the member for Perth has stated in the media on numerous occasions that there needs to be rationalisation of the private health industry. Without this rationalisation occurring, the taxpayer is pumping money into a worthless cause and the health consumer is being ripped off. Labor recognise that private health insurance is a reality. People choose to participate in private health insurance for a variety of reasons. What riles us is the fact that this government, a government that has reformed many industries and declined to help out other industries, is effectively propping up an inefficient sector. Because the sector is inefficient and the services offered are often less than adequate, we have the ridiculous situation where a population that has experienced a 13 per cent increase in private health insurance participation rates over two years is putting more pressure on our public health system. The decrease in the number of doctors who are bulk-billing is forcing people to go to our hospital emergency wards to receive free treatment. There are instances of people with private health insurance going into public hospitals for treatment as public patients because they do not want to pay the gap. This bill is about gap reporting. The government needs to do more than just tinker around the edges of the gap issue; it needs to develop policies that address the fundamental problems in the Australian health system that are increasing costs to the health consumer. It is the consumer who matters. We are all health consumers at some stage in our lives. Health affects us all. WhatI want to say to the people who sent me the 30 per cent rebate campaign card is that this government took you for a ride. It promised lower premiums and better services as a result of the rebate. Have you received either of these promises? Have the private health insurers given you cheaper premiums and wider cover? I think the answer to both of these questions is no. The people with private health insurance have been hit with a double whammy: they are contributing their taxes to fund the rebate and they are forking out more in premiums. Put simply, they are paying more. This increased cost will force them out of schemes in the near future. If prices drop due to some miraculous industry reform, they will be penalised for leaving by this government’s Lifetime Health Cover policy. All they are faced with are increased costs if they stay in and increased costs, through penalties, if they leave and return in the future. If they leave then they will utilise the public health system, a system that is starved of funds. The future of health in this country is not a pretty picture. What is needed is a two-pronged approach. Firstly, there should be an approach that rationalises the private health industry to reduce administration costs, a rationalisation that would see less money spent on advertising and more spent on giving the private health consumer value for their money. Without this rationalisation, the industry will continue to operate inefficiently, with the consumer the loser. The second part of a sensible approach would be to look at the amount of taxpayers’ money that is currently pumped into private health insurance and to redirect some of this money into a public health system in crisis. 7286 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 We cannot continue to support an approach by this government that leaves the people in both systems as losers. Families in Stirling need to know that they have the safety net of a vibrant public health system if they cannot afford private health insurance. Those families who choose to take up private health insurance need to know they are getting value for money. Only the Labor Party will deliver on this issue. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (10.58 a.m.)-The issue of health policy is a vital one affecting constituents regardless of whether they are represented by a Labor or a Liberal representative in this parliament, so I think much of what I am going to say also confronts members on the opposite side of the House in their electorates. I want to begin by drawing attention to health policy statements that were made by the Prime Minister before the election and the reality of what happened after the election, and to put it in the context of yet another broken promise and yet another area where, in power, the government has differentiated between so-called core and non-core promises. I remember very clearly in the lead-up to the last federal election that the Prime Minister and his party were trumpeting the following claims: under a Howard government, private health insurance would become more affordable; and private health insurance would be more attractive across the board because it would ‘ensure that premiums were driven down’, thereby making it easier for all families to take up the option of coverage under the private health system. I concede that there are many Australians who make the choice to have private health coverage-among them some very low income earners such as pensioners and self-funded retirees. That happens in my electorate as well. I think the reason they do that is the increasing apprehension about access to quality public health, particularly in the public hospital system. For a lot of these very low income earners, pensioners and self-funded retirees, it is like an insurance policy against the eventuality of needing urgent care that is not there because of the deliberate running down of provisions in the public health system. People in my electorate weighed up all the policies and actually believed that John Howard meant what he said. But what did we see? Far from premiums being driven down, it was not too long before a range of private health insurance bodies were making ambit claims about the nature of the increases they wanted in their premiums. This happened in the electorate of Throsby. Many constituents contacted me about the outrageous increases that were being foisted upon them. The Labor Party and the shadow minister at the time clearly enumerated the range of increases facing working families, pensioners and low-income earners, particularly in my electorate. Suffice to say, the nonsense about the promise of driving premiums down was just rhetoric. In reality, if you take Medibank Private, the most popular private insurer, as an example, there was a nine per cent increase on average and up to a 16 per cent increase for its most popular product. I could go on and list the range of increases that faced people in Throsby, but I think that example is enough to show that it was one thing before the election and another after the election. My electorate comprises a lot of struggling families at the lower end of the income scale. When, despite your promise, they are contending with a slug of $150 to $200 extra a year, naturally they ring you. SoI did a bit of investigation. Of course this was happening at the same time as the profits of the private health insurance companies, in the previous financial year, doubled to $800 million and many of them were accumulating large reserves. You have to say that there has been a deliberate misleading of the public with regard to this government’s health policies. Having dealt with that broken promise, let me recall that at the same time that these promises were being made the Prime Minister said, amongst other things Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7287 in a similar vein-and I think the exact date quoted by the shadow minister was 29 August 1996-when addressing the Queensland division of the Liberal Party: WhatI can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in futurethat is, any change in costs of private health insurancewill be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified. In other words, before the election we were told that premiums would come down, private health insurance would be more affordable and any increases would have to be justified on a political basis. Well, lo and behold, on 11 September this year, the anniversary of tragic international and global circumstances, the announcement was made. I cannot think of anything more sneaky than an announcement being made at 4 p.m. on 11 September 2002-that that promise before the election would no longer have any weight and that private health funds were now free to increase their premiums in accordance with adjustments to the CPI. What does that mean? It means for the families in Throsby an extra $150 to $200 slug, on average, from last year. If you take the current CPI of 2.8 per cent and the statements of the private health insurance industry of a five per cent increase, that will mean another $50 to $100 slug next year. I think the electorate deserves to be told the truth by politicians and particularly by the leader of the nation. Now we are facing the fact that funds will no longer require political approval; they can just go along and automatically increase by the CPI. From the economic analyses of late-and in the uncertain times in which we live-you can be assured that the CPI is not going to remain at 2.8 per cent. The point I am making is that this has a profound impact on ordinary people. These are ordinary people who actually go to cast their vote believing that what they are being told is what is going to happen in reality. This government, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing in particular, stand absolutely condemned for their betrayal of their pre-election commitments. WhatI want to argue as well is that we need to look at what is actually occurring. I did an analysis in the electorate of Throsby. Roughly one-third of the families in Throsby are in private health insurance and two-thirds are not. So within my own electorate, and within the broader Australian community, I think we are looking at a cross-subsidisation where those who are not in private health insurance are, in fact, cross-subsidising those who are in it. As we know, the current federal outlay is somewhere in the order of $2.3 billion per year for the 30 per cent rebate. So it is $2.3 billion today, and the minimum projected increases that I have talked about will add another $250 million over the next four years. I think intelligent people are rightly asking, first of all: are the people who are covered by private health insurance getting value for money, particularly in terms of the problems with the gap? I will come to one of my constituents as a classic case study later. Secondly, are Australian taxpayers getting value for their money? Thirdly, is this actually good public policy? Is this a good way for the taxpayers’ contribution of $2.3 billion-and $2.5 billion not too far down the track-to be spent? From what I can see, the 30 per cent rebate is handed over willy-nilly, without any strings attached, without any tying into health outcomes and, certainly and absolutely, with no pressure on cost constraints by the private health funds. As I said, two-thirds of my constituents in the electorate of Throsby are not in private health insurance. A lot of them are people on very low incomes. Almost 60 per cent of my constituents in Throsby rely on some form of government payment, so we are ranked ninth on the socioeconomic index of disadvantage. I want to draw attention to an advertisement that appeared in the Sunday Telegraph -I am going to bring this to the attention of my constituents-and ask: is it fair that they are cross-subsidising 7288 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 messages like this? The advertisement shows a lady reclining while having a massage, and the heading says, ‘Who paid for your last massage? ... and natural medicines, vitamins, sunglasses ...’? The advertisement reads: At Grand United our aim is to help you stay well, not just cover the costs if you have to go to hospital. Our UltraCare Health Cover makes it easy for you to look after yourself naturally. You get generous rebates on the widest range of natural therapies, herbal supplements and lifestyle choices. Plus all the usuals like dental, optical, physiotherapy and chiropractic. Combine UltraCare with any Grand United Hospital Option for total peace of mind. All Grand United Hospital Options come with Access Gap cover at no extra cost. The advertisement continues: Celebrate Natural Health Month Win a natural health retreat weekend for two! Join, or upgrade your Grand United LifeCare Cover, during September to win a rejuvenating weekend for two at the Crystal Lodge Blue Mountains Retreat NSW including therapeutic massage, deluxe facial and aroma bath. Quite frankly, when I have constituents who have been waiting four years to get dentures and constituents who are paying $100, after the Medicare rebate, to see a specialist, and when I have families who are very fearful of the extra cost of their prescriptions if the government has its way, I begin to wonder where the justice is in this. Where is the justice for the two-thirds of people in the electorate of Throsby who do not have private health insurance and who have to cope with that kind of self-indulgent lifestyle-a lifestyle that is beyond the reach of nearly everyone in my electorate? I am beginning to think that we need in this country a proper debate about the benefits of the public policy position involved in this and an immediate crackdown on private health cover that provides lifestyle choices and products. This is all happening at a time when people are struggling to get access to basic services. I know this bill specifically talks about the problems associated with the gap, so I contend that, first of all, there should not be cross-subsidisation by the poor for those who can afford the spas, the facials and the wonderful retreats at the Blue Mountains. But what about those who scrape together the cost of coverage by private health insurance? Are they getting value for their money? Let me read a classic case study. I think my constituent says it better than I could. My constituent says: I do not know who to turn to, who I should be speaking with, or if I’m going to get anywhere voicing my opinion, but I certainly need to express how frustrated and disappointed I am with the Australian government. I am certainly not venting my frustrations at you personally, but I am hoping you may be able to enlighten me as to how the whole government system works!! I would like to know why a middle class, hard working couple, who pay their taxes and join the private health insurance, end up in a worse situation than the people who live off the government!! My husband and I work, to provide a comfortable lifestyle for ourselves and our children, we work hard, pay taxes and recently joined the “all important private health insurance”. I expect that for this, the government provides me with a good public health system, one that is accessible to all of my family, and a great education system, one that enriches and broadens my children’s knowledge. I have two daughtersI have deleted their names and other detailsone is 16yrs and the other is 11yrs. The 16-year-old has been quite ill this year, with a condition called “Quinsy”. Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7289 It continues: Eight weeks ago ... had an abscess cut out of her throat in the surgeons’ room, 6 weeks later she was admitted to Wollongong and Bulli Hospitals as the condition had worsened again, they were able to syringe the infection, enough for her to breath, eat and talk properly. Next week ... is supposed to be operated on at Shellharbour Private Hospital to have her infected tonsils removed. ... has been on antibiotics for the past 3 and a half months, to keep the infection under control. I have been advised by the specialist that I will be out of pocket for his fee, a total of $250.00, because he obviously charges more than can be covered. I have to pay the excess of $200.00 to the hospital at admission and I will also be up for the anaesthetist costs, which I am not sure of the moment. I was advised today by my health fund NIB that Shellharbour Private Hospital is not a “contracted hospital” and that I will more than likely be out of pocket for accommodation and theatre fees!!! I have 100% hospital cover, my own doctor, private hospital, accommodation and theatre fees included, why should I be out of pocket at all? … … … I am extremely disappointed in the all Australian way of life. It appears to me that the rich get richer, the poor get help and the middle class families just keep banging their heads against brick walls and pay for the governments unfairness. There is a happy ending to the story. Following representations from my office, the health fund finally agreed to cover at least the full cost of the operation. But where is the justice? There is no justice for the poor, who are subsidising indulgent lifestyle options and products. There is no justice for those who manage to scrape together the money for private insurance so that they are covered. The case that I read out involving one of my constituents is not atypical. It is high time the minister and the government had a serious look at what is going on in the private health sector. There has to be greater accountability by the private health funds for outcomes. There has to be greater pressure on the government to rein in costs. The government should reverse its decision of 11 September to open the door to automatic CPI adjustments at a time when the inflation rate is likely to increase without any political justification having to be provided. This government has failed the Australian people. It has broken its promises that were obviously taken sincerely. The example of my constituent shows that, even when they struggle and work hard to get covered, they then face a situation whereby private health funds that are not able to reach agreements with contracted hospitals can set their own rules. It is an indictment of the government’s mishandling of the health portfolio. The government owes it to the Australian people to provide explanations as to why its promises are broken and why the poor, the pensioners and those at the lower income end of the scale are subsidising these indulgent lifestyles at the taxpayers’ expense. The time has come for a serious and whole reappraisal of the funding of private health insurers and of public policy in this vital area affecting all Australian citizens. 1996, the reform of the nation’s health system has been high on its agenda. The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill 2002 seeks to build on earlier reforms initiated by the government to provide consumers with insurance cover for gap payments. Members from the opposition have stated that more money should be going to the",124,Representatives Main Committee
345,Mrs Draper (Makin) (11.16 A.m.),"Since the election of the Howard government in7290 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 public health system rather than to so-called cross-subsidisation of private health insurance funds and extravagant lifestyles. However, in the year 2000-01, I note that private hospital admissions rose nationally by 12 per cent, which represents a massive 245,129 hospital admissions. Without the growth in the number of people who are now privately insured, many if not most of these patients would have been seeking admission to a public hospital. The added stress and strain this would impose on the public system would not have been sustainable. I would like to move on to discuss more specifically the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill. The difference between what a doctor or a hospital charges for health services and the amount covered by the combined Medicare benefit and private health insurance benefit is known as the gap. Consumers have long resented gap payments. Prior to 1995, the legislation did not allow private health insurance companies to offer coverage over and above the established Medicare Benefits Schedule fee. Medicare covered 75 per cent of the schedule fee, and private health funds could cover only the remaining 25 per cent. Following subsequent legislative changes, the private funds were able to make payments for medical services above the schedule fee but only when there was an agreement in place between the fund and the doctor or the hospital. In 1993, the then Labor government’s health minister, Graham Richardson, warned the nation that, if the percentage of Australians with private health coverage were to drop below 40 per cent, the entire health system would be in danger of collapse. No doubt this was the reason for the legislative changes two years later, but by then it was a case of too little too late. In 1983, nearly 65 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. By March 1996, when Labor finally left office, this proportion had plummeted to below 34 per cent. The decline in private health insurance coverage placed unsustainable pressure on the public system. It was estimated that, unless some urgent action was taken to reverse the trend away from private health insurance, we faced the prospect of having to build two large hospitals each year solely to cope with the increase in public demand. With the election of the Howard government, the disaster facing our health system was averted. The introduction of Lifetime Health Cover and the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance saw the trend reversed as Australians began to take up the option of private insurance once again. Overseas experience should warn us about the problems inherent in allowing too much reliance on either the public or the private systems. Australia has the best health system in the world because we have been able to achieve a fair balance between the public and the private. The issue of the gap remained a concern, however, so in 2000 the Howard government amended the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act to allow for the establishment of gap cover schemes. These reforms enabled private health funds to provide no-gap cover, where the patient does not have to make any payments at all, and known gap cover, where the patient is told how much he or she will have to pay before treatment starts. This removed a major disincentive for people to take out private cover. An anomaly exists with the present arrangements whereby the new gap cover schemes are treated differently from the contractual gap agreements established in 1995. This bill seeks to remove that anomaly by providing that transactions under the new gap cover schemes will not be subject to any government duties or charges, just as contractual gap agreements are exempt. It also introduces a requirement for health funds, at the request of the patient, to provide information to their doctor. This will enable them to comply with the legislative requirement to provide the patient with written information on the expected costs of treatment. Failure by the parliament to approve this bill would prove costly to consumers. Additional charges would have to be levied, making the new gap cover schemes more expensive than the contractual agreements. Rejection of this bill Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7291 would also disadvantage patients, as funds would not be required to assist doctors in providing them with the information on the cost of treatment before it begins. Another problem which currently exists is the absence of information on which hospitals, day hospital facilities and doctors have no-gap contractual agreements with health funds. For consumers wishing to find this information, it is currently quite difficult. The bill addresses their concerns by requiring private health insurance funds to make the details of doctors or hospitals who are participating in gap cover schemes accessible to any member of the fund or the general public. Finally, this bill will also allow health funds to offer discounts to members where they pay three months or more in advance. I have been fascinated by recent media performances predicting the end of bulk-billing. For the record, last year the rate of bulk-billing in Australia was higher than it was during the last year of the Keating government. Over 70 per cent of all services provided to patients by their doctors were bulk-billed. Three out of every four visits to the family doctor are being bulkbilled, with no expense to the patient. For Australians 65 years and over, the bulk-billing rate is 82.3 per cent, which is equivalent to eight out of every 10 services being bulk-billed. Since 1999, the Medicare rebate which is paid to doctors for a standard consultation has risen by more than 14 per cent, and for longer consultations it has risen by more than 20 per cent. I have had calls to my electorate office from elderly pensioners who have heard the irresponsible claims that bulk-billing will soon cease. It is absolutely irresponsible for anyone to be frightening vulnerable people in this manner, particularly as these claims are not consistent with the facts. Without the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover, the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the no-gap schemes, our public hospitals would today be facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions. The latest figures on hospital admissions, released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, demonstrate the success of the government’s policies. As I said at the beginning of my speech-and I think it is worth repeating here-in 2000-01, private hospital admissions rose nationally by 12 per cent, which represents a massive 245,129 hospital admissions. Without the growth in the number of people who are now privately insured, many-if not most-of these patients would have been seeking admission to a public hospital. As I said earlier, the added stress and strain this would have imposed on the public system would not have been sustainable. The measures contained in this bill will continue to provide Australians with a viable private health insurance option so that when they need medical care and attention it will be available and affordable. I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.25 a.m.)-Later in my speech I will make some comments on bulk-billing. That is something I had not intended to do when speaking on this piece of legislation, but I need to put on record the facts and figures that relate to my area-facts and figures that have been researched and are accurate, not figures that have been pulled out of the air with obviously no validity whatsoever. I will discuss that a little later. I will give a very detailed explanation of bulk-billing within my electorate, which across the board, including veterans, stands at a bit over 60 per cent-hardly the figure that the previous speaker was discussing. The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill 2002 amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments are basically technical ones that we on this side of the House do not have any problems with. Overall, this should make the whole system work a little better, so there is no problem there. The legislation seeks to remove unintended differences between contractual gap cover arrangements 7292 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 which were introduced in 1995 and gap cover schemes, as well as to transfer the oversight of this to the Health Insurance Commission. The gap refers to the difference between the fee that doctors charge for services provided in a hospital and the combined Medicare and health insurance benefits for those services. I have been contacted in my office on a number of occasions about the problem with the gap. It has caused hardship for a number of people when they have had a stay in hospital. They have found that there is quite a difference between the money they get back from the health insurance fund and the cost of the services they received from their doctor. I think it is really important that governments do address this issue and that there are schemes in place that deal with this. One of the issues contributing at the moment to an increase in the size of the gap is the problem with medical indemnity. A number of specialists within my area have charged their patients a $200 gap fee up front to cover that insurance. That is something that I do not think is acceptable and that I have forwarded on to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I hope it is something that she will address. I would like to refer to a health survey that I have been conducting within my electorate. It has been sent to everyone in the electorate. I must say, it is early days at this stage; I have received just under 1,000 responses. I asked people in the Shortland electorate to rate nine different questions from one to nine, in order of importance. The questions related to having a doctor who bulk-bills; being able to see a doctor locally when sick, which is a very big issue in the Central Coast part of my electorate; retaining Medicare; listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to make them more affordable; increasing the costs of prescriptions; having a Commonwealth dental health scheme; having access to medical specialists in your area; and having affordable private health insurance. The last question I asked was about having no gap payment for surgery or a stay in a private hospital. It is really interesting that only two per cent of those who have responded to the survey to date said that the no-gap payment for surgery was the most important issue. I thought I would expand it out to look at the people who listed it in their top three in order of importance. Even in doing that, only 14 per cent put that in their top three. That compared with the 33 per cent of the people who said that having a doctor who bulk-bills was their No. 1 issue, 19 per cent who put that as their No. 2 issue-which takes it up to 52 per cent-and nine per cent who put that as their No. 3 issue. So that is 61 per cent, as opposed to 14 per cent. There is quite a disparity there in the way people view the importance of the gap payment. You can link that to another question, on having affordable private health insurance, which only four per cent put as their first choice. There was strong support for retaining Medicare-over 60 per cent of people put that in their top three. To make a valid comparison, 21 per cent of people put affordable private health insurance in their top three. I really try to listen to the people of Shortland, and the survey I sent out was scientifically valid. It was not a survey that was designed to elicit a special response from people. It was designed to obtain a response that was free of manipulation, and the wording was in no way emotive. So it seems to me that if I am listening to the people of Shortland, I would have to say that having a doctor who bulk-bills, retaining Medicare and being able to see a doctor when they are sick-something I indicated earlier is a real problem in the Central Coast part of the Shortland electorate-are the top three issues. Two of the least important are having affordable private health insurance and not having to pay a gap when they stay in a private hospital. This is important information, not only for me, not only for us in the opposition. I believe it is something that the government should listen to, too. Wednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7293 I might slip sideways to what the previous speaker said about bulk-billing and her comment that there is absolutely no crisis in bulk-billing. I had no intention of talking about various aspects of bulk-billing as it relates to my electorate. In the northern part of the Shortland electorate that falls within the Lake Macquarie City Council area, we contacted 24 doctors. Out of those 24 doctors, only 19 bulk-bill pensioners. There were some doctors who would forward off their accounts and charge the pensioners between $5 and $10 to save them going to a Medicare office. But I think it is very important to point out that something like 22 per cent of doctors within the northern part of Shortland electorate were bulk-billing. It was a little less-under 20 per cent-in the southern part of the electorate, which is on the Central Coast. And an incredibly low percentage-under 10 per cent-of doctors in both the Lake Macquarie part of Shortland electorate and the Central Coast part of Shortland electorate bulk-billed all their patients. It is not true to say that bulk-billing has increased. There has been a dramatic decrease within my area and the areas of other members on this side of the House. We have actually monitored what is happening. It is not hearsay; it is fact. I needed to put that on record, but my contribution from here on will be quite brief. Prior to 1995, the National Health Act 1953 prevented private health insurance funds from providing benefits that were greater than the medical benefits schedule. Seventy-five per cent was provided by Medicare and 25 per cent by private health funds. The 1995 amendment allowed the establishment of purchaser-provider agreements between hospitals and doctors, and between hospitals and insurance companies. This was welcomed by some people. In the electorate of Shortland, not too many people welcomed it because it was not seen as a high priority-but some did and it was very important that it was dealt with. The Health Legislation Amendment (Gap Cover Schemes) Act 2000 amended both the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments allowed private health funds to establish gap schemes. That helped some people but there are still some problems with it, as all members in this House would know. Health insurance funds claim that doctors are not participating in gap schemes within the spirit of the legislation. Some unscrupulous doctors even used the establishment of gap schemes to increase the cost of their services. That has been fairly widely documented, and it is something that members on either side of this House oppose. The AMA has serious concerns about using gap cover arrangements because it feels that they compromise the independence of the relationship between doctors and patients. There is probably a relationship between the two points that I have just made. Doctors like to be able to determine what prices they are charging their patients. In the overall scheme of things, probably the people who miss out and whose needs are not considered are those who rely on doctors, the government and health funds to ensure that the money that they are contributing-massive amounts of money-to health insurance is going to deliver them a service for which they will not have to pay a gap. The Consumer Health Forum of Australia was generally supportive of gap fund legislation. The government has put a lot of money into health insurance. The government made a choice, as is its prerogative, to invest in health insurance rather than public hospitals. I know that if we were in government our priorities would be funding public hospitals and ensuring that doctors bulk-bill, that Medicare is retained and that all Australians get access to good quality health coverage and services. The kind of service you receive should not be determined by your ability to pay private health insurance. 7294 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 September 2002 The previous speaker also referred to the cost of health services. The country whose health service costs are amongst the highest is the United States. The model that this government seems to be moving us towards is a model that is very much driven by the private market and one in which access to health services-being able to receive medical treatment when you need it-is determined by your ability to pay. We on this side of the House believe that basic quality health care is the right of all Australians; it is not a privilege. The government should do some independent research of its own and find out just how supportive Australian people are of private health insurance and the issues raised in this legislation. It should find out whether or not Australian people are concerned about having a doctor they can go to who bulk-bills, about retaining Medicare and about having enough doctors in their area to have an appointment with their doctor when they are sick and not have to wait between seven and 14 days. We support this legislation. It is technical in nature. I have absolutely no problems with it. stration) (11.40 a.m.)-Initially, and as is customary, I would like to thank those honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Industry Measures) Bill 2002, which is before the chamber. for their support of the amendments. I do think it is a little unfortunate, however, that a number of opposition members used this chance to divert from the particular measures of this bill and sought to criticise this government’s outstanding record in the area of health. I noted with particular interest the comments made by opposition members on private health insurance and, in particular, the cost of private cover. When you look at what happened under the Australian Labor Party during those 13 dark years of office, you find that in 1983 they inherited a participation rate for private health insurance of 63.7 per cent and yet, by 1996 when the Keating government was swept from office, they had reduced that participation rate to 33.9 per cent. Under the coalition we have actually seen the participation rate increase to 44.1 per cent. In other words, we put a platform under the numbers of people leaving private health insurance and what is more we have made private health insurance attractive. This has meant that more people have taken the opportunity to take out private health insurance. By comparison, the Australian Labor Party flip-flops all over the place. We do not really know where they stand on the issue of the private health insurance rebate. They say one thing at one time and another thing at another time. members in this debate, many of them seem to do anything other than support what the government has done. The member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Shortland, said that this government had chosen to invest in private health insurance at the expense of public hospitals. That is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. The government have an excellent record in the area of health. We are proud of our record. It ought to be recognised that every last cent of the goods and services tax is paid to the Australian states so that they are able to invest in the areas of their constitutional responsibilities, including health.

Under Labor, between 1990 and 1996, private health insurance premiums grew by an average 7.7 per cent a year. Forget about only one increase per year: often they rose three or four times per year. There was no control and no interest by the then Labor government in protecting the community. Maybe the member for Lowe was talking tongue in cheek, but he referred to what he called the government’s serial practice of slugging families by stealth. The member for Lowe simply could not have been serious. This is just amazing, given the views in the Australian Labor Party on the government’s 30 per cent rebate. This government has increased the numbers of people with private health insurance, provided a 30 per cent rebate-enhancing the affordability of private health insurance-and provided gap cover schemes rather than watch the health funds decline, as Labor did during its years in office. This government is committed to a viable public health system complemented by a private health insurance system. The member for Shortland seemed to think that this government was not interested in the public health system. That is simply not the case. The member for Stirling, who is still in the chamber, referred to premium increases. Under Labor, between 1990 and 1996 premiums grew by an average of 7.7 per cent per year. In one year alone, 1991-92-the member for Stirling will be shocked to hear me recall thishealth insurance premiums grew by a monstrous 17 per cent of the CPI. The member for Stirling is clearly crying crocodile tears. At least she has the grace to smile at being found out. In this government’s period in office, premiums have increased by substantially lower amounts than during the dark years of the Keating and Hawke Labor governments. Each and every Labor member has stood in this place this morning and derided the 30 per cent rebate, which provides about $750 to every Australian family with private cover. Private health insurance will always be 30 per cent cheaper under the coalition. Unfortunately, I do not have the statistics at the moment for the individual electorates around the country showing the numbers of people who have taken out private health cover and the numbers of people who take advantage of the government’s private health insurance rebate. The honourable members who spoke on behalf of the opposition-the members for Lowe, Bruce, Stirling, Throsby and Shortland-would be shocked to know of the thousands of people in each of their electorates who have private health insurance. Those people will exact their revenge at the next election when they hear Labor members get up and deride this rebate from the Australian government, which enables many more people to take out private health insurance. I just so happen to have had handed to me information relating to private health insurance participation in New South Wales by electorate. The honourable member for Lowe was not supportive of private health insurance, yet he has thousands of people in his electorate who are strongly supportive of it. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.48 a.m. to 12.02 p.m. was talking about how members opposite are not speaking for their electorates when they fail to be entirely supportive of the private health insurance rebate. I think it would benefit the chamber if I advise it of the level of support for private health insurance in a number of electorates represented by members of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Lowe has 64.34 per cent of his people in private health insurance; the member for Bruce, 47.71 per cent; the member for Stirling, 59.49 per cent-almost 60 per cent; the member for Throsby, 35.23 per cent; and the member for Shortland, 40.82 per cent.",136,Representatives Main Committee

In my view, it is utterly despicable for the ALP to be less than entirely supportive of a system that has brought about private health insurance affordability to so many Australians.

To answer the member’s question, it is a fact that the Australian Labor Party technically supports Lifetime Health Cover, but unfortunately many of the remarks by Labor members in this debate indicate that they are unsupportive of the private health insurance rebate which, in effect, makes private health insurance attainable for their constituents.",137,Representatives Main Committee

363,Mr Slipper,"I would like to thank the member for Dunkley for his very perceptiveWednesday, 25 September 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 7297 correctly pointed out. Because there are undoubtedly going to be further divisions in the main chamber, I just want to sum up by saying that this is a very important piece of legislation. I thank all honourable members for backing this legislation. I think, however, it is regrettable that the Australian Labor Party has seen fit to criticise the government when this government has made private health insurance affordable for more Australians and, in doing so, has also been able to make sure that the public health system is viable. A very vibrant private health insurance system means that the public health system remains viable, and that is particularly important. BeforeI sit down, the member for Shortland did refer to bulk-billing. The government does recognise that there has been a decline in bulk-billing. However, some 73 per cent of services provided by general practitioners are bulk-billed and, for people over the age of 65, over 80 per cent of the services are bulk-billed. So, while there has been a reduction, there is still a substantial, high proportion of services being bulk-billed. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. 2002 contains a minor amendment, and Labor will support it. The amendment clarifies the operation of two acts: the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2001 and the General Insurance Reform Act 2001. The collection of data act sought to improve the quality of data that APRA collects from financial agencies for the purposes of prudential supervision. The General Insurance Reform Act sought to strengthen the prudential supervision regime for general insurers. This new bill does just one thing. It makes it clear that the provisions of the collection of data act commence immediately before the provisions of the General Insurance Reform Act. This will ensure that, where the same provisions of the Insurance Act 1973 are amended by both acts, the collection of data amendments operate first. The relevant provisions of the Insurance Act relate to the role, accountability and responsibility of auditors and actuaries, access to premises and the signing of documents. However, this bill has come before the House because of two careless errors by the government. The collection of data act was to commence on a date to be fixed by proclamation. The government duly proclaimed that the bill would commence on 1 October 2001. However, the proclamation was invalid. The government then proclaimed that the bill would commence on 1 July 2002, the same date that the General Insurance Reform Act commenced. However, in doing so, they failed to notice that this would create an ambiguity as to which act commenced first. Labor will support this bill, but urges the government to exercise greater care in the future and not waste this chamber’s valuable time correcting their careless mistakes.",138,Representatives Main Committee

The purpose of this bill, the Treasury Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, is to clarify the operation of two acts-and the member for Kingston referred to that in his speech-the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2001 and the General Insurance Reform Act 2001. The bill is of a minor and technical nature and is designed to ensure that these two acts have their intended effects. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act and the General Insurance Reform Act both amended the Insurance Act 1973 for different purposes. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act, among other things, amended the Insurance Act to enable modernisation of APRA’s data collections from general insurance companies. The General Insurance Reform Act amended the Insurance Act to substantially strengthen the prudential supervisory requirements for general insurers operating in Australia. The provisions of the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act which amended the Insurance Act and the General Insurance Reform Act both commenced on 1 July this year. It had originally been intended that the provisions of the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act amending the Insurance Act would commence on 1 October last year, in advance of the commencement of the General Insurance Reform Act. A proclamation was made to the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act with this intent. On this basis, the General Insurance Reform Act was drafted as though the provisions of the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act which amended the Insurance Act had already commenced. However, it was subsequently determined that, due to a technical difficulty, the proclamation of the provisions of the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act which purported to amend the Insurance Act was ineffective. As a result, another effective proclamation was made. The effect of this was that the two acts, both amending the Insurance Act, and in some cases the same provisions of the Insurance Act, commenced on the same day. tary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. question? the government not only did not get it right the first time but did not get it right at its second go-and that we are now back fixing the problem? matter of finetuning. This has introduced some uncertainty as to which amendments to the Insurance Act were designed to commence first.

Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 12.16 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration: Visa Overstayers (Question No. 550) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 18 June 2002: (1) What is his Department’s estimate of foreigners working illegally in Australia each year from 1996 to 2001. (2) How many illegal visa overstaying foreigners were removed each year from 1996 to 2001. (3) What was the cost of locating and removing over stayers each year from 1996 to 2001. (4) What departmental measures have been taken to reduce the number of over stayers. (5) Does this Department plan a crackdown on the location and removal of overstayers; if so, what is the extent of the proposed measures. (1) It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the number of non-citizens working illegally in Australia at any given point in time. This is because some non-citizens will have valid visas but be breaching conditions attached to those visas, whilst others will be working while they have overstayed their visa or are otherwise illegally in Australia. However in March 1999 the Government appointed an external Reference Group to guide a review of the issue of illegal workers in Australia. The Reference Group’s report, entitled ‘Review of Illegal Workers in Australia’ was released in November 1999. In the report the Reference Group estimated that 50 per cent of unlawful non-citizens are working illegally. The Reference Group also noted that the number of lawful visitors working in breach of their visa conditions was unknown. Based on the estimate of the Reference GroupI provide the following table. The table covers estimates of overstayers and the consequent number of Illegal Workers going back to the year 2000. Overstayer figures prior to 2000 were derived using a different, less accurate methodology than that currently being used and are not statistically comparable to the current estimates. Period Ending Estimated Number Estimated Number of 30 June of Overstayers* Illegal Workers 2001 60,000 30,000 2000 59,000 29,500 (2) The table below provides the number of unlawful non-citizens and people breaching their visa conditions who have left Australia as a result of Departmental compliance action in the years 1995/1996 to 2001/2002. These figures exclude fishermen, stowaways, smugglers, deserters and unauthorised boat arrivals. Financial Year Total Removals 2001/2002 9,504 2000/2001 9,054 1999/2000 8,996 1998/1999 8,054 1997/1998 7,474 1996/1997 5,654 1995/1996 5,381 (3) Because of the wide range of other activities done in the compliance program (for example employer information, program integrity checking, visa cancellation and the removal of unauthorised boat arrivals) it is not possible to derive actual costs associated solely with the location and removal of overstayers. However to give some indication of the costs involved in the first eleven months of 2001/2002 it is estimated that my Department spent just under $30m in locating a total of 15,892 persons. For the same period it is estimated that approximately $14m was spent on removing 9,852 persons (this in-",140,Representatives Main Committee
373,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:cludes unlawful non-citizens, people breaching their visa conditions, fishermen, stowaways, smugglers, deserters and unauthorised boat arrivals). (4) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) is actively working on a number of onshore and offshore measures to reduce the number of overstayers in Australia. These measures include: A network of specialist compliance officers located overseas to liaise with authorities such as local police and immigration officers to combat the number of people arriving in Australia illegally. In association with other Government agencies, measures to enhance border surveillance systems and deter illegal migration. The whole-of-government approach to preventing people smuggling and illegal migration has ensured that attempted breaches of Australian borders are detected and intercepted. Onshore compliance officers undertake regular field operations in both metropolitan areas and rural areas of Australia. Some of the field operations are organised in conjunction with other agencies such as Federal/State police, Centrelink and ATO officers. The development of successful relationships with employers, educational institutions, and other Government agencies to gain the cooperation of the Australian community in assisting the Department locate overstayers. Compliance teams are set up which target certain risk areas identified for the program. As examples such teams may focus on illegal worker and employer awareness campaigns, failed ministerial intervention applications, failed appeals to merits review tribunals and student compliance. Implementation of a number of the recommendations of the Review of Illegal Workers in Australia. These include measures to discourage employers from employing illegal workers, including overstayers, as well as information to assist employers to identify illegal workers. (5) DIMIA plans to maintain its active and ongoing program of detection and removal of overstayers and persons breaching their visa conditions. These people are located through our regular field operations and through the action of Federal, State and Territory police forces and other agencies. Newcastle Electorate: Employment of Disabled (Question No. 587) Ms Grierson asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 24 June 2002: How many people with a disability are employed by the Minister’s Department or agencies under the Minister’s administration in the electoral division of Newcastle. The two agencies within my portfolio that have staff in the Newcastle electorate are the Australian Customs Service (ACS) and the Family Court of Australia. It should be noted that individual employees are not required to provide information about a disability they may have. Employees may choose voluntarily to identify themselves as having a disability, either prior to commencement or during the course of their employment. I am advised that no employees in the ACS or the Family Court in Newcastle have identified themselves as persons with a disability. Foreign Affairs: Western Sahara (Question No. 625) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 2002: What is the Australian Government doing to assist the resolution of conflict over self-determination for Western Sahara, particularly in relation to his representations to the Moroccan Government on this issue. lows: The Government supports the early holding of a referendum to determine the wishes of the population of Western Sahara on the question of independence or incorporation into the Kingdom of Morocco, so long as that remains the only process endorsed by the UN for resolving the dispute. On 30 July 2002, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1429, extending the mandate of the United Nations Mis-",142,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

I have made Australia’s views clear to the Moroccan Foreign Minister, most recently in a letter in August 2002. Novartis Animal Health (Question No. 659) Ms Gillard asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: Has his Department issued a purchase order in the last 12 months to Novartis Animal Health of Pendle Hill, NSW. My Department has advised that it has no record of a purchase order being issued to Novartis Animal Health of Pendle Hill, NSW, in the last 12 months. Australian Defence Industries: Sale (Question No. 672) Mr Murphy asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answers to parts (2), (6) and (7) to question No. 394 provided by the Minister for Finance and Administration, will he answer those parts to question 394 left unanswered by that Minister. (2) Will he provide details of the advice, if any, he gave to the Minister for Finance and Administration prior to the sale of the assets. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (Part 2) The security of contractual and other relevant information held by ADI is monitored through the Department of Defence contract management processes and the Defence Industrial Security Program, which is managed by the Defence Security Authority. (Parts6 and 7) There are no strategic military assets in private (ADI Group) hands. However, ADI operates facilities at Benalla, Mulwala and Garden Island (Sydney) that have industry capabilities regarded by Defence as important for the support of Australian Defence Force capability. The Benalla facility is owned by the ADI Group and the facilities at Mulwala and Garden Island remain Commonwealth-owned and are leased to ADI. The Commonwealth’s interests in respect of all of these capabilities are adequately protected through appropriate contractual arrangements, including the industrial security requirements discussed in part (2) above. (2) No. However, there was full consultation between the former Ministers for Defence and Finance when they jointly developed options for the Government’s consideration on how best to proceed with ADI’s sale. Health: Fertility Rates (Question No. 681) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to paragraph 1 of the answer to part (3) of question No. 495, when will the Government’s review be concluded. (2) Will a report of the review be made available to the public; if not, why not. (3) Further to paragraph 2 of the answer to part (3) of question 495, how does the Government propose to promote public debate and discussions to inform future policy, particularly as they relate to Australia’s falling fertility rates.",143,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
376,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the honourable member’s question: (1) & (2) There is no formal review. There is no plan for a written report on fertility rates as a policy issue. (3) Public debate and policy consideration of this issue is ongoing and occurs in the context of family policy and a broad range of social and economic issues. Aviation: Point Cook Airfield (Question No. 701) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the Government’s announced sale of Point Cook Airfield, (a) is the Government intending to offer the property for sale as freehold or leasehold and (b) what have been the considerations given to the alternative forms of sale.

(4) What national or international environmental classifications are associated directly or indirectly with the Point Cook site. (5) What specific environmental audit or audits of the site have been commissioned by or on behalf of the Defence Estates Organisation. (6) Has the Government discussed the environmental condition of the site with the Victorian Environment Protection Authority. (7) How does the Government intend to deal with any potential findings of environmental contamination of the site ahead of the sale being finalised. (8) What is the current value of the RAAF Museum collection at Point Cook. (9) What annual funding has been allocated by the Government or the RAAF to the RAAF Point Cook Museum in each year between 1990 and 2001. (10) How does the Government intend for the RAAF Museum to continue operations within a privately owned site, and what funding will the Government, either through the RAAF or other sources, deliver recurrently to the RAAF Museum. (11) Has the Government had any discussions with Victorian Government museum representatives about the relationship that might be developed between the RAAF Point Cook Museum and other museums in Victoria. (12) What provision is being made for the upgrading of electricity, sewerage and road services to the Point Cook site ahead of its sale. (13) How many RAAF personnel were housed on the Point Cook site at 1 August 2002, and how many of the children of the RAAF personnel attend the Point Cook Primary School. (14) When does the Government envisage RAAF personnel will depart the Point Cook site. (15) What are the current air traffic control arrangements at Point Cook. (16) What are the minimum air traffic control arrangements that the Government will require for any private owner to maintain. (17) What provision will be made for changes in minimum air traffic control arrangements at Point Cook if, after the date of sale, recommendations are made for increased control services out of the late-July 2002 collision and fatality at Moorabbin airport. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) and (b) Initial planning anticipated the disposal of the site was as a freehold sale. Defence is currently considering a proposal for a leasehold sale and a recommendation will be provided to the Government once that consideration has been finalised. (2) Defence has not yet sought a market valuation for the property from an independent authority such as the Australian Valuation Office. A market valuation will be sought once the property is ready",144,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
377,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer tofor marketing. The valuation will be commercial-in-confidence as its release may prejudice the sale price. (3) It is anticipated the property will be offered for sale in the 2002/03 financial year, although revenue is not anticipated until the 2003/04 financial year. (4) It is understood that the environmental classifications associated with the Point Cook site are covered by the Register of the National Estate, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Victoria Planning and Environment Act. (5) In January 1996, a Victorian EPA Accredited Environmental Auditor– Contaminated Land, undertook a Statutory Environmental Audit of a 6.159 ha portion of the site as part of a proposal to establish the National Air& Space Museum of Australia. Additionally, there have been a number of other environmental and related assessments conducted on the site, which are currently being reviewed. (6) Yes. (7) Defence is undertaking further investigation to complement the existing environmental information and gain a comprehensive understanding of issues on the property. Where appropriate, Defence will undertake remediation consistent with future land use; however, all information on the site condition will be made available to potential purchasers. (8) A major stocktake program is currently underway to catalogue and value the RAAF heritage collection. It is currently conservatively valued at $40million. (9) Annual operating allocations for RAAF Museum, excluding salaries, have been: Year $million 1990/91 0.250 1991/92 0.250 1992/93 0.250 1993/94 0.500 1994/95 0.506 1995/96 0.467 1996/97 0.345 1997/98 0.500 1998/99 0.486 1999/2000 0.500 2000/01 0.619 2001/02 0.611 (10) It is intended that the precinct occupied by RAAF Museum will remain under a form of Commonwealth control after the sale of Point Cook. It is anticipated that recurrent Museum funding will remain consistent with current funding levels. (11) RAAF Museum works closely with the Australian War Memorial in regard to advice and expertise on aircraft and technical equipment. RAAF Museum has a working relationship with other institutions, such as the Museum of Victoria, in providing advice on technical equipment that may be acquired by those institutions. (12) No consideration has been afforded to the upgrade of these services. Defence is disposing of the site on an “as is” basis. (13) As at 15 August 2002 (figures as at 1 August 2002 not readily available) there were 19 Defence families occupying married quarters on Point Cook base, not all of whom are posted to RAAF Williams, and 126 single or unaccompanied members, predominantly students, occupying single living-in accommodation. Defence does not maintain data on the schools attended by Defence personnel. However, I understand that there are approximately 10-12 Defence children at Point Cook Primary School. (14) The majority of RAAF personnel will depart the site when the RAAF College is relocated by approximately 2005. A small cadre of RAAF personnel will remain within RAAF Museum and Australian Airforce Cadet billets on the site indefinitely. (15) The Point Cook airfield is an unlicensed airfield. Aircraft using the airfield are required to have signed an Airfield Use Agreement and have it lodged with KFPW, Defence’s property manager for leases and licences at the site. An Airfield Manager contracted by Defence monitors air movements. The air traffic control tower is not in operation. The current air traffic control arrangements are for Mandatory Broadcast Zone operations. (16) The Commonwealth will not have any minimum air traffic control arrangements. Air movements after the sale of the property will be the responsibility of the new owner. The Wyndham City Council has advised that it has adopted a figure of 100,000 movements per year for planning purposes in the area. Defence has incorporated this figure into one of the scenarios developed in considering the possible future strategic land use. Any formal air traffic arrangement will be the responsibility of the State and/or local government. (17) This will be an issue for the new owner and the State authorities to determine. Telstra: Services (Question No. 702) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) What specific improvements in Telstra services have been achieved in the Albury Wodonga region since April 2002, and what is the specific methodology used to demonstrate any improvement. (2) What specific improvements in Telstra services have been achieved in the Gippsland South region over the past 12 months, and what is the methodology for demonstrating any improvement. (3) What specific improvements in Telstra services have been achieved in the (a) eastern and (b) northern suburbs of Melbourne since 1 January 2002, and what is the methodology for demonstrating any improvement. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question based on information provided by Telstra: The Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) is part of the Government’s comprehensive regulatory safety-net. The CSG requires telephone companies to meet specified timeframes for the connection and repair of telephone services for residential and small business customers, or pay compensation. Timeframes under the CSG for service connection have been progressively tightened since its introduction. Compliance with the CSG has been used as an indicator of service performance in relation to new connections (Service Activations) and fault repairs (Service Assurance) in the following answer. It should be noted that CSG performance can be adversely affected by factors outside Telstra’s control such as extreme weather and other seasonal factors, especially when looking at defined geographical areas. The following figures provided by Telstra are based on Telstra’s Service Regions. (1) Telstra has advised that CSG compliance figures for Service Assurance in the Albury/Wodonga Region improved from 85.5% in April 2002 to 92.5% as at June 2002. Over the same period CSG figures for Service Activation moved from 92% to 94.8%. (2) CSG performance for Service Assurance in the Gippsland Region averaged 93.1% for the period July to November 2001. In December 2001, the Gippsland Service Area was expanded to include the Seymour area and is now known at the South Eastern Service Delivery Area. From December 2001 to June 2002, CSG Assurance performance for the South Eastern Service Delivery area averaged 93.3%. CSG performance for Service Activation in the Gippsland Region averaged 95.8% for the period July to November 2001. In December 2001, the Gippsland Service Area was expanded to include the Seymour area and is now known as the South Eastern Service Delivery area. From December 2001 to June 2002, CSG Activation performance for the South Eastern Service Delivery area averaged 95.3%. (3) The eastern and northern suburbs of Melbourne are serviced by one Telstra service region. This area is bounded by Ferntree Gully and Kinglake in the east and Coburg and Sunbury in the west. Telstra has advised that CSG performance for Service Assurance in this area has improved from 91% in January 2002 to 97% at June 2002. CSG figures for Service Activation rose from 94% in January 2002 to 95% as at June 2002.",145,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

(4) Will such High Readiness Reserves be utilised as slots in Regular Army or in formed Reserve units; if so, what are the criteria for their utilisation. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) None. The authority for Service Chiefs to raise new Reserve categories of service such as High Readiness will not come into effect until new Defence (Personnel) Regulations are passed into law. This process is not likely to occur until 1 December 2002. The size and structure of such a category would be based upon the Army’s preparedness requirements as determined through regular reviews and higher direction. Options are being examined as part of the Army’s development of models for the sustainment of combat forces under guidance provided in the Defence 2000 White Paper. (2) None, at this stage. When the new Defence (Personnel) Regulations come into effect it is planned that members currently serving in the General Reserve will be re-categorised as Active Reservists. (3) None. (4) If a High Readiness category is to be raised it is unlikely that whole units would be designated as High Readiness as the nature of Reserve service would not enable all members to be available at short notice. It is envisaged that should a High Readiness component be established it would be utilised to support Army’s short notice contingencies.",147,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
379,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence: High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 768) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: What is the period of the notice to move for a High Readiness Reserve and how is that different for a similar Active Reserve (a) individual, (b) unit, (c) company, (d) battalion or (e) brigade. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: No period of notice to move has been specified. Should a High Readiness category be established the period of notice will be based upon the Army’s preparedness requirements. Defence: High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 769) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) What is the training requirement for a High Readiness Reserve and how is that different for a similar Active Reserve (a) individual, (b) unit, (c) company, (d) battalion or (e) brigade. (2) What is the extra dollar investment in training for a High Readiness Reserve (a) individual, (b) unit, (c) company, (d) battalion or (e) brigade. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) As a High Readiness category is yet to be established the specific training requirements and obligations have not been determined. It is envisaged that the fundamental difference between a High Readiness Reservist and an Active Reservist would be the periods of notice in which individuals would be expected to report for full-time service. High Readiness Reservists would be expected to be at a standard that allowed them to deploy at periods of notice similar to many of their Regular Army counterparts. (2) No additional investment has been determined. Defence: High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 770) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Has it been estimated that it costs $4.2 billion to fully equip the Army. (2) What is the estimated cost to fully equip the (a) High Readiness Reserve (i) individual, (ii) unit, (ii) company, (iv) battalion or (v) brigade and the (b) Active Reserve (i) individual, (ii) unit, (iii) company, (iv) battalion or (v) brigade. (3) What additional equipment is being provided for High Readiness Reserve and (a) what is its cost and (b) which units will get what equipment and at what cost. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The Portfolio Budget Statement indicates that the cost of the Army’s total output for 2002/2003 will be $5.192 billion. (2) Cost estimates are yet to be completed. (3) Equipment requirements are yet to be determined. Defence: High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 771) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) How many potential High Readiness and Active Reservists are expected to be recruited in (a) 2002 and (b) 2003. (2) What is the estimated cost per reserve recruit in (a) 2002 and (b) 2003 for (i) advertising and (ii) training. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Army would not expect to recruit directly to the High Readiness Reserve. If such a category is established it is envisaged that members of the High Readiness Reserve would be required to satisfy a selection criteria and would elect to be transferred from other parts of the Army. The number of recruits that may be required to feed new categories is being examined. The Army recruited 2,712 Reserve recruits in financial year 2001/02 and has a recruitment target of 3,098 for financial year 2002/03. (2) (a) 2001/2002 was: (i) $996.00 (ii) $23,594.00 (b) 2002/2003 is estimated at: (i) $839.00 (ii) $25,953.00 Defence: High Readiness Reserves (Question No. 772) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Is there a mechanism for designating High Readiness Reserves or is it done voluntarily; if so, what are the details. (2) What was the mechanism and or criteria for determining which units would be High Readiness Reserve and Active Reserve. Mrs Vale-The minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s questions: (1) If a High Readiness category is raised it would be filled on a voluntary basis. It is envisaged that individuals would be required to satisfy particular proficiency and availability criteria but would be administered within their current Reserve unit. (2) If a High Readiness category is raised it is highly unlikely that whole units or larger formations would be designated High Readiness as the nature of Reserve Service would not enable all members to be available at short notice. The current thinking is that individuals and groups within standing Reserve units and formations may become High Readiness Reserves after satisfying particular criteria. The numbers that might be required are under examination as part of a wider capability development project to meet the Army’s Defence 2000 White Paper requirements. Defence: High Readiness Reserve (Question No. 773) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) What is the proportion of regular army personnel for High Readiness Reserve and Active Reserve (a) units, (b) companies, (c) battalions or (d) brigades. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: There is no plan to change the current allocation of Regular members regardless of any future initiatives to establish new Reserve categories. Defence: Army Reserves (Question No. 774) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Does Army have a plan to close Reserve depots; if so, (a) what is it called and (b) is it publicly available. (2) For each calendar year from 1996 to date, (a) which Reserve depots have closed, (b) where were they located, (c) when did they close and (d) were any sold; if so, for what sum. (3) Are further Reserve depots closures expected; if so, (a) which Reserve depots, (b) what are their locations and (c) when are they expected to close. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Army does not possess a plan that formally depicts which Reserve depots will close. (a) The Army does possess the Army Facilities Plan 2001 which provides guidance for the acquisition, development and environmental management of facilities and training areas appropriate to Army capability outputs. It also contains an annex that outlines Army occupied properties identified for possible disposal. (b) No. (2) (a), (b) and (c) The database information recorded does not specifically identify facilities occupied by Reserve Units as Reserve Depots. Attached is a list of training depots and drill halls that may have accommodated Reserve Units, and which have been sold during the period Financial Year 1995-96 to date. (d) Due to confidentiality limitations, it is inappropriate for Defence to disclose the sale price of the individual properties. (3) Further Reserve depot closures are possible as Defence rationalises its estate. (a), (b) and (c) This information has not been determined. This is dependant on the strategic outlook and capability outputs required by the Army and Defence.

(2) If so, can personnel swap worn out, lost or damaged uniforms and equipment on a one for one basis or are they required to pay for all new uniforms and equipment after their initial issue. (3) If personnel are forced to pay for their own replacement uniforms and equipment are they able to claim it back on tax; if not, why not. (4) Is it the case that the families of (a) Navy personnel deployed on operations overseas are able to send mail for no cost up to 3kg, (b) Army personnel deployed on operations overseas are able to send mail for no cost up to 2kg and (c) Air Force personnel deployed on operations overseas are able to send mail for no cost up to 1kg; if so, (d) why are the weights at which families can send mail different for the different services and (e) what action does the Minister intend to take to remedy these discrepancies. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) After the initial free issue, a Uniform Maintenance Allowance is paid to assist members to maintain an approved scale of uniforms in good order and condition. However, provisions exist for field uniforms and equipment that are worn out or damaged due to everyday wear and tear to be exchanged on a one for one basis unless they are lost or damaged through the members’ negligence. In that case replacement of the items must be paid for by the member. Reserve Australian Defence Force members, not on continuous full-time duty, are issued replacement clothing and equipment on a one for one basis. Again, loss or damage of uniforms due to the members negligence requires replacement costs to be met by the member. (3) Uniform Maintenance Allowance is paid to eligible Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel fortnightly as a non-taxed allowance. Personnel are required to justify expenditure on uniform and uniform-related items in their taxation returns at the end of each financial year as per normal workrelated clothing deduction arrangements. ADF personnel in receipt of the Uniform Maintenance Allowance are required to pay tax on any amount of the allowance that cannot be substantiated as expended on the maintenance of their uniforms. (4) ‘Free’ mail limits for ADF personnel deployed overseas do not differ between the three Services. These limits are set by Commander Australian Theatre, in consultation with others, including Australia Post. These limits are based on the nature and location of the operation, as well as logistic support considerations. The cost of sending mail to ADF personnel deployed on operations is subsidised by Defence. The rate of subsidy is determined as a component of the conditions of service for each operation, and thus varies between operations. Currently, operations in East Timor and the Australian contribution to the war on terrorism attract the highest subsidies. For example, a package of up to 20kgs can be sent free of charge to East Timor, where the same package to a member serving in Israel would be charged at the Australian domestic rate applicable from the point of lodgement in Sydney. Mail or packages for personnel deployed as part of the Australian contribution to the war on terrorism are only free up to a limit of 1kg. Anything over 1kg is charged at the Australian domestic rate applicable from the point of lodgement to Sydney. Throsby Electorate: Residential Detoxification Beds (Question No. 779) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) How many residential detoxification beds are available in the electoral division of Throsby and where are they located. (2) How many residential detoxification beds are available in the Illawarra area, which hospitals, or non-government organisations provide them and where are they located. (3) How many residential rehabilitation beds are available in the electoral division of Throsby. (4) How many residential rehabilitation beds are available in the Illawarra area, which hospitals, or non-government organisations provide them and where are they located. (5) What facilities exist in the electoral division of Throsby and the wider Illawarra area for the treatment of people suffering from a combined mental illness and drug dependency. (6) Which service providers in the electoral division of Throsby and the wider Illawarra area are offering treatment for people with a drug dependency and what is the nature of their treatment and services. (7) What is the nature of the Commonwealth assistance provided in the electoral division of Throsby and in the wider Illawarra area to assist in the area of prevention and treatment of illicit drug abuse. the honourable member’s question: (1) to (6)The NSW State Government is primarily responsible for the delivery of drug and alcohol services in NSW. Information about services available in the areas specified will need to be provided by the NSW State Government. (7) Under the National Illicit Drugs Strategy the Commonwealth Government provides funding for prevention and treatment of illicit drug use through the Non-Government Organisation (NGO) Treatment Grants Program, the Community Partnerships Initiative and the Council of Australian Government’s (COAG) Drug Diversion Initiative.

These programs include the: Young Offenders’ Act This Scheme applies to children apprehended by police for a wholly summary drug offence involving not more than the statutory small quantity of the drug, or for an offence that is drug-related. This means police, in appropriate circumstances, can issue a caution or warning, or organise a youth justice conference in lieu of commencing court proceedings and Cannabis Cautioning Scheme The Scheme provides police officers with the discretion to caution adult offenders in relation to the use and possession of dried cannabis and the possession of equipment for the administration of cannabis. A person can only be cautioned if they have no prior convictions for drug offences or offences of violence or sexual assault. Offenders are given written legal and health information on the use of cannabis. The caution also lists the dedicated cannabis phone line for the Alcohol and Drug Information Service (ADIS). From1 September 2001, NSW Police commenced the issue of Second Caution Notices where offenders are required to contact ADIS to undertake a mandatory health education session on the use of cannabis. Defence: Chicquita Park (Question No. 781) Ms Corcoran asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) What was the sale price of the Defence property known as Chicquita Park, located at Levanto Street, Mentone, Vic., sold in December 2001. (2) On what date was (a) the property sold and (b) the sale price agreed upon by the Minister’s Department and the purchaser. (3) What conditions, if any, applied to the sale. (4) How many tenderers submitted a bid. (5) Was the price in the tender of the eventual purchaser the highest price of all tenders. (6) By what process did the Minister’s Department satisfy itself that the final price agreed with the purchaser was a reasonable price for the property. (7) During negotiations with Kingston Council prior to the sale of Chicquita Park, what estimated value did the Minister’s Department place on the property. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Due to confidentiality limitations, it is inappropriate for Defence to disclose the sale price of individual properties. (2) (a) Contracts were exchanged on 20 December 2001 and settlement occurred on 20 March 2002. (b) The price was agreed on 20 December 2001 when a deposit was accepted on the exchange of contracts. (3) The only condition of sale was that the purchaser offered a lease of up to three years to the Mentone Scout Group. (4) Five conforming tenders and four non-conforming tenders were received. (5) No. (6) The department obtained a valuation from a certified valuer in June 2001 indicating a market value for the site of between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000. (7) A valuation based on a residential zoning was obtained in 1999 and the market value of the property at that time was estimated at $2,900,000. Defence: Staffing (Question No. 800) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) How many (a) full time permanent staff, (b) part time permanent staff, (c) full time contract staff and (d) part time contract staff were employed by (i) the Minister’s Department and (ii) agencies within the Minister’s portfolio as at (A) 30 March 1996 and (B) 30 June 2002. (2) For each category of engagement referred to in part (1) and employed by (a) the Minister’s Department and (b) agencies within the Minister’s portfolio, where were such persons located in (i) 30 March 1996 and (ii) 30 June 2002. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (A) The information sought by the honourable member in relation to part (1)(A) and part (2)(i) of his question is not readily available and I am not prepared to authorise the use of the resources that would be required to provide that information. I am able to inform the honourable member, however, that data on APS staffing as at 30 June 1996 is contained in the Australian Public Service Statistical Bulletin 1995-1996 which is publicly available. The honourable member should be aware, however, that changes in APS functions and administrative arrangements between 1996 and 2002 may render direct comparisons between the data for those years invalid.

(2) What were the countries of origin of these visa holders. (3) Of those issued a secondary movement relocation visa, how many were (a) partners and (b) children of temporary protection visa holders who are already in Australia. (4) Are temporary protection visas for 3 years duration and Secondary Movement Relocation visas for 5 years; if so, does this mean that the Government proposes to review separately, and at different times, the continuing need for protection of individual family members. (1) As at 6 September 2002, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) had issued 119 Secondary Movement Relocation (subclass 451) (SMR) visas: 34 SMR visas were issued to persons residing in Indonesia; and 85 SMR visas were issued to persons residing in Nauru. (2) As at 6 September 2002, DIMIA had issued SMR visas to: 107 Iraqi nationals; 1 Iranian national; 3 Afghani nationals; 4 Palestinian nationals; and 4 stateless persons. (3) As at 6 September 2002 of the 119 persons issued with SMR visas: (a) 31 were partners of Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders already in Australia; and (b) 66 were minors with a parent TPV holder already in Australia. (4) TPVs are issued for a period of 3 years and SMR visas are issued for a period of 5 years. It is possible that members of a single family unit who have arrived in Australia under different circumstances or at different times have been issued with different temporary humanitarian visa types with different expiry dates. It is therefore possible that they may have any subsequent claims for",154,Attachment A
381,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ongoing protection considered at different times. However, holders of these visas in Australia are able to lodge further applications for protection at any time and the Minister is able to decide such applications at any time. Opportunities thus exist for the Minister to align the terms of visas subsequently granted to family groups, if appropriate, should they apply together. Defence: Director of Military Prosecutions (Question No. 834) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 August 2002: (1) What is the full year budget cost of the office of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force following the appointment of the Acting Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Peter Newsman, to the position. (2) When will the Director of Military Prosecutions be appointed. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) $1,018,700.00. (2) The creation of a Director of Military Prosecutions will require legislative change to the Defence Force Discipline Act. Pending legislative change an interim Director of Military Prosecutions model will be put in place. The Chiefs of Service Committee will consider the final interim model in October 2002, with the interim Director of Military Prosecutions commencing operations in 2003. Foreign Affairs: Iraq (Question No. 841) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 2002: (1) Is he aware of Channel Nines Sunday programs claim that 13% of oil for food revenue is to be distributed to the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq. (2) Is he able to say why the World Health Organisation (WHO) allows Baghdad to distribute or not distribute medicines brought under the oil for food program to the Kurdish region. (3) Is he able to say whether US$250 million is being earmarked for Kurdistan per annum, and about $200 million per annum remains in accounts controlled by the regime in Iraq. (4) Is he also able to say whether there are widespread shortages of key medicines in Kurdistan and Northern Iraq. (5) Has the Australian Government had representatives visit Kurdistan since the establishment of the northern no fly zone. (6) Has the Australian Government made representations to the WHO about the more equitable distribution of the oil for food plan; if not, why not. (1) Yes. United Nations’ resolutions stipulate that 13 per cent of total revenue from the Oil-for-Food Programme will fund the humanitarian programme in the three northern governorates of Iraq. (2) The United Nations Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme is responsible for the storage, handling, internal transportation, distribution and confirmation of equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies in the three northern governorates. Distribution is not undertaken in these three northern governorates by the Iraqi Regime. (3) Money raised from the Oil-for-Food Programme is placed into UN escrow accounts and is not controlled by the Iraqi Regime.

382,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) No. According to a technical report prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN in 2000, improvements in the nutritional situation in the north started in 1994, prior to UNSCR 986 (1995). This is due to greater resources in the north – the north has 9 per cent of the land area of Iraq but nearly 50 per cent of the productive arable land – and receives higher levels of assistance per person. The north also benefits from the greater flexibility the use of cash gives agencies for the more effective operation and management of programmes.
