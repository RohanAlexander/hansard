186,Nesses. The Celebrations Attracted The Impor,"The SPEAKER-Order! It being 10.00Monday, 26 October 2009 ----Science Funding Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (4.01 pm)-I rise to protest at the actions of the Rudd government in axing funding for high school science centres and its general lack of commitment to science. This government trumpeted its support for maths and sciences before the 2007 election. Its policy paper stated: For Australia to succeed in a highly competitive global economy our children need to have a strong grasp of basic maths and science … The document continued: The foundations of a highly skilled workforce are increasingly laid in the maths and science classrooms of high schools … Unfortunately, Australians have discovered that what was said in opposition before the election and the actions of the Rudd government since the election are two totally different things. I raised the issue of engaging and supporting young people in the sciences over three years ago when I observed: … the problem is keeping the youth interested and engaged through high school. You will never encourage young people in science when they have second-class facilities. The Labor Party has demonstrated its disdain for science with its funding cut for school laboratories and with cuts to such science based organisations as the CSIRO and ANSTO, which were highlighted on 23 June last year. Labor’s lack of real support for sciences was also referred to by Professor Kurt Lambeck, President of the Australian Academy of Science on The 7.30 Report last month. He was speaking on the necessity for international collaboration to aid in the advancement of science and scientists in Australia. Professor Lambeck was asked about the government’s commitment to international collaboration. He replied: I think there is a disconnect at the moment. The Minister, Senator Carr, and the Prime Minister, have both talked about the importance of it, but we haven’t seen that filtering through yet into actual actions. And what we have seen instead, for example, is the effectively the closing town of many of our Commonwealth science officers in our overseas postings. … … … And the cutting back of the funding for some of our international bilateral exchange programs likewise is really making it difficult to develop, to maintain these ceding grounds that have been so important in the past. So the actions are not necessarily compatible with what the ambitions are of the Government. In other words, what this government says and what it does are poles apart, as usual.

187,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 4.00 Pm.,"Midland Highway infrastructure fund and how the needs of Tasmania are already being met by the funding announced for the upgrade of the Midland Highway. The opposition in the stateA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.04 pm to 4.15 pm highway all the way from one end of the road to the other and has committed a future federal Liberal government to pay for it. I understand that Shadow Minister Truss has said he would be prepared to commit only $400 million and that not until 2014. The cost of a four-lane highway is more likely to be over $2 billion at the moment, let alone by 2014, when it will probably be a lot more. That is two elections away. Where the money is coming from I do not know, but the Liberals may have found a goldfield in their back garden-or perhaps they are thinking about a toll road. This government has already started improving the Midlands Highway, beginning with the Brighton hub, which demonstrates a broader approach than just bypassing Brighton as it includes linking into rail and road heavy transport and facilitating a proper transport hub in the south to get some proper planning into the transport system. The system to bypass Brighton will be 9.5 kilometres of four-lane dual carriageway extending from the roundabout at the junction of the Midlands and East Derwent highways to the northern side of Pontville, at a cost of $1.6 million. It will mean a lot of jobs in the Bridgewater-Brighton area too, as well as improvements to Constitution Hill, which have almost been completed. Road planning for the Brighton bypass is also nearing completion and work on the lower end of the Midlands Highway will commence very soon. This will free up this bottleneck and allow a more even distribution of traffic out of the southern points. We also have a rail system being redeveloped, which will help keep a lot of heavy traffic off the Midlands Highway, putting less pressure on tourism traffic and commuters. This is all part of our commitments prior to the last election and is already funded and being delivered. So talk of a four-lane highway at this stage is not only stupid but unachievable by a Liberal state government. Even their own federal representatives cannot agree that it would be useful to the state. Four lanes will not stop accidents. Many of the accidents have taken place on long, narrow, straight stretches of the road. The accidents might not affect as many people at one time, but accidents will still happen when drivers deliberately or accidentally ignore road conditions, road rules and road hazards. Compare our system to the mainland, especially areas equivalent in population and country parts of the mainland, where our major highways stack up very well. Frankly, I prefer driving in these areas to doing so in many parts of Victoria and New South Wales. I will continue to work for the betterment of all roads in Lyons. I am very grateful to this government for understanding the real transport needs of Tasmania and addressing them urgently. (Time expired) with his time because he was cut off by the division.

190,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"The member for Lyons got a bit of leniencyFarrer Electorate: Electoral Redistribution Ms LEY (Farrer) (4.19 pm)-Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker-you are always nice. I would like to speak today on the electoral redistribution in New South Wales, the final announcement around which was made by the boundaries commission last Friday, and the effect that that redistribution has on my electorate of Farrer. I say at the outset that I know that redistributions are difficult periods for members who may lose parts of their electorates that are very important to them or parts of their electorates where they live, or-can I put it this way-the numbers may not quite work in their favour so well post redistribution and they may have to look at the very real possibility of exiting parliament. SoI feel for my colleagues on both sides of the House after this redistribution in New South Wales. My circumstances are that the electorate of Farrer has become larger by 50,000 square kilometres and approximately 5,500 new voters in the local government area of the shire of Central Darling, previously ably represented by my colleague the member for Parkes. I think it is common sense for the whole of the Central Darling Shire to be moved into the same electorate. As it stands, part of that shire-the township of Menindee and the Menindee Lakes, because of their close relationship with Broken Hill-is in the electorate and the rest of the shire is outside of it. After this redistribution, the entire Central Darling Shire and the unincorporated area of western New South Wales, which is a very significant part of the Western Division, will be in the electorate of Farrer. I am absolutely delighted. I know that people assume that when one’s electorate gets larger and the distances you have to travel are more substantial it is not always a good thing. From my point of view, I love the back country; I love representing the people of the far west. They are, in every sense of the word, good people. My only request of them is that when they have problems they contact me more frequently than they do. They would see a lot of that contact as complaining or raising issues that they could probably deal with themselves. I want them to realise that I am here to look after their interests, whatever they may be. I have been asked about what I think this redistribution means for rural representation. While, as I said, I am happy with my personal circumstances, I recognise that by losing a seat in New South Wales we drop another rural representative in the federal parliament. I am not suggesting that we should or could go to a gerrymander situation. In fact, having thoroughly investigated the constitutions of both the states and the federal government, it is not possible for us to do that. But it is very sad that we have dropped to 48 seats in New South Wales. I am told by those who study the numbers that this may well occur again at the next federal election, where we could drop to 47. That is not a good thing for rural representation in this parliament. Although those of us who represent rural Australia work very hard, we sometimes fight to have our arguments heard. This means we will have to fight even harder. Cunningham Electorate: Mr Jim Hagan Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (4.22 pm)-It is with great sadness that I rise to put on the record of this House the passing of a great gentleman from the seat of Cunningham, Mr Jim Hagan. I am very pleased that the member for Throsby is with me in the chamber today while we acknowledge Jim’s great work and the great value that he brought to our region. I acknowledge first of all that Jim is survived by his wife, Lois, his sons, John and Jim, and his grandchildren, Clare, Angus and Jasper. Regarding Jim’s two sons, John works for the New South Wales state forestry department and Jim is Australia’s representative on the World Bank board MAIN COMMITTEE in Washington. I know that Jim took great pride in the work of both of his sons and their achievements. Jim joined the ALP in 1956. He joined the Thirroul branch in 1966 following his membership at Caringbah and in the ACT while completing his PhD. He was a very well regarded and well respected long-term member of a very active branch at Thirroul. He will be sadly missed by all of us in the party but particularly by his branch colleagues. He chaired the Hughes FEC for approximately 15 years and was President of the Thirroul branch for the past two years; he was Vice-President of the Thirroul branch for 40 years-a level of service that many of us can well admire. Jim was educated at Bondi Public School and Sydney Boys High School. He originally worked as a teacher at Parramatta, Sutherland and Caringbah high schools. I want to put on the record that, when he was 12, Jim was one of the original Quiz Kids-between 1941 and 1945-and is still well remembered for that role. It was one of the most popular radio programs in the 1940s. Jim was a historian. He had a long history of union activism in the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the University Staff Association. Indeed, he was the author of the book, The history of the ACTU, although he wrote over a dozen books on regional politics in New South Wales and Wollongong local history, as well as parliamentary biographies. Jim had a very renowned period working at the University of Wollongong as the head of history and politics and was the Dean of Arts. In fact, he was an emeritus professor of history at the University of Wollongong. This came on the back of being Deputy Chancellor at Charles Sturt University for approximately 15 years. Also, I should acknowledge, he was chairman of the Riverina council at Wagga Wagga during his time. So, wherever Jim went, he took an active role in his community. He loved bushwalking, heritage and railways. We loved Jim and he will be very sadly missed by all of us in the Illawarra. Jenny and I are very sad we cannot be there for his funeral on Wednesday to share their memories. National School Chaplaincy Program ernment has spent more money than it has received or is in the process of spending more money than it will receive, there are a huge number of programs that will face the axe. It is my sad duty to reflect the views and the concerns of the constituents of Ryan in relation to one specific program that has enormous resonance around the community, not just in the Ryan electorate but I am sure throughout the electorates of this great country. I am talking about the School Chaplaincy Program. In recent days the School Chaplaincy Program’s continuity has come into question. Certainly in the Ryan electorate this is cause for great concern. I have received literally hundreds of emails in the last 72 hours about whether the Rudd government is going to continue funding this worthy program. I have received emails from suburbs as far away as Kenmore and Pullenvale at one end of the electorate to The Gap in the other part of the Ryan electorate. Constituents there reflect all kinds of concerns about whether this worthy program funded by the federal government will continue to be a source of nourishment and sustenance for the young people in schools. I want to read some of the concerns of stakeholders, of parents and school teachers and, indeed, local community members, who have expressed their deep reservations about whether the Rudd government will continue funding this wonderful initiative of the Howard governMAIN COMMITTEE",167,Constituency Statements

My children have both benefitted from her input as have the children in my year 2 class. I have been so impressed with the change in the ‘tone’ of our school I have joined the LCC committee. From the suburb of Kenmore, one gentleman says to me: I believe that most schools in Kenmore and district have chaplains and that parents actively support their chaplains. In the 2 years of the program the chaplains have become an incredibly important part of the school support system for all the students. I believe the government is under incredible financial pressure this year and next year and the chaplaincy program may well be stopped. A constituent in the Pullenvale says to me: Dear Michael… You may not remember me but I was involved at Kenmore High School’s Chaplaincy program as a parent representative over 2002-2005.

It is an area she has some connection with and during my campaign the member for Throsby worked very hard to show my constituents how we as a government would represent the people of Forde and certainly of Tamborine Mountain. The victory I refer to is about the Zamia Theatre, which I have spoken about in this chamber before. The Zamia Theatre is a very historic venue and asset on the mountain. It started in 1924 as a local hall which had a local theatre group but was also a community hall for other events. Through its history it has been owned by private interests and at one stage the Tamborine Mountain Progress Association, who more recently, a number of years ago, realised that because of the maintenance required on the building it needed to have a helping hand. To their credit the Beaudesert Shire Council, now the Scenic Rim Regional Council, took some responsibility for that. Unfortunately, in the period leading up to the last election there was a commitment of funding under the RPP, the Regional Partnerships Program, which essentially did not materialise. It was an unfunded commitment. Becoming the member, I stood in the middle of this theatre, which had been gutted to take out some of the asbestos and other materials that were to be replaced, and it had no future funding. I have a great amount of gratitude to Queensland government, and I acknowledge their assistance by providing funding through their Q150 funding, which was to celebrate 150 years of Queensland. Further to that, there has been some money from the community infrastructure funds that our government, the Rudd government, have put in place. With the help of the Scenic Rim Regional Council, that has allowed this project to continue. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Constituency Statements

It has brought back an iconic building to the community, an asset that we almost lost. I know that the people who have been involved in this, such as Mayor John Brent, supported the three tiers of government coming together to make a project like this successful. The community worked very hard to maintain the understanding that this facility should be saved. There were hard decisions made by some of the council officers. This asset was probably going to be demolished. Clearly, having the three tiers of government working together to support what is a very important iconic community theatre has meant that we now have the Zamia Theatre back in production. At a function on Friday night, they were celebrating the success of the people of the mountain and the representations at all levels of government. I wish all success to the Rudd government and the Queensland government. Flinders Electorate: Disability Services ents within my electorate and more parents throughout Victoria generally. I have been approached in particular by Maria Franca Lachman Galanzi and Alan Lachman, her husband. They have a child who is vision impaired and who suffers quite profound blindness. I had not been aware that Vision Australia had been forced to close its school for the vision impaired within Australia. I confess that it is something of which I should have been aware, but I was not. As I have looked into it more deeply, it has been quite a profound shock. Maria writes to me: ‘There are 81 schools for people with special needs and desires in Australia. That may include those with deafness; that may include those with profound intellectual or physical disability. But the one school in Victoria specifically set aside to give the parents of children with blindness or vision impairment conditions-the choice as to whether they attend a mainstream or a specially streamed school-is about to be closed. I would respectfully but categorically and absolutely say to the Victorian government that it is extraordinary that Victoria is about to find itself without any government support for a school for the vision impaired at all.’ In Adelaide in South Australia, as Maria writes to me, there is a school for students with vision impairment with over 40 students. That school does wonderful work. Not every child who is blind or vision impaired in Adelaide attends that school. But many parents choose consciously, deliberately and absolutely to pursue the education of their children within a specially streamed school. The reason is very simple: it is, as Maria has said to me, many needs are easily addressable. A blind student needs a school equipped with Braille books and PCs with adaptive technology; adapted art rooms, PE and music facilities; no physical barriers; and an expanded core curriculum. These are easily achievable, but only on a whole-of-school basis for many people who lack confidence or societal connections. One of the points made to me by Maria and Alan was that it can be terribly isolating for a blind student to be in a mainstream school. Some can adapt, but some have profound social disadvantage as well as a learning disadvantage. They have no intellectual impairment but have great physical and social needs. SoI say to the Victorian government, please listen to the pleas of Maria and Alan and other parents and help re-establish a school for children with blindness in Victoria.

Time prevents my reading out their names but, suffice to say, they are the successful nominees chosen by their schools for appropriate recognition. The annual Throsby Community Spirit and Leadership Awards program was instituted by me back in 2007. The purpose of the awards is to acknowledge students at all our local schools who actively contribute either to their school community or, indeed, to their wider community-for example, by volunteering for a range of school activities or involvement with local organisations like the Red Cross and also for their assistance, particularly for younger students and those with a disability, through numerous ‘buddy’ programs that are run in our schools. It is often the case, as we know, that those students who excel academically or on the sporting field receive accolades at their annual school speech nights and presentations. The Throsby awards recognise those students whose contributions may be less immediately obvious but are just as valuable. I would like to quote the words of an editorial that appeared in our local paper, the Lake Times. It said: Certain schools in the area are well-known for their sporting prowess, consistently producing high achievers on the sporting field. Other schools set the bar high academically and still others have a strong reputation for pursuing the arts. Within every high school there will be students who excel in each of those fields. But for every would be Brett Lee or high flying business person who picks up an accolade to encourage them on to bigger and better things, there are scores of students who won’t. … … … But the efforts of students who helped out disabled students at school, or acted as safety monitors or even who picked up garbage should not be underestimated-they may just go on to be the next Tim Costello or Gordon Bradbery Gordon Bradbery is the local well-known and admired reverend of the Uniting Church. I thank all the students and their family members who attended the awards presentation on 4 September. I hope the students benefit from the books they purchase with the voucher that was presented to them on the evening, along with their congratulatory certificates. Thanks also to the principals and staff of my schools. I would like to thank them for their encouragement of such a fine group of young local ambassadors who bring great credit to their school and to our community. National School Chaplaincy Program National Schools Chaplaincy Program has not been funded past mid-next year has caused considerable concern amongst students, parents, teachers and chaplains in my electorate.

194,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (4.36 Pm),"The discovery in Senate estimates last week that theconcern expressed by many schools who felt it may threaten the separation of church and state. However, over the past week, I have received a great deal of correspondence from students, principals, parents and chaplains who have benefited in one way or another from the program. The benefits that this program offers school communities are immense. Despite being a relatively new program, the feedback I have received is that school chaplains are making an enormous contribution to the personal, emotional and spiritual well-being of many school communities. This was recently reinforced by a study into the program by Edith Cowan University. The study found that teachers’ feedback from the program has been overwhelmingly positive. For teachers, the program fills a vital gap and provides an invaluable resource for teachers who have neither the time nor the capability to provide the services offered by these chaplains. Adolescence is a very difficult time. For many students, having an adult who is always available to help them with behavioural management issues and social relationship issues such as anger, peer relationships, loneliness and bullying makes a significant difference to their lives. It would be interesting to know how many youth suicides have been prevented by young people having access to a kind and understanding ear. The chaplains also provide support, comfort and advice in the event of a family breakdown. They also offer support to students who are grief stricken by the loss of friends in tragic accidents or by the loss of family members. As one parent in my electorate correctly pointed out, this program gives students a head start in life and a platform from which they can begin to make the right choices in life. Despite the fact that 97 per cent of school principals have engaged a chaplain and strongly support the program and its benefits to their school communities, the government has refused to rule out cancelling funding for this program. The government must give a firm commitment that this program will be extended. In closing, I would say that this is something that has worked. It is not a religious indoctrination. I know from personal experience that very marginalised children have benefited from having a person with a kind and caring ear to speak to.

This bill provides for the smooth transition from the current regime, which is out of step with the contemporary tax and commercial environment, to the new regulatory regime in the Tax Agent Services Act 2009, which was passed by parliament earlier this year. The bill ensures that entities currently providing tax agent services are able to make the transition into the new regime with as little disruption as possible. This includes tax agents and nominees registered under the current law, as well as entities currently providing business activity statement services. The bill also includes special transitional provisions to cater for entities providing specialist tax agent services. Importantly, the bill introduces two safe harbour provisions.

These safe harbours have been a key feature of the new regime since they were first proposed in 1998. They reflect the fact that, under the new regime, effective action can be taken by the board to improve the performance of tax agents or BAS agents where necessary. The bill will also make consequential amendments to other existing legislation. These amendments will be necessary upon the commencement of the key regulatory provisions in the Tax Agent Services Act 2009-for example, the bill repeals part VIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which is the existing law for the registration of tax agents. The key transitional and consequential amendments include safe harbour provisions, have been the subject of extensive consultation over a number of years and have undergone significant development and refinement. Those involved in the tax agent services industry continue to express their strong support for the introduction of the new regulatory regime. The opposition has also made known its support for the new regime and the benefits that it will provide. The government is committed to the creation of a new regulatory regime that is appropriately tailored to the contemporary tax and commercial environment and that reflects legitimate expectations of consumers of tax agent services. The passage of this bill will represent another important step in the creation of such a regime. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a second time.

198,Mr Griffin (Bruce,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (4.46 pm)-I present a supplementhe Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009, but I do wish to make a few observations about the approach that the opposition intends to take to it. I begin by reaffirming that the opposition strongly supports Medicare. Indeed, it used to be said under the former government that it was the best friend that Medicare had ever had. Many members of the current government were probably sick of hearing that statement, but I think that the former government did by its actions abundantly justify that statement. Obviously, if Medicare is to workif it is to function effectively-there have to be meaningful mechanisms to tackle fraud and overservicing. At the moment, the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare can request information from doctors who are reasonably suspected of engaging in inappropriate or improper practices. The CEO of Medicare reports that some 20 per cent of doctors who are asked to provide access to patients’ medical records refuse to do so. The government believes that of that 20 per cent many are quite possibly engaged in improper or inappropriate practices. I would suggest to the Main Committee that it could equally be that they simply do not believe that it is ethically proper of them to provide their patients’ medical records to a third party, even a third party as eminent as the CEO of Medicare. This legislation seeks to give the CEO of Medicare the power to require the production of patients’ medical records rather than just request them. I should point out that this strikes me and the opposition as a rather heavy-handed solution to a problem that may be more apparent than real. For instance, every year some $4.5 million is recovered from doctors in Medicare payments which turn out to have been inappropriately claimed. That suggests, firstly, that there are mechanisms in place to recover moneys from doctors who have inappropriately claimed and, secondly, that it is not such a shocking problem given that $4.5 million, while a lot of money in itself, is a minuscule percentage of the $14 billion or thereabouts that Medicare disburses every year. Five convictions on average are secured every year against doctors for improperly claiming Medicare benefits. Obviously, five is five too many but when we remember that there are some 55,000 doctors registered to claim Medicare benefits, the fact that in any one year five do so improperly suggests that the vast majority of doctors are working entirely appropriately under the system. I would be very disappointed to think that this government was engaging in doctor bashing. The last thing that we should do if we want our health care system, and in particular Medicare, to function well is to assume that all doctors are cheats. Medicare only works because of the goodwill and integrity of the medical profession. I believe it is important for the government and the parliament to work with the profession rather than against it in matters such as this. I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate and ultimately more productive, when the CEO of Medicare believes that there may be some grounds for suspecting that benefits have been claimed improperly or inappropriately, if rather than issuing a notice requiring a doctor to produce medical records the CEO instead sent a Medicare official to the doctor’s practice to be there with the doctor on site to inspect the relevant records. This, I think, would be a simpler and more collegial way of ascertaining the true facts of the situation and in the long run more likely to get to the truth of the matter than the issuing of notices to produce records. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Health Insurance Amendment Compliance Bill 2009
199,Mr Abbott (Warringah) (4.48 Pm),"I do not propose to detain the Committee long onIf it really does seem to the CEO of Medicare that something improper has taken place, there are already mechanisms for securing access to patients’ records, mechanisms which have been in place for many years and which are well regarded in terms of the privacy provisions surrounding them. There is the possibility of a professional services review or, if that is regarded as insufficient, the possibility of bringing action in court against the doctor concerned. At least on the face of it, this legislation strikes me as going too far and as giving a power to the CEO of Medicare the necessity for which is far from clear. Without wishing further to detain the Main Committee and without wishing to move amendments at this stage of the bill, I foreshadow that the opposition is looking at some amendments which we will consider in another place. Ms HALL (Shortland) (4.54 pm)-I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009. I am not really clear whether the opposition will support this legislation or whether it will oppose it in the House. I note that the shadow minister talked of some amendments to be moved in another place, but I am still not sure whether or not that means that the opposition is seeking to oppose this legislation. This bill will enable Medicare to give a notice requiring the production of documents to a practitioner or another person who has control of documents to substitute an amount of Medicare benefit paid in respect of professional services. This initiative aims to protect the integrity of Medicare and to enhance Medicare Australia through an audit process and sees the government deliver on its commitment of responsible economic management. The 2008-09 budget measures also included an increase in the number of audits conducted under the compliance program. This legislation ensures that Medicare remains viable. Expenditure on Medicare has now increased to $14 billion per year, and it has more than doubled over the last 10 years. It is in that light that the government has introduced this legislation. It establishes a compliance measure to be undertaken by Medicare Australia administrative staff to maintain the integrity of Medicare. It is a vital part of the government’s overall economic management and a vital part of the government’s strategy to ensure that Medicare remains viable into the future. Medicare is an institution that protects all Australians. The shadow minister indicated that, when he was the minister for health, his government was the best friend that Medicare ever had. I would strongly argue against that proposition put by the shadow minister. It was under his reign as minister that bulk-billing plummeted. It was under his reign as minister that many problems developed within Medicare. It was only because of Labor constantly keeping him on his toes that Medicare actually survived the Howard years. So it is with great pleasure that I am able to stand up in this place and support the bill we have before us. I note very strongly that most medical practitioners do the right thing and charge appropriately. Other medical practitioners may make mistakes. I think that most errors that occur would just be an oversight, and this legislation takes into account those kinds of problems. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into compliance audits on Medicare benefits recommended: … as part of the Medicare compliance audit process specific measures are detailed in the regulations to ensure that patient clinical records are only required to be accessed where necessary. The government has taken into account what this legislation’s purpose is and listened to what the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee put forward. MAIN COMMITTEE The government has also consulted widely, and that is a really important point for me to make at this point in my contribution to this debate. We have also consulted very widely with all sectors of the community that are involved in this. Key stakeholders have all been consulted, and they were given the opportunity in 2008 and in the first half of this year to comment. This included the AMA, as it did the Senate committee. As I have already stated, the Senate committee’s recommendations have been considered and are reflected in the legislation that we are debating here in the chamber today. I should walk through a few aspects of this legislation. In doing so I should mention that the government decided that it was very much appropriate to address the issues covered by this legislation in primary legislation rather than regulation. Therefore, the bill was amended to include significant involvement by medical advisers in the compliance audit process. A ‘medical adviser’, for the record, is a medical practitioner employed by Medicare Australia. That is of vital importance, because the audit is not an audit of clinical process, clinical decisions or clinical practice but rather an administrative audit. The documents that will be required to be produced by a medical practitioner will not in any way impinge on patient privacy or in any way look at patient decisions in relation to patient care and appropriate medical decisions. If it is found that there has been some breach, there are a number of conditions that need to be satisfied before the CEO can act: firstly, the CEO must have reasonable concern that Medicare benefits paid in respect of a service may exceed the amount that has been paid; secondly, the CEO must take advice from a medical adviser before a notice can be issued; and, thirdly, the CEO must give a person a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily respond to the audit request prior to formal notice. It is important to note that this legislation was needed because currently 20 per cent of medical practitioners do not comply voluntarily with the audit and it was felt by the government that this needed to be right across the board to ensure the integrity, ongoing success and viability of Medicare. Medicare Australia will continue to work with all the stakeholders, will continue to see that it involves everybody and will continue to consult. That is something that is very different from the previous government. It is something that is very different to what happened when the previous minister for health, in the Howard government-the member for Warringah, who just spoke-held the portfolio and had an opportunity to have an impact in these areas. The bill also looks at the penalty rate. Where a person voluntarily admits they have made a mistake there will be a 100 per cent reduction in the penalty. Where it has been paid, there will be a 50 per cent reduction. Before the completion of the audit, there will be a 25 per cent reduction. But if a person does not respond to the audit then they will have a 25 per cent increase. Overall, this is a very fair piece of legislation. It is legislation that has been designed to ensure the ongoing viability of Medicare, and it is very reasonable that both sides of this House support it. It did worry me that, when the shadow minister spoke a few moments ago, he indicated that he may not support this legislation. I was hoping that he would clarify that fact for me. I will be very disappointed if the shadow minister does not get behind this very sensible piece of legislation, which is designed to ensure the long-term viability of Medicare.

200,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporatecreased Medicare compliance audit initiative which was announced in the 2008-09 budget. This is a very important bill, as the member for Shortland said. It is a very sensible bill. Expenditure on the Medicare scheme is substantial, totalling over $14 billion in 2008-09. This expenditure has increased by more than $1 billion per annum in each of the last two years. Medicare Australia does conduct a compliance audit on Medicare services to ensure that taxpayers’ funds are spent appropriately. A compliance audit is an administrative check to confirm that all elements of a service, which are outlined in the Medicare Benefits Schedule, were performed. A compliance audit does not review matters relating to the clinical relevance of services. These are and will continue to be managed through the Professional Services Review. The government recognises that compliance audits can be inconvenient to medical practitioners and may cause some additional workload for a short period of time. However, there is simply no other way to cost-effectively manage the risks associated with large expenditure while still maintaining accessible, affordable services through Medicare. At present, Medicare Australia cannot require the production of documents during an audit. As a result, around 20 per cent of practitioners either do not respond or refuse to cooperate with a request for documents during a compliance audit. I note that the member for Warringah, representing the shadow minister for human services, said that therefore the conclusion is that the government think that the majority of those 20 per cent are doing something wrong. That is not necessarily the case. What we do think, though, is that it is incumbent on the government to ensure that taxpayers’ funds are being spent appropriately. It is not acceptable to have 20 per cent of respondents refusing to agree. That would be the case in this program and it would be the case in any other government program whether it be welfare based or expenditure based-whatever it is. Twenty per cent of people simply refusing to comply with an audit is far too high a figure, and the government must act to boost its powers. That is not a reflection on doctors. It is not a reflection even on those 20 per cent of doctors refusing to comply. But it is a sign of prudent fiscal management and responsible budgeting to say that we should ensure that all money is being spent appropriately. This bill was considered at the government’s instigation by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which concluded that it represented a good balance between the overlapping interests of maintaining patient privacy and ensuring that public funds are spent appropriately. The committee recommended the development of regulations to ensure that clinical records are only accessed where necessary during an audit. We accepted this recommendation, but we consider this is more appropriately addressed in the primary legislation, which it is, before the House. For this reason the bill provides for extensive involvement by medical practitioners employed by Medicare Australia in the compliance audit process. This bill will enable the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia to give a notice requiring the production of documents to a practitioner or another person who has custody, control or possession of the documents, to substantiate a Medicare benefit paid in respect of the service. However, before the notice to produce documents can be issued, the CEO must have reasonable concern about the Medicare benefit paid in respect of the service, take advice from a medical practitioner employed by Medicare Australia on potential sensitivities associated with the kinds of documents a practitioner may need to provide to substantiate the service and MAIN COMMITTEE give the person a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily respond to an audit request. That is very important. Again, the member for Warringah asked: why wouldn’t the CEO just send a representative to talk to the medical practitioner involved before issuing a notice? The fact of the matter is that that does and will continue to occur, but the CEO does need an increase in powers to deal with a situation where the medical practitioner involved simply refuses to cooperate, refuses to discuss the matter or in any way substantiate the claim that is being made. Now, importantly, it will be up to the person who receives the notice to decide what documents they have available to substantiate the service. The notice to produce documents must include a statement that documents containing clinical details do not have to be produced unless these are necessary to substantiate the service. If a practitioner decides that documents containing clinical details must be provided then the bill allows practitioners to supply those documents to a medical practitioner employed by Medicare Australia rather than an administrative officer. This means that the practitioner who provided a service decides what documents to provide to Medicare Australia and who will receive those documents. Medicare Australia is working with stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, to develop guidelines on the kinds of documents that will substantiate particular services or groups of services. These guidelines will be publicly available and will emphasise that clinical information is not to be provided unless it is absolutely necessary to substantiate the service. The provisions in this bill do not commence until 1 January 2010, in order to allow for the development and publication of these guidelines. The bill provides for an important protection for practitioners. Documents which are provided to Medicare Australia in response to a notice cannot be used against the practitioner in any other proceedings except for those relating to false or misleading statements under the Health Insurance Act. This means that Medicare Australia cannot use any information obtained as a result of the notice to produce documents as the basis for a referral to the Professional Services Review. The bill provides for practitioners to be notified of the outcome of the audit. In addition, if a practitioner is found to owe a debt to the Commonwealth, the CEO must give them 28 days in which to seek an internal review before a debt notice can be issued. At present, if the Medicare amount paid is not substantiated, the practitioner is required to repay the money, and this will continue to occur. However, this bill provides that a practitioner who cannot substantiate the Medicare amount paid may also be liable to a financial penalty. This financial penalty is intended to encourage practitioners to itemise Medicare services correctly. A base penalty amount of 20 per cent will be applied to debts in excess of $2,500. Medicare Australia’s data indicates that this is the point at which mistaken claims may become routine or reflective of poor administrational decision making. In 2008-09, only 22 per cent of practitioners who were found to have made incorrect claims were asked to pay more than $2,500. The $2,500 threshold may be increased by regulations. This allows the threshold to be adjusted to ensure that practitioners are not disadvantaged by increases in the value of the Medicare benefit paid in respect of services. This bill allows the base penalty amount to be reduced or increased according to individual circumstances described in the legislation. This is intended to encourage self-disclosure and promote voluntary compliance. This bill is not retrospective and will apply only to Medicare services provided after the commencement of the legislation on 1 January 2010. MAIN COMMITTEE This is, as I said, a very important bill. It is a bill which the government has paid a great deal of attention to. It is a bill in which we have listened to concerns about privacy, and I believe we have got the balance right. I have had a number of meetings with the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Andrew Pesce, about this bill, and I have taken the AMA’s views on board where I have felt it prudent and appropriate to do so. The shadow minister indicated, I believe, support in the House but reserved the opposition’s position and indicated that they will be moving amendments in the other place. I will look at those amendments carefully. If they are sensible and practical then we will take them on board, but we will be looking for the opposition’s support for this very important bill, which protects taxpayers’ money and ensures the integrity of the Medicare system. The government cannot stand before the Australian people at the moment and say, ‘We believe everything is being done that can be done to ensure that your taxpayers’ dollars are spent appropriately when it comes to Medicare.’ This bill will make a very substantial improvement to the integrity and accountability of our expenditure of taxpayers’ money on Medicare services. It is appropriately and carefully balanced and targeted, and I commend it to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 September, on motion by Ms Kate Ellis: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (5.15 pm)-In speaking to the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority Amendment Bill 2009, I want to indicate that the opposition lends its support to this bill. This piece of legislation is largely directed towards the governance of laid down to stamp out doping in sport. Despite some governance issues that this bill is addressing, the policies of the coalition ensured that ASADA developed a strong international reputation as a world leader in best practice anti-doping regulation. The coalition improved Australia’s anti-doping effort by replacing the Australian Sports Drug Agency with ASADA in 2006. This was as a result of the Anderson inquiry in 2004 into the Australian track cycling team. We armed this new agency with strong powers to investigate and present cases as well as exchange information with other enforcement agencies. We gave it the power to investigate suspected anti-doping rule violations outlined in the World Anti-Doping Code, to make recommendations on its findings and to present cases against alleged offenders at sport tribunals. We provided an additional $2.24 million to ASADA in the MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Health Insurance Amendment Compliance Bill 2009
201,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ja Saffin),"Before we proceed to the next bill, I wish to2007 budget for enhanced investigation of alleged doping violations and the subsequent preparation and submission of briefs in relation to individual cases, bringing total funding to $12.9 million. We launched the ‘stamp out’ hotline in March 2006, where people can report information about possible doping in sport. We established the Register of Findings in March 2006, which makes public the names of athletes who have committed a violation, and we initiated the Athlete Whereabouts information register in March 2007 to further facilitate tested. Because of the work of the previous government, ASADA has earned a fine international reputation. It now conducts approximately 4,200 government funded tests each year. Additionally, a Curtin University survey found that the proportion of athletes vulnerable to doping had declined in the last four years. The proportion of athletes who would give a lot of or some consideration to taking up an offer of a banned substance had decreased from 16 per cent in 2004 to eight per cent in 2008, in this survey. However, the same survey found that 18 per cent of athletes believed they could get away with using performance-enhancing drugs while out of competition, while six per cent said they could get away with it during competition. Therefore, there is clearly more work to do. To ensure that our anti-doping efforts are as effective as possible, ASADA, which is central to our fight against doping, must be operating at its optimum. A review of ASADA commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008 found that this may not be the case. The review found that the complex governance arrangements made it difficult to resolve disagreements between the ASADA chair, who was also the head of the agency, and the ASADA members. These disagreements have included the strategic direction of ASADA, the testing of schoolboy rowers, the handling of a test result from Ian Thorpe and a Medicare-datacorrelating pilot project. The review found that the definitions of the roles, responsibilities and powers of the blurred. The review found that disagreements between the members and the chair-CEO, in the amalgamated role, have therefore been hard to resolve, which has caused tensions to develop and, in some cases, relationships to break down. The review stated: Many of the problems which have faced ASADA since its inception can be directly attributed to the lack of clarity in the ASADA Act about the roles, powers and functions of the Chair/CEO on the one hand and the non-executive members on the other … It recommended that two main issues required clarification. The first was the need for clear allocation of roles and responsibilities within ASADA and between ASADA and key stakeholders, including the Department of Health and Ageing. The second issue was the need for a clear distinction between functions through which ASADA acts as an arm of government and functions in which independence from government may be desirable. This bill seeks to alter FMA Act agency by removing its CAC Act elements. It will create a new CEO position with an advisory board, create an anti-doping rule violation panel and make changes to the way the National Anti-Doping Scheme will be amended in the future. The first element is to ensure that ASADA operates as a conventional FMA Act agency by removing its CAC Act elements. When ASADA was established in 2006, its financial arMAIN COMMITTEE rangements were determined by the FMA Act and its staffing arrangements were determined by the Public Service Act 1999. ASADA was established as a body corporate, consisting of a chair, deputy chair and independent non-executive members who were given decision-making roles. This meant that it would also perform some functions attributable to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the CAC Act. So it had, in a sense, a hybrid nature-features of an agency operating under both the FMA Act and the CAC Act. For the purposes of the FMA Act, the ASADA chair was also the chief executive of the agency. Removing the CAC Act elements and ensuring ASADA operates as an agency under the FMA Act will separate the chair and chief executive roles. We will now have a chief executive officer and an advisory group. The creation of a new chief executive officer position and a new advisory group is being proposed to clarify the roles and responsibilities within ASADA. The CEO position will be responsible for directing ASADA in carrying out functions prescribed under the ASADA Act, including financial responsibilities normally expected of a CEO under the FMA Act and the Public Service Act. The advisory group will have purely advisory functions. Members will be appointed by the Minister for Sport and will have specialist skills in areas such as education and training, sports medicine, sports law, ethics and investigations. There will also be a new anti-doping rule violations panel. The panel being created by this bill will replace the current anti-doping rule violation committee. The new panel will consist of members with specialist skills, such as sports law, sports medicine and pharmacology, and will not include the ASADA chief executive, ASADA staff or members of the new advisory group. So there will be very clear separation. The panel will have a quasi-judicial role, in that it will be their responsibility to determine any anti-doping rule violations and make recommendations, which will be given back to the ASADA chief executive officer. It will be his responsibility to notify the individual athletes and the national sporting organisation. Finally, the bill will change that the way the National Anti-Doping Scheme will be amended in the future. The National Anti-Doping Scheme ensures Australia remains compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. When the World Anti-Doping Code changes, the NAD Scheme is amended to reflect the changes. Under current arrangements, ASADA can only change the National Anti-Doping Scheme as a whole by a written instrument. Under the new arrangements, which provide more flexibility, the chief executive officer will still make changes via a written instrument, but the bill will include additional matters where the CEO can make changes, allowing him or her the ability to change just sections of the National Anti-Doping Scheme instead of the scheme as a whole. In conclusion, I regard the legislation as very straightforward. It goes to the governance of clearly these governance problems have been identified and they need to be resolved. I think this will be a much better structure going forward. As I said earlier, ASADA has earned an excellent reputation in its work on stamping out doping in sport and Australia maintains a very strong line against doping in sport. It is a matter of pride to Australia that WADA is headed up by an Australian, a former federal minister and former New South Wales Premier, John Fahey. I wanted to indicate that the opposition support this legislation. It is very straightforward. I would also like to thank the Minister for Sport and her staff and the department for their exMAIN COMMITTEE tensive consultation and briefings on this legislation. The bill is implementing structural changes to the internal operations of ASADA which are consistent with the independent review. It will clarify the roles and responsibilities within ASADA and streamline the way it runs. I indicate the opposition will be supporting this bill. very important bill, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2009. At the outset I congratulate the Minister for Sport, the Hon. Kate Ellis, for her role in bringing this to the parliament and ensuring that the good work that has been done by the Sports AntiDoping Authority is continued into the future and that in fact it continues to improve as it has done for many years. SoI congratulate her for her good work in that particular area. This is an important bill. Although it is a matter of just some governance changes and some minor amendments and a number of realignments of roles and so forth, all the while it is very important in terms of the way that ASADA actually operates given that it currently exists under what is best described as a hybrid governance model which is subject to a number of acts, particularly the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. While ASADA has been functioning well, the way it is currently structured and governed and the way the board operates means that there have been a number of internal and structural issues when it comes to decision-making and some confusion as to people’s specific roles or the direction that the board or the organisation actually takes. This is a sensible move forward and I understand the opposition fully support these changes in the bill. We welcome that, because Australia does have a strong reputation for anti-doping in sports and I believe it is important that we continue to build on that reputation and make sure that we continue the good work that has been done to protect sports and sports people and to ensure that the image of sports in Australia is of clean sports without the use of performance enhancing drugs or other drugs. This legislative change has come about via a review that was commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing. It found that there were difficulties with the hybrid model of governance that I mentioned earlier, that in itself created some problems, particularly to the extent of authority that was available to non-executive members in the performance of their duties under the ASADA Act. These governance changes will correct that and remove that uncertainty that existed. Basically what the changes to the ASADA Act will mean is the abolition of the positions of ASADA chair and ASADA members. This of course has been done in consultation with those members and they are aware of the impending changes. The bill will create a new chief executive officer position to fulfil the head of agency role and it will also establish a new independent anti-doping rule violation panel to make sure that decisions on anti-doping rule violations, previously the responsibility of ASADA members, are carried forward and there is a proper way for that to happen. It will also establish an advisory group as part of a consultative forum for the CEO on various matters, such as testing, education, investigations and so forth. There will also be some small incidental changes to align the ASADA Act more closely with changes to the world anti-doping code that came into effect on 1 January this year. So it will align our internal efforts and internal governance within Australia with what is happening on the global stage. Change will also mean that the method for amending the regulations covering ASADA’s operational activities will provide the parliament with greater scrutiny.

202,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (5.26 Pm),"I thank the chamber for the opportunity to speak on thisties in sport, particularly in Australia, given that we all believe in a strong stance in this area and given that we want to maintain our reputation as a country that produces sportspeople who are free of drugs, and teams free of drug cheats. The changes that we are proposing will come into effect on 1 January next year. The amendments that we are proposing do not have a financial impact. As I said earlier, I want to congratulate the Minister for Sport for taking this one. While I understand that there is cross chamber acceptance of the changes, it is good to see that it was she who brought these changes in. It is important legislation. While it is minor in some respects, putting Australia at the forefront of global change in anti-doping activities is important. We all want to get rid of drug cheats in sport. They have no place in sport at any level, be it an individual or team level, a club level or an elite level. Drugs cheating is a dangerous practice, both in terms of a country’s reputation and a sport’s reputation, but also from a health perspective for individual sportspeople. It is important to note in this debate that these changes will not have any adverse effect on any anti-doping activities that are currently taking place. We are making sure that there will be transitional measures in place to enable the continuity of some key activities that are going on right now-in particular, any decisions relating to any anti-doping rule violations that are in the process of being taken. Everybody in this House agrees that there is no place for drug cheats in sport at any level, and particularly not at the elite level where people are representing their country. In what some people would describe as a sports mad country, it is fairly important that we take a strong anti-doping stance and that we have a system that matches that stance. It is a pretty widely held view in the community as well. People want to see fair competition and people competing on their merits and not on their ability to take drugs. The potential health risks involved in the taking of either shortor long-term performance-enhancing drugs are worthy of note. We have seen these risks over a number of years in elite sports, with highly talented individuals who have decided to use performance-enhancing drugs often having health problems or taking other drugs. Not only does that affect their ability over the long term, it can also quite substantially shorten their lives. We have seen a number of high-profile deaths over the years relating directly to the harmful use of drugs. There is an important role for every country to play in making sure that we protect athletes from the pressures that are placed on them when they compete at those elite levels. That is something that we need to acknowledge in this debate: the pressure that is placed on people to continue to perform better and better; to continue to lift; to perform with incredible levels of stamina, fitness or strength; to perform feats beyond the ordinary human being. We have seen that in particular sports, be it football, handball or one of my favourite sports, cycling, where we have seen lots of controversies over the years in world-renowned events such as the Tour de France and others. It always saddens me when I see such controversies because I see the damage that is being done to those sports through the use of drugs. I also see the damage that is being done to ordinary people who participate in those sports when the sport is tarnished with the image of being a drug-cheating sport. This is not isolated to the cycling world. We have seen it occur in the weightlifting world and a whole range of other sports at the Olympics. MAIN COMMITTEE It is really important that governments and countries take it upon themselves to do everything they can to ensure that they have the right regulatory frameworks in place. Anti-doping bodies need the right governance, the right structures and the right funding. A strong message also needs to be sent out so that young people in particular do not fall into bad habits or traps early, because that often leads them into some poor practices later in life. Again, I congratulate the Australian government for continuing the commitment to fight against dopingperformance enhancing drugs in sport-and for doing that through a range of methods such as detection and through looking at the different opportunities where these drugs can be taken. The bill before us today, as I said, reflects part of an independent review that was done at the end of last year. The change that we are putting forward is part of a central implementation agency for anti-doping efforts in Australia which will effect its key responsibilities in detecting drug cheats and, through education programs, in discouraging athletes from taking drugs through testing, through investigations and, of course, essentially through enforcement. You have to enforce it at some point. You have to take a tough stance, and sometimes that is done at the high-profile end to send the message back down the line. I strongly believe that this is the right direction in which to go and that we have to send out the right signals. Australia is a leader in this area, and it ought to continue its very good efforts. There will be some costs associated with the establishment of the new anti-doping review panel and also the advisory group, including member remuneration and some secretarial expenses and so forth. But it will be money well spent. The associated costs will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, which is the appropriate place for these things to be done. While the positions of ASADA members are being abolished as part of these changes, as I said before, they will still have a role to play through participation on the interim review panel. Outgoing members who possess the right skills will be eligible for permanent appointment to the new panel or to the advisory group, and members have been consulted on this. Australia has been renowned for setting a very high bar in this area. We certainly make no apology in terms of that. Our good reputation needs to be continually strengthened, and this bill will do that. I am particularly heartened by the view that we are not operating alone in this area. While our good efforts are unique to Australia, it is important that we align our efforts with those of the rest of the world, given that elite sport is played on a global stage and not just in our own backyards. At the same time, we need to make sure that we protect the rights and privacy of athletes and that we do things the right way. When this bill takes effect, a number of new positions will be created and some older positions will be abolished. The bill will provide the new body with a governance framework to operate properly. It will remove any of the confusion that previously existed and ensure that anti-doping continues to be a central plank in Australia’s approach to sport and that Australia continues to be at the forefront of anti-doping measures around the world. It will ensure that, when our athletes compete, they will be confident that the athletes whom they compete against are not drug cheats and that there is a level playing field. Our athletic champions, our sports people, will know that all their hard work and effort over many, many years can be rewarded appropriately by competing against people who are not cheating the system and who are not on drugs. I commend the bill to the House. Amendment Bill 2009 has been promoted, in particular, as a series of administrative changes. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Asada I Believe Asada Has Operated Well In Terms Of The Functions It Has Carried Out But
203,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (5.39 Pm),"The Australian Sports Anti-Doping AuthorityIt has some quite serious implications and is worthy, I think, of some comment in that regard. These amendments-or series of administrative changes-were, quite properly, brought forward due to a considerable discourse within the management of ASADA that resulted in disputes about the privacy rights of athletes. There was a virtual zero tolerance process that some of the executive thought was appropriate but which was rejected by others. In the case of Thorpe, possibly that enthusiasm was acceded to. This bill is an attempt to bring forward a new regime that is expected, I think, to be more successful on both sides of the fence, and it warrants some discussion as to those matters. I continue to have an involvement in the ownership and training of racehorses. I served for nine years on the committee of the Western Australian Turf Club and for two years as the chairman. Nowhere else, historically, has the issue of performance-enhancing drugs been more prominent than in the racing industry. Originally, it only applied to the animals. At the turf club, particularly under my chairmanship, we took a very strong position in regard to the taking of narcotic type drugs-so-called recreational drugs, a label that I do not agree with by jockeys, track riders and other persons in the industry. An interesting aspect of the horseracing industry is that everybody is licensed, right down to the stablehand. As such, a simple punishment is to withdraw that licence. Of course, the consequence is that it takes away that person’s living. It is a very dramatic punishment. You can imagine a top jockey who, being delicensed for three or six months, might miss out on riding the Melbourne Cup winner, where five per cent of a couple of million dollars is a reasonable fee for the amount of time spent on the horse’s back. When the first person so charged came forward-and it was for the use of marijuana-he was quite put out. He said, ‘I had my last puff on Wednesday. You tested me on Saturday, and I was clearly no danger on the back of the horse.’ Our response to that was to say, ‘You are an elite athlete. You are surrounded by young apprentices and others wishing to learn the trade of horse riding. It is a lousy example to set and you had better stop it.’ That process continued, and all of sudden our stewards started turning up at track work in the morning and asking certain licensed personnel to submit a sample. That really put the cat amongst the pigeons until the industry woke up to the fact that it was not smart to do it. I make that point, because I have been enraged for a long time, considering the processes of the Australian Football League, the AFL: three strikes and you are out. Again, if one goes back to racing parlance, the odds of catching someone three times, considering it is a random testing process, are extremely wide, and, in my mind, it was an incentive to take a couple of risks in the hope that you did not get caught. That, of course, achieved high farce when I discovered that a 17-year-old draft pick could have a positive test to one of these drugs and such were the rules of the AFL that their parents could not be involved in the circumstances. You just cannot believe that, under the pressure of the players’ association, any organisation could accommodate those arrangements. One of the situations that I want to bring to the attention of the House is that when one talks of performance-enhancing drugs there is a supposition that it will be some sort of steroid, blood-doping product et cetera. I suggest that, as one who back in 1976 had a very severe car accident that pulled one of his feet off, I do not run very well anymore. Maybe that is why I never run away! But the fact of life is that I have incessant pain in one of my ankles, and that stops me running. It is still accepted in human sport-not horse racing-that painkillers are an MAIN COMMITTEE acceptable treatment. I well remember that on his retirement one of Australia’s better fast bowlers, Bruce Reid, commented that he had to give up the painkillers he was taking because they were sending him dizzy. One of the retired women’s champions who came back to the sport more recently gave as a reason for retirement at the time that the type of painkiller she was taking to address whatever physical injury she was suffering was affecting her health. But you read in the paper that so-and-so is being given painkilling injections so he can run out on the football ground today. There is a tragedy behind that. Of course that has enhanced that player’s performance; but, more particularly, you are masking the pain signals that say, ‘Give your leg a rest,’ ‘Give your back a rest,’ or, ‘Give your arm a rest.’ That is what pain is all about. Imagine Bart Cummings stepping out one of his Melbourne Cup fancies on the day. Imagine if it were limping in the morning and he said to a journalist, ‘Don’t you worry; we’ll give it a painkilling injection before the race and it’ll go all right.’ There is the example of the death of Damien Oliver’s brother-yet to be resolved in the courts. It was killed and it killed the jockey in the process. In a trial the young horse he was riding showed positive; it was running with sore legs which had been masked by a fairly common treatment known as Butazolidin, and of course that young horse did not know to give its leg a rest and it broke. It rolled over and it killed the jockey, Damien Oliver’s brother. Those sorts of matters are taken so seriously with animals but not so seriously with human beings. ASADA and the World Anti-Doping Code have no rules about performance-enhancing drugs. I note some tennis player picked up for taking the so-called recreational drug cocaine. I hear on the radio of research recently done in Holland by a woman who looked into the production of legal cocaine during the First World War. There was massive growth in production, which she suggested was because the troops were getting it. I quote that as published research-I do not want it to be attributed to me-but this raises the question of aggression: were the generals of that period, who I thought were murderers, feeding the troops this sort of treatment through a cup of rum or something like that if it gave them the courage and the stupidity to run out in front of machine guns and be mowed down? But, again, that then takes us to the step in the recreational area of the violence that is now so commonplace and that is frequently blamed on alcohol. I think there is a link between the two, and it is doubly worse. I am totally convinced. In my previous life I was a hotel keeper for about 30 years, and as recreational drugs, as they are known, came to be part of people’s needs to have a good time. I never could work out why they needed it, but they did-I noticed an increase in violence. More particularly, as one who had to maintain order in his premises, I found that I was dealing with an entirely different type of person in a number of ways: there were people who could not be convinced to behave themselves and who were inclined to very violent acts. I was in the industry for 30 years and in 28 of those years I never saw anybody kick anyone lying on the ground, and yet that is a common factor and it is related to fatalities-but that is extending the debate somewhat. This particular legislation gives me the opportunity to draw the attention of the House to a tennis player who has tested positive to cocaine and is doing time. He is banned from the sport for a given period notwithstanding that cocaine can be performance enhancing. All the original doping of racehorses was done with heroin and my old-time mentors reckoned the horses went pretty well on that. Elephant juice, which resulted in the tragedy of the horse that MAIN COMMITTEE nearly died at the end of the Perth Cup, is only super-refined heroin and is so strong that if you want to give it to a horse you pull 10 millilitres into a syringe, squirt it all back and then pull in 10 millilitres of water, and the residual drug in the needle and around the edges of the syringe is sufficient to dope a horse and for it to run two miles when it is dead on its feet after a mile because it has no pain signals. The point that I want to make is that while the tennis player got time for cocaine the AFL thinks it is okay unless you get caught three times. That is just outrageous and should never have been the case. To the credit of other sports like rugby, I do not think the ‘three strikes before you’re out’ rule applies, and nor should it. Human trainers, the football coaches and others, have become a little more responsible about resting players who have suffered injury. I can well remember reading years ago about a coach who said that when you go out on the football field you have to take a bit of pain. But, as I said, pain is a warning. Pain tells you to give yourself a rest. Pain is exhaustion and exhaustion is pain. Lactic acid suddenly discharging into the muscles of a horse or, I assume, a human being indicates that you had better give yourself a rest. Yet one of the most interesting doping techniques of recent times-particularly in the horse industry, and you wonder about others-involves bicarbonate of soda. We now have a testing regime for it, and it is very difficult because under a certain figure it occurs naturally in the animal. If you can get enough bicarb of soda into a horse within an hour of him racing, he will feel no pain because the bicarb of soda dilutes the lactic acid discharge. But the question is whether you should you do that to an animal and whether you should do that to a human. All of these issues, if the ASADA people bother to read my speech, are issues to be addressed. It is wrong to give painkilling injections to an athlete and to be able to do so publicly. That was the case with Reid and with this tennis player. Reid said he was getting too dizzy and that he could not take any more of the stuff because his bowling arm had become so painful. That should not be, and I hope that at some stage ASADA and the World Anti-Doping Code recognise that painkillers of any format are as much a performance-enhancing drug as some steroids. In fact, if I were taking a practical view I would say that at some stage a person wishing to recover from an injury might think that they could enhance their repair with some steroid assistance that passed from their system, to their benefit, but that of course is a no-no. I wonder in practical terms whether a healing process is as unfair as a pain-masking process that can be applied on the day of the race-for humans but not for racehorses, dogs or other animals. In both cases I think it is really of grave concern and it is a huge gap in the entire process of assessing athletes so that they meet one another on the same level playing field. There just seems to be a thought that humans can run with pain masking of that nature. Most of these drugs are narcotic. Any of the usual injections you get to kill pain will have a narcotic base, and it is not good stuff. The legislation is welcome. It creates a new administrative regime which will hopefully be proven, in time, as effective. But, if there is any weakening of the virtually zero tolerance system that should apply, it will not be successful. When someone is consuming drugs for whatever purpose I am not sure that they are entitled to privacy protection. It is said that ASADA wanted to look at Medicare records and find out what drugs people purchase, and that was considered a bridge too far. Getting further from the issue, a pharmacist well known to me and residing in my electorate said to me the other day that, when it comes to the recording of drug MAIN COMMITTEE sales, if you need a particular antibiotic or other drug that is extremely expensive to Medicare the doctor has to ring up and get approval to prescribe it. But, if you are out prescriptionshopping to get some of the somewhat lesser drugs that can be converted into quite serious recreational drugs, the doctors do not have to report that. This pharmacist thinks that is just dopey. Outside of the ASADA issue, governments are worried about the cost of drugs and therefore make them reportable. But the kinds of drugs that people can go from doctor to doctor and get a prescription for are dangerous and can be turned into very dangerous products, yet there is no reporting process. A doctor has no responsibility to ring up as he issues a prescription, thereby creating a database that would say, ‘This person’s got five prescriptions today.’ The pharmacist gave me not only an example of that but an example of something that resulted in a fatality. So this is a chance to put that on the record. The advisers here might want to ring up and ask Medicare or the health commission why it is that doctors do not have to report those sorts of prescriptions, when as soon as the cost goes beyond a certain degree in terms of other medications they are obliged to do so. Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2009. I listened to the member for O’Connor, who has just finished speaking, and he made a number of very constructive comments in his contribution to this debate. I speak on this matter as someone who has undergone sports drug testing on several occasions. I am familiar with the process, the procedures and the obligations of the various authorities that carry out those tests. The intent of this bill is to restructure the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and, in doing so, create three separate functions in its the structure: firstly, a new chief executive officer role to fill the head of agency role in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act; secondly, a new independent anti-doping rule violation panel to make decisions on anti-doping rule violations; and, thirdly, an advisory group as a consultative forum for the CEO. The new structure should make the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority a much more effective organisation and better equip it to deal with the emerging challenges ahead. Since drug testing was first introduced into the Olympic Games in 1968, and in Australia in the early 1980s, the challenges faced by anti-doping agencies around the world have become far more complex than previously and they will continue to increase in complexity. For sports administrators and anti-doping authorities, the prevention of drug use by athletes poses a far more difficult task than that faced by many other law enforcement agencies. In support of that statement, I point to the following facts. Firstly, sports supremacy attracts huge sums of money, often in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Secondly, sports performance is associated with international supremacy amongst nations. One has only to look at the huge sums of money invested in preparation for Olympic athletes by some nations to understand the importance placed on sports performance by national governments around the world. Thirdly, national governments have been accused, from time to time, of being complicit in the administration of, and perhaps even in developing, the drugs administered to athletes. Fourthly, the science behind sports drugs is changing frequently. The ability of antidoping authorities to keep up with the latest science presents them with an incredibly difficult task. MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Asada I Believe Asada Has Operated Well In Terms Of The Functions It Has Carried Out But
204,Mr Zappia (Makin) (5.58 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the AustralianThe black market sports performance enhancement drug industry is today estimated to be worth billions of dollars. When one combines the value of the sports drugs black market with the sports contracts, and the entertainment contracts and commercial value of the sporting sector, one begins to understand the power of the drivers and the magnitude of the obstacles faced by anti-doping agencies. Let me make it absolutely clear: sports drug use is not limited to Olympic or Commonwealth Games athletes. I noted the comments by the member for O’Connor a moment ago when he was reflecting on the violence that he sees today, as compared with many years ago-I think he made reference to kicking someone when they were down on the ground. One of the side-effects that I am well aware of for one of the drugs often taken by athletes-and people who work in the security industry, who quite often, are the very people who secure hotels-causes extremely violent behaviour. It is not unusual to see the kind of activity that the member for O’Connor was referring to, not only because the person involved in the brawl is either intoxicated or on drugs, but also because the people who are supposedly expected to provide security are themselves taking different kinds of drugs. They do so because they need to in order to secure their employment. They need to in order to maintain the size that will give them the opportunity to gain employment in that particular industry. Sports drug use, as I said, is not limited to Olympic or Commonwealth Games athletes at all. Whatever one looks to, the goal to win or to entertain drives some athletes to turn to drugs. I will explain what I mean by ‘entertain’. We had the comment earlier on about footballers or tennis players, but we also have professional wrestling as a good example, where predominantly the objective of whatever these athletes are doing is to entertain. The ability of these people to be entertainers is dependent on their athletic ability. Their athletic ability often drives them to turn to drugs in order to be able to perform at the level required, which in turn, provides them with the entertainment opportunity and the income that goes with it. Sometimes the athlete is driven by the desire to win and other times by the desire to just remain competitive. At times, because performance is a sport star’s livelihood and the athlete fears being unable to continue to compete professionally, they turn to performance-enhancing drugs. Again, I am well aware of individual athletes who have done that because without drugs they are unlikely to be able to compete at the level that provides them with their income. At times it is even driven by governments who demand results from the investments that they have made in their athletes. I think all of us in this chamber would be aware of some of the accusations that have been made in respect of the way different countries prepare their athletes for major international events. I will leave everyone to draw their own conclusions from those accusations, but it seems to me that if there were a worldwide consistent, uniform attempt to stamp out performance-enhancing drugs, we probably would not have seen some of the events that we have seen in the past with athletes subsequently being proven to have taken performance-enhancing drugs. With the pressures of having to compete and the huge sums of money that are at stake, avoiding drug use detection has itself become an industry. Masking drugs and other detection avoidance practices have become common practices. In discussing this matter we generally focus on the need to ensure a level playing field for athletes and sport participants and there is no question that it is a critical objective. Any competitor who has an unnatural advantage beMAIN COMMITTEE cause of the use of performance-enhancing drugs is not competing fairly, and it defeats the spirit of the contest. But it goes much further than that, because competing with an unfair advantage deprives other competitors of the opportunities that come with winning. These are opportunities that may be the culmination of a lifetime of devotion, sacrifice and sheer hard work, the very qualities that should be rewarded in sports performance. These are opportunities which sometimes come only once in a lifetime, when an athlete’s performance peaks. I will explain that particular point. We often talk about sports performance in parliament, and I noted that it was raised recently when we were talking about a citizenship bill and the ability to compete in the Olympic Games which come around once every four years. For some athletes their ability to peak will only happen once in their lifetime and they need to try to ensure that that coincides, if they are wanting to compete in the Olympic Games, with when the games are held. If they are denied the opportunity to win because someone has been taking drugs, they are denied the opportunity to achieve a whole lifetime of ambition, which might have started when they were children, and they have committed their whole life to performing at that level. But with it also comes the denial of the opportunities that subsequently come from having been an Olympic gold medallist and so on. It is not just a case of people winning because they have taken drugs. The athlete who has not taken drugs has been denied so much. That is why it is so unfair and why we should do whatever we can to ensure that when athletes do compete they compete fairly and not with the assistance of performance-enhancing drugs. There are other matters that concern me about this particular issue. To begin with, most of the sports performance-enhancing drugs that are bought are bought illegally on the black market. They are sold not by medical or pharmaceutical professionals but by drug pushers, mostly-maybe not in all cases-with limited medical knowledge or no medical knowledge at all. They have little understanding of the long-term medical effects, little understanding of the immediate side effects and little understanding of the risks associated with the drugs. There can be serious risks if the athlete has a known medical condition or is on other prescribed drugs. Under normal circumstances, a medical professional prescribes the drugs the person has taken and takes precautions before prescribing other drugs at any time. In other words, they look at what drugs a person is on before they prescribe another drug. I am talking here not about sports-performance-enhancing drugs but about any form of drugs. They ensure that there is not going to be a contraindication as a result of other drugs being taken by the patient. When it comes to the sellers of sports-performance-enhancing drugs-I am referring to those that are being sold on the black market-the chances are that no such precautions are taken, placing the athletes at real risk. The risks are high and, in fact, can be devastating, including loss of life. The second matter I raise with respect to the supply of sports-performance-enhancing drugs is this: not only are the drugs often prescribed and supplied by nonprofessionals but the quality of the drugs provided may be below standard. I refer to drugs which, I understand, are made by rogue pharmaceutical manufacturers or to out-of-date drugs sold by illegal distributors rather than being properly disposed of. As if that were not bad enough, I understand that there are also black market sellers who have supplied veterinary-grade drugs to athletes. MAIN COMMITTEE I have seen lives destroyed because of the physical and psychological side effects of performance-enhancing drugs. Equally distressing to those people was that the use of those very drugs never, ever resulted in any worthwhile or rewarding personal achievement. The drugs were sold to them on the premise ‘These drugs will achieve super wonders for you,’ and they never, ever got there, yet they had to endure the health risks that went with the drugs for no valuable gain whatsoever. Sports-performance-enhancing drugs are not only taken by elite sportspeople. I believe that there is widespread use of them right across different sectors of the community, including, as I said a moment ago, perhaps in the security industry around Australia. The third matter I raise with respect to sports drugs is that the testing regime itself, while vastly improved since the 1980s, still has limitations in that it does not detect all drugs or drugs that are not registered or even known. There is no easy response with regard to the prevention of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly when spectator numbers are driven by the desire to witness record-breaking performances. The organisers know that, the sponsors know that and the authorities know that. The temptation to turn a blind eye to drugs is huge. The last matter I will raise about the prevention of drugs in sport is the cost associated with the drug testing itself. Most sporting organisations engage the federal government through club or organisation. The costs are quite high, and therefore sporting organisations are limited in the number of tests they can carry out. Clearly, if we could find a cheaper way of carrying out the tests, it would make it possible for organisations to carry out more tests, which would make it a little easier for them to stamp out drug taking within the sports. There is a lot more I could say on this issue. I realise that my time is running out and that we are trying to get this matter concluded today. I will close by saying this: it will be extremely difficult to prevent the use of sports-performance-enhancing drugs through any form of regulation or procedure that we engage in. However, it is important that we do whatever we can to try and stamp them out, for a whole range of very good reasons. This particular bill, I believe, provides us with a much improved process and authority to do that. I believe that it will add to the work we are doing and to our ability to stamp out drug taking. For those reasons I support it, but I still believe we have a long way to go. Authority Amendment Bill 2009. In primary school, secondary school and even in the ArmyI liked to play football. As people would often remind me, I was limited by only a few things: ability, coordination and skill. SoI found my way into the sport of rowing, at 11 years old, back in 1975. I was involved in the sport for some 27 years, until 2002. I competed competitively in almost all states around the country, and in other places, with time in the Army. I was also fortunate enough to win a couple of Australian championships, having represented the sport at state level three times and once at the under-23 Australian level. By ‘represent’ I mean that I pretty much made it to the top level of the state in 1985 and to the under-23 Australian level in 1984. I was at my competitive peak in the mid-eighties, and I have no recollection whatsoever of any antidoping testing in rowing at that time. Maybe it was just that I was never selected. Maybe people looked at my performance and realised that there was no way drugs could possibly be enhancing that sort of performance. In any case, I have no recollecMAIN COMMITTEE",190,Asada I Believe Asada Has Operated Well In Terms Of The Functions It Has Carried Out But
205,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (6.14 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Dopingtion of it. It was probably in the 1990s, when I was studying for a level 2 coaching qualification, that I developed some knowledge of testing for performance-enhancing drugs. Drug cheating in sports probably came to the notice of Australians in 1988 when, at the Seoul Olympics, the infamous Ben Johnson cheating incident took place, when he won the 100-metre gold medal only to be stripped of it later following a drug test. Since 1988 we have heard many reports of a constant string of drug cheats from around the world, particularly in sports such as bike riding, weightlifting, swimming and at a high-profile athletics event recently, with the public disgrace of the now infamous United States multiple gold medallist Marion Jones. Australians would also have seen interviews with famous Australian sports men and women in which they have made allegations about athletes of other nations being involved in drugs and the advantages that our opponents have achieved as a result of cheating with those performance-enhancing drugs. I do not wish to dwell too much on this specific matter, but I would like to emphasise the importance of deterrence as the main objective because, while detection after the fact is vital, at the elite level the awarding of gold medals at international events, such as the Olympic Games, is pretty much the pinnacle for an athlete. Athletes desperately want to cross the finish line first and stand on the podium, receiving the accolade as best of the best. If a winner is later disqualified and the medal is given to the clean winner, the moment of the race and the stand on the podium can never be replicated. That is the reason why deterrence and the elimination of drug cheats before the event is important to those who would otherwise have won. Following on from the problems in the late 1980s, in 1990 the Australian Sports Drug Agency was established as a result of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act, with a mission to deter the use of banned doping practices in sport. At that time, ASDA undertook education, testing and advocacy services and coordinated the Australian antidoping program. ASDA’s programs were directed at athletes, coaches, sports science and medical personnel, and sports administrators. I recall having some knowledge of this when I was undertaking my level 2 coaching course for rowing in Canberra in 1998. As part of a course at the Australian Institute of Sport we had a session with ASDA, as it was at that time. We were given an explanation of how performance-enhancing drugs worked, and of course the health risks involved, as well as an explanation of the way the testing of athletes was actually carried out. On 23 June 2005, the coalition government announced a decision to add additional functions to those undertaken by ASDA and rename it, thereby establishing the new and independent anti-doping body Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, or ASADA, to commence operations in 2006. Beyond the duties previously undertaken by ASDA, ASADA would be able to investigate doping allegations and present cases at hearings. In addition to the existing budget allocation for ASDA, ASADA received an additional appropriation of $1.298 million in 2005-06 and an additional $4.571 million over the following three years. With regard to drugs in sport, I think we can say that predominantly Australia can lay claim to a good record and is relatively clean in this area. In the last financial year ASADA conducted 2,158 out-of-competition and 2,084 in-competition government funded tests. Another 2,395 tests were undertaken on a user-pays arrangement comprising AFL, NRL, rugby union, A league and Cricket Australia athletes. In 2007-08, 64 cases were managed by ASADA, 39 involving a sanction, of which, 18 admitted a violation. It is therefore clear that there is a problem and that vigilance must be maintained. However, I would to say that there are fine MAIN COMMITTEE lines to be drawn on some of these matters. We know professional athletes take supplements and tablets, and they get injections. Hopefully they do these things in the belief that what they take is not illegal. In researching this speech I looked at the case of the triathlete Rebekah Keat who tested positive to a drug test in 2004 following the Western Australian Ironman event. She was suspended for two years and has returned to competition, but has fought to clear her professional name and restore her reputation. Rebekah Keat was able to prove that a supplement, Endurolyte, was contaminated with the steroid precursor norandrostenedione. I understand that the fight to clear her name cost Rebekah Keat a lot of money and I commend her on her determination, although given her background in a most arduous sport it is little surprise that she fought hard. That is not to say that we do not have real cases of Australians who have cheated by using performance enhancing drugs thereby justifying the need for having ASADA. Werner Reiterer, a field athlete, admitted to taking drugs before the Sydney Olympics and said that officials turned a blind eye to it. He was rightly taken to task for refusing to name names, thereby contributing to ongoing problems in the sport. In 2004, there was the case of Australian weightlifter Caroline Pileggi who received a mandatory two-year ban for refusing a drug test. Following legal action culminating in a failed Federal Court appeal, she had the two-year ban upheld. As I understand it, the member for Isaacs was the unsuccessful QC in that matter. No doubt he would have some interesting views regarding this legislation. There have been other cases and the facts demonstrate that, sadly, Australia is not completely clean, although I would always say that we are among the best for clean sport and with our athletes. Nevertheless the record does show that we have an ongoing need to have strong and effective deterrents and mechanisms to lead the fight against drugs in Australian sport. In closing, no-one should ever be able to gain a competitive advantage in sport through illegal methods. This bill will aid in clarifying the roles and responsibilities within ASADA, as well as streamlining its processes. The need to adapt to changing circumstances has been demonstrated in regard to drugs in sports. The need for ASADA to adapt has also been recognised. I support this bill to improve its capabilities, and maintain and improve the standing of Australian sport in the world. Authority Amendment Bill 2009 and also to support the comments made by the Minister in her second reading speech when she said: I think all of us would agree that doping and drug cheats have no place in sport. The Australian government is committed to the fight against doping-and is determined to ensure that performance enhancing drugs are detected, dealt with and deterred at every possible opportunity. In a sports loving country like Australia a strong anti-doping system is essential to protect the integrity of our sporting competitions and also protect our athletes from the potentially harmful health effects of using prohibited substances and methods. … This bill amends the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006, ASADA Act, to keep the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, ASADA, Australia’s peak anti-doping in sports agency, at the forefront of global and local efforts to stamp out drug cheats. Specifically, the bill reflects the need for new structural and governance arrangements to ensure the efficiency of ASADA antidoping programs today as well as into the future.

206,Mr Hale (Solomon) (6.23 Pm),"I rise in support of the Australian Sports Anti-Dopingis a key implementation agency for Australia’s antidoping efforts, supporting the Australian government in coordinating and harmonising antidoping initiatives with states and territories and of course with our national sporting organisations at the core of antidoping methods in this country. ASADA’s responsibilities include detecting drug cheats and discouraging drug use through education programs, testing, investigations and enforcement. As a former elite football coach at the under-18 level, I knew that the challenges were there then in order to educate our young athletes who were trying to get to the AFL about performance-enhancing drugs. However, this issue is also one of recreational drug use in regard to the challenges, and I think that our country has an attitude towards recreational drug use that needs to be addressed and addressed quickly. I think that far too often we are seeing high-profile athletes as well as high-profile people come out and say that throughout their careers or throughout their life they have used recreational drugs. I think our whole culture around the recreational drug issue and the fact that some people still think that it is all right to be doing it rubs off on how young people think when it comes to performance-enhancing drugs. I touch on what the member for Cowan alluded to. For me it was Ben Johnson and the fact that as an 18-year-old watching the Seoul Olympics and very much enthralled with athletics I felt absolutely gutted the next day when I saw that this race, 9.93 seconds for the 100 metres, had been drug affected. I think we were all in awe of this athlete from Canada, but he did not quite look right, I must admit. He had a fairly big solid body and a tiny head, but he certainly ran. The next day when it came out that he was a drug cheat and had been found guilty of using anabolic steroids I think the world was in shock at how this had happened. Ms Marino-And disappointed. career and her life cut short through anabolic steroid use. We certainly saw the demise of Marion Jones in more recent times. I once read a survey where they spoke to Olympic athletes. The member for Makin touched on this, that they get a very small window to do the best they can. Once every four years they get to run in the Olympics and they get the world championships two years in between. There is a lot of training and a lot of effort goes in for that very small window. They once surveyed Olympic athletes and over 80 per cent said that they would take an anabolic steroid that could cost them their life if it was the difference between winning and not winning a gold medal. To me that is just an amazing statistic, to think that so many would risk their life to do it. Think of all the great sportspeople we have had in the last century, the Dawn Frasers, the Herb Elliotts, the Betty Cuthberts and those types of athletes in that, I suppose, golden era of athletics. They were household names and fantastic athletes. They were not full-time professionals, they did not get paid anywhere near the amount of money they get paid today. They had to be amateurs to compete in the Olympics and compete in the Commonwealth Games. But they were raw athletes who could ply their trade without any sort of enhancement. The fact of the matter was that those athletes won just through sheer hard work. I find that it is totally unacceptable that athletes can use drugs in order to skip past hard work. Recently in Darwin we had the natural body-building contests. Ronnie Coleman is the seven-time Mr Olympia, I think, and I think a bit of enhancement has gone into Ronnie’s biceps; I have got no doubt about that. Certainly the natural body-building competition was there for all to see. MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Asada To Carry Out The Drug Testing On Their Behalf The Cost Of The Testing Is Borne By The
207,Mr Hale,"And disappointed. After that we saw Florence Griffith Joyner, who also had aIt sends a very ordinary message, I think, that you can have a natural body-building contest and an unnatural body-building contest. The evolution of athletes in America, who are constantly being caught with performanceenhancing drugs, especially in professional football and baseball, is a blight on sport globally. The problem is that these people have massive profiles, they are paid an enormous amount of money-as the member for Makin touched on-and they are put up on a pedestal for young people to aspire to. And it is not only at the elite level. I am sure that among the secondand third-tier athletes, who are trying to get that extra edge in order to capture their full potential and become full-time professionals, drug use would be absolutely rife. There are no protections for those athletes and there is very limited testing of those athletes. There is a lot of hearsay and innuendo about who is taking drugs and who is involved in performanceenhancing drug activities, yet there is no testing and there are no protections in place. It is not until they get to the highest level that they are caught out, or, by that stage, they may have decided to go clean and not use drugs. However, the damage to their bodies has already been done; and maybe, when using drugs in order to get to the next level, they have beaten athletes who are doing the right thing-only to fail when they get there because they are not able to use the drugs they have used in the past. The first change in this bill is that ASADA will be headed solely by a CEO, who will be responsible for operational and strategic matters. Secondly, under the proposed new arrangements, the current ASADA members structure will be replaced with a new model to ensure that the functions previously undertaken by ASADA members continue-for example, decisions on anti-doping rule violations. Thirdly, this bill will establish an advisory group that will primarily be a consultative forum for the CEO on matters such as education, testing and investigations and provide advice to assist in the development, implementation and continuous improvement of the delivery of ASADA’s core business. The advisory group will consist of a chair and a small group of members comprising individuals with relevant skills in areas such as education, stakeholder services, sports medicine, sports law, ethics and investigations. It is really important that this group works closely with all sports. I really believe that Australian sport is the cleanest. That is through the efforts of ASADA, but it is also about education. There is no silver bullet to address this issue. I think the education of young athletes is paramount because it is when they are 10, 11 or 12 years old that they set their own standards, their own agenda and their own ideas about what is fair and what is best for them. As a coach of elite athletes during my time with the AFL, I found that what you teach the kids at that stage of their lives they carry right through their career. I am currently training with a friend of mine, Duncan MacGillivray, whom I coached when he was 15 years old. He went on to play for six years at Penrith, two years at South Sydney Rabbitohs and four years at Wakefield Trinity. He had a 12-year professional rugby league career and he has just moved back to Darwin. I am hanging out with him and doing some training and some weights. He was a second rower but did not carry a lot of weight. As a medium-sized player who played in a tough position, he said there was enormous pressure on him to use performanceenhancing drugs in order to put weight on. I thank God that he did not. He is a healthy specimen. He played for 12 years on his natural ability. He is certainly a role model for all the young players of the future in Darwin. They do not need to go down that track. Duncan MacGillivray was a lightweight footballer with a lot of determination, a lot of heart and a very MAIN COMMITTEE good work ethic. He was able to edge out a career with the body structure he inherited when he was born. The bill also introduces changes to the mechanism by which the National Anti-Doping Scheme will be amended in the future. Currently, ASADA can amend the National AntiDoping Scheme through a disallowable legislative instrument. It is a very important bill. I fully support the minister on this issue. I think it is paramount that as a society, and certainly in our sporting community, we continue to have an anti-drugs approach and a zero-tolerance attitude towards enhancing performance through the use of drugs. I commend all the speakers who have spoken on this bill-especially the member for Cowan and the member for Makin, who have had personal experience in their own sports. The member for Cowan’s career has involved body-building and those types of activities, and he has an enormous amount of knowledge on this subject. It will be a difficult process to continue to be vigilant in this area. I know that some countries around the world certainly do not have our vigilance and our zero-tolerance attitude. As a coach, I never wanted to put any of my athletes in a dangerous position and I never wanted them to suffer the long-term effects of decisions that I made as a coach, or decisions that our strength and conditioning coaches may have made on their behalf. I think we really have a duty of care. As a coach, you have got an enormous amount of responsibility, and when the final siren goes you want to make sure that everyone who has been in your care is not worse off because of it. When it comes down to preparing your athletes, there is no room in sport at all to enhance their preparation through the use of substances. It is not only cheating and making it an unfair playing field for all participants, but very often it is putting the life of your athletes at risk. I do not think it is an acceptable position. I commend ASADA and I also commend the sporting organisations right across Australia that have got accreditation through their coaching programs. With my accreditation in the last 10 to 15 years as a level 2 rugby league coach, as well as a level 3 Aussie Rules coach, I think Australia is at the forefront of accreditation of our coaches. It is a holistic approach, not just teaching the skills of the game but also teaching the safety aspects of the game and educating young people about the dangers of not only social drugs but also anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs. As I said, it will be an ongoing battle. Australia has absolutely led the world with our stance on performance-enhancing drugs. I am happy to have spoken today in support of the minister. I think this is a really good bill. It is non-controversial. I know from the comments and contributions made that it is supported by those opposite. Very rarely do I agree with what the member for O’Connor says in this place, but, in his absence, I thought he made a very worthy contribution, and one that I support, on pain-killing injections. As a coach, that is a duty of care issue that you have for your athletes. with standing order 192.

I also seek leave to present this in-order petition of 442 names under the name of principal petitioner Maureen Grierson. Leave granted. The petition read as followsTo the honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives This petition of the citizens of Western Australia Draws to the attention of the House: Concerns over the recent 50% Budget cut to the Medicare Cataract Surgery Rebate, which is now down from $623 to $311. This will result in additional costs to patients and may therefore mean that some are forced to delay or abandon surgery. We therefore ask the House to: Immediately reinstate the required funding that is desperately needed to continue the Federal Government’s Medicare Cataract Surgery Rebate. from 442 citizens Petition received. the people of Perth have for this issue, because it is an issue that affects real people, the people whose names appear on the petition. This decision has a human cost and an outcome where those who can least afford to pay extra will be forced to pay extra or they will be forced to endure delays to surgery. This is about a reduction to the rebate that will seriously impact upon the 70 per cent of operations that are undertaken in the private system and the 30 per cent in the public system. The impact will fall on 120,000 to 140,000 Australians who need that surgery each year. The cost will be delays in access to surgery and greater cost for those in the public system, and it will undermine the current no-gap arrangements for private health insurance products. With any reduction in cataract surgery access by distance or cost there comes a downstream cost of risk to health for those who cannot get the surgery, in terms of falls, broken bones, depression and social exclusion. The government have made a mistake and they should do as my petitioners ask and restore the rebate to provide access for those who need it. Mr Paul Andrews pm)-On FridayI was deeply saddened by the news that Paul Andrews, the former state member for Southern River, had died after a long battle with kidney disease and cancer. Paul was born on 11 November 1955 in Bunbury, Western Australia, and was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2008.

He earned deep respect from both sides of politics for his fair and reasonable conduct while Acting Speaker and for his work on parliamentary committees. Paul believed that parliament was essential for maintaining a humane and civilised society and endeavoured to ensure that he and his colleagues behaved in a manner consistent with that.

The accident occurred near Macksville. The Pacific Highway runs the length of my electorate and most of that highway is undivided road. The people I represent are at risk every time they travel north or south in the electorate. We have local traffic mixing with heavy vehicles. It is a deadly combination. It is essential that governments redouble their efforts to complete the duplication of the highway as quickly as possible. There is a bipartisan support for the completion of this project as quickly as possible. The federal government has let the New South Wales government off the hook in only requiring a contribution of some $500 million up to 2014. This compares to a federal contribution of $3.1 billion. We should be demanding dollar-for-dollar funding from the New South Wales state government and increasing the federal contribution to the road project if it is to be completed within a realistic time frame. Every year the completion date is revised further out into the future. The people of the North Coast deserve better. Highway1 needs to be priority 1 at both the federal and state levels. Our towns need to be bypassed. We need to get the trucks out of our main streets on the North Coast of New South Wales. North Coast residents have been waiting far too long. The government needs to do better. Mr Paul Andrews Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (6.44 pm)-I want to join with my colleague the member for Brand and pay tribute to a former state Labor colleague, Paul Andrews. Paul passed away on Thursday night, 22 October, at the age of 54 after losing his battle with cancer. Paul was elected to the state seat of Southern River in February 2001. He held the seat until the 2008 state election. The state seat is encompassed within my federal seat of Hasluck and I worked with Paul over many years-many, many footpaths were pounded in doorknocking and many, many school graduations were attended together. Paul was well liked by his electorate. He, his office and staff were well respected for their hard work, advocacy and representation on behalf of his constituents. Paul was a teacher before entering the parliament and remained passionate about education in schools. He was delighted by the Rudd government’s education revolution. He was also a transplant recipient. He had two kidney transplants, one of which was from his wife Gim. Paul battled kidney disease for 20 years. He championed organ transplants in the parliament and in the community. Paul was a committed and loving family man. My deepest sympathy goes to Gim and their three kids, Lara, Rebecca and Peter.

212,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (6.42 Pm),"On 22 October there was yet another horrificNational School Chaplaincy Program continue funding the National Schools Chaplaincy Program. This initiative, which has been highly popular in my electorate and, I know, right across Australia, was started by the former coalition government to provide the staff and students of schools with Christian pastoral care. More than $1.6 million was provided to schools in my electorate of Maranoa in the last two years of the Howard government and in the first two years of the program. I was out in the western part of my electorate in the Diamantina shire about 12 months ago and I was saying to the local Aboriginal elder of a very remote community how wonderful it was that they had applied for some of the chaplaincy money and received it. She said to me, ‘Yes, Bruce, it is wonderful. We have to do this for the young ones.’ For me that says it all. Whether it is the Aboriginal elders in a community or whether it is the schools where 97 per cent of principals across Australia believe this is a positive program, I believe this is a program that must continue. It is one that requires the federal government’s financial support and I am calling on the Prime Minister to continue that support through funding for the chaplaincy service. The three-year program is about to run out and as we end this school year the schools need to know that next year they will have funding for this chaplaincy service. We have recently had a very successful Stock Up for Hope droving trek in my electorate. The community raised over $300,000 for that program, and I urge the government to put this program back as a priority. Makin Electorate: St David’s Catholic Church versary church service at St David’s Catholic Church in the Makin electorate. The service was led by Father George Ryan, who is presently one of the parish priests, along with Father Andrew Chen and Father Slawek Plonka, and administers at St David’s Church and at Our Lady of Hope Chapel at Greenwith, also located within the Makin electorate. St David’s Church was officially opened in 1969 by Archbishop Beovich and in 1977 St David’s Catholic School was subsequently established adjacent to the church. Over the years St David’s parish has been served by some 32 oblate priests and through their leadership the parish has grown and become an integral part of the north-east community of Adelaide. Today St David’s parish has grown further to include not only Our Lady of Hope Chapel School at Greenwith but also Gleeson Secondary College at Golden Grove and St Francis Xavier’s school at Wynn Vale. Through the church and school communities St David’s parish today is associated with extensive educational, humanitarian and spiritual services both locally and overseas. I particularly mention that amongst its humanitarian activities St David’s parish has taken a special interest in supporting orphaned children in China. I take this opportunity to collectively acknowledge and thank the many people who 40 years ago conceived and, with much hard work, built the St David’s parish church and in the years that followed all the people who over the past 40 years have contributed to its service to humanity, providing services which are needed today no less than they were 40 years ago as we face global challenges arising from climate change, political unrest in many nations and rising poverty associated with the global economic downturn.

Maggie, who is 78 years old, has a fantastic enthusiasm for life which is reflected in her scope of volunteering. Maggie is a founding member of the Positive Ageing Foundation and presently works four days a week as an unpaid volunteer. Over the past 13 years Maggie has volunteered as a tour guide at Perth Zoo and also at Rottnest Island, where Maggie supervised 10-kilometre walks. Maggie is a member of the Community Peer Education Council, which represents the interests of seniors, and is also a member of the Arthritis Foundation of WA. Somehow Maggie even finds time to give talks to seniors on a range of health issues such as depression. Maggie’s accomplishments send a positive message to seniors everywhere about how to keep active and enjoying life after 65. Maggie’s approach to life is ‘use it or lose it’-keep happy and healthy by remaining independent and active for as long as possible. I have met Maggie’s son Martin who owns a security business, and I am sure he and the rest of Maggie’s family are impressed by their mother’s achievements. My office spoke to Maggie last week to wish her luck ahead of the Burswood awards ceremony, and today I send my congratulations and those, I am sure, of federal parliament to Maggie.

Landcare has enjoyed bipartisan support and there are now more than 4,500 community Landcare groups in operation. To mark Landcare Week, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry distributed a media release to recognise the fact that more than 100,000 volunteers roll up their sleeves in communities each year to replant vegetation, repair erosion and improve agricultural production. There is no doubt that the minister knows in theory what Landcare does, but there is a great deal of concern throughout regional communities about whether the minister actually understands how Landcare facilitates this great work and the importance of Landcare groups to the fabric of regional communities and about whether Landcare will continue to prosper in the future. As much as members in this place lecture about the forecast impact of climate change, they should always remember the people who are on the ground actually getting their hands dirty to undertake the practical environmental work that helps to sustain our natural heritage. Our farmers are often vilified by those who have little understanding of the fact that it is the families on the land and in our regional towns who have adopted the Landcare message of sustainability and done the hard work that is required to enhance their properties and the natural environment, and it is with this in mind that I have moved the motion before the House. In recent months my office has been contacted by dozens of Landcare volunteers and paid staff members who believe this government has failed to understand the need to employ facilitators and coordinators, who play a pivotal role in managing the volunteer programs, assisting community groups, providing professional advice and mobilising volunteer effort.

222,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (6.55 Pm),"Just over a month ago Australia commemorateddeeply concerned by the correspondence that I have received and the meetings I have attended with my constituents. The Victorian Landcare Network shares my concerns about federal government cuts to funding for natural resource management under the Caring for our Country business plan. The network wrote to the minister in August this year, and in that letter secretary Kevin Spence said: We are concerned that, under the business plan, Landcare coordinator positions and facilitator positions will no longer be funded by the Australian government unless they are linked to priority projects. The letter went on to highlight that there were 142 Landcare support staff working on the ground to support Landcare groups in Victoria during 2007-08. According to the information that I have received from regional areas, that number is likely to fall to less than 35 before the end of this year. Already there have been a substantial number of cuts to these positions made across Gippsland, with many people being made redundant across my electorate. A senior catchment management authority executive in Victoria has also written to me and commented: Whilst the Caring for our Country business plan talks about the importance of Landcare and community capacity building, there is not one single dollar being allocated to the capacity, skills, knowledge and engagement targets. There is no doubt that facilitation of Landcare funded by the Australian government is dead and whilst this may not mean the total destruction of Landcare, it will dramatically reduce the number of groups and participants. It concerns me that those views are being expressed by people in such senior roles in the catchment management organisations in Victoria. Those concerns were also expressed by the Victorian Landcare Network. The letter from Mr Spence continued: The VLN considers that a loss of Landcare support staff will have a critical effect on maintaining the long-term participation and engagement of the community in natural resource management. Our concerns are mirrored by the Landcare community who question the rationale and economics of dissolving the goodwill, trust and experience built up over many years-knowledge and networks will inevitably erode. Without coordinators and facilitators providing that level of support and communication, many Landcare groups would lose initiative, greatly reducing the capacity to participate effectively in natural resource management. This is an issue, as I said at the outset, of significant concern right across the nation, particularly in my electorate of Gippsland. On 15 November there will be an East Gippsland community rally in protest at the cuts to Landcare funding. Residents will gather at the Orbost Snowy Rovers Football Club from 11 am to 3 pm. While it will be a community day with a free barbecue and fun for the family, it will be underpinned by a very serious message. The community is angry that this government is reducing its commitment to Landcare, and it is a story that is being played out on a national scale. The National Landcare Network distributed a media release on 7 July this year in which spokesman David Walker said that, of the $403 million in funding announced by the federal government, just $1.4 million, or 0.3 per cent, had gone to community Landcare. He went on to say: Landcare has a proven track record in producing best practice environmental outcomes and in growing and maintaining important social and community networks. The strength of landcare is its local focus and character. Ministers Burke and Garrett must ensure that grassroots landcare has a place within their Caring for our Country program. MAIN COMMITTEE Regional Australians are proud of their contribution to sustainable and environmental management through Landcare in the past 20 years. It is a remarkable organisation that must never be taken for granted by anyone in this place. Without ongoing funding to support the role played by the facilitators, the coordinators and the volunteers themselves, the Landcare organisation will become a shadow of its former self, and I doubt that we will be here in 20 years time commemorating the great achievements of the Landcare volunteers across our nation. Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.00 pm)-I rise to put it on record that the Rudd government is highly supportive of Landcare. This can be seen by funding commitments to the program through this parliament and through this government. Those on the other side of this House tend to be totally negative about any support given by the government to organisations such as Landcare. I am a long-term supporter of Landcare. Landcare plays a very important role in the electorate I represent in this parliament. The Shortland electorate is very environmentally sensitive. It is situated between the ocean and a series of lakes. In the electorate, and in the whole of Lake Macquarie for that matter, we have enormous and long standing commitments made by Landcare groups. In fact, I am so committed to Landcare that I am a member of the Lake Macquarie Landcare public funding management committee, which meets regularly to organise funding and support for Landcare groups throughout Lake Macquarie. I will share with you some of the fine work that is done by Landcare groups in the Shortland electorate. The first point is that the financial contribution made by volunteers through Landcare in the previous year came to about $3.6 million-that is in volunteer hours given by people. It is all about people taking pride in their community. It is all about people taking pride in the environment. Landcare plays a very important role, not only in bush areas but also in areas like the Shortland electorate. Landcare is fundamentally a grassroots volunteer movement supported by all three levels of government and the corporate sector in partnership with the community, to facilitate community stewardship of their own environment. So it is a whole-of-community grassroots organisation. Landcarers have a passion for seeing that our natural environment is managed so that it will be there for future generations to enjoy and to benefit from. Landcare volunteers are people from all walks of life. I recently had an afternoon tea for seniors in the Shortland electorate-and I am sure other members did a similar thing-where seniors were presented with certificates for their contributions to our community. At that particular ceremony there were a number of volunteers that worked with Landcare groups. Valentine Landcare group was represented, along with Galgabba Landcare group. Landcare has been classified into six different areas: wetland sites, riparian sites, coastal sites, rainforest sites, bushland sites and foreshore sites. That is the way we do it in Lake Macquarie. In the few moments that I have remaining, I want to run through for the benefit of the parliament some of the 260 quality Landcare groups in Lake Macquarie that are located within the Shortland electorate. There is the Belmont Wetlands group, the Black Ned’s Bay Rejuvenation group, the Jewells group, the Pelican Blacksmith group, the Salts Bay group, the Warners Bay group, the Redhead Bluff group, and the Floraville Gully Ridge and Rainforest group. I will make special reference to this group because it works in conjunction with the Floraville Public School and provides a wonderful learning environment for so many of the MAIN COMMITTEE young people who are associated with that school. It gives them the ability to be involved in the long-term care and appreciation of their environment and that is reflected in the fact that they have won the Sydney Morning Herald environmental award on a number of occasions. (Time expired) Shortland. While I appreciate her contribution I am afraid she is grossly out of touch with the sentiment that is flowing through Landcare organisations right throughout Australia. Indeed, I have spent much of the last 12 months visiting Landcare groups and natural resource management groups from Cape York throughout the rest of Australia and there is a degree of anger there that I do not believe I have ever seen before in such a large volunteer organisation. Indeed, Landcare is one of the greatest volunteer organisations in Australia, with the largest number of members, and people are walking away from it in droves. In July last year a decision was made by the Rudd government to rebadge the former coalition government’s Natural Heritage Trust and National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality programs and rebrand them as Caring for our Country. This was the first step in the government’s dismantling of grassroots conservation in this country. In just over 12 months the Caring for our Country program has virtually decimated the extremely successful conservation and resource management work that was undertaken through the Natural Heritage Trust program. It has also left natural resources management organisations in tatters and jeopardised the future of Landcare groups across Australia. The initial reworking of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality programs saw funding cut for catchment management bodies by 40 per cent and Landcare by 20 per cent. Over the past year the size of these cuts seems to have risen dramatically resulting in Landcare groups across Australia, particularly in regional New South Wales, facing an increasingly uncertain future. Last year has been disastrous for Australia’s grassroots environmental movement. Many Landcare groups have had their funding halved and are running on little more than the smell of an oily rag. What was once a remarkable example of nationwide grassroots conservationism is slowly being destroyed by a ballooning environmental bureaucracy. Moneys that were previously allocated for improvements in water quality, salinity management and biodiversity are now going to government agencies and staff who are managing these programs without having ever spent a day of their lives amongst the weeds on the riverbank or the cracked earth of a drought affected paddock. Indeed, this is a classic example of top-down, government-knowsbest bureaucracy. I believe the failures of the Caring for our Country program perfectly illustrate the hypocrisy of this government. When it suits him, the Prime Minister is more than happy to tell anyone who will listen that combating the threats posed by climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time. However, when the opportunity presents itself to do something practical to ensure the long-term productivity and sustainability of our natural environment the government do not want to know about it. While publicly masquerading as a green tinged party with an environmental conscience the government are privately destroying the grassroots community groups that form the backbone of conservation in this country. If the government were serious about combating climate change, the first thing they would be doing is MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Private Members Business
223,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (7.05 Pm),"I follow my friend and colleague the member forboosting funding to Landcare groups and giving expert local environmentalists certainty in their careers. It is telling that of the 1,300 applications that were lodged for natural resource management funding under the Caring for our Country program 1,243 were rejected. This was an incredible rejection rate and one that has disheartened Landcare groups across Australia. The fact that just 56 applications were approved-and in New South Wales not one single cent went west of the Blue Mountains-highlights the serious design flaws of the Caring for our Country program. These applications are not easily done. To have any chance of obtaining funding Landcare groups are required to navigate an exhausting 30-page application that asks groups to fill out their funding needs in intricate detail. Some groups have said the application has taken up to 200 hours to complete, often at great expense. One natural resource management group, for example, spent $80,000 putting together a professional submission for a Caring for our Country grant after being encouraged to apply by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. They were very optimistic after being assured by the department of the importance of the unique conservation work they were carrying out. They did not receive one cent. The changes forced upon Landcare groups through the Caring for our Country program are causing great angst among Landcare managers. One senior manager has told me that the federal government’s approach to investing in Landcare and biodiversity conservation is creating many tensions within the community, industry and project staff. Among the long list of concerns that have been raised by groups about the new process, the three that feature consistently are that it completely fails to support regional and remote land managers, that it stripped funding available to continue critical projects and that the process is leaving the dwindling number of natural resource management project staff with no job security due to the government’s insistence on month-on-month(Time expired) care groups around the country, particularly the work undertaken by Landcare groups within my seat of Corangamite. The geography of my seat is unique. We have a very famous coastline. We have the Great Ocean Road. We have the Surf Coast and the Bellarine Peninsula. We also have some famous Ramsar wetlands and very famous national parks, particularly the Great Otway National Park. It is as a consequence of that unique landscape that I have within my seat a particular passion for the work that Landcare undertakes and for that of its sister organisations such as Coastcare. I will say a little on the history of Landcare. Landcare was formally established under the Hawke Labor government, with then Minister John Kerin and the late Minister Peter Cook playing a very substantial role in establishing a national Landcare network. At that point, they planned to have by the year 2000 somewhere in the vicinity of 2,000 Landcare groups scattered across the length and breadth of our great nation. In fact, today we have more than 4,000 groups that have been established within Australia, and I think that is absolutely fantastic. Landcare plays an important role in the conservation of our land and the economic sustainability of, particularly, our farming communities. Three-quarters of Australia’s farmers are in one way or another engaged in Landcare in Australia. I certainly think Landcare would be unique on the world stage as an example of participation in a voluntary sense. MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Private Members Business
224,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (7.10 Pm),"TonightI rise to praise the work of LandThe Rudd Labor government is a very strong supporter of Landcare, particularly given that it was our great party, the Australian Labor Party, that established Landcare in a formal sense in the mid-1980s. The Rudd government is spending more than $2 billion on natural resource management in the first five years of our platform Caring for our Country, which is a very substantial contribution to our landscape and which I think will play a very significant role. The federal government is also spending $189 million on Landcare over the same period of time under that platform. The federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke, has announced $33.6 million over four years for a national network of Landcare facilitators to play that important role of organising and driving the work that Landcare needs to undertake throughout the nation. Ministers Garrett and Burke have also announced $5 million for small grants of up to $20,000 for community natural resource management groups such as Landcare, Coastcare and other groups. Corangamite, being a regional electorate, has many important Landcare initiatives being supported by local farmers in partnership with the Rudd Labor government. I think somewhere in the vicinity of $150,000 has been made available to the Otway Agroforestry Network, who work in a very productive way with Landcare. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Australian Food Labelling Standards Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Zappia: That the House: (1) notes the widespread calls from throughout the community to provide more clarity with respect to Australian food labelling standards; (2) acknowledges progress made to date in ensuring that Australian food labelling laws provide consumers with the relevant and clear information that they require to make informed product choices; (3) notes that Australian producers and consumers will benefit from clearer food labelling laws and that there are economic and health outcomes related to this matter; (4) acknowledges the importance of this matter to both Australian producers and consumers; and (5) notes and supports the review being undertaken by the Australian and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council and asks the Minister for Health and Ageing to consider any options available to speed up the review process. debate and public disquiet for some years, including in recent years strong commentary from the Productivity Commission. Put simply, Australian consumers have a right to know where the products they purchase come from and what is in them. In other words, people want clear, easy to read and easy to understand labelling laws. That is even more the case in relation to food products, where the current labelling laws are anything but clear. I accept that this is a complex issue, given the range of matters that labels are expected to provide information about, including nutritional information, use-by dates, health warnings, trans-fatty acid content, allergen information, daily intake guides, and the source country of products or ingredients. However, I believe we can do better and the Australian people I speak to expect more clarity. MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Private Members Business

226,Mr Zappia (Makin) (7.15 Pm),"This is a matter that has been the subject of much publicAt present we have a situation where, at federal level, both the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the minister for health have an interest in different aspects of food importation but where the responsibility for regulation and enforcement of the standard falls to the states. To further complicate the onus of responsibility, the Australian Made logo and the similar trademarks used are administered by a non-government organisation. But the confusion does not stop there. For consumers, terms such as ‘product of Australia’, ‘Australian made’, and ‘Australian grown’ all have a level of haziness or ambiguity about their meaning. Australian branding of products has significant market appeal, a fact well understood by product manufacturers and so, not surprisingly, there is considerable resistance to providing clarity as to product labelling by some sectors of the community. On the significance of the Australian-made brand, if I may refer to it in that context, I note that last year, at a time of global economic recession, some 79 per cent of our food exporters-people who were exporting Australian-made products-either still experienced an increase in their sales or at least maintained sales equivalent to those of the previous year. That says a lot about Australian products at a time when the market has constricted and that certainly highlights and proves the point that Australian products are in demand both here in Australia and overseas. With respect to food products, consumers not only have the right to know product origin and content, but they often need to know for health related reasons. They need to know exactly what is in food because, depending on what is in the food that they are consuming, it may or may not have serious health implications for them, and that is why it is absolutely critical that they know. There are no international standards with respect to food production and preparation. Food produced outside of Australia is not produced to the same standards as that produced in Australia. I do not for one minute suggest that everything produced in Australia is absolutely perfect. But I do suggest that in Australia we produce food to a much more acceptable level of standard than many of the products that we import from overseas countries. For example, we do not know what chemicals have been used in foods that are produced overseas or what hygiene standards have been used in the manufacture of food that comes in from overseas, and therefore we do not know what the health risks associated with that food are. In 2007-08 Australia imported $9 billion of food products. That was a 10 per cent growth from the previous year, and it is a growing industry. In some cases these were foods that were not produced at all in Australia and did not compete for market share with Australian products. I accept that. But in many other cases they were marketed in direct competition with Australian produce, in turn placing Australia’s farming, agricultural and horticultural sectors under even more pressure than they are currently facing as a result of drought, floods, other extreme weather events and the global economic recession. They also faced a problem with a monopolised market. I welcome the announcement last Friday by the Parliamentary Secretary for Health that Dr Neal Blewett has been appointed to oversee a review of Australian food-labelling laws in this country. I welcome that review and I appreciate the terms of reference that have been attached to it. I urge the review panel to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency, and I certainly look forward to the review panel’s recommendations. tion to the attention of the parliament.

227,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (7.20 Pm),"I support the member for Makin in bringing this moissues in the early nineties about truth in labelling. I remember what was probably my first question in the early nineties to the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, the Hon. Jeannette McHugh, in the Keating government. She instituted some processes to put clarity into ‘Made in Australia’. But what I want to offer tonight is a slightly different tack to that of the member for Makin. His resolution is about health concerns, and I support that. My concern, representing food producers, is to engage in activities that encourage Australians to do what they want to do. Consumers have indicated that they want to support Australian products, because they are aware that this is supporting employment in Australian jobs. They are very loyal. In fact, it is quite a barbecue stopper for someone to pick up the sauce bottle or the orange juice at a barbecue and make some comment about where it came from or where it was made. The point I would like to make is that we already have tools in place to address this. The Hon. Warren Truss was the minister in the Howard government who introduced and reinforced the concept of ‘Product of Australia’. I have brought along some products tonight, and I hope I have the indulgence of members in the House, and your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, to use these props. It is a pity the standing orders do not allow for it. The point I want to make is just how confusing it is for consumers. These products have been provided to me by food producers in my electorate. Here is a product: it is breakfast cereal. are not allowed to use props, and I will stick with the rulings of other speakers and deputy speakers on this. tralian company, and yet it does not have ‘Product of Australia’ on it. It does have the symbol for ‘Made in Australia’ with the flying kangaroo. Here is a sugar product from a famous sugar company which everybody would assume was Australian but which does not have ‘Product of Australia’ on it. That means it must have some level of imported product in it. fusing it is for consumers when they are in the supermarket and in a hurry. They are probably driven by the final bill for the product, but they still want to support Australian-made products. I believe we have the legislative tools to deal with this. We have ‘Product of Australia’ and ‘produce of Australia’, and wherever there is a label that does not have that on it, consumers can guarantee that it is not Australian, or that it has some imported ingredient-even Vegemite. I often enjoy, when I have international visitors, coming home to put Vegemite on the toast and introduce them to Vegemite, a purely Australian product. And yet it does not haveand they are not by law allowed to put-‘produce of Australia’ on it because they have to rely on some imported ingredients. The tools are there to have absolute truth. I would like to see the member for Makin encourage his government to put some effort into this, to educate those Australian consumers who want to support Australian producers, particularly of food, so that they understand what that label ‘Product of Australia’ or ‘produce of Australia’ means. Take an Australian wine bottle which has ‘produce of Australia’ on it. They can be guaranteed 100 per cent that all ingredients are made within Australia.

231,Mr Forrest,"That is a great shame, because all I am trying to demonstrate is how conproducers of these products are aware of Australian loyalty; they will go to great lengths to say that the company is owned in Australia. They will put labels on it to say, ‘Made in Australia’ but ‘from imported ingredients’. The power is with the people. We need to have them educated to the point where they understand clearly what ‘Product of Australia’ really means, so that they will support it. If we can achieve that, the packagers and processors of the food will put ‘Product of Australia’ as high as they possibly can, subject to the limits of their products’ packaging. I have even got a sample of Castlemaine rock, which comes not from my electorate but from the electorate of the member for Bendigo. It proudly has ‘Product of Australia’ printed on it in very large letters. Australians know that they can buy that confidently, knowing that they are 100 per cent supporting Australian jobs. They are not confused. As the member for Makin made the point, there is a proliferation of(Time expired) tonight’s motion on food labelling standards. It is an exceptionally important area of legislation, and a lot of good can be done in a community sense by getting these sorts of frameworks right. I commend the member for putting this forward. I note for the record that I have spoken on these types of issues-such as food labelling and other standards, as well as genetically modified foods and other products-on a number of occasions over many years. I have a very real interest in these things, mainly because they are issues of consumer protection, consumer rights and the ability of people to make free and fully informed decisions about the types of products they consume. Getting that framework right is about getting labelling right in more than one area, so I again congratulate the member for Makin for tonight’s motion on these particular standards. Of course, food labelling is not just about what is contained within a food product itself but also about how much you pay for it, what its value is, what its weight is, the additives that are contained in it and a whole range of issues that affect us today more than they ever have in the past, because of the complex nature of and the variety of ways in which foods are brought to our table. It is exceptionally complex for interested people, let alone intelligent people, to decipher or make sense of what a food label actually tells you. This is so for anyone who is in the practice of reading them, and I hope that most people are; I know I am. I still do the shopping. I still think I am reasonably well grounded. I can tell you the price of a loaf of bread in any range, colour or size-or, for that matter, of the 368 different types of milk containers that are on the market. The reality is that it is important to know not only what is in a product but how it compares to other food products on the shelves. The basis of all of this comes back to the standard of our food labelling and how that works for ordinary people, because the labelling itself is what people use to understand what it is they buy. Having that right is critically important, and, while I think we have certainly come a long way and that food labelling is better than it was at times in the past, it still has room for improvement. This government has certainly been very active in making sure that we get these things correct for consumers, and I note the good work that Minister Bowen has done in terms of unit pricing and the importance that plays. I am a beneficiary of some of that, because when I go shopping with my family I always explain to my kids that they should look at what they are purchasing, look at the label, understand where their money is going and understand how much it is per unit or per hundred grams or how many you actually get in a packet. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Private Members Business
232,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.25 Pm),"I firstly want to thank the member for Makin for movingI do that so that, when they buy something off a shelf, they actually understand what they are purchasing-what is inside that package or can. AndI have to say that these days I find myself buying fewer and fewer things that are contained in a packet or in a can. I am not passing a particular judgment, as I think that some food products that come in a can are quite healthy and quite good. And if the labelling is right then I think it is quite okay. But, generally speaking, it would be better, and it would help our farmers, if people bought fresh produce. The more people make a conscious choice to buy from the butcher, from the baker, from the farmers’ market, from the smaller grocery store, from the fresh food store and from the fruit and vegetable outlet, the more opportunity they have to be in touch with what they are purchasing and probably the less labelling they will need. If you are buying fresh fruit and fresh vegetables, or meat from your butcher, you do not need as much labelling, because you know that not much else has gone into it, apart from the product you are actually purchasing. I would encourage consumers to take more of that approach. But in the absence of that I understand the time or location difficulties there are for people. They find themselves spending all of their food dollars at a particular store. I am not going to mention any in this place. The only weapon they have to arm themselves with to make a clear and conscious choice is decent product labelling. I commend any work that this government is doing and has done and any work that has been done previously to ensure that consumers know what they are buying, what they are paying for and what impact it may have on their health and that of their families. for Makin for putting it forward. It is a line of inquiry that I am also pursuing through some of my parliamentary committees to try to encourage them to do work in this area. In particular I am interested in imported foodstuffs and the people’s ability to make informed choices about their shopping practices. Australia has a reputation for producing some of the cleanest, freshest and safest food in the world; however, with many major food products we no longer have the cheapest. That is not to say that, if all foods in the Australian market had to be produced in the same safe, quality assured manner using our minimum standards, our industries would not be competitive. I recently obtained an AQIS list of foodstuffs imported from China in the last six months. It is sobering reading-over 5,000 different items: thousands of tonnes of prawns, nuts, meats, shellfish, prepared foods, sauces and vegetables. The list goes on and on. I doubt we have any real idea how most of the food was produced, under what levels of hygiene it was produced and packed and what the quality of the water it was grown in and the chemicals which were used to grow it were. Are those chemicals banned in Australia? Of course, it is not just China; there are fish from Vietnam and Thailand and even food from India. Products are pouring in from all over the world. Just last week we heard that we will now allow the importation of beef from countries with mad cow disease. If you gave the public adequate information on this product-for example, ‘This beef has been imported from a country with mad cow disease’-I would suggest that sales might be a little sluggish! But you can be sure that that sign will not be appearing on the product. Our beef industry is a multimillion-dollar export earner for Australia, and can we be sure there are no biosecurity risks and, even more importantly, no public health risks? I have been to Vietnam, and a wonderful, beautiful and industrious country it is, even as it deals with MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Private Members Business
233,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (7.30 Pm),"I rise to support this motion and to thank the membersome difficulties in governance. But, although only a casual observer at the time, I could not help observing the conditions of the prawn farms. I allege they would be highly unlikely to pass Australian health tests. In fact, large tonnage of catfish is imported into Australia under another name. My understanding of catfish is that they dwell in the dirtiest of water and consume the filthiest of foods, but the Australian population lives largely in blissful ignorance of all this. I am in favour of free and fair trade; however, production not meeting the conditions our locals producers must is not fair on either the growers or the consumers. We turn our memory to the recent melamine scandal coming out of China. Are we convinced that our imported processed food from that nation is free of that contaminant? I understand part of China’s crackdown on this practice has involved lifting the maximum allowable standard of melamine in the product. So where are the safeguards? Unfortunately, they are difficult to find. Supposedly we are protected by AQIS, the very same organisation the government is planning to withdraw $40 million from. That is 40 per cent of their budget. And then we expect them to protect us! It is impossible not to think that in that event there may be shortcuts. We should have a full understanding of where our food comes from. Even though there have been reforms in labelling over the years, I am far from convinced the public understands the messages in the labelling. We can have education programs encouraging people to read and understand the labels, but at the heart of the problem is that the public trusts the government and its institutions to guard them from poor standards. I am far from convinced that, as this explosion of imported food threatens to bury the cleanest, freshest food industry in the world, we are being properly protected. I support this private members’ motion and thank the member for presenting it. I support it because it does address some of the issues I have raised, supplying better information to the public. I suspect, though, we will have to do much more than just this to address many of those issues. member for Makin and am in agreeance with most of what has been said by previous speakers. This is an extremely important motion and it is very important for the consumers of Australia. Consumers throughout the nation desire best practice when it comes to food labelling. Consumers have every right to know exactly where their product was grown, where it was produced and what effects it might have on them. More informative labelling is continually desired by consumers and has been progressed over time through the Food Standards Code, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council and Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Historical advances have been made in some regulations, with ‘made in’ becoming ‘manufactured in’, and ‘produce of’ requiring a minimum 50 per cent of the cost of the production to be in a certain area. Consumers, as I said, want to know where products come from. They have a desire to buy Australian products. There was a very good point made earlier by a previous speaker, the member for Mallee, that certain products are labelled ‘made in Australia’ or ‘produce of Australia’ but that that is not necessarily the case with some other products because of the 50 per cent production rule that we have. So country of origin is extremely important as well. RecentlyI received some calls from constituents that had dentures that were made in China. After they had been made and fitted, they discovered that these dentures had been made in China MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Private Members Business
234,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (7.34 Pm),"I too rise in support of the motion of theat approximately $150 total cost, yet they were still charged what we would charge here for dentures, which was in the thousands. As I said, the quality of mass produced food products is being investigated currently within the context of general human health, development and function, and food benefits are also something that people want to know about. The former health minister Dr Blewett has been appointed as chair of the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council. It determined at its 12th meeting about a year ago to undertake a comprehensive review of food labelling law and policy, and the terms of reference have now been agreed to and released. I wish him the wisdom of Solomon and hope for the successful completion of the task. In the past, we have seen many cases of products that have come from countries that do not have the same stringent laws that we do. Australia is right up there on a pedestal when it comes to our produce. We have a name on the international markets for good, clean produce, and it is very important that we maintain the good name that we have internationally for our food exports and for our farmers. As I said, most consumers want to know where their product comes from. If we can make labelling simpler and easier for people to read-with the factswe will find that more Australians will prefer buying Australian made products. RecentlyI was on an inquiry into obesity, and people submitted to the inquiry that labelling was very confusing. People told us that they wanted to know what is in products but found labelling extremely confusing, with low sugars, high sugars, sucrose et cetera. Everyone was telling us that they wanted something simpler to read, something understandable and something that will tell them what is in the product, where the product comes from and any dangers that might be in the product. There is an emerging desire here and around the world for environmental labelling as well. It is a new factor in assessing food products which is coming over the horizon. For example, ‘water footprint’ measures the volume of water used in the production of the food, whether it be cheese, beef, coffee or whatever. These are things that are emerging and that we want to see in labelling. (Time expired) tice from the Senate agriculture committee budget estimates reveal that hundreds of jobs are being lost because of the failure of the current Rudd government to deliver on its promise to clarify country of origin labelling requirements. The figures show that in just a three-month period Australia imported over 290,000 kilograms of home brand peanut butter, peanuts and beer nuts from China. All up, from February to May 2009, 994,635-almost a millionkilograms of nuts, mostly peanuts and peanut butter, were imported from China alone. In the same period, almost half a million kilograms-454,706 kilograms-of prawns and shrimp were imported from China. I find it incredible that Australia, the home of Kingaroy, cannot produce its own peanut butter. A recent media report stated that food imports will reach a record $8.5 billion in 2008-09, raising fears that Australia is sacrificing economic growth, jobs and food security and threatening food safety. The food industry fears that as consumers buy more home brand products the level of imports will continue to rise. Fruit and vegetables top the list of import categories at $1.7 billion in 2008-09, followed by seafood at $1.3 billion; coffee, tea, cocoa and spices at $1.2 billion; cereals at $800 million; dairy at $600 million; and meat at $575 million.

235,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (7.39 Pm),"On the question of food labelling, questions on nosupport, there is a danger of their jobs going the same way as our clothing and manufacturing sector. The Rudd government promised to end the confusion surrounding food labelling by clarifying country of origin labelling requirements. The Labor Party’s pre-election policy stated: A Rudd Labor Government will simplify and strengthen food labelling laws. This will include: A new ‘Grown in Australia’ label under the Trade Practices Act for products that are not only made in Australia, but also grown in Australia. Working with the organic food sector to develop a National Standard for Organic Produce with an agreed labelling and certification system for Australian produce. Consideration of amendments to the Food Standards Code to clarify country of origin labelling requirements. Strengthening compliance arrangements. It is a disgrace that in the midst of the financial crisis this government has racked up billions of dollars of debt stimulating the economy but Australians still do not have a clue about where their food is being grown and manufactured. The failure of the Rudd government and the Labor Party to deliver on their pre-election promises is becoming more apparent by the day. You only have to look at Coles and Woolworths. We all know how they will only buy Australian! They will only buy from where they will make their best quid; don’t worry about that. Let me tell you something. If the ETS and CPRS legislation moved in the House today comes into force, it will make our food even less competitive against the Chinese produce, for example, that Coles and Woolworths are increasingly using to stock their shelves. SoI think this issue of food labelling is extraordinarily important, and we should be looking at it from the point of view of where the produce concerned is grown, not so much where it is labelled. Assuming it is done under proper circumstances, the issue is where it is grown. We all know how certain companies can use the laws to say it was packaged here or had Australian content because it was put together here, but the real issue is: where the heck was it grown? I believe that, until we get laws that reflect whether it was grown or produced in Australia rather than where it was packaged, canned or processed, we are always going to have this problem and we are always going to have Australian consumers who are subject to selling by stealth, as it were. expired.

As I read I became ashamed of the fact that the story being told could have ever occurred. I was also filled with a rising disgust that in a country such as ours, despite how widespread these cases were, they were effectively condoned by silence, and I was compelled to present the motion to the House. This is what the letter said, in part: Re; Formal apology for the abuse and neglect suffered by children who were placed in government institutions or out of home care in the last century. Dear Joanna Gash MP, I would like you to hear the story of another victim. I did it in your electorate and I am hoping you will be my voice. I hope the apology won’t be a brief statement that makes these seven o’clock news and then fades away. The pain that I and others who have been abused feel will not just fade away. I would like to be able to attend any ceremony that might happen. I also feel that the States should have to apologise as well and not continue to be in denial that people who were in their employ did anything wrong. With that introductory statement came a victim statement from the writer, a New South Wales ward. I will not mention his name but he is in my electorate and he was born in 1953. Today he is 56 years of age. Constraints of speaking time allow me to quote only excerpts which are in themselves quite heart-rending. His entire statement stands as an indictment of the practices that prevailed and were endured by countless innocent children. And we owe them. An official, sincere apology from both government and the opposition should be just a starting point. I commend the New South Wales parliament for doing so and I urge the federal government to follow suit in a bipartisan apology. I acknowledge those organisations mentioned in the motion, and I support them and thank them for their continued support of the forgotten Australians. The following is a very small part of his statement. He said: I was placed in Royelston in 1959 at the age of six and this is when my transition from an innocent child began. Limited memories of Royelston are both of physical, sexual and mental (humiliation) abuse. I was sexually assaulted and raped. I was sodomised anally and orally. I was held down, beaten and battered. I was physically assaulted, brutally punished, had my head banged against the wall, pushed to the ground and beaten for any infraction of the rules. Even answering slowly was a punishable offence. The sexual abuse was frequent. It was indeed a good night when after lights out, that a carer did not come and remove you from your cot and take you away to another room. Here was my induction into the world where sexual molestation and physical abuse was the norm and accepted behaviour. I tried to avoid being noticed. I was afraid of the rough punishment that was routinely handed out. I couldn’t bear the beatings or the humiliation I was subjected to because I had a problem with regard to soiling my underwear. I can clearly remember an instance of being paraded before the rest of the boys because I soiled my underwear due to sexual abuse. They used large dogs that used to growl and MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Private Members Business
239,Mrs Gash,"Some months ago I received a letter from a constituent, and it took me somesnarl to frighten me, as an example to others. Physical abuse was used to beat me into letting them do whatever they desired. This is just the second paragraph. His statement goes on to describe continuing abuse whilst in the hands of a foster parent. He speaks of his changed behaviour, inability to adapt socially, a failed marriage, and a constant state of heightened alert. He also writes: I live with daily pain. I was given 10 shillings when I left the institutionand I will use his concluding paragraph to summarise his pain. He said: I wonder how much a politically correct apology from the Federal Government will be expected to make me and others in my situation feel better. The state of NSW told me that they have to protect the privacy of people who took away my childhood and had an enormous impact on my entire life from the age of six to this very day. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I call on this House to issue an unequivocal genuine apology to all the children who have had their innocence stolen from them while they were in the alleged care of the Australian government sanctioned institutions. It is long overdue and a moral obligation that we owe them as a nation, and I call on the government to continue to work with the opposition to make this apology to all victims of such abuse. As my time has now been increased from five minutes to 10 minutes, I would like to add the following. Just over two years ago a book titled The Forgotten Children was published by Random House. The author is David Hill, previously the managing director of the ABC, chairman of the Australian Football Association, chief executive and director of the State Rail Authority of New South Wales, chairman of Sydney Water Corporation and chairman of and children in institutional care. This is the publisher’s synopsis about David Hill’s story: In 1959 David Hill’s mother, a poor single parent living in England, reluctantly decided to send her sons to Fairbridge Farm School in New South Wales, where she was led to believe they would have a good education and a better life. David was lucky. His mother was able to follow him out to Australia. But for most children the reality was shockingly different. From 1938 to 1974 thousands of parents were persuaded to sign over legal guardianship of their children to Fairbridge to solve a problem of child poverty in Britain while populating the colony. Many of those children have decided to speak out. Physical and sexual abuse were not uncommon, loneliness was rife, food was often inedible and the standard of education was appalling. Here for the first time is the story of the lives of the Fairbridge children, from the bizarre luxury of the voyage out to Australia to the harsh reality of their very first days, from the crushing daily routine to stolen moments of freedom and the struggle that defined life after leaving the school. Despite the litany of abuse and the stories that continue to emerge of what occurred in some of our most respected institutions, our national government has so far not seen fit to apologise for the travesty. But, as I mentioned earlier, this will soon be rectified. Former Transport Workers Union vice-president Laurie Humphreys has set up the Forgotten Australian Alliance, an organisation intent on getting justice for the hundreds, if not thousands, of adults abused as children whilst wards of the state. Mr Humphreys says that 19 recommendations from a 2004 federal inquiry into forgotten Australians remain largely unactioned. The big one is for them to apologise to the forgotten Australians for the trauma caused by coming here in the first place and the experiences that they have suffered: lack of education, being battered, alleged sexual abuse and being institutionalised. He has also written a book called A chip off what block? It too is compelling reading. In March this year the ABC’s Law Report ran a story on MAIN COMMITTEE the forgotten generation, and the fact was reiterated that no apology had been forthcoming despite the extensive publicity of Sorry Day. Just to bring into perspective the enormity of the story, over 500,000 Australians were raised in 500-plus orphanages, children’s homes and foster care, effectively the population of Tasmania. Governments of all persuasions over the years are equally guilty of neglecting these children. We as a parliament stand condemned for failing to include or even consider these children in the National Sorry Day when the opportunity was there. I thank the parliament for listening to the story of my constituent. Mrs Vale-I second the amendment. Question agreed to. to. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (7.53 pm)-I rise today to recognise and acknowledge the pain and suffering inflicted upon more than 500,000 forgotten Australians in institutional care over the past century. I also rise to offer my support for a formal apology to the forgotten Australians, which the Minister for Families and Communities, Jennifer Macklin, has indicated will occur before the end of 2009. I know how welcome that apology would be to those women and girls who were incarcerated as girls in the Parramatta Girls Home in my electorate. For all those whose lives were diminished by government actions in these institutions an apology is long overdue. The history of the forgotten Australians is particularly significant in the electorate of Parramatta, particularly for women. The historical precinct on the bank of the Parramatta River, which was home to the Parramatta Girls Home, is known as the Parramatta Female Factory Precinct and it has been a site of incarceration and institutionalisation of women from 1804 to the present day, which is over 200 years. It was the home of the Parramatta Girls Home last century but institutions of various types have been housed there, opened and closed, rebuilt, expanded or added to. It is undoubtedly one of Australia’s most significant historical sites yet, like the stories of the children imprisoned there, it remains largely neglected and unknown. It was home to the first female convict factory in Australia, later an institution known as the Industrial School for Girls, then the Girls Training School, then the infamous Parramatta Girls Home and its current use is as a prison for women. The female factory at Parramatta was originally built in 1804 and acted as a workhouse, jail and a holding area for newly arrived female convicts and their children. It was the first of the 12 convict factories built around Australia. In 1841 an orphanage was built adjoining the site and in 1844 with the arrival of children from a Catholic orphanage in Waverley it was renamed the Roman Catholic Orphans School. In 1886 the school was asked to vacate the building and the forerunner of the Parramatta Girls Home, the Industrial School for Females, was declared on 1 April 1887 with the transfer of girls from Biloela. Children were held there under one of two classifications. Firstly, there were those considered destitute, abandoned or orphaned, who were not deemed as corrupt; and, secondly, those who were deemed as having tendencies towards criminal behaviour.

242,The Deputy Speaker,"The question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreedfor both it was very much an institution. In 1897 additional isolation cells were built and in the following year there was a number of riots because of a lack of food. By 1910 there was a growing awareness that not all the girls sentenced to the Parramatta Industrial School were corrupt and this saw the establishment of a training home on the adjacent acre. The school was intended for girls of uncontrollable character but not of immoral tendencies but a few years later again trends changed and the schools were merged and renamed the Parramatta Girls Home. Even more isolation cells were built in 1834. In 1961 there was a repeat of the riots and a derelict jail at Hay in regional New South Wales was gazetted as a maximum security annex of the Parramatta Girls Home and was named the Hay Girls Institution. Remember that these girls were not necessarily in the home because of any criminal tendencies. Tales were told by the Parra girls and the Hay girls of deprivation, of harsh discipline, of life behind walls, of keeping their eyes down, of beatings and of rape. Most of these girls had not committed any offence but had merely been placed in institutions under child welfare legislation. Their crimes included being neglected, being exposed to moral danger, being homeless or being uncontrollable. Many had run away from home because of violence and many were there simply for being Indigenous children who later became known as the stolen generation. In 1973 a series of protests called for the closure of welfare institutions and in October 1974 the Parramatta Girls Home was not closed but was renamed Kamballa and continued to operate under the management of the child welfare department. In 1980 the Department of Corrective Services took over part of the site and established the periodic detention centre for women. It was closed in 1986, some 99 years after it was opened under a different name. Given that the Parramatta Girls Training School was the principal institution and remand centre for all girls aged between 11 and 18 years in the state of New South Wales until 1966, it is likely that possibly more than 50,000 girls passed through this institution. Of this somewhere between seven and 10 per cent would have been girls of Aboriginal descent. The rich but tragic history of the site and the appalling stories of abuse and intimidation and its connection to so many contemporary women is told by Bonney Djuric in a recently completed history of the Parramatta Girls Home, Abandon All Hope. Bonney is the driving force behind the Parra girls, an extraordinary group of women who are still putting their lives together after a childhood in one of the most notorious institutions, the infamous Parramatta Girls Home. They are extraordinary women, the Parra girls, raising the profile of women who have similar histories but also of the site itself, a site of 200 years of the incarceration of women and ironically built on the sacred women’s site of the Barramatugal clan of the Darug nation. Bonney’s history is based on extensive research and the first accounts of survivors contributes to a broader understanding of how a system of care for girls was shaped and defined by many factors that would challenge societal perceptions and have shamed and silenced the Parramatta girls for far too long. Bonney describes the experience of the Parramatta girls: ‘Parramatta Training and Industrial School for Girls like its earlier counterpart, the Female Factory, was known for its notoriety and the control it exerted over the lives of all females who did not conform to whatever moral standards society expected of them. Its history is that of routine brutality, generalized ill-treatment and the denial of basic human rights where the principle of legal duty of care was entirely unknown or unrecognised.’ MAIN COMMITTEE ‘Operating under the guise of a “School”, Parramatta’s regime was in stark contrast to that of philosophies of education. Its intent was uniformity, non-flexibility and the provision of the same “training” in the same way, at the same time and place, for groups of individuals of disparate age, capacity and physique to be moulded and compressed into mass produced performance units, exhibiting uniform requirements of compliance and subjugation of personality.’ ‘… unlike mainstream schools which seek to maximise student achievement, “training” resulted in a suppression of achievement and a generation of near unemployability, and unsuitability for parenthood and family life.’ ‘The sexual experience of some inmates was often enforced criminally by rape at the hands of employees paid to “care” for their well-being. This only served to reinforce girl’s sexual experience as one of violence, powerlessness and shame.’ So speaks Bonney Djuric of the Parramatta Girls Home. I am lending my support to those trying to elevate the experiences of the forgotten Australians in the minds and hearts of Australians and to recognise the history of women, in this case, that was played out on this site, firstly as the Female Factory and then through the Parramatta Industrial School for Girls and finally the Parramatta Girls Home and Kamballa. It is an ugly story but it is a history that we should not back away from. It is a history that needs to be told. As many as one in five Australians today are descended from women who were once incarcerated in the Parramatta Female Factory Precinct, and members should consider that for a moment: 20 per cent of all Australians, over four million people, have a direct family link to women who were incarcerated on that site over its two-century history. Many others have a link to its use as a traditional sacred women’s site by the Burramattagal clan of the Dharug nation. Children experienced these horrors-serious and often criminal physical, sexual and emotional abuse, neglect and assault-in the places that were supposed to care for them. As adult survivors they deserve acknowledgement of and an apology for that harm. The forgotten Australians already have an apology from all states and will soon have an apology from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will acknowledge and apologise for the failure of federal governments of all persuasions to protect these children and young women. Nothing is fixed by being forgotten, but the many stories of survival and overcoming deserve to have a great light shone upon them. They deserve prime location at the front of every Australian’s mind and they deserve to be valued as great Australian stories of tenacity and endurance. As Helen Keller said: Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired and success achieved. of the forgotten Australians and I thank the member for Gilmore for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The first part of this amended motion is: That the House: … recognises the extent of abuse and neglect inflicted on Australian children who were placed in the care of the Government in institutions or out of home care during the last century … It is one of the darkest chapters of our nation’s history that, between the 1920s and 1990s, upwards of possibly more than 500,000 young Australians experienced care in an orphanage, home or another form of home care.

243,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (8.03 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this moving issueloss of family, neglect, exploitation, brutality, sexual assault, poor health care, poor education and loss of identity. We can only imagine the daily experience of utter grief and desolation that they as children would have endured. The legacy of their childhood experiences for far too many has been low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, fear, anger, shame, guilt, possessiveness, social anxieties, phobias and recurring nightmares. Unfortunately, many forgotten Australians have tried to block the pain of their past by resorting to substance abuse through lifelong alcohol and drug addictions. Some have also turned to illegal practices such as prostitution or more serious lawbreaking offences that have resulted in a percentage of the prison population being care leavers. An inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee began in 2004 and allowed many of these innocent children, who were now adults, to express their concerns and their experiences of being in the institutional care system. They were able to tell their personal stories and, in their telling, members of the committee were immensely moved and touched by their grieving, because the grief was very clear and present and unresolved. The committee received over 440 public submissions and 174 confidential submissions. The extensive nature of the inquiry is evident from the submissions received. Stories were received from care leavers who had been in government and nongovernment institutions or foster homes across all states in Australia spanning those 70 years. Many hundreds of people opened their lives and the memories of traumatic childhood abuse and punishment to the committee in their public submissions and at the hearings. Some people were actually telling their story for the first time. Some of these stories remain so distressing that they asked for their name to be withheld or to be identified only by their first name. Many others, who for a range of reasons preferred that their identity remain undisclosed, provided confidential submissions. But all these people desperately wanted the committee to read and to hear what they had experienced in childhood and the impact that those events have had throughout their lives. They wanted their voice to be heard. The first recommendation from the report was: That the Commonwealth Government issue a formal statement acknowledging, on behalf of the nation, the hurt and distress suffered by many children in institutional care, particularly the children who were victims of abuse and assault; and apologising for the harm caused to these children. The government has announced that it will implement this recommendation and apologise to the forgotten Australians before the end of the year, and the opposition supports this important step forward. Tomorrow is the inaugural meeting of Parliamentary Friends of the Forgotten Australians. I am advised that the minister will brief us on the details for the national apology and there will be representatives from the organisations that represent these forgotten Australians. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of the Alliance for Forgotten Australians, established in 2006 and formally launched by former Senator Andrew Murray on 16 October 2007. The Alliance for Forgotten Australians brought together existing funded and unfunded organisations that supported forgotten Australians to form a new national advocacy. The apology that will be given to these forgotten Australians will be like the apology to the Stolen Generation, but it is only a very small step in a very long journey for our forgotten Australians, the government and, most importantly, the ordinary people of Australia. It is a moral MAIN COMMITTEE imperative that we must all share to carry the burden of sadness that has been the dominant aspect of the lives of so many of these deserving fellow human beings. They deserve our love, our compassion and our practical support. I commend this amendment to the House. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (8.08 pm)-I thank the member for Gilmore for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House through this motion and for providing the opportunity to speak again on this significant national issue. The Australian community now acknowledges that the abuse and neglect suffered by many children in institutional or other out-of-home care during the last century was unacceptable. These matters have been the subject of three landmark Senate reports dating back as far as 2001. We know that many of the 500,000 children raised in more than 500 institutions in the period between 1920 and 1980 had been the victims of brutality, with many suffering from sexual and physical abuse. The traumatic impact of such treatment was brought home to me at a very personal level by one of my constituents, Mr Geoff Meyers, who came to see me and talk about issues that he had not talked about very much at all. He is now 73 and, for a lot of that period, Geoff had been unable to discuss these matters of such a personal nature, even with members of his own family. In an adjournment speech several months ago I spoke about the experiences he had shared with me. Geoff was abandoned when 14 months old and made a ward of the state. The scars of being orphaned and institutionalised were difficult enough but were made manifestly more unbearable as he survived through periods of sexual and emotional abuse. I noted in my earlier comments in the House that Geoff Meyers had said to me in that interview that an apology from the government was a very important issue for him. In his own words: I would like Mr Rudd to come to my door and say, ‘Mate, I know it happened to you and, even though I’m not responsible, I’m very sorry for what happened.’ Well, Geoff, it will not be long before the Rudd government responds positively to your request. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has already indicated that before year’s end, and even as soon as a matter of weeks from now, our government will issue a formal statement of acknowledgement and apology on behalf of the nation to forgotten Australians and former child migrants. As I understand it, the government is planning a significant remembrance event for that occasion. To help in the healing process, the Rudd Labor government has also provided $300,000 each to the Alliance for Forgotten Australians and the Care Leavers Australia Network, more commonly referred to as CLAN. I pay tribute this evening to the wonderful work, support and counselling provided by both organisations. The member for Gilmore may not have been aware of the commitments I have outlined, the commitments already made by our government, when she submitted her motion. If she was, I have to wonder why her original resolution condemned the current government but was silent on the lack of meaningful responses by the Howard government to earlier Senate recommendations. I note tonight that she has presented her motion in an amended form and in the proper spirit of bipartisanship which this matter deserves. In thanking the member for Gilmore for submitting this motion, I would also like to draw her attention to further commitments made by the Rudd Labor government. One of those is our commitment to work with the National Library of Australia and the National Museum of Australia in deciding how best to record for MAIN COMMITTEE the historical record the experiences of the forgotten Australians, former child migrants and women and children affected by past adoption practices. I know that for Mr Meyers, along with many others who have been so scarred by their experiences, the day cannot come quickly enough when the government, on behalf of the nation, renders a formal apology. this motion before the House and allowing me the opportunity to speak on behalf of my constituents who have suffered and been affected by abuse. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Steve Irons, the member for Swan, for his strong advocacy in this matter. His passion comes from a personal perspective that I know drives him in this place. I know that he stands up for the people of Western Australia who suffered whilst in care. The worse of all crimes are those against children, because these are the crimes where power and the advantage of strength is used to take control over victims. Criminals take control in circumstances where their victims have the disadvantage of inexperience and believe that they can trust adults. This is why these crimes are the worse. It is the most terrible example of power being used against the defenceless. It is reprehensible in every degree and every crime and law enforcement agency should-and I am sure does-give these crimes the highest priority. The substance of this motion refers to child abuse and neglect in the last century. It is in relation to children who were placed in the care of government institutions. It also acknowledges the neglect of governments in allowing abuse, pain and suffering to continue for many years. The motion calls upon the government to issue an unequivocal apology to all of the victims, and I note that we are now certain that that will occur in the days before the end of the year. I welcome that apology. In 2004, it was revealed that more than 500,000 Australian children were placed in foster care in orphanages and other sorts of institutions. Of those 500,000 children, there is no doubt that a significant number were abused and faced neglect. Through most of last century the controls on who was working in these institutions and in such roles were virtually non-existent. There were no working with children checks and there was no exchange of information between jurisdictions. It was a different time, and what looked good on paper as trusted agencies, caring organisations and individuals, many church based, were in some cases anything but reliable. That is not to say that every nun, priest or other caregiver was a paedophile or a violent abuser of children. This was not the case. However, that having been said, one of the great problems regarding child abuse, not only in the last century but also in this century, is where those who have not been directly involved but have known or suspected have not reported that information. It is hard to tell how many of the carers effectively gave their tacit consent to abuse and neglect by not reporting those crimes. It is my view that they stand condemned for their silence and that their actions are not far short of their being perpetrators. In any case they betrayed the trust placed in them and their duty as adults to protect children. It is therefore surprising that it was only last year in Western Australia that the Children and Community Services Amendment (Reporting Sexual Abuse of Children) Bill was passed. The result of that legislation was that, from 1 January this year, doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers and police officers were now required to submit a written mandatory reporting form in cases where they suspected abuse had occurred. SoI applaud the Barnett government of Western Australia for bringing this long-awaited legislation MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Create A National Organisation Responsible For Representing The Interests Of Young People
244,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.12 Pm),"I also thank the member for Gilmore for bringinginto law, an important element of the fight against sexual abuse and neglect of children. Although it imposes a legal obligation on several professions, I say that it remains a moral obligation of every adult to report evidence of or suspicion of child abuse or neglect. It is a statistic that a great proportion of cases of abuse and neglect are inflicted by a person known to the victim as either a family member or a family friend. That having been acknowledged, we must also acknowledge that other family members and family friends would be best placed to observe concerns or form suspicions. I say that those who do not act are as guilty of betrayal as were those who worked in the old institutions last century: those who suspected but did not nothing. It is hard to know whether the abuse and neglect of children is increasing or decreasing. In any case not a single case of abuse is tolerable and also a single suspicion that is not reported is not tolerable. Given the scale of abuse and neglect, it is appropriate that an apology be given and a strong expression of regret take place. However, I do look forward to the application of accountability to all perpetrators and to those who gave their tacit consent, as evidenced by the silence of betrayal of the weak and the defenceless. To those in Cowan who still carry the physical and emotional scars of their abuse and neglect, I say that I am sorry that the governments of this country did not ensure your safety and protect your childhood from abuse and neglect. In this place it is our job to make sure that it can never happen again, and we should fight to do so as even one case is one case too many. Once again I thank the member for Gilmore for bringing this most important motion before the parliament. I look forward to the apology by this parliament to those who suffered being made as soon as possible. (Time expired) has expired.

This motion was moved in the same terms in the Senate by Senator Hanson-Young, the Greens senator from South Australia, and I know that the member for Mackellar would be surprised by that bipartisan arrangement. But it highlights the fact that such was the anger towards the state Labor government that we got together and moved that motion. She was successful in having it passed in the Senate to highlight just how badly the state Labor government have been managing their budget. In the week following my putting this motion on the Notice Paper the South Australian government buckled under all the pressure and backflipped. I thought of removing it, given that the issue had been dealt with. But I thought it still presented an important opportunity to talk about the effects of governments mismanaging budgets by spending too much money such as the impacts that has on the delivery of services to the community. This issue was starkly brought to my attention by a visit from Chris Varney, who is Australia’s youth ambassador to the United Nations. Mr Varney was successful in being one of the very few people to gain access to see the conditions inside the Magill Youth Training Centre. We all accept that young offenders need to be incarcerated from time to time. They should be if they commit offences. However, they should be incarcerated in a humane way-and we have just seen a motion before this House in relation to the mistreatment of young people. I think it goes beyond doubt that the treatment of the young people in this centre was and is still today not appropriate. This motion also sought to bring to public attention the role of the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth whose job it is to represent young people of our country at a federal level. Her role is not just to represent youth in the positive circumstances as she often does, but more importantly, for those young people who are in difficult circumstances. This minister also has a unique relationship with the South Australian Labor government, in particular those who made the decision not to go ahead with the rebuilding of the Magill Training Centre. We thought it was important that the minister involve herself in trying to resolve this issue through her unique position. I must say it is disappointing that, after three months, I still have not received a reply to a letter I wrote bringing this issue to her attention, but I guess she is very busy. The centre was planned to be replaced as far back as 1999 when the then South Australian Liberal government announced it was to be rebuilt at Cavan. However, this was shelved when the Labor government took office in 2002. In 2006, the Rann government announced it would rebuild a suite of correctional facilities. However, due to the mismanagement of the state budget, the Rann government had to cut that promise in last year’s budget. They are using the tough-on-crime rhetoric that we often see with media Mike Rann, and his sidekick, the Treasurer. We know that that is all spin and no substance given that the gang of 49 seem to be running around South Australia at the moment doing what they like. The Magill Training Centre has been criticised by everyone; from the Greens in the Senate, to our side of politics, to their social inclusion adviser, Monsignor Cappo, who we all presume-given that the Treasurer says anyone who criticises this is soft on crime-is also inMAIN COMMITTEE cluded in that criticism. Pressure from Stephen Wade, a spokesman in the state Liberal party; John Gardner, who is the candidate for Morialta; several media outlets, including Matt and Dave; and the state Labor government’s polling reflected that they needed to do something about it and thus we saw the backflip. A week after this motion was moved, the Minister for Families and Communities in South Australia, Jennifer Rankine, said that if they built this it would damage the state’s AAA credit rating. That is quite an extraordinary announcement, that a $60 million one-off spend would actually damage the state’s AAA credit rating. It just highlights how this state Labor government’s waste and mismanagement over eight years has sent South Australia back to the bad old days of the State Bank. The worse thing is that we are seeing exactly the same thing in this national parliament today, with this Prime Minister. This government should be condemned for its waste and mismanagement. (Time expired) ance and some factual material to this debate. Let me say from the outset that, while the member for Mayo talks about mismanagement by the current state Labor government in South Australia, I would like to point out to him a fact that he pretty much acknowledged himself towards the end of his contribution, that it was a state Labor government that brought the state finances to a point where the state today has a AAA credit rating, a rating that it has been able to maintain for several years now. You cannot, on one hand, be saying that you have mismanaged the state finances yet still maintain a AAA credit rating for your state. The two arguments simply are in contradiction to each other. This is a serious matter. This is a very serious matter. So much so, that it is a matter that has been ongoing in South Australia for almost three decades. If time permits I will talk a little about its history. But I would say this in an attempt to highlight the seriousness of this matter: if you talk to our police, if you talk to our court officials, if you talk to the correctional services department, or if you talk to Monsignor David Cappo, the Commissioner for Social Inclusion in South Australia, they will all admit that it is a very complex matter to deal with. That is why it is a matter that still needs to be resolved the government of the day. It is a complex matter because we are dealing with young lives and there are no simple fixes to the problems and situations that they often find themselves in. It is not an issue that you can find a simple fix to when you are dealing with criminal acts of people, regardless of age. The truth of the matter is that it goes back about three decades. It was in the early 1980s that the Labor government of the day began the process of rebuilding a new youth detention facility at Cavan, at Jonal Drive, and that facility still exists. It has, I think, space for about 36 young offenders. Subsequently-I say subsequently-the Liberal government of the day did look to relocate the Magill facility to a site at Cavan, close to but not adjacent to the Jonal Drive site. They purchased that site in the nineties. I am well aware of that; I was involved in the negotiations. That was in 1999. In fact the decision was made before that. They left office in 2002, three years later. So to say that the Labor government then reneged on completing a commitment made by the previous Liberal government fails to take account of the fact that the Liberals had three years to follow through on it. The truth is that they too walked away from the decision to rebuild the Magill centre at Cavan and left it in limbo. The state Labor government did come to power and continued the negotiations as to where the best location for that facility ought to MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Create A National Organisation Responsible For Representing The Interests Of Young People
247,Mr Zappia (Makin) (8.22 Pm),"I rise to speak on this matter in order to bring some balbe. The decision was not made lightly, because there are a lot of factors that you need to take into account when you build a detention facility of any kind-factors relating to access to it and access to family members of those people who are in custody. That said, the decision was then made to continue and rebuild the new facility at Cavan. It was linked to the extensions to the adult facility at Mobilong, extensions which were packaged up as a $600 million investment in additional correctional facilities in South Australia. It is because of the $600 million figure that the state government had to revisit its commitment, not because of the $60 million that the member for Mayo would have you believe was the beall and end-all of this decision. Ultimately the minister of the day has committed the $67 million to a new 60-bed facility at Goldsborough Road, at the original site where the land was set aside for this facility. The Jonal Drive facility, which as I said currently has room for 36 offenders, will be used to house the younger offenders in youth detention. I understand that $4 million will immediately be spent to provide a level of improvement to both the Magill facility and the Jonal Drive facility. This is a government that is responding to the needs of the community and is responsive to the obligations of government, and that is why it is making these investments. (Time expired) has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed from 19 October. That grievances be noted. Gippsland Electorate: Gippsland Rotary Centenary House Gippsland Electorate: Gippsland Plains Rail Trail me and many hundreds of people in my electorate: the federal government’s failure to provide funding to support the development of the second stage of Gippsland Rotary Centenary House and the upgrade of the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail. I will get to the specific details of the rail trail in a few moments, but I want to begin on a more positive note. Earlier tonight in the HouseI briefly mentioned a fundraising auction which was held on Saturday night in Traralgon, at the Traralgon Vineyard, hosted by Leon and Margaret Hammond. It really was a magnificent setting, and it befitted the occasion given the magnificent generosity shown by Gippslanders on the evening. The generosity of Gippslanders was certainly on show. I believe that in excess of $20,000 was raised for Gippsland Rotary Centenary House on the evening. I commend the members of the fundraising committee for putting in the hard work that goes into arranging such an event, and I also commend the sponsors of the night. It typified the community spirit since the decision was made to build Centenary House. I have spoken in the House before in relation to the Centenary House facility, and it really is quite extraordinary. It provides a home away from home for patients and their families attending Latrobe Regional Hospital and, primarily, patients of the Gippsland Cancer Care CenMAIN COMMITTEE",227,Create A National Organisation Responsible For Representing The Interests Of Young People
248,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),Order! The time allotted for this debate,228,Grievance Debate
249,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),The question is:,228,Grievance Debate
250,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (8.27 Pm),"I rise to speak on two issues that certainly grievetre. At the most vulnerable time in their lives, it is very reassuring for people in Gippsland to know that someone cares enough to help them out in this manner. I have visited Rotary Centenary House on several occasions, and it is always being improved, quite often by the partners of the patients, who come in and do odd jobs while their loved ones are receiving treatment and care at the nearby Latrobe Regional Hospital. It has been quite extraordinary to see this community facility developing in the way it has been. This is the house that love, compassion and empathy have built. Everyone on the committee and all Rotarians in Gippsland should be proud of their achievement. The facility contains six large ensuite units and two smaller self-contained units, along with a communal kitchen, dining room and lounge facilities, a children’s play area and a quiet room for family consultation and privacy. Such a facility did not just happen overnight; it required an enormous amount of work and goodwill from the community and governments at all levels. In the first stage, $500,000 from the Community Support Fund was contributed by the state Labor government, $407,000 was contributed by the federal coalition government through the Sustainable Regions Program and Latrobe city provided the land, while Rotarians across Gippsland provided the people power, with a total of 432,000 coming through philanthropic trusts, including a $100,000 donation by the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The link to McDonald’s is very strong through the local benefactors, Kay and Tony Radford. I know the Radfords will be embarrassed to have their names acknowledged so publicly, but Kay is really a driving force behind the fundraising activities of the committee. Rotary clubs across Gippsland provided $350,000 to the first stage plus a range of in-kind donations. All up, it was a $2 million project that was officially launched by the former federal member for Gippsland, Peter McGauran, and the former state Labor member for Morwell, Brendan Jenkins. I make the point regarding both the funding sources and the official opening to reflect the bipartisan support that round 1 of the project received and to appeal to the current governments at the state and federal levels to follow that example. There are now plans to build a further stage, and the volunteer board, led by the chairman, Ken Peake, have been successful in raising in the vicinity of $500,000. Federal funding was sought under the Jobs Fund, but the project’s bid for funding was unsuccessful in round 1. I think it is a sad indication that the demand for such a facility is there and growing so quickly that there is such a pressing concern in the community of Gippsland to build another nine units so desperately. Centenary House is providing comfortable and affordable accommodation for Gippslanders when they are certainly at their most vulnerable. I have no doubt that the friendly and supportive environment which is provided in a safe and secure location is contributing to improved health outcomes for guests while they stay at Centenary House. It is important to note that functions like the fundraiser on Saturday night reflect the overwhelming generosity of Gippslanders, which has been seen right throughout this year, beginning with the fundraising that supported our bushfire victims earlier this year. Although Centenary House is located between Traralgon and Morwell, the main beneficiaries of this project come from further afield, with 82 per cent of the patients travelling from East Gippsland, Wellington and South Gippsland shires. I think it says a lot about the community of the Latrobe Valley and the businesses and residents, who are so willing to support this project, that they are the major sponsors and supporters of the Centenary House facility yet it is their neighbouring communities across Gippsland which actually receive the benefits of their hard work. I strongly urge the federal govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment ministers to work with their state colleagues in Victoria and support the extension of Centenary House as soon as possible. I indicated at the outset that I also wanted to raise the issue of the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail. By way of background, the rail trail covers a distance of 65 kilometres through the towns of Traralgon, Glengarry, Toongabbie, Cowwarr, Heyfield, Tinamba, Maffra and Stratford. The trail follows the path of the disused railway line which connected these towns. This trail is a major tourist icon and a drawcard for touring cyclists and walkers alike. Funding was sought again under the Jobs Fund program to restore the Latrobe River timber trestle rail bridge, which was operational for over 100 years until its closure in 1986. This restoration will enable a seven-kilometre section of the trail between Traralgon and Glengarry to be opened up. This is another project that has strong support in my community from people who are both passionate and determined to make a difference. In this case, the lady leading the charge is Helen Hoppner. She is a tireless worker for our community and an outstanding advocate of the rail trail. Helen is the current chairperson of the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail Committee and, as I said, she has worked tirelessly to promote the opportunities to develop this facility and to encourage state and federal governments to make a contribution to the ongoing upgrades. The funding proposal that was submitted sought, I think, $340,000. During the construction phase of the project, five jobs are expected to be created on the site and local timbers will be sourced to use in the restoration work. As the application to the Jobs Fund indicated, it is a major tourist icon for the region which would attract some 20,500 touring cyclists, providing an economic benefit to the connected towns estimated at $6 million per annum, thus stimulating development of existing tourist establishments such as cafes, hotels, general stores, the accommodation sector such as the bed and breakfasts, wineries, cheese-making firms and other associated tourism industries. Obviously some very important observations need to be made about providing opportunities for healthy lifestyles and encouraging people of all ages to exercise in a safe and relaxed environment. I take this opportunity to reflect on the fact that I often worry about the current need for cyclists to exercise on our main road environment right across Gippsland. It is difficult terrain, the visibility is not always that great and our roads have not necessarily been established with cyclists in mind. The broader issue concerning the safety of cyclists in our community needs to be addressed. There have been several tragic accidents in my electorate in the time that I have been a member of parliament, and one occurred quite recently. A local doctor, Heather Hunter, from Sale-a much-loved and well-respected physician in the Sale community-was struck and seriously injured. Heather is still in a critical condition and the thoughts and prayers of all Gippslanders are with Heather and her family and loved ones at this time. In the context of the need to provide safe opportunities for people to exercise, it is important that the government carefully considers whether there are any opportunities to fund the further stage of the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail project in subsequent rounds of the jobs fund. The rail trail has a heritage component associated with it. The trestle bridge, which I referred to earlier, has historical significance. It operated for something in the order of 100 years, until its closure in 1986. It served to develop a resource-rich area, noted for its dairy farming, timMAIN COMMITTEE ber cutting and mining. Aesthetically, the bridge, together with its adjacent flood plain timber bridges, was regarded in the past as a notable and very attractive feature of the Latrobe River. It would be great to see the government in a position to support such a project in future funding rounds. It would obviously add some benefit to the tourism and economic base of the Gippsland region but also to the safety of the cycling community and to the health and well-being of the community more generally. In the time that is left available to me, I also want to reflect briefly that, if such projects do get off the ground, we will be seeking government support to encourage local contractors to tender for any such work. The Gippsland Rotary Centenary House has benefited enormously from local traders undertaking the vast majority of that work. In the time leading up to Christmas, I will be running my own ‘Shopping locally’ campaign in the electorate of Gippsland, with the message of putting locals first. I want to encourage Gippsland mums and dads to seek the opportunity to purchase their Christmas presents wherever they can from the local business sector. We all know that, if you support local businesses in your country communities, you are helping to generate jobs for the future and provide opportunities for young people to remain in your towns. Something we can all do as members of parliament is to promote the benefits of our own regional communities by encouraging such initiatives in our regional areas. Despite the changes to the communications and printing entitlements, I am sure my communication will fit under the new criteria. There will be no disparaging remarks about any government ministers. It will be a very positive newsletter. It will promote the benefits of supporting local communities, putting locals first and creating jobs in the Gippsland region. Far North Queensland: Infrastructure sland hit 13.8 per cent in September-one of the highest in the country, if not the highest. Unemployment has effectively doubled since the global financial crisis hit and led to the global recession. The tourism and construction industries in Cairns are being hard hit, and many people have lost their jobs or are under threat of losing their jobs through no fault of their own. This is why the government needed to act early and decisively in response to the global financial crisis through the support it provided in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The Rudd government’s $42 billion economic stimulus through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan alone is contributing more than $150 million in education investments in my electorate of Leichhardt. This is on top of the $50 million investment we are making in a new dental school or the investments we are putting into schools through our trades training centres, including the construction of a new marine skills training centre. This is real bricks and mortar infrastructure. The schools modernisation program is the biggest in Australia’s history. Schools are receiving infrastructure refurbishments and other improvements that are well overdue, and local tradies-plumbers, carpenters and electricians-are getting solid work from it. I have visited a number of schools recently in Far North Queensland. I was out at Edge Hill State School looking at the work that Metro Builders are doing there. And it is a similar situation at Caravonica State School, where 40 or 50 tradies are getting work through the education project. Down at Hambeldon State School, Laurie Lindner builders have 20 or 30 fellows and women working, constructing a new library multipurpose centre-a $3 million investment. MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Grievance Debate
251,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (8.38 Pm),"The unemployment rate in Far North QueenConstruction projects like these are going on all over my electorate, thanks to the government’s response to the global recession through our economic stimulus plan. Recently we announced another 218 social houses would be built in the region to further stimulate the local economy and the construction industry. These are in addition to the five defence houses that are currently well underway. In addition to the nation-building stimulus package, of which nearly 70 per cent is for infrastructure, Cairns has been recognised as an area that needs additional support. Cairns has been formally recognised, therefore, by the Australian government as a priority employment area. Recently the government held a Keep Australia Working forum attended by the Minister for Employment Participation, Mark Arbib, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Jason Clare. The forum identified that work could be done to continue to support jobs in the short term but that we would also work to diversify our economy. We are an economy very much based on tourism and the construction industry, and people are tired of the boom-bust cycle. We need to ensure, though, in the short term that local businesses are getting the stimulus work. Many of these construction projects are only just getting underway, so we are running a major projects forum this Friday in partnership with the state government. It will not only include the stimulus projects but also projects like the dental school, investments in Indigenous housing and other Indigenous infrastructure, the state government’s $450 million hospital redevelopment and a major prison redevelopment at Lotus Glen. Lead contractors will be available at the major projects forum to hear directly from contractors about tendering and quoting for some of the jobs involved in the construction of these projects. This is important work that we are doing to make sure that local businesses are getting part of the action from the stimulus work, much of which is only just getting underway. A local employment coordinator has been appointed to the region. Amanda Altman, who has been doing the job in the interim, has done a fantastic job. I would like to thank her and congratulate her for the work that she has been doing, including pulling together this major projects forum. Mr Peter Doutre will be starting as the coordinator next week. He is a man who brings great experience to the job. He has been a leader in Centrelink; he was involved in the Centrelink response to the Victorian bushfires and in the Northern Territory intervention. I am looking forward to him coming back to Cairns and starting work as our local employment coordinator. I am confident that his extensive experience will help us to combat the global recession and support jobs in our local community. I also thank Minister Arbib. He has been very supportive, as have other ministers, of the work that I have been doing in the local community. In the past week I have spoken to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Ferguson, Minister Crean and others as well as Minister Arbib. We recognise that we need to continue to do work in the short term to support jobs. We had a jobs expo planned for next year, and I said to Minister Arbib that that was not good enough as we have seen unemployment continue to go up. He has agreed to bring that jobs forum forward to December so that young people leaving school in Cairns can go along to the forum, meet employers and get put in touch with real jobs. The apprenticeship kick-start program that kicks off on 1 December is going to be an important part of that forum as well. I am looking forward to Minister Arbib coming up directly after these parliamentary sittings to promote that and again meet with local employers. MAIN COMMITTEE Jobs are not created only by government; they are mainly created in the private sector and so we need to work with and partner the private sector. I was pleased that last week the peak business organisations in Cairns-Tourism Tropical North Queensland, Advance Cairns and the Cairns Chamber of Commerce-brought forward a new plan to keep Cairns people working. Their plan involves a range of different areas. We are already working on some of them, including access into Papua New Guinea in the mining sector, and we are looking at getting some of those mining companies to come to the jobs expo. The plan also talked about aviation access. This is something I have been working on with Minister Albanese to see how we can attract more international carriers into Cairns and in particular get them to triangulate through Cairns to major cities such as Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. I hope there will be some regulatory reform as an outcome from the aviation white paper due later this year. The local businesses plan also included requesting some changes to taxation. It proposed tax concessions for local Cairns employers through interest-free deferral of pay-as-you-go, GST contributions for employers until 30 June 2010 and tax-free use of annual leave until 31 March 2011. There are difficult issues involved when you start to look at getting tax concessions for a particular region, but I will be taking these up with the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer. The ATO has already given special consideration to businesses doing it tough during the global recession. Where businesses are having difficulty meeting their tax debts, the ATO will be fair and reasonable, treating them with the empathy that they deserve. The ATO is more than willing to enter into payment arrangements, without penalties and the general interest charge, that suit business cash flow and see them through the worse effects of the global financial crisis. I thank the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for their support on this. We have also seen measures like the reduction in pay-as-you-go tax instalments from nine per cent to two per cent in 2009-10 and, of course, the small business and general business tax breaks, which have been well utilised by small businesses in my electorate. The plan called A New Deal for Cairns involves some local projects. One of them is a project that has been put forward by the Cairns Regional Council for a new performing arts precinct. The concept is something that I support. I think it is a fantastic concept: a performing arts centre on the waterfront. This is a $200 million plus project, though, and it really needs to be staged. The council need to bring forward a detailed business plan before we can effectively respond to this. They need to demonstrate how they are going to not only provide their share of the capital in terms of a local council but get the state on board. They also need to show how they will ensure the ongoing running costs of this facility. They are also talking about a proposal for the redevelopment of the city centre of Cairns. I think this is a fantastic idea. The community infrastructure program that Anthony Albanese has put together is something that we will look to in terms of that project. The work that the Rudd government is doing and the partnerships that I am building with the local business community are really important in supporting jobs in our local community. That stands in stark contrast to the opposition who, since the beginning, have been opposing our stimulus measures. Just recently they were talking again about wanting to pull the rug out from under economies like mine in Cairns by pulling back on the stimulus measures. Unemployment is at almost 14 per cent in Cairns. Families are being impacted through no fault of their own and they do not need the opposition talking about stimulus being pulled back in places like Cairns. We are determined to continue to work with the local business community. MAIN COMMITTEE I will continue to work with my ministerial colleagues as part of the government-Minister Arbib, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others-to make sure that we are doing all we can to support employment in my local community. I am pleased the local business community have brought forward their plan A New Deal for Cairns. I will continue to work with them, the local employment coordinator and the government to make sure that we can make a difference in the local community and support jobs in the short term while we work to diversify the economy of Cairns as we move forward. Asylum Seekers Dr STONE (Murray) (8.47 pm)-We have almost got used to the government at question time leaning across and screaming abuse at the opposition, calling them people who locked up children, who continued to lock up children until there was a change of government. Tampa is referred to. This is such a hypocritical business that I felt I should use this time to set some of the record straight. At the moment, there is the interception of a vessel in a zone near Indonesia at the request of the Australian government. The 255 people, including women and children, from Sri Lanka are still on board the boat in Indonesia with very little hope of being processed as asylum seekers any time soon. They have been on hunger strikes and the children are in distress, but they still remain there. I wonder what this government would have said if it were a coalition issue some years ago. Also, we recently had the so-called Indonesian solution announced, which suggests that this government can wash its hands of any responsibility for those being lured down to Australia with the new softened policies in relation to border security. The government simply says, ‘Indonesia, you put your foot out the door, try and trip these smugglers coming down and detain the people in your detention centres. We’ll pay you a lot to do that,’ knowing full well that the standards in the detention centres in Indonesia are not anything like the accepted standards of proper detention in Australian facilities, in terms of access to education, information, nutritional standards, outdoor space and even the security of those centres, yet this government is more than pleased to pass the buck. I draw the chamber’s attention to an Australian Human Rights Commission report which has come out only in the last couple of days. It is called 2009 Immigration detention and offshore processing on Christmas Island. The Human Rights Commission details a number of areas of major concern. Amongst those is the detention of unaccompanied minors and families with children. It says: Some children (including unaccompanied children) are detained in a closed immigration detention facility on Christmas Island–the ‘construction camp’. The Commission considers this a concerning regression from the 2005 changes to the Migration Act which affirmed the principle that children should only be detained as a last resort. Of course it was the coalition who brought in the 2005 changes. This is a ‘regression’ from those changes. There is a conflict of interest created by having the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship or DIAC officers acting as a legal guardian for unaccompanied minorsthe report continuesdetained on Christmas Island. There is also a lack of clarity about responsibilities and procedures relating to child welfare and protection for children in immigration detention on the island. MAIN COMMITTEE The commission goes on to say: On arrival on Christmas Island, families and unaccompanied minors are placed into detention at the construction camp. According to DIAC, as soon as health, security and identity checks are completed, the Minister is asked to consider placing them into community detention. However, while some are moved after an initial period in the camp, others are not. In the Commission’s view, the shortage of community-based accommodation on Christmas Island is likely to be a key factor delaying or preventing a move to community detention for some families and unaccompanied minors. We have to ask from the coalition’s point of view: why is there a shortage of community based accommodation. Quite simply, it is because this government is failing to deal with the numbers pouring on down now through the people-smugglers’ routes and this government is refusing to deal properly with those in detention now on Christmas Island, in particular the children. The report continues: During the Commission’s visitand I am talking about the Human Rights Commissionof the 82 children in immigration detention on the island, only 29 were in community detention. The other 53 were detained in the construction camp. Of the 53 children in the camp, the majority were 16 or 17 years old, but a significant proportion were younger-including 11 children aged between zero and five years. Thirty six of the children in the camp were unaccompanied. It goes on to say: … the construction camp is not an appropriate environment for children. It is a claustrophobic facility consisting of demountables linked by covered walkways. There is little open space, there are virtually no trees, and there is no open grassy area for children to play. The bedrooms are very small, with beds that are not appropriate for babies or young toddlers: I need to echo the Human Rights Commission’s concerns about what is said publicly by this government and what is actually going on. I need to repeat what the Human Rights Commission says. It says: The Commission is concerned that, on occasions, Australian Government statements about detention arrangements for children do not accurately reflect the current reality for children on Christmas Island. For example, an August 2009 press release stated: It is Rudd Government policy that no child be held in an immigration detention centre and there are no children detained in the Christmas Island facility or any other detention centre. Children and where possible their families are housed in community accommodation. As a further example, the DIAC website states: Detention policy is administered with flexibility, fairness and in a timely manner. Arrangements introduced in 2005 provide for these requirementsand of course 2005 was under the coalition. The report continues: the detention of families with children is to take place in the community under community detention rather than in immigration detention centres… The Human Rights Commission goes on to say: Statements such as these convey the impression that children are not held in closed immigration detention facilities, but are accommodated in community detention in community-based accommodation. They may have also contributed to recent media reports which wrongly state that children are no longer held in immigration detention. For many children on Christmas Island, that is not the case. MAIN COMMITTEE As discussed in section 11.3 above, many children are detained in a closed detention facility-the construction camp. DIAC’s classification of the construction camp as ‘alternative temporary detention in the community’ is misleading. The camp is not community-based accommodation. It is a closed facility from which detainees are not free to come and go. SoI need to repeat that this government is incredibly hypocritical, misleading and inhumane. With its policies, it has unravelled border security in this country. It has changed so many of the watertight secure arrangements and immigration policies which had stopped the people smugglers coming on down to Australia. You will recall that today in question time. I held up a chart that showed that there was virtually no people smuggling for the last five years in Australia. This government has unravelled those very important immigration strategies. Under those strategies, if you wished to come to Australia as a general skilled migrant there were pathways. There were pathways for families to have reunion access. There were also 13,500 humanitarian and refugee places for those who the UNHCR assists us to identify as the most in need, such as women and children out of Africa, Congolese families with eight, nine or children who would never be able to raise the American dollars to buy their way out of horrendous situations. This government has allowed that unravelling to occur. It has brought enormous distress to those who are in the queues and who are being bumped from coming through the front door. But at the same time it is refusing to acknowledge or look after those asylum seekers who make it through to Christmas Island. I have read to you from the Australian Human Rights Commission report that was published just days ago. They are most concerned at the wrong statements that are being made publicly about children in detention on Christmas Island. They are very right to make those observations. They are sincere in their comments that there has in fact been-and I repeat-a regression from the 2005 changes to the Migration Act which affirmed that children should only be detained as a last resort. I am afraid that this is a disgraceful situation. I call upon this government to again address the pull factors that are bringing the people smugglers and their human cargo, people who are desperate and who are prepared to risk their lives. But I am concerned that the hypocrisy will continue. This government must deal with the facts, take responsibility for its actions and take actions to stop people smuggling. Asylum Seekers Preventative HealthI was listening very carefully to the member for Murray’s contribution to the grievance debate, which was about people smugglers and refugees. I must say that I am very proud to be part of a government that is dealing with the situation in a level-headed way and sincere way, a way that is not inciting the Australian public. What the member for Murray did not tell us is what they are planning to do-what she would do if she were in government-and what the alternatives are. We have not heard any alternatives from the opposition at this point. I would like to repeat the questions the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked today: would they bring barbed wire? Would they bring back the Nauru project? Would they bring back temporary protection visas? These are questions that have not been answered by the opposition. In defence of the Rudd Labor government, we are dealing with the situation in a very level-headed MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Grievance Debate
252,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (8.57 Pm),"BeforeI go on with what I was about to say,manner and in a way that is not inciting the Australian public. We are not using this for political purposes, which is something that we saw in the past. I planned to speak about other things tonight. One of the things that I really wanted to speak about was preventative health. As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I want to talk about the work that we do. We have spoken with many people-experts, professors, doctors and many people who know the area of health-and they have all been giving us one message. They have been all been telling us one thing: preventative health measures make the most sense. Preventative health measures are cheaper, less disruptive to people’s lives and cause less grief and fear, fewer side effects and complications. We know that from campaigns that have been run in the past that educating and teaching the public about what they can do to avoid illnesses works. We have seen many successful campaigns over the years. It is a very important message that preventative health is common sense. I was disappointed that the Liberal Party today voted against the establishment of Australia’s first national preventive health agency. In doing so, the Liberal Party established itself as being possessed by the opposite of common sense: it was completely daft, irrational, illogical and irresponsible. Voting against the establishment of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency serves only to establish the opposition as obstructionist, devoid of policy and oblivious to the best interests of millions of Australians. By voting against this measure, they are voting against cheaper costs and less disruption to people’s lives and for the causes of more grief, fear, side-effects and complications, because preventative health is common sense and the way to go. This could have been anticipated, looking at the positions of the Liberal Party over timeand there are many positions to look at. The opposition has only wanted to work in retrospect. For example, in government and now in opposition the coalition parties want to deal with climate change only after the Murray-Darling has become a desert, not before. They want to deal with the global recession after our economy collapses, not before. They want to deal with road, rail and harbour development only after the mining boom ends, not before. They want to deal with school retention rates after they bottom out, not before. They want to deal with crumbling public housing stock after it has been condemned, not before. Nothing could be more typical of the coalition parties than their desire to do nothing and blame everyone else after the fact. The opposition is always looking at the view to their rear. It is living in the past and politicking on current choice as a throwback to 2001. Its lot is to try to lead from the position of yesterday. We all know that pensioners, and age pensioners in particular, have been doing it very tough for some time. I know this because I have one of the oldest electorates in the country. Well over 20 per cent of people in the electorate of Hindmarsh are aged 65 or over. Many of these people are pensioners, many of them are suffering ill health and many of them feel the effects of isolation in the community. These people have deserved more assistance. I have said this publicly for many years. I am pleased that the Rudd government was good enough to give pension increases last September in extremely difficult economic times. I praise the Rudd government for those pension increases. Pensioners-the people I spoke about in my electorate, and in fact in electorates all over Australia-often are living without any savings and without any investments but with subMAIN COMMITTEE stantial recurrent costs to meet. They deserved the full increase in the pension that was handed out to them by the Rudd Labor government. So it is unacceptable that some state governments callously want to exploit some of the most vulnerable in our community, as I read in the paper yesterday. I read that some states may increase some public housing rents because of the increase in the pension. They cynically double-deal with the goodwill of the Rudd government and take more than they should for public housing services. Since coming to power, the Rudd government has done more to assist our most vulnerable than the previous government did in over a decade. This was the first substantial increase in pensions, and it took a Rudd Labor government to come up with that increase. What each state is doing on this front is yet to become crystal clear, but they should each be aware of the likely consequences of trying to exploit the needy in our community. Those pensioners deserve that increase, they deserve that extra amount of money, and to claw it back by increasing public housing rents I think is a very callous act. But we are yet to see this story fully played out. Another issue in my electorate is a Telstra issue. It has diminished the service it is making available to customers through MPs’ offices. I am not sure about other MPs in other states, but in my state of South Australia previously there were contact points within each electorate office to speak to and resolve constituents’ issues with Telstra. This particular service has been revoked and we have been told to only use email to put our complaints forward or to see how we can have a particular constituent’s inquiry investigated. The customer service people who used to take our calls and assist us were extremely helpful, but that service is no longer available to MPs-at least in South Australia. would be more than happy to show it to the member. It says that you should only email this particular department to resolve your issues and that they are not taking phone calls. So again Telstra have revamped their assistance services to reduce the direct customer contact that MPs’ offices can have; it is indicative of a company which has an attitude that betrays a disrespect for customers, a disregard of quality service and an orientation towards working behind closed doors-out of sight, out of earshot and removed from those they preferred not to be associated too closely with. Telstra has incited frustration for years. We saw the frustration it has caused the many pensioners when it wanted to charge them $2 if they did not have an internet service to receive their bills. I have raised this before. Even though there is an application they can make not to be charged the $2 if they do not have the internet services, I think it is a callous company that wants to charge you for sending you a bill. I again praise the Rudd government for taking Telstra to task as it currently is and for challenging the effective monopoly that they have not just enjoyed but cynically exploited by any means conceivable. I look forward to the fibre-optic cable rollout and constituents’ access to an alternative network of infrastructure that will deliver to them the service that they deserve. In the last minute or so that I have left, I say that this government has also been good enough to make available funds for the replacement of an important piece of transport infrastructure in the Glenelg area of my electorate: the King Street Bridge. This conflict has been ever present with the residents, council and state governments. Some want it replaced, and I am glad that it will be soon. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",236,Grievance Debate
253,Mr Lindsay,That is not right; I have immediate contact with Telstra.,238,Grievance Debate
254,Mr Georganas,"This letter came through my office. I received it last week and ITelstra Herbert Electorate: Douglas Arterial Road it tonight, where the member for Hindmarsh has misled this chamber. I say to the member for Hindmarsh: I have open access to Telstra any time night or day. I am able to solve Telstra’s customers’ problems immediately. It is a great service, it is a great Australian company and it does not deserve the treatment that it is getting from the Australian Labor Party. I will tell the member for Hindmarsh how I do it later on. In North Queensland-I represent in the parliament Australia’s largest tropical city-road infrastructure has always been a very significant issue. We have long distances. We are a long way from our capital city. In fact, my city is further north of Brisbane than Canberra is south of Brisbane. There are long road distances to travel and our people are always very interested in road issues. And so it was that in the city of Townsville I identified a very significant new road project: the Douglas Arterial Road. It was to link the upper Ross suburbs over the river to the hospital, the university and Lavarack Barracks. It was ultimately to become part of the bypass of Townsville. You would not believe the fight that I had with the state government to get that project built. Despite the state government saying that, if I delivered this from the federal government then they would do this every time. I delivered something, they then wanted more. It went on and on. Fortunately, I prevailed, because I was not going to give up. We built the Douglas arterial and, as soon as it opened, it was an extraordinary success and probably one of the best road projects that has ever been built in the city of Townsville. However, in 2004 I saw that the Douglas arterial should be extended to the Bruce Highway, going to the north of the city, and this would complete the Townsville ring road. Nobody was talking about it; nobody thought that it was possible. People wanted the port access road built, but I knew that the benefit-cost ratio of building the port access road was less than one, meaning we would have to spend more money than what it would actually save the community. But the benefit-cost ratio of building the Townsville ring road, connecting to the Douglas arterial, was eight. In other words, it delivered eight times the benefit of the cost that was put in to build the road. It was a no-brainer. I promoted that as an election promise at the 2004 election. The chamber of commerce, the Townsville Enterprise and the city council all reacted in horror and said to me, ‘How could you do this?’ But I knew that it would a huge success for the city-and we built it. When it opened, the people from the northern beaches, the people coming from the north to the south and the people going from the south to the north found that it cut a lot of time off the journey and that it was a high-speed motorway, the first motorway in North Queensland. It was an outstanding success. However, sometimes when you succeed, you have unintended consequences. The unintended consequence in this case was that the Douglas arterial, which I had fought to have built two or three years earlier, could not carry the extra volume. So at the last election I said, ‘I will find the money to four-lane the Douglas arterial.’ That was very well received, because everybody knew that that was what had to be done. Fortunately, the Australian Labor Party matched my promise to four-lane it. So they were locked in and it did not matter which government was going to get elected; we were going to get the four-laning of the Douglas arterial for Townsville. MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Grievance Debate
255,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.07 Pm),"Labor hates Telstra. We have seen more evidence ofHave we got it? The answer is no. What is interesting is that federal funding was provided for this project as promised in the 2008 budget. It was then re-announced in the 2009 budget. So now, nearly 18 months after the first announcement, construction is yet to begin. That has really let down our city, and it is interesting that, representing one of the state electorates in the area, we have the state Minister for Main Roads, the member for Thuringowa. In a press release from Minister Albanese and the Queensland Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, of 16 September 2009, Minister Albanese reported that the Douglas arterial duplication was ‘running ahead of schedule’. I beg your pardon? Ahead of schedule? It was promised in the budget in 2008. Not a sod has yet been turned, but it is ‘running ahead of schedule’. That is why I aggrieve here tonight in this grievance debate. It is wrong to give our community an expectation that we will build this and then not start the project. Another press release from Minister Albanese, this one on 16 June 2009, talked about ‘vital nation building legislation passed’. The minister said: … upgrading Australia’s transport network is central to the Government’s nation building agenda and essential to the country’s international competitiveness. The projects referred to included the Douglas arterial upgrade. Given the vital nature of this project, and the fact that both federal and state funding has been allocated, I ask the question: why hasn’t it proceeded? We all know as members of parliament that the current government has very much talked up the nation building, the infrastructure and the stimulus package. Well, hello, where is the stimulus in not building anything? I think it is a fair question. I think we are all embarrassed that we have not been able to deliver. I am embarrassed, as the local member; and the government is embarrassed, as the provider of funding. In response to a question I asked the minister in June this year regarding the progress of the duplication, he informed me that construction would commence this year in the third quarter. Well, hello, we are in the fourth quarter and no construction has been commenced. Gosh, that is sad. Gosh, that is tough for my community. When you have these long standing commitments it is very difficult to explain to the community that construction has not begun. Today in question time the minister told the House that apparently the government was getting on with the job: ‘Infrastructure development will remain at the heart of the government’s economic policy.’ Not building anything is not the heart of a government economic policy, I would suggest. The minister is saying one thing and doing another and despite publicly committing to infrastructure development, the minister has allowed the Douglas arterial duplication to be pushed further back on the agenda. Clearly, Labor’s stated commitment to nation building is all talk and no action. I demand that the minister review this; I demand that we get cracking on this much, much needed duplication of the Douglas arterial to stop the traffic problems that are there. In the two minutes I have available to me I would also like to mention the issue of the PET scanner in Townsville, the nuclear scanning machine that easily detects cancers very quickly. There are no PET scanners in North Queensland and once again we are being short-changed in a regional area. We should have a PET scanner in Australia’s largest tropical city. On 22 February 2008 I moved a private member’s bill in the House calling on the government to match a commitment offered by a private X-ray business to install a PET scanner. Their offer to the government was extraordinarily generous: ‘We will pay half the capital cost-$2 milMAIN COMMITTEE lion.’ The Queensland health department strongly backed this particular proposal. They want to use a PET scanner just as much as anybody else wants to use a PET scanner. Recently Craig Wallace, the member for Thuringowa and Minister for Main Roads, whose electorate is also where this PET scanner will be installed, said that he would lead a delegation to Canberra to see the Minister for Health and Ageing. I immediately wrote to Craig saying, ‘Count me in. I’ll get you an appointment with the minister.’ That was a month ago and I have not heard a word from him. Mr Wallace, you are a populist politician. You need to have actions not words, just like all of us need to have actions and not words. We need to deliver a PET scanner for our community in the interests of their health and I ask that you move with me on this. Together we will see the Minister for Health and Ageing and together we will get a PET scanner for Townsville. Executive Remuneration of remuneration that are now being paid by some of Australia’s leading public companies to their chief executive officers and other senior executives. On9 September this year I spoke on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Terminations Payments) Bill 2009 and at the time. I noted there was a great deal of public concern not only with executive termination payments but also with salary and total remuneration packages as well. In fact, for the past few years there has been a regular outcry from shareholder groups, journalists, unions, workers and mum and dad investors about the extraordinary payments made to senior company executives. It seems that executive salaries are growing at an exponential rate and that poor company performance has little relation to bonuses and termination payments. Interestingly, recent research from a range of developed nations conducted amongst company directors indicates that many directors also feel that CEO remuneration is obscene and out of control-an interesting choice of words. Since the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Terminations Payments) Bill 2009 was introduced into the House we have seen the release of the Productivity Commission’s draft report into executive remuneration in Australia. This report contains some very alarming figures highlighting the growth of chief executive officer remuneration in Australia between 1993 and 2007. It shows that CEO remuneration at Australia’s 50 to 100 largest companies grew by up to 300 per cent between 1993 and 2007 and that remuneration for CEOs of Australia’s top 20 companies averaged almost $10 million for the year 200708. If you think about that figure of $10 million: that is more than 150 times the average wage. It would take a working life of 150 years to get one year’s salary. The average wage at the moment, MTAWE, is $1,280 per week. CEOs of the next 20 biggest companies were paid around $5 million per annum. That is only about 75 times the average wage! Much of the total sum of these payments is in the form of short-term incentives or better known to the rest of us as bonuses. So whilst it might not seem, in some cases, that the actual base salary has gone up all that much, you do have to look at the total package. When you look at the total package you can see the growth that has occurred over the yearscontinuously. When it comes to bonuses, there is plenty of evidence that they are not linked to company profitability as they continue to rise year after year as company fortunes rise and fall. Look at Telstra whose former CEO, Sol Trujillo, is a prime example. He was paid by TelMAIN COMMITTEE",239,Grievance Debate
256,Mr Symon (Deakin) (9.17 Pm),"My grievance today relates to the astronomical levelsstra, a so-called golden handshake of $3 million on his termination. Yet Telstra share prices did not perform brilliantly when Sol Trujillo was there. If my memory serves me correctly, they actually dropped to about two dollars per share during his tenure. It is certainly hard to find a member of my community who was happy with the service Telstra provided when Mr Trujillo ran the show. He cut services, he cut contacts and he cut the range of people you could talk to about getting problems fixed. Customers lost out while senior executives raked the money in. For many companies executive remuneration has increased despite poor performance and it is no wonder that the community regards such payments as greedy and outrageous. Professor David Peats supports this point in his submission to the Senate inquiry into the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Termination Payments) Bill 2009 noting a range of research over the past few years that shows increased pay despite lower levels of performance. So often we hear the excuse that these executive salaries must be paid as we are competing in a global market. The payment of incentive pay without properly defined targets, which appears to have been imported from the US, is one practice that should be targeted for much greater scrutiny. It is not only shareholders who are footing this bill of the greedy few, it is also the rest of us, the consumers of Australia, who pay higher costs for goods and services to line the pockets of a few select corporate fat cats. The vast majority of Australians are shareholders in ASX listed companies in two major ways. The ASX has reported that 6.7 million Australians-41 per cent of the adult population-own shares either directly or through unlisted managed funds. When that figure is considered with the 11.6 million Australians over the age of 15 who have superannuation coverage then the size of the interest in locally listed company performance and remuneration practices can be understood. Superannuation funds often invest in shares, making every person who has a superannuation account a shareholder. Every oversized salary or remuneration package paid by companies at the rates I have already described is ultimately a drain on shareholder and superannuation returns. It is ordinary people’s futures that big company executives are playing with. But the question that bothers me even more than the current level of CEO remuneration packages is: what happens in the future? At what stage does this exponential growth in CEO and executive salaries stop? If 150 times the average weekly wage is regarded as fair then why not 1,000 times? Why not even more? Until recently, I, along with many other people, regarded Australia as a fair and egalitarian society. But with payments like that to executives, I think that view is rapidly receding as those at the top of the tree continue to pull further and further away from the average. And while executive salaries accelerate, those very same executives argue that the working people who produce the goods and provide the whiteand blue-collar services should consistently receive lower rises, if any, year after year. It must be galling for low-income earners, some of whom obviously work in companies run by these senior executives, to hear these corporations argue that their wages should be frozen. It would also be particularly disheartening for shareholders who are suffering from reduced dividends and share values from the current global financial crisis. As we know, there is no direct brake on executive remuneration. Remuneration committees, formed by companies, recommend payment amounts, but it falls to shareholders to have a say, with a non-binding vote, on a company’s remuneration report at the annual general MAIN COMMITTEE meeting. It is worth noting that on 12 October the Sydney Morning Herald described 2008 as ‘a watershed year for protest votes on remuneration reports at annual general meetings’. And even when there is a substantial shareholder revolt against executive salaries, such as the 43 per cent of shareholders who voted against the remuneration report at Qantas’s recent annual general meeting, there are always vast numbers of proxy votes from other institutional shareholders to protect the status quo. Qantas is not the only example. At Downer EDI’s AGM earlier this month, 59 per cent of shareholders voted against the remuneration report. Shareholders rebuked this company for deliberately lowering its performance standards under its plans for executive bonuses. Again, this was noted in a recent Sydney Morning Herald report. I welcome the Productivity Commission’s draft report into executive remuneration in Australia. I hope that both this report and the final report will lead to a real and public debate about what can be done to curb such massive payments to corporate executives and help our country return to a fairer way of rewarding work for each and every worker in Australia. bate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Main Committee adjourned at 9.28 pm MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Grievance Debate
257,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"There being no further grievances, the deKimberley: Trawl Fisheries (Question No. 865) Mr Haase asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Is the escalation and expansion of the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) bottom fish trawling in the Kimberley waters, supported by and under the management of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), consistent with (a) Government, and (b) AFMA, environmental and ecological sustainability policies; if so, how; if not, why not. (2) Why is the delineating line, first set under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement agreement, for the NWSTF and the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery under review to be changed when the review of this boundary position and the location in which it is finally determined to lie will have a significant impact on the marine ecological environment that the Government is trying to protect. (3) Can the Minister guarantee that the NWSTF and Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDTF) boundary change will not have adverse effects on the environment; if not, why not. (4) Does the Minister (a) support the repositioning of the boundaries, and (b) guarantee the repositioning (i) will not adversely affect the marine stocks, (ii) takes into account that the marine environment is an ecosystem, (iii) is sensitive to the scientific knowledge and fishing history gathered since originally defining the line, and (iv) supports the purpose of the boundary in separating the two fisheries. (5) If ecologically sustainable development and environmental responsibility require separating these fisheries according to ocean floor type-the fundamental purpose of the boundary-how will the Minister commit to looking into and acting on the matter of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement and the NWSTF and WDTF boundaries to ensure that any change is consistent with this aim. (1) (a) I am advised by the department that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority’s (AFMA) management of the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) is consistent with government policies and environmental and ecological sustainability objectives. AFMA temporarily closed a part of the existing fishery until 13 October 2009 to prevent trawling by Commonwealth vessels adding additional fishing pressure to fish stocks targeted by WA trap and line fishers. AFMA extended this closure on 8 October 2009 until 31 December 2010 on the basis of continuing concerns over additional fishing pressure. Whilst the closure is in place AFMA will negotiate catch sharing arrangements with WA. In addition, AFMA has proposed new boundaries for the NWSTF to ensure consistency with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangements between the Commonwealth and Western Australian (WA) governments. The original intention of the OCS agreement was that the NWSTF takes place in waters seaward of the 200 metre depth contour. The boundaries of the fishery were gazetted in 1995. However, with improved mapping precision it has been discovered that the gazetted boundary does not track the 200 metre depth contour in a number of places. AFMA is therefore seeking to amend the boundary as described in the OCS agreement. This proposal is consistent with government policy agreed in an exchange of letters between the then Western Australian Fisheries Minister and the then Commonwealth Fisheries Minister in September 2007. Implementation of this proposed change will result in a net reduction in the area open to trawling and restrict overlap of State and Commonwealth fishing activities on tropical snapper stocks.",243,Grievance Debate
258,Mr Burke,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) I am advised by the department that the proposed trawl boundary amendments within the OCS are consistent with AFMA environmental and ecological sustainability policies. The fishery is managed by AFMA in accordance with Commonwealth Government policies, including the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy policy and Commonwealth Bycatch policy. An ecological risk assessment has also been completed for the fishery. The NWSTF is also assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) in accordance with the Australian Government Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries. The fishery is declared an approved Wildlife Trade Operation under the EPBC Act. (2) I am advised by the department that the fishery boundary line is under review in order to more accurately reflect the Offshore Constitutional Settlement arrangements as described at answer 865, 1(a). When implemented, the new boundary will result in a net reduction in the area open to trawling. Management measures described at answer 865, 1(b) ensure that the new fishery boundaries will not have a significant impact on the marine ecological environment. (3) See response at answer 865, 2 in relation to the NWSTF. I am unable to comment on the environmental impact from fishing in the adjacent WA-managed Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery. The proposed boundary change will result in a small increase in the area available to trawling in the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery, consistent with the intent of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement arrangements. No adverse effects from trawling have been detected in this large but lightly fished fishery to date. I am advised that AFMA will continue to manage the fishery in accordance with Commonwealth Government policies, including the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy policy and Commonwealth Bycatch policy. I am advised that AFMA will also put in place precautionary management measures to address any risks to the environment. I am advised that AFMA will liaise with the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and the Western Australian Department of Fisheries in developing any new management arrangements resulting from the proposed boundary change. (4) (a) I support the repositioning of fishery boundaries to align trawl boundaries with water depths as intended in the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangement and to restrict potential overlapping fishing activities. (4) (b) Previously answered in response to question 865, 1, 2 and 3. I am advised that AFMA will take the issues covered in (i), (ii) and (iii) into account in implementing management arrangements for the fishery. (iv) The purpose of the proposed repositioning of the trawl boundaries is to accurately reflect the intent of the OCS arrangement. I am advised that the access of WA fishers is unchanged, and they may continue to fish with non-trawl methods beyond 200 metre depths within the boundaries of the Commonwealth trawl fisheries. (5) State and Commonwealth fisheries are separated by a boundary representing the 200m depth contour for trawling only, regardless of ocean floor type. The Commonwealth manages waters seaward of the 200 metre depth contour for trawling only, WA manages other fisheries from the coast out to the edge of the Australian Fishing Zone. AFMA has extended the closure in the NWSTF until 31 December 2010 while catch sharing arrangements are negotiated with WA. This closure will prevent trawling by Commonwealth vessels adding additional fishing pressure to fish stocks targeted by WA trap and line fishers. Kimberley: Trawl Fisheries (Question No. 867) Mr Haase asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Why have the many thousands of square kilometres of sustainably managed State fisheries of demersal scalefish (found on sponge and coral bottom) been opened to Commonwealth managed trawling, when a temporary closure to Commonwealth licensed trawling in the Kimberley was implemented by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) in 2007. (2) Can the Minister guarantee that opening the Kimberley to Commonwealth licensed trawling will not have adverse effects on the environment; if not, why not. (3) Can the Minister guarantee that the AFMA’s decision to open the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery (NDSF) fishing grounds in the Kimberley to Commonwealth trawling will not lead to the closure of the NDSF as a result of depleted supply; if not, why not. (1) No additional areas have been opened to trawling. A temporary closure implemented in 2007 in the North West Slope Trawl Fishery has been extended by AFMA until 31 December 2010. Catch sharing arrangements will be developed with WA and a proposed amendment to the Offshore Constitutional Settlement would permanently remove this area from the Commonwealth trawl fishery. (2) I have answered this question. See Question 1, House of Representatives Question No. 865. (3) I am not the Minister responsible for regulation of the WA state fishery, the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery. Kimberley: Trawl Fisheries (Question No. 869) Mr Haase asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Has the Minister read the email sent on 10 June 2009 at 4.17 p.m. by Mr Paul Murphy, Acting Executive Manager of Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), to Mr Bob Masters of the Kimberley Professional Fishermen’s Association, entitled WestMAC Meeting today; if so, does the Minister support the views of, and approach taken by, Mr Murphy; if so, why. (2) Is the Minister aware that 400 kilograms of Goldband Snapper was thrown over the side of a North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) trawler in just one morning, with an AFMA observer on board; if so, does he support such action. (3) What controls are in place to help facilitate environmentally sustainable and responsible management of fisheries trawling demersal scalefish on coral/sponge bottom in the Kimberley waters. (4) Has an Ecological Risk Assessment been conducted by AFMA for the NWSTF and the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery on trawling damage to benthos; if not, why not. (1) No. This is a matter for Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). (2) No. This is a matter for AFMA. (3) See response at 865 1b.",244,Questions In Writing
259,Mr Burke,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,246,Questions In Writing
260,Mr Burke,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) AFMA advises that both fisheries have had Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) undertaken by CSIRO. Two ERAs assessed the effects of fishing upon target, by-product and threatened, endangered and protected (TEP) species and direct and indirect impacts of trawling on habitats and communities. Boat Building Standards (Question No. 875) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Why is there no Australian Boat Building Standard (ABBS). (2) Is he aware that the absence of an ABBS has created a situation where some boats are built to United States standards, and others to no standards. (1) Recreational boating standards are the responsibility of the state and Northern Territory governments. The mandatory requirements are on the web site of the National Marine Safety Committee at www.nmsc.gov.au. The National Marine Safety Committee advises that the elements of those standards that are essential to the safety of the boat users have been made mandatory by the state governments as a prerequisite for a new boat to be sold or registered. (2) Recreational boats destined for export to the US market have to be built to US safety standards in order to comply with the US federal regulation (CFR 33), just as any other product exported to the US must meet that country’s laws.
