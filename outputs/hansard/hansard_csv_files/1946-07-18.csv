What action is proposed hy the Minister for the enforcement of this instruction? because dismissals at the Royal Navy stores are being carried out in accordance with an order issued by the Commonwealth Government. Naturally, I do not know what happened at the meeting last night of the Sydney branch executive of the Engine-drivers and Firemen's Union.

9,Mr Ward,"The honourable memberfair-minded person will recognize that this Government' has dealt very fairly and generously with these people. The Government has decided in respect of -pension payments to treat the 'dependants of civilians who lost their lives in the territories in the same manner as it treats dependants of deceased members of the services. With regard to other benefits which would accrue to them under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, the Government is now examining certain difficulties which have arisen iii that respect. At the moment, endeavours arc being made to extend the education facilities to the children of such people and, wherever possible, give them the equivalent of whatever benefits are made available under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. If the deceased civilians were at the time of their death members of the Public Service of the Territories, their dependants receive superannuation payments in addition to the pensions provided by this Government under the scheme already referred to. The honourable member may rest assured that this Government will continue to do everything possible to assist the dependants of those who lost their lives in the circumstances which he mentioned. attention to an undoubted anomaly in the distribution of drought relief to cerealgrowers, in as much as it debars a wheat grower of -20 or 30 years' standing from participation in this' relief, merely because, through no fault of his own, he was prevented from sowing wheat in 1944. others returning from war work who have sown their first crop cannot participate in the relief. Is the Minister favorable to such growers receiving this benefit, and will the Government provide 50 per cent, of the cost of their participation ? drought relief, and the technical difficulties that have arisen in respect of this matter, are entirely the concern of the State authorities, who could approach the Commonwealth Government regarding it. The whole position will be ex-amined further, and a reply will be given to the honourable member later. the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether an indication could be given as to how soon the passenger and cargo service between Sydney and Hobart would be re-established. That service ceased during the war period, and Hobart merchants are placed at a great disadvantage. Is the Minister now in a position to state when the service will be renewed ? ber will be aware that, with one exception, all ships on that run were taken over by the Government for troop-carrying purposes. Some of the vessels are still engaged in that work, and others have been returned, but a fairly lengthy period is required for their overhaul to make them fit to resume service in the coastal trade. The Minister for Supply and Shipping is doing all he can to expedite these overhauls. . AlthoughI understand that he is not able to state when the service will be resumed, it is hoped that in the near future additional ships will be available for that purpose. MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL.

It has remained on the notice-paper ever since, and I had hoped that long ere this the House would have had an opportunity to. place on record its grateful admiration of the outstanding leadership, inspired courage and dogged tenacity by which the Right Honourable Winston Spencer Churchill brought the peoples of the British Commonwealth of Nations out of the abyss of 1940, through the terrors and tribulations of 1941 and 1942, to the victories of 1943 and 1944, and the complete and glorious European triumph of 1945. Now, however, I do not expect that this Parliament, which represents the people of Australia, willhave an opportunity to pay this necessary tribute to the greatest man which the British Empire has produced during the last century, perhaps the greatest, indeed, who has ever served the cause of civilization.

What is the exact relationship of Dr. Simonds's work to the Government's official immigration programme? Has any specific quota been allotted to Dr. Simonds, and what conditions have been attached? Does the Minister not believe that it is highly desirable that the selection of migrants should be strictly free from sectarian significance? Will the Minister lay on the table of the House all papers relating to the visit of Dr. Simonds to Europe? honourable member should have asked a question on this subject without having first consulted me.

20,Mr Calwell,"I regret that theis at present in London, and I did everything to facilitate his departure. The Lady Northcote Homes Trust is the only body which has, so far, put forward any real proposals for the development of its work, and the Government has given every encouragement to it. A subcommittee of Cabinet, consisting of five Ministers, was appointed to consider giving to this purely secular body financial assistance towards any capital expenditure that might be incurred by it in the extension of its work. The sub-committee devised a plan which has since been submitted to the State Government of Victoria asking for its cooperation, and I am happy to say that the Government of that State is prepared to help also. As a principle, the Commonwealth Government has decided to contribute on a £1 for £1 basis for approved capital expenditure to any organization, whether religious or secular, prepared to do something to bring British children to Australia. I have not made any special arrangement with Dr. Simonds or any other Catholic dignitary, or, indeed, any dignitary of any other church, but I would be glad to help all churches which are prepared to do as much as the Lady Northcote Homes Trust proposes to do, in order to bring British children to Australia. Sir not British children, but Continental children. for newspaper statements in regard to visits by any persons to European countries to bring child migrants to Australia. The view of the Government, after an exhaustive inquiry, is that there will be very few child migrants to come here from anywhere. The Government originally had a proposal to bring 50,000 British children to Australia, but, happily it found that there was not that number of orphan children resulting from the aerial bombing of Great Britain or from enemy submarine warfare. Only between 3,000 and 4,000 children who were so orphaned are available in Great Britain, and the United Kingdom Government, with pardonable pride, claims that they are its responsibility and are not available for migration to other countries. T ask honourable members to bear with me if my reply is rather lengthy, because some unfair implications are associated with the question of the honourable member for Parramatta. In conclusion, I say that there is practically no government in Europe to-day with which the Commonwealth Government, or any religious or secular organization in this country, can deal in regard to the migration of orphan children to Australia. during a discussion in this House regarding the partial prohibition of the transport of cattle from the Northern Territory, the Minister for the Interior promised that a cattle dip would be established at or near Alice Springs. I understand that the dip has not yet been provided and that there has been a conference between representatives of South Australia and the Administrator of the Northern Territory on the subject. I now ask the Minister for the Interior whether such a conference has been held and, if so, whether he has any information to give to the House? tion made by the Administrator of the conference should be held between officers of the Department of the Interior and representatives of the South Australian Government, the Chief Veterinary Officer, Colonel Rose, was sent to Alice Springs to investigate and report upon the need for such a conference. I assure the honourable member that special attention has been given to the problem, and I am certain that the difficulty which has arisen as the result of the prohibition imposed by the South Australian Government will be overcome.

However, I say definitely that it was the unanimous wish of all interested parties, including the municipal authority and growers in the district, that the store should be erected at the earliest possible date.

I hope conservation. needed in our national economy-water , hydro-electric plant manufacturers. There is wide scope for the use of giant earthmoving machinery, which can be purchased overseas if it is not available in this country. Each undertaking would increase industrial development and transport over a wide area. Fresh timber mills would be opened, mining ventures would be initiated, and our latent wealth would be tapped. On the coast, and throughout the water-starved areas of our vast interior, water conservation schemes would develop Australia, bringing to it wealth and prosperity, increasing its population, and ensuring the winning of crops which had been sown and the marketing of stock which to-day is lost, in one drought alone, to the value of £100,000,000. There is no "" argument against the production' of wealth by the conservation of water. I cannot recite all the possibilities, but I can mention some of our accomplishments. Victoria,. with an area of '87,884 square miles, is the smallest and most densely populated and yet . the most water-conservation minded of all the States. It is an example of the wealth that can be gained by means of irrigation. It has the Mildura, the Goulburn Eiver, the Murray River, and many more schemes, which to-day make prosperous those who live in the districts in which irrigation is available. For an expenditure of £15,000,000, the production of the last three or four years has heen £12,000,000 a year. Realizing that the farmers should not be required to bear the whole of the burden of the cost of construction, especially of the headworks of such undertakings, the State wiped off £12,500,000 of the total expenditure. In the areas of Victoria served'by irrigation projects, there is no loss from drought and only gain results from the labours of the primary producer. An area of 100 acres of irrigated land carries a dairy herd of 70 milch cows and their offspring, which do not fail to produce year in and year out. While droughts beset the greater part of Queensland and Western Australia, the irrigated parts of Victoria produce to the maximum degree, their production comparing favourably with that of any other part of the world. The primary producers in those parts have security. During the last drought, 1,000,000 sheep [08] were saved in a small area between Shepparton and Kerang, measuring 110 miles by 40 miles, not all of which is irrigated. The settlers in .that district are also engaged in fruit-growing, dairying and lamb-raising. No other country in the world could compete with Queensland, with its warmer climate and longer seasons, the growing period in some parts of it extending throughout the year, if it were irrigated. It is the only country in the world in which white men produce tropical fruits such as pineapples, bananas and paw-paws, and grow sugar-cane and cotton, as well as contributing to the general requirements of commerce. In Victoria, the Goulburn Valley scheme is being enlarged. Thecapacity of the Eildon Weir will be' increased to provide for nearly seven times greater production and wealth than at present. Blueprints are being prepared by no less an authority than Mr Jack Savage, the engineer from the United States of America who was called to this country to report on the damage that had occurred to the Burrinjuck Dam in New South Wales. He is the expert who planned the Boulder Dam on the Colorado River to benefit 5,000,000 people. This is the. world's biggest structure of the kind, having a present hydroelectric capacity of 2,500,000 kilowatts. He also designed the Shasta Dam in the United States of America, which is the world's second largest dam. But these are babies compared with a huge dam on the Yangtze 'River, of which' Mr Savage has prepared, blueprints, and which is destined to supply the water required by 144.000,000 people in China, and to put an end to the misery and poverty of 450,000,000 people. This scheme will impound the water of that great river for a distance of 250 miles, and yield 10,500,000 kilowatts, being ten times greater than the Boulder Dam. The manufacture of the electrical equipment required' for this undertaking will keep the largest factories 'of the United' States of America occupied for 24 years. [Extension of time granted.] Mr Savage, who was secured on loan from the United States of America, for service in Australia, similarly served the governments of India and Afghanistan while World War II . was raging. In New South ""Wales, plans are being prepared for a further expenditure of £30,000,000 on water storage, apart from the scheme on the Clarence River suggested by the right. honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). The needs of Queensland and of Australia generally call for the services of an authority like Mr Savage, or Mr Sloan, who is working on the great Missouri Valley scheme, which is to provide 90 dams at a cost of $1,257,000,000 with seventeen hydro-elecan attempt to provide evidence for his "" trie plants generating 4,000,000 kilowatts constituents that he occasionally jpeaks for farms and factories. This dam will provide . irrigation for an additional 4,760,000 acres of farm land and 538,000. acres now occupied by struggling people. Other great schemes for water conservation could be mentioned. The fact that rivers occur in Australia for the most part throughout the continent is of advanlatitudes similar to those of Australia, tage, and no scheme should be regarded as too small. In the Wide Bay and Burnett areas, there arc requests and plans for water storage on the Mary River and its tributaries In some cases in ' this chamber for eighteen years', the tributaries are always running, and a valuable opportunity is afforded for the governments of a political colour from storage of much-needed supplies. There are great catchment areas, particularly in the hills. Similar opportunities for conservation occur along the Burnett River and its tributaries, including the Barambah. River, which passes through fertile farm lands. Some use is now made of this water, and there are good opportunities for large storages between this area and the junction of the Barambah with the Burnett. The Barambah, for part of its course, runs constantly through a rugged gorge which would provide facilities, such as an engineer might years when the honourable member kept dream about, for. the establishment of hydro-electric plants. Transmission lines could be fed with electricity for hundreds of miles, and water could be made available for use both above and below the clam. The Burnett proposal was reported on 40 years ago. I urge the appointment' ofan expert authority to report further on this scheme, with a view to a great increase in water conservation in that part of Queensland, with the consequent development of latent wealth. This would put an end to the privations of the men and women on the land in those areas to-day. Mr Bernard Corser. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.37] -An examination of a text of the motion would lead me to believe that the action of the honorable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) is either the result of a desire on his part to delay the consideration of more important matters which are engaging the attention of the House, or in this chamber. He has raised this matter as one of great urgency. It is true that the effects of drought are devastating to the economy of this country, and that, as the result of it, many people from time to time suffer extreme hardships. But in countries located in droughts have been experienced from the beginning of time, and have occurred at intervals of about seven years. The honourable member has occupied a seat during eleven of which he supported that different of the Government now in power; but during those eleven years he did not raise the matter which he now says is of great urgency. The Minister was not in this country at that time. country longer than the honourable member has been in this Parliament. Not only is' that the case, but during the eleven silent about the matter, plenty of resources were available for the very purposes to which he now refers. During the late ""twenties,"" and also in the ""thirties"" there were in this country, and army of unemployed and unused resources of different kinds which could have been profitably availed of for the purposes mentioned by the honourable member. But during all those years he remained silent.'

As a matter of fact, at a conference held only the other day on the subject of the diversion of the Snowy River, when it was decided that the Commonwealth should undertake certain investigations, I had to make it a condition that the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria should provide, trained men for the work. By using the word ""authority"" in the phrase ""'expert Commonwealth authority"" the honourable member sought to convey the impression that the Commonwealth Parliament had power to legislate in regard to these matters. Mr F-ADDEST -What about the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research? ber speaks with his tongue in his cheek.

62,Mr Dedman,"I say now that the already said that the Government has not the State .Government has prepared plans for water conservation schemes throughout the whole of the south-west of the State, and they are now being discussed by representatives of the State and of the Commonwealth. an intensive investigation has been made, and. plans have been prepared by the Queensland Government. It is not the function of the Commonwealth Government' to make surveys in the various States, and to prepare plans of the kind. I have mentioned. The proper procedure has been laid down at Premiers conferences, and it has been followed through at meetings.of the National Works Council, which was inaugurated as far back as 1943. The understanding between the Commonwealth and the States is that major projects will be brought forward through' the Co-ordinator-General of Works to the National Works Council for examination. I have before me a document which is confidential because it was sent in the first place to the National Works Council. . It shows' clearly that the Government of Queensland has submitted a number of detailed proposals to the National Works Council for consideration. It must have done this a considerable time ago, because the note which I have on the proposals indicates that they could not be proceeded with at the time because we were then still at war,, and there were more urgent works to which available supplies of labour and material had to be directed"". I cannot enter into details of how far the plans have progressed, or what final decisions have been made by the Queensland Government on matters of priority, but the plans include the damming of the Mingoola-Dumaresq, Severn, Dawson, Fitzroy and Burdekin Rivers. It is clear, therefore, that the Government of Queensland, the State which the honprable member as'sists to represent, has prepared all the detailed plans for which he has asked. The honourable member offered no suggestion as to how these works should be financed. Here, again, the procedure to be followed is clearly laid down; money for these works must be obtained through the Loan Council. Some of the projects which the honourable member suggested should be investigated have already Mr Dedman. been examined by State governments and discussed by the Loan Council. I suggest that when the honourable member moved his motion he was not aware of all that has been done. ter name one project that has been discussed by the Loan Council? of that body, but I know what projects have been discussed by it because of my association with the National Works Council. Many of the projects in Queensland to which the honourable member referred this morning have already been discussed. The plans of the State governments in. co-operation with the Commonwealth Government cover adequately all that the honourable member wants done. As I have said, the Commonwealth Government has already done what he suggests should be done. said that the Commonwealth Government had not the power to do these things. as the Commonwealth Government has authority to do these things, it had done a great deal in co-operation with the States. The major portion of the work has been performed by the States, but their efforts have been retarded by reason of the fact that many of their trained men were absent with the fighting services. Many investigations have been carried out by the State Governments, and the plans have reached the stage that if considerable unemployment threatened in the near future it would be possible'to proceed with some of these schemes fairly quickly. They are, in -fact, a part of the GovernBurnett, ment's plan to provide full employment. I wish to make it clear that the Government has the utmost sympathy with those who have suffered from droughts. I believe that the action taken by the Commonwealth Government, iii conjunction with the State governments, to grant financial relief to those who have suffered from droughts during the last three or four years-is thoroughly appreciated by the primary producers of this country. Insofar as that aspect of the motion is concerned, I point out that recommendations have been made to the Government that drought relief should be placed on a better basis than has existed in the. past.",23,Water Conservation And Hydro Electric Schemes Formal Motion For Adjournment

Unfortunately, however, before the scheme was completed its propounder was so depressed by the hostile' criticism levelled against it that he committed suicide. The completion of the pipe line changed the history of Kalgoorlie arid district, converting it from a mining town into a position of pre-eminence in Western Australia. turned the tap in the pipe line that brought water to Kalgoorlie the miners threw their hats in the air in delight, regarding the water as ""more valuable than the gold in the earth below. The construction of to irrigate Wimmera is not beyond the bounds of possibility. It would increase the fertility of our marginal areas a hundredfold and would ensure at all times ample food for stock. And it would be a great aid to decentralization, an objective so eagerly sought after. The scheme I have propounded would so increase the productivity of the soil as to enable the ;great unused port of Portland to be -developed as the outlet for the products of the south-east of South Australia and the fertile areas in the Wimmera and Wannon electorates.' We should also do everything possible to develop the Murray Valley. It would be far better first to develop and increase the productivity of areas already under cultivation than to endeavour to hew a heritage out of drought-stricken and distant areas. By the development of the pipe-line system from decentralized water storage and the exploitation of the Murray Valley we shall enter a new era of progress. Such a scheme can be implemented only if the Oommonwealth and the State undertake the task jointly. be established authority same lines and having the same powers as the famous Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States of America.

Parliament of the present b ill is necessary to encourage re-establishment of the cotton-growing industry in Australia on question resolved in the a sound economic basis. In its report of the 15th October, 1945, at the conclusion'of a public inquiry, the Tariff Board made the following principal recommendation:(«) That bounty be granted for a period of two calendar years from the 1st January, 1947, at a rate having the same effect as a pre-war committee (Consideration of basic rate of 3id. per lb. of raw cotton of grades higher than "" strict good ordinary"" grade when the Liverpool spot price of American middling grade raw cotton J;in. per lb. bounty.

During the ten-year period, 1935-44, has declined from an annual average of bales for the 1945 cotton season. Such retrogression is due mainly to the extreme shortage of man-power and a changevernment from cotton to food, production. An incentive to the change-over was the",26,Water Conservation And Hydro Electric Schemes Formal Motion For Adjournment

72,Mr Forde (Capricornia,"Minister over urged by the Commonwealth Go""while about 5,000 bales will be required for the other industrial purposes. Apart from certain minor modifications, the basic rate of bounty recommended by the Tariff Board, that is, 3Jd. per lb. of high-grade raw cotton, is the same as that originally recommended by the board in November, 1933, and subsequently confirmed on several occasions. This was regarded by the Government as too low to be of any real assistance to the cotton-growing industry, and therefore has never beeu accepted by the Parliament. Tariff Board's recommendation were adopted, the result would probably be that most growers would abandon the industry as, in the event of any considerable decrease of overseas cotton prices, the returns to growers from sales of raw cotton in competition with imported cotton would be insufficient to enable them to carry on. Abandonment of the industry would involve the closing of ginneries and a cotton seed oil mill on which £160,575 has been invested. This plant is owned by the Queensland Cotton Board, which is a co-operative growers' organization. splendid service to the Queensland cot; ton-growers. The general manager is Mr J. D. Young, a very capable gentleman,, who succeeded Mr R. J. ""Webster when, he left to take the position of managing director of the Bradford Cotton Mills. Mr Young has made a close study of the cotton-growing industry and he and the.members of the board, which consists .cf cotton-growers, have devoted themselves to the interests of the industry tigations on general' irrigation and conin collaboration with the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland, the Queensland Government, the Commonwealth Minister for Trade and .Customs and representatives of cotton-growing districts regardless of the political party to which they may belong. Therefore, it is gratifying to me, as representative of a district where 85 per cent, of the cotton grown in Australia is produced, to find that this bill has been approved by the Government of. which I am a member and will . be approved, 1 believe, by the Parliament. by-products ' of raw cotton are of great economic value. A crop of 15,000 Mr Forde. bales of raw cotton would result in the production of the following principal comparatively by-products: -820 tons of edible cotton seed oil largely used in the production of bakers' shortening fats; and 3,000 tons of high protein cotton seed meal for stock feeding, particularly dairy cattle during periods of drought. Honourable members may recall that the 1940 raw cotton bounty legislation was associated with undertakings given by the Queensland Government that steps would be taken to improve efficiency by If the (#) converting the industry from dryfarming to irrigation by the most economic means for each selected locality. In this connection, cotton-growing under irrigation would probably result in a large increase of yield per acre with considerable reduction of production costs and improvement of the quality of raw cotton produced; (b) encouraging growers generally in the adoption of improved cultural practices; (c)'accelerating scientific work on plant breeding, measures to combat insect pests, plant diseases, soil tests and new problems likely -to be encountered with production The organization has given under irrigation. Since initiation of the cotton stimulation programme in 1939-40, the Queensland Government has spent the following sums up to the 30th June, 1945: £291,000 on investigations and research directly related to cotton production, -assistance to growers and provision of irrigation facilities, including pumping plants; £49,000 on water conservation and irrigation projects; £17,000 on invesstruction programme carried out mainly in the cotton-growing areas; a total of £357,000. Proposed irrigation works comprising 30 weirs, to be built during the immediate post-war period, are estimated to cost a further £296,000. Full implementation of the undertakings was prevented by war conditions beyond the control of the Queensland Government. The causes were mainly shortages of labour and materials. I note from consultations with the Premier of Queensland', Mr Hanlon, the The Treasurer of Queensland, Mr Larcombe, who represents Rockhampton, and the Minister for Lands, Mr A. Jones, M.L.A., that they are all cognizant and appreciative of the great importance of going right ahead with water conservation and irrigation 'schemes in order to make it possible for agriculturists in Queensland to step up production of raw cotton very substantially and, in addition, to carry on, of course, with the benefit of irriga' tion, other agricultural pursuits, and for dairy-farmers to go in for fodder conservation in good seasons to tide them over droughts like that through which they are unfortunately passing in the Queensland coastal dairying districts. I am pleased to note that the Queensland Government has already prepared tentative water schemes; They have been surveyed by the Bureau of Investigation over the last three years. They may have to give way for the time being to works of greater economic value; but I give full credit to the Queensland Government for the keen interest it has taken in the -matter of water conservation and irrigation. Now that the war is over they are pressing ahead with the, projects which, after proper investigation, Will be put to the Loan Council in August. I believe that approval will be given to the projects. .1 know that as the result of water conservation and irrigation we shall find that the production of raw cotton .will be more than trebled in many of the present cotton-growing districts and other districts that have not been exploited to the' f u l l ; utilization of the water of the Dumaresque Eiver will, I believe, benefit not only border districts of Queensland, but also New South Wales, and will make it possible for a big expansion of cotton-growing. In addition, in the electorate I represent, in the North Burnett district from Mundubbera to Monto up to the Dawes Range and in the Boyne,. Dawson and Callide Valleys many water conservation and irrigation projects can be developed under the scheme proposed by tlie Queensland Government. That Government and the cotton-growers can rest assured of the fullest co-operation on the part of the Commonwealth in the implementation of those projects, which I have no doubt will enable the industry to increase the production substantially. growers reside in the Minister's electorate ? question, which transcends consideration of any benefit which is likely to be gained by any electorate represented by any individual member of Parliament. I notice the chairman of the Queensland Cotton Board, "" Mr E. J. Basson, in the gallery, and I am sure that he realizes the national importance of the industry. Whilst Australian manufacturers require 65,000 bales of cotton, our production last year was only 1,300 bales.. Provided conservation and irrigation water-conservation and irrigation schemes be undertaken, the industry is capable of tremendous expansion. Any one who has been associated with closer settlement in Queensland can ' recall the days when pioneers in the Upper Burnett and Callide and Dawson Valleys, after clearing their land, planted cotton among the charred stumps, and obtained an early and ready return for their labour. They were thus enabled to 'purchase stock and engage in the dairying and pig-raising industries. Cotton-growing is essentially a small man's industry. Farmers in thosedistricts-will 'not need in the future to put all their eggs in one basket, but will be enabled to engage in a diversity of production. by the rotation of crops. Prior to 1941, the bounty on raw cotton was on a gradually reducing scale related to a Liverpool spot price of 6d. sterling per lb. and fluctuating conversely in accordance with changes in that price. This arrangement was not regarded by growers as offering any real sense of security, whereas the provision of a bounty in an amount sufficient to provide a guaranteed net return for high grade raw cotton, tends towards achieving stability and gives, some encouragement to farmers to incur capital expenditure on irrigation plants and other equipment necessary for improved methods of cultivation. Farmers in the areas I have mentioned, more than trebled their production of seed cotton as the result of water conservation and, irrigation. Recently, when I visited Bingerra in the Bundaberg area, I had an opportunityto see what had been accomplished by Messrs. Gibson and",27,Second Reading
73,Mr Harrison,Ho w many cotton,29,Second Reading
74,,"Mr Forde -This is a great nationalHowes, by damming the Burnett River and utilizing 10,000,000 gallons of water a day on the firm's plantation and on adjoining farms. They increased . the yield on their sugar plantations to 100 tons an acre in some parts, whilst the average over the whole of the plantations was 39 tons of cane an acre, compared with an average of22 tons an acre for all sugar areas in Queensland. I can see no reason why, with the aid of irrigation our cotton production could not be stepped up to a corresponding degree. The Liverpool cotton exchange closed on the 21st March, 1941, and is not likely to re-open during the life of the present United Kingdom Government, which has -u further four years' tenure of office. The ""JsTew York cotton exchange quotations iare not now regarded as suitable as a base for bounty linkage because export -sales are mainly effected in the United States of America on the average prices of the ten southern cotton markets, less an export subsidy of approximately four scents per lb. The resultant export prices ^therefore differ from New York quotations. Under existing conditions, with iselling prices of. Australian-grown raw cotton at 18d. per lb. basis c.i.f. spinners' ports, as fixed by the Prices Commissioner, a crop of 3,000 bales or higher would reduce overhead expenses associated withginning, classifying and handling, to such an extent that the net return to growers would most likely be 15d. or more perlb., thus relieving the Government of the payment of a bounty. It may be possible to obtain within the next few years an annual production . of 20,000 bales of raw cotton, thereby reducing further the costs of production with corresponding increases in the net returns to growers. With the stability that will be given to the industry by the payment of this bounty and the stimulus to production resulting from the provision of waterconservation and irrigation schemes, together with an incentive price in respect of the whole of the crop on the basis of the price of imported cotton, I have no. doubt that the production of raw cotton in Australia will be substantially increased. The Commonwealth will do everything it can to help the industry produce the whole of Australia's requireItr. 'Forde. inents. This achievement would help us in many ways, particularly by easing our position in respect of dollar exchange and transport difficulties. . We are .experiencing' considerable difficulty in obtaining supplies of raw cotton from other countries. India is averse to shipping cotton 'to Australia, whilst we find it very difficult to obtain supplies from the United States of America. In these circumstances we shall be compelled next year to purchase most of our cotton from Brazil. The Australian price , of overseas raw cotton comparable with that produced in Queensland, is now somewhat higher than the price at which the Prices Commissioner has authorized purchase of the Queensland crop, namely, 18d. per lb. basis c.i.f. spinners' ports. Raw cotton is admitted free of duty. In accordance with the existing prices stabilization scheme, both the Australian and the imported raw cotton are supplied . to spinne.rs for making yarns for hosiery, for weaving, and for certain high quality cordage, also for manufacture of combed yarns, at 14£d. per lb. There is therefore good reason for the continuance of bounty assistance. on raw cotton produced in Australia at the existing level as now proposed. The possibility of any considerable decrease in the price of imported raw cotton appears to be remote for three or four years at least. There is at present a world shortage of desirable types of raw cotton suitable for general spinning requirements with resultant high prices, and the Government of India, which is the second largest cotton producing country in the world, has prohibited .the export of raw cotton of 13 /ic-in. staple or longer. The extension of the period of the operation of the bounty, as now proposed, should' be recognized by growers and the appropriate State authorities as affording an excellent opportunity for the further development of plans with the express object of increasing efficiency and reducing production costs. In this connection, overseas experience proves clearly that production costs can be substantially reduced by producing raw cotton under irrigation. In the United States of America, Egypt, the Sudan, and several other countries, the yield per acre under irrigation has always been at least three times as high as the yield under dry-farming conditions. Similar results have been consistently -achieved in the comparatively small irrigated area in Queensland. Experience over many years in the cotton-growing districts of Queensland has proved that rainfall and other important climatic conditions are too variable and unreliable for the consistent economic production of raw cotton under dry-farming""conditions, -except in a comparatively few small areas. The Queensland Government fully realizes this fact, and it is hoped that the next year or two will witness a very marked advance in irrigation developments. Picking or harvesting costs in Australia are high, representing about 1.64d. per lb. of seed cotton, equivalent to approximately 4.7d. per lb. of raw cotton. The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock and the Queensland Cotton. Board have each purchased from the United States of America a mechanical cotton-picking machine. A light picker of another make recently developed in that country has been ordered by the : Cotton Board. The latter unit, which is designed for independent operation by means of a tractor, is expected to arrive in Australia within the next few months. Picking machines offer the prospect of reducing picking costs, which are at present, the highest of the costs involved in the production of seed cotton. The machines have given most promising results in trials, and will be of particular value in harvesting irrigated crops, where the yield exceeds 300 lb. of seed cotton, per acre. The greater concentration of the farms under irrigation will' tend to facilitate mechanical harvesting. One of the principal reasons for the decline of production during World War II . Was the labour problem. This is a seasonal occupation, and the conditions of employment in it, because of living conditions on scattered farms were not attractive. adjourned. Furthermore, nearly all the workers were employed in the production of materials Sitting suspended from 1247 to 2.15 p.m. for the conduct of the war, and could, not be diverted to the cotton industry. Members of the Australian Women's Land Army rendered splendid service within the limits of their ability, but their labour did not prove to be. very satisfactory under which many of these farmers, unfortunately, are obliged to live at present. The cotton-growing industry is worthy ' of all the encouragement that this National Parliament can give to it. Its potential value to the Commonwealth is considerable. This industry will assist the States' schemes for the land settlement of ex-servicemen. The Queensland Cotton Board, I understand, now has a representative on the staff of the Gatton Agricultural College. He possesses a sound knowledge of the cotton industry,, and is giving instruction to the young men who are being trained in agriculture, and to others who attend for short ""refresher"" courses. This instruction .' will make a greater number of agriculturists in Queensland cotton-minded. Sufficient encouragement should be given to the industry to enable the possibilities of production under irrigation to be thoroughly explored and demonstrated. form me whether it is a fact' that cotton 1 growers in the electorate of Capricornia will receive about £140,000 out of the total amount of £170,000? member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) to deal with this industry as a part of a broad national plan.

When the proposed irrigation schemes are undertaken, cotton will be produced in south-western Queensland and in northern New South Wales.

The chairman of the board, and the representative of flour-mill owners are definitely to hold office during the pleasure of the Minister. It seems to me that avoidance of the repetition of those words suggests that the representatives of the growers also are to hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, although the Minister may prescribe that they shall hold office for a year, two years, or whatever other term he may fix. The bill having gone so far as to provide that the growers shall have an opportunity to elect representatives to. the board, it ought to further specify the period for which they shall hold office. In order to place the matter . beyond doubt, I move That, in sub-clause (2.), paragraph ( 6 ) , after the words ""Western Australia"" the following words be inserted:-""wh o shall nohl office for three years from the dates of their appointments "".

The honourable member for lndi and the honourable member for. New England( Mr Abbott) would have been logical had they proposed that not only the chairman of the board and the representative of the flour-mill owners, but also the representatives of the growers, shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister. The Minister is satisfied that he will' have the power to provide that the representatives of the growers shall hold office during his pleasure. It would be unwise to limit the term of office of the representatives of the growers, as the honourable member for lndi' has proposed. We all hope that for the first two years, and perhaps also in the third year, they will have a comparatively easy passage to. negotiate. By the fourth year, or the fifth year, they may find themselves in a difficult position, with the export price of wheat far below what it is to-day. They might find . the problems of the industry becoming more intricate and involved. Some change might occur in Australia's internal -economy, with resulting difficulties. The honourable member has proposed that the term of office of growers' representatives shall .cease at the expiration of three years, but has not suggested that the Minister should have the power to re-appoint them. growers should be elected, not appointed, to the board. siderable experience during a period of three years, it would"" be exceedingly unwise to require them to submit themselves to another ballot of the growers. The provisions of the bill are satisfactory. The honourable member-for New England has said that these men might even hold office for life. The honourable gentleman knows that under the Wheat Export Charge Bill, which is complementary to this measure, tax will be collected for five years, and no member of any government would allow the mem. bers of the board to hold office at a time when this legislation was no longer required. [2.41] I wish to know whether a decision on the amendment moved by the honourable. member for lndi ( Mr McEwen) would prevent me from moving three amendments which I have in mind. I desire to move that, in sub-clause 2,, paragraph b, the word "" two "", first occurring, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" three "" ; 'that the word "" one "", second occurring, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" two "" ; and that the word "" one "", third occurring, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" two "".

The honourable gentleman said, he did not like big boards. Perhaps better results are obtained from small boards, but why give more representation to one State than to another, why should New South Wales and Victoria which have the greater number of representatives in this House have the. greater number of representatives on the Board? Commerce and Agriculture) [2.55] I cannot accept the amendment. This matter was threshed out at the last meeting of the Agricultural Council. The State Ministers for Agriculture asked leave of me, as chairman, to discuss it among themselves and with their officers. On the following day they informed me that the representation proposed was satisfactory to them. At that meeting it was agreed, that in each State, there should be formed a State Advisory Committee for the express purpose of advising the Australian Wheat Board on matters pertaining to marketing. The Minister for Agriculture in the Queensland Government, and his officers, were concerned because, in that State, there was a most efficient State Wheat Board, and I gave an assurance that in no cir-. cumstances would we interfere with the constitution of that body. I believe that it will be a most valuable adjunct to the Australian Wheat Board in marketingarrangements. Honourable members am justified in refusing to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Barker. -attitude of the Minister is inconsistent. First, he said that the representation from the various States had been determined by the representatives of the growers, and now he says that the numbers cannot be altered because they were agreed to in consultature. He added that the latter had -asked for time to consult their officials and advisers, after which they had agreed to the representation in the clause-In effect, he tells us that the. representation was decided, not by himself, but by the State' Ministers for Agriculture, and as he did not object"" to their proposal, he accepted it. He seeks to fortify his arguments by telling us that there is also to be appointed an Advisory Committee in each State, that it will be appointed by the State authorities, and that he has given an assurance that the : Commonwealth will not seek to interfere in any way.' The Minister cannot have' it both ways. If the State committees are to be free from Commonwealth intervention-and I agree that they shouldthen the Minister cannot justify the representation proposed in the clause for the federal body on the ground that it was agreed to hy State representatives. agreed to by the States. States were not in a position to evolve a plan for themselves. The real core of the plan must have been Commonwealth finance, and the plan must continue to be a Commonwealth responsibility. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie' Cameron), by citing figures about the number of growers and the acreage normally sown to wheat in Western Australia and South Australia, proved that those States were entitled to more representation on the board. Actually, the acreage under wheat in South Australia and Western Australia is normally greater than in Victoria, and the total yield from those States is very",36,Averages For Ten Years Ending That The Personnel Of The Board Shall Be

Therefore, if arithmetic is to be our guide, there appears to be ample justification for granting ""Western Australia and South Australia-increased representation. We have frequently heard of the disabilities of the more distant States. Here is'one way in which we can help-to improve their lot. I am astounded that this debate should have progressed so far without any Government supporters from constituencies in South Australia or Western Australia rising to. speak in favour of the amendment. How they will explain their attitude to the wheat-growers whom they claim to represent I do not know. However, that is their affair, not mine. I regard the amendment as a very fair one, and I .ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to it. not possible to accept the amendment because of the arrangement which has been made with the States. However, I suggest to the Minister that, should tnis matter at any time come up for review by the Agricultural Council, . an attempt should be made to reduce the total number of representatives on that board. I do not think that it is necessary to have two representatives from Victoria and two from New South Wales. the honourable member -supporting the clause ? it is based on an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, and until the parties agree to reduce the number of representatives on the board I shall continue to support the present proposal. The purpose of having State representatives on the board is that they may bring to its deliberations their particular knowledge of the industry in various parts of Australia. For this purpose^ one representative from each State would be sufficient. We have listened to two extraordinary speeches from honourable members on the Government side-on e from the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) and the other from the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon). In reply to the clear and forceful argument of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), in which he showed, by citing figures about acreages and yields, what the representation of each State should be . on the board, the. honourable ( member for Forrest said that the amendment could not be accepted because the present ratio of representation had been agreed to before the bill was introduced to Parliament. If an arrangement of that kind is to be meekly accepted, .what is the use of bringing the bill . before Parliament at all ? Apparently, a decision was reached in the first place between the Minister and certain selected wheat-growers. I say selected because all the growers do not belong to the wheat-growers' organizations. The proposal was accepted by the Minister, and then placed before the State Ministers for Agriculture, who concurred. Then it was 2 ^ l before caucus, 3 ace< and, having received the stamp of approval from all these authorities, it was tossed on the table of this House, and we are expected to go through the farce of debating it. Are we to accept the humiliating position, as suggested by the honourable member for Forrest-wh o represents a Western Australian constituency, and is a -supporter of the Government-that Parliament cannot amend the clause because it was agreed to in principle by various authorities outside Parliament? If that is the spirit in which legislation is presented to Parliament, it is high time that those responsible altered their attitude. The honourable member for Ballarat said that he did not favour the proposal that tlie term of office of members of the wheat board should be fixed at two or at three years. He believes that they should continue in office at the pleasure of the Minister because, he said, after a few years they might have gained such valuable experience that their services should not be dispensed with. He put that forward as a reason for taking from the growers their right to remove from the board undesirable members. All those selected to fill such positions do not remain in them for life, as members of this Parliament know only too well. They do not always continue to enjoy the approval of. those whom they are supposed to represent, a fact which, I have no doubt, will be made very clear before",37,Cameron I Tion With The State Ministers Of Agricul

115,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [3.5],"long to some honourable members opposite who may have thought that they were here for life. The amendment of the honourable member for. Barker is a perfectly reasonable cue, assuming that we accept the principle that certain States should be specifically represented on the board. I agree that big boards are unwieldy, as I know from experience. However, if certain States are granted representation out of proportion to their merits we shall strike trouble, and it was with the. idea of obviating trouble that the honourable member moved his aniendment. I am sure that if the Minister agreed to restrict State Ministers the Minister might sug-the membership of the board to six representatives without regard to State rights, the honourable member for Barker would 1 agree because he would regard a smaller board as likely to be more efficient. It is obvious that provision has been made for larger representation of New South Wales interests because that State is the most populous and because of its importance, not as a wheat-growing, but as an industrial area. In other words, New South Wales is to have this dominance in the affairs of the board because it contains within its borders approximately' 40 per cent, of the Australian population. In constituting the board we should entirely disregard the numerical strength of the States, except insofar as it relates to the wheat industry itself. AlthoughI listened carefully to the a great, deal of attention to. the desirspeech of the honourable member for ability of consulting wheat-growers as to Richmond( Mr Anthony), I do not know the re-organization of their industry. whether or not he supported the amendment. He commenced his speech on one note and ended it on an entirely Lyons Government established the Ausdifferent one. Going back over the tralian Agricultural Council for that very history of the Australian Wheat Board purpose. we find, that under Statutory Rule No. 49 of 1916, the board was originally composed of one represensulted tative of the Commonwealth Government. it stands. . two representatives of the wheat-growers, two representatives of marketing pools, three representatives of merchants and one [3.14] -If the logical and unanswerable representative of the bulk handling case submitted by the honourable member authorities. The two representatives of for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has wheat-growers were not selected from any made no impression on the Minister, particular State. I agree with the honorsurely he cannot fail to be moved by the able member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) appeals made by members of his own that the number of representatives on the party. board might very well be reduced. I agree with the honourable member for Richmond that a smaller board.is likely to be more efficient on the basis that the less talk there is the more work js likely to be done. bers opposite experienced that in the Labour caucus? Country party has but a small caucus and the honora.ble member is very much afraid that it will become very much smaller in the not distant future. I suggest that in his later discussions with gest that the representation of New South Wales and Victoria he reduced to one in each case. The honourable member for Richmond has said, in effect, that if this Parliament is merely to rubber stamp legislation passed by the States, its continuance is not worthwhile. The honourable member knows very well that the party to which he belongs has done everything in its power to prevent the Commonwealth Parliament from obtaining complete powers to deal with these matters in its own right. If this Parliament is to be truly national it must have complete national powers. Measures designed for the improvement of our primary industries could be brought before this Parliament in the first instance instead of only after protracted negotiations with the States.

I believe that equal representation should be extended to all States. The representation on the board has already been decided after consultation with State Ministers. If , however, in. the dim and shadowy future, the Minister in his wisdom is inclined to reduce the representation of Victoria and New South Wales to one, we shall be entirely satisfied. I appeal to the Minister to' reconsider his attitude towards the proposal of the honourable -member for Barker and to provide such representation on the board as will do justice to the . wheat-growers. The point must not be overlooked that it is the individual wheat-grower whose money will be controlled by this board -For that reason I believe that Western Australia and South Australia should be given the same negativedrepresentation as Victoria. bates on measures brought before this chamber are reduced, to a farce because of pre-commitments, responsibility for that rests not on the Labour party, which has always advocated additional powers for the National Parliament, but upon its political 'opponents, who have invariably opposed the granting of them. ""While the state of affairs continues under which the Commonwealth Parliament has not complete domain, and arrangements and agreements have to be made with the States in order to make Commonwealth legislation effective, it is ridiculous for people to criticize the action of the Minister in making such arrangements or agreements with the States before bringing the appropriate measures before the Parliament. If such legislation were placed upon the statute-book without the prior consent of the States, it would become null and void. All that is contemplated in the measure now before us has already been tried out during the war period That was the great testing time for much of the legislation we are enacting now for peace-time. Some of the legislation must necessarily impinge on the province of the States and but for their co-operation would be unthe honourable workable. The Minister. accordingly must ' take into consideration all the factors that may make this scheme' strangely workable, and he would be foolish if he did not take advantage of the lessons learned during the war while the National Security Regulations were in. operation. After all, this bill merely proposes to carry into an era of peace a scheme that has proved workable during the war and will possibly prove 80 per cent, workable under peace-time -conditions. If this Parliament had' complete authority to legislate without taking into' consideration the wishes of the States We' Would be in a vastly different position.

That is the most incredible statement. I have ever heard. The board will deal not farmers but also with a wheat crop valued at not less than £50,000,000 this year. The representatives of the growers have customarily been paid, I think, £500 a year, plus travelling expenses. amount to £1,000 a year each. penses amount to, I think the pay is £500 a year. The board has to deal with, a crop worth £50,000,000. Yet the argument is advanced that the country cannot afford-one more board member because he would cost an additional £500 a year. No more amazing objection could ever be raised to such a reasonable proposal as is contained in the amendment. Coming from a Western Australian"" it is even more, astounding, because if there is one State that needs development and expansion it is Western Australia, and to the wheat industry it must look for that Both are confronted with a proposal by the .Government that Western Australia, which grows about one-fifth of the total Ausmore representation than .Queensland, honourable member for Forrest protests on the paltry ground of economy.

The result is hopes to trap the honourable member for that the wheat-growers of Australia are to be shackled for not less than five years to a measure of which apparently not one comma can be altered. If ever a reasonable proposal was made it is the proposal, on which we are about to vote, that the representation of the ""Western Australian wheat-growers shall be increased by one in order to give them the same representation as is to be given to the Victorian wheat-growers, and thus possibly lessen the disadvantages that they suffer in the disparity of distance from the centre of government and in the management of their affairs. I regret that the Minister is hypocritical. When they were in office adamant in his refusal to accept the amendment, and that the representatives of the wheat-growers are so blind in their obedience. Commerce and Agriculture) [3.40] Members of the Opposition are deliberately stone-walling this bill. First, the honourable member for Barker( Mr honourable member for Forrest and the Archie Cameron) moved that the representation of South Australia on the Australian Wheat Board should be increased from one to two members. When that amendment was defeated, the honourable gentleman moved that the representation of Western Australia on the board be increased from one.to two members.

The first amendment which the honourable member for Barker proposed, was defeated on the voices. Evidently he did not consider that the amendment was of sufficient importance to warrant his calling for a division. The arguments which the Opposition has advanced against this clause are mere "" moonshine"""", and honourable members opposite know it. Their attitude toward the Australian Wheat Board has always been and appointed the members of the original board, they overlooked entirely the representation of the wheat-growers, but they did not forget to give to their masters, the vested interests of Australia, a majority of members on the board.. So"" much for the sincerity of the Australian Country party! Now, honourable members opposite are attempting to bluff the honourable member for Swan into voting for the amendment.

The Minister's reflection upon the sincerity of members of the Opposition by accusing them of stone-walling the bill, which deals with £50,000,000 worth of produce, is too silly for words. The honourable gentleman recalled what was done in war-time to market the wheat harvest. But never before has a government told the wheat-growers: "" We shall retain almost one-half of the overseas price at which your wheat was sold"". When the Government acts in that"" manner, the grower is entitled to effective representation on the Australian Wheat Board. The Minister has already heard the views of the honourable member for Forrest and the ' that, the composition of the board could be improved. They did not believe that New South Wales and Victoriashould have a greater numerical representation on the board than South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland have. Whilst they were prepared to reduce the representation of New South Wales and Victoria, they were not willing to increase the representation of South Australia and Western Australia. I do 'not want to explain away the position for them. ' They will have enough to do to explain it away themselves, but I voice my resentment at the Minister's accusation that the Opposition is stone-walling the bill.. . honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Parliament is to pass national legislation,, McDonald) would go well on the auction block. Swan would go well on the. chopping block. the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), because I shall be re-elected. The honourable member for lndi ( Mr Australian Wheat Board is most McEwen) and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) are astute politicians. The honourable membeT for Barker is endeavouring to get "" on side "" with the wheat-growers in his electorate Forrest( Mr Lemmon) and myself "" off side"" with our constituents. If the honourable gentleman thinks that it required the speech of the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) to stiffen our attitude, or that he cam cause a split among honourable members on this side of the chamber, he should think again. We recognize that the amendment has been moved for political purposes. When the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who represents the banana-growers, considers that the wheat-growing State of Western Australia should be given another representative on the Australian Wheat Board, I immediately become suspicious of the whole proposal. The representation of New South Wales and Victoria might be reduced. It is true that in the export season when the price of wheat is high,, honourable member for Swan, namely, the exporting States of South Australia and Western Australia will contribute to» the.stabilization fund; but when pricesdecline, the wheat-consuming States of New South Wales and Victoria will contribute a greater amount to the fund. correct. indications, the home consumption price of 5s. 2d. a bushel will be very valuable to wheat-growers in future. Honourable members on this side of the chamber will not "" f a l l "" for this obvious, political propaganda of the Opposition. We are convinced that the bill is sound, although it may be improved at a later date in agreement with the States.

It is extraordinary that the two representatives of Western Australian wheat-growers should vote contrary to the best interests of .their State. Their wheat grower constituents are "" sweating blood "" in an almost superhuman effort to pro-duce this vital staple commodity, wheat; but honourable members opposite deny to them the right to have an additional representative on the Australian Wheat Board. The disabilities of Western Australia will be further, emphasized as the result of this opposition by those Jiidases who have turned down their farmer -constituents. Government members interjecting, found that when people behave in .a shocking manner and betray .the interests that they are supposed to represent, they act like the squid, and create an inky screen to conceal their .actions. Honourable' members opposite are trying to shout me down. The Minister had .no right to say that honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber were attempting to stone-wall the bill. Actually, we are looking after the interests of the wheat-growers of Western Australia, who were betrayed so badly this afternoon by their representatives, the honourable member for Forrest and the honourable member for Swan. I hope that the people of Western Australia, will -realize that, because of the steamroller .caucus method, their cause has to be pleaded here by members of the Opposition. I left the Hotel Kurrajong this morning, I was informed that the "" works would be turned on "" to-day. Members of the Opposition have "" turned on the works "" for political purposes. They have brought a political football into this contest this afternoon. If I were their captain, I would sack them on the spot. They are -dressing their political window, but it is .a very shoddy window. At the. forthcoming elections they will get the sack even more decisively than they received it in 1943. I have no hesitation in saying that when honourable members opposite .are called upon to give, an account of their stewardship in this chamber the wheat-growers will deal with them most effectively. [3.55] I strongly resent the statement of the Minister( Mr Scully) that members of the Opposition are stonewalling this measure and attempting to trap certain honourable gentlemen oppo site who represent Western"" Australian constituencies. done, and the honourable member knows it. listened to the honourable gentlemen who have spoken on the amendment, and it is quite untrue, that they were stonewalling. But, without any coaxing, I intend to stand up for distant Western Australia, which, in some respects at least, has an affinity with Queensland. We intend-to do our best to see that, the wheat-growers of Western Australia are treated fairly. The wheat industry of that State is one of its most important activities; it certainly involves more hard work than any other. The .members of the Australian Country party believe that the wheat-farmers of Western Australia should have equal representation on the Australian Wheat Board with. the farmers of the eastern States in which approximately the same quantity of wheat is grown each season. If this subject be considered calmly it will be realized that the Government's proposal is iniquitous. The Minister has said that the constitution of the Australian Wheat Board' was agreed to-by the States. That is not so. It was agreed to at a conference of Ministers of Agriculture who were advised by under secretaries or other officers of State Departments of Agriculture. To my mind that is not fair. The farmers of Western Australia should not be deprived of fair representation because of the decision of such a conference. No agreement has been made by the various State governments on this matter. The most that can be said is that the Ministers for Agriculture, acting on the advice of public servants, reached an agreement. Such agreements should not be binding on this Parliament. If they are to be binding, they should not be made. The Minister' has stated that he will not agree to .the amendment and that the agreement",44,Cameron To Which Grows About One Two Hundredth Tbe

In other words, the honourable gentleman has a throat-hold on the members of his party and, in particular, on the representatives of two wheat growing : constituencies in ""Western Australia. Any one can see with half an eye that those honourable gentlemen are in an unfortunate position. However, the Opposition is prepared to help them in this matter. people of Western Australia, who are suddenly receiving some consideration from members of the Opposition, are wise in their political judgment, and they will clearly understand that the foolish purpose of honourable gentlement' opposite is to embarrass the joy) and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon). The Australian Country party has maintained a consistent opposition to this bill for the stabilization of the wheat industry. I have ho doubt that the two .honourable gentlemen , to whom I have referred wish that Western Australia could be given more representation on. the Australian Wheat Board, but they also are well aware that the wheat-growers of that State are so insistent in their demand for a wheat stabilization scheme that they would strongly resent any delay in giving effect to this plan. Members of the Australian Country party hope that by the adoption of these delaying tactics they may he able to prevent the passage of the bill until after the elections. They also hope for a change of government and then, probably, stabilization would be forgotten. The wheat-growers of Australia have little to hone for from members of the.Australian Country party who, through the years, have failed to fulfil their promises to stabilize the wheat industry or to justify the allegiance of farmers to the Australian Country party. In consequence, its' representatives from the wheat-growing electorates. It cannot be denied that any delay in the "" passage' of this hill will be detrimental to the wheat-growing industry. The farmers, therefore, will prefer a speedy passage for the measure. They realize that they will be able. subsequently to take any action they think necessary to review its provisions. The honourable membeifor Swan and the honourable member for Forrest will not be embarrassed in their electorates by the tactics of the Australian Country party. I am' sure that the passage of the bill will confer substantial .benefits on the wheat industry. I take strong exception to the statement of the Minister that the members of the Australian Country party are stonewalling the bill. You, Mr Chairman, must be well aware that the call has been given during this discussion to Opposition and Government supporters in strict rotation, which indicates clearly that we have not been stone-walling. We are concerned about this measure because of its grave implications in relation to the wheat industry. able member to confine his remarks to the clause. the statements of the Minister, who said that the amendment of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) to increase the representation of Western Australia on the Australian Wheat Board from one to two members had been moved to embarrass the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Mountjoy). That is not the position. We consider that Western Australia is entitled to equal representation with New South Wales and Victoria. In any case, what is to prevent the honourable gentlemen to whom I have referred from voting in favour of the amendment if they are free men, as they should be in this Parliament ? The Minister knows, however, that they are bound by the iron rules of the party to which they belong.. Every member of the Labour party is required to vote according to caucus instructions. If have been scourged the -honourable gentlemen believe that Western Australia should have two representatives on the board they should assert their freedom and vote for the amendment, but the Minister has said that they will vote against it.

The honourable member for Dalley based his argument, on a total of 57,000 growers-19,00 0 in New South Wales, 14,000 in Victoria, 12,000 in South Australia, S,000 in Western Australia and 4,000 in Queensland-and stated that the representation was two representatives each for New South Wales and Victoria and' one representative each for South Abbott, J.

Australia."": He, and those who are trying Gullett, H . B. to extricate themselves from the very Holt, .difficult position .in which they have .been placed by the aniendment, have overlooked one point. It must be appreciated! that this wheat stabilization scheme will be dependent entirely on the exports of wheat from Australia. The stabilization fund is to be built up by having paid into it one-half of the difference between the fixed ""home consumption price of os. 2d. a bushel and whatever -price maybe received for wheat exported. It cannot be denied that Western Australia and South Australia are responsible for the bulk of our exports. mine what is proper and just representation, we must ascertain how many of the 57,000 growers mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley are exporters. The amendment was framed, and has been presented, on that basis. The statistics given by the honourable member for ' Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) are indisputable. Western Australia has the largest proportion of the growers who, as exporters .of wheat, will be directly responsible for the stabilization fund.

My sole desire was that the representatives of the growers should be able to function most effectively in the interests of the growers themselves, and to be entitled t'o indicate from time to time the progress made in the realization of the pools. It is true that a member of the board may, through inexperience, unwittingly reveal some information which might prejudice the board in its competitive marketing operations vis-a-vis some foreign country. I am accordingly willing to alter the wording of my amendment to provide that the board shall make reasonable-reports to wheat-growers relative to the progress of marketing operations. That would remove responsibility from the individual board member and place it upon the board as a whole. The suggestion of the Minister that discretion in this matter should be left to the chairman violates the principle of grower representation. It is futile to have what purports to be a grower-controlled board if in the charter of that body there are incorporated conditions which prevent the board from functioning properly, either in its corporate entity or through its individual members. Behind the facade of a grower-controlled board is the provision that the Minister, or his spokesman,' the chairman of the board, who shall be appointed by and. shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, shall be the authority on every issue of any consequence, because the suggestion of the Minister is that only he or the chairman shall release information about the realizations of various pools.

218,Mr Mcewen ( L N D I ) [5.17],"I tother clauses are machinery. But clause 10 provides for the establishment of the Australian Wheat Board to act for the wheat-growers in the realization of their product. In.this country, we have been accustomed to a way of life under which, within the law, a man can offer his services or engage in production and be free to sell his product or services. reasons with which we all are familiar, we know that general conditions require that those engaged in certain industries shall be bound together collectively to dispose of their product, as men bind themselves together in unions for the purpose of disposing of their labour. The bill proposes that wheat-growers shall be bound together to dispose of the product of their labour. The essence of the whole arrangement is that the man's own labour, whether it be eight hours' work a day or be converted into bushels of wheat, is his to dispose of as he chooses. It is merely a matter of economic necessity that all political parties in this Parliament have agreed that, the time has come to regulate and organize the disposal of wheat. The amendment which the Minister has moved is designed to provide that the product of the wheat-growers shall be in every respect subject to the direction of the Minister of the day. In short, it represents a complete form of socialization of industry. The effect of the amendment will be that when a wheat-grower produces his grain, it shall immediately become the property of a government authority; and as soon as it becomes the property of that government authority, the wheat may not be sold, disposed of or handled in any way except with the approval of the Minister. Russia, there is nothing more authoritarian than that. I am completely averse to the principle inherent in the amendment, and the condition of affairs that it is designed to establish. I point out to the House, the wheat-growers and the even-wider audience that is interested, that this proposal reveals the basic political attitude of the Government towards the property of individuals. This approach is completely When men have their labour to sell, the law permits them to bind themselves together in their trade unions and even wider associations, but at least it does provide that an impartial tribunal-the Conciliation and Arbitration Courtshall adjudicate on the terms and conditions upon which their product shall be sold. In this instance, the Minister will be the only adjudicator. Stalin thought of nothing more autocratic than that. When we compare the proposal with For the publically propounded policy of the Labour party, we find either the essence of contradiction or the essence of hypocrisy. The Labour party propounded the principle of marketing boards upon which there should be a majority of producers. Very well! The Australian Wheat Board will have a majority of producers. In its written and spoken policy, the Labour party always advocates grower-controlled boards, but the amendment is a complete abrogation of that policy. This is a proposal to establish a sham board behind which the Minister will exercise al) authority over the wheat-growing industry and the wheat which is the property of the growers. Is a man to be free to grow wheat ? No! He must apply to the stabilization board for a licence. Are there any grower representatives on the stabilization board ? There are not. The members of the stabilization board will be appointed by the Minister. He may dismiss them, so they will give effect to his will. No person may grow wheat unless he has the permission of the Minister. Having grown the wheat, is it his property the moment it is placed in a bag oia bin ? It is not! It is only his property so long as he intends to use it on his own farm. That quantity represents In Soviet only a minute portion of his crop. .The moment it has been converted into merchandise and an edible product it i-= to pass from his ownership into the ownership of the Australian Whear Board-thi s glorious board, with a majority of growers who will have no authority whatever if the amendment be agreed to, but who, in every respect, as the clause carefully provides at great length, are to be subject to the Minister, revolutionary.

No; it may sell wheat only subject to any direction given to it by the Minister. The principle which the Government desires to embody in this legislation is in its essence the most revolutionary that I have known to be proposed in this Parliament. If it were applied to the products of every other Australian citizen, whether labour or commodities, it would write "" finis"" to our free Australia, for we should have introduced the complete socialist state. I know what the result of the vote will be, because honourable gentlemen opposite are controlled by the iron-bound caucus. Every one of them is pledged, before even he goes before the electors as a candidate, to abide by the decision of his party in respect of matters that will come before the Parliament. He signs that pledge when he signs his' nomination form. It seems inevitable that this principle will be written into this legislation. I can only hope that the revulsion of the Australian people to the menace that is inherent in this measure will have such repercussions at the forthcoming elections as will cause a change of government. The speech of the honourable member for statement. I made in my second-reading speech that, except for the fact that a Labour Government is in office, the stabilization of the wheat industry and the continuance of co-operative marketing would have gone the same way after this war as it went after the last war, when a tory government was in office. The speech of the honourable member indicates quite clearly that he is suffering from election "" jitters "". His mouthings of the word "" socialization "" indicate that very clearly. But, if this bill is a socialistic measure so, likewise, were the stabilization enactments of the government that was in office in 1940, in which the honourable member held a portfolio. If this Government is socialistic in its outlook in this regard so, likewise, was that government, which indicates that it was prepared to be socialistic when it happened to suit the purses of the peophit pretended to represent but so sadiy misrepresented. There is not one provision in this measure, except price provision, which is not on all-fours with the stabilization enactment introduced by the anti-Labour government ot 1940. No form of organized marketing is possible in this country that is not, in some respects,-dependent finally upon ministerial control. This Government is just a3 conscious of that fact as was the government of 1940. The plain fact is that if this enactment interferes with the freedom of the subject in this country, the power to do so has been in the Constitution from the inception of Federation. All Commonwealth governments have had authority to take control, and to determine the price, of that portion of the product of the people which is exported for sale overseas. The power is as old as the Constitution, and it has been operated in regard to exports by every Commonwealth government, irrespective of its political complexion, since the beginning of federation. If those governments were socialistic in these matters, they also acted in a common sense fashion, and conferred substantial benefits thereby on all the people of this Commonwealth. Let us examine the basic principles of this measure. The bill provides, on the one hand, that when the export price of the wheat exceeds 5s. 2d. a bushel the wheat-growers shall make substantial contributions from export receipts in excess of that amount to the stabilization fund. On the other hand, if after this fund is established the price of export wheat should fall below 5s. 2d. a bushel, and the fund should become .unstable, the tax-payers of this country will be required to make contributions to keep it",56,Pairs

It is -true that the contract will operate for a number of years. It is also true that it will ensure a guaranteed price to the wheat-grower. Government will take some contribution from the moneys which the wheat consumers of this country contribute to Consolidated Revenue in order to ensure a. minimum price of 5s. 2d. a bushel to the farmers. In these circumstances, it is essential that the Government shall have final control of the scheme. It is arrant electioneering humbug for the honourable member for lndi to talk about the. scheme depriving citizens of their freedom and their rights. Throughout his membership of this Parliament, including in particular his term as Minister, he has been responsible for the inclusion of this principle in legislation that has come before the Parliament. ber knows that that is not true. ber for lndi is the biggest party hack in the Parliament. should be honest in .these matters.

That is true in regard to industrial legisvernment are acceded to, the Auslation, and to all descriptions of legislation for the organized or collective marketing of products. There can be no collective marketing in any substantial way without ministerial responsibility. A Minister must be answerable finally both to the primary producers and to the consumers, who, after all, are the people affected by guaranteed prices. The type of propaganda which is being pumped into this chamber at present by the windbags of the Australian Country party is neither more nor less than an exhibition of election ""jitters"" and of the artful methods in which honourable members of the Australian Country party are so practised. I hope that the committee will accept the amendment. It is somewhat surprising that the apparently simple amendment of the Minister( Mr Scully) should have excited such a discussion, but the amendment goes to the root of the measure. It might appear When necessary, the that the amendment was introduced as an afterthought, but that cannot have been the case. The principle involved is too important, and it has been embodied in several other recently introduced measures. The principle is, in fact, supervision by the Minister. In Russia, where a totalitarian system is in operation, when one person is named as the head of an industry, and he tells everybody else what to do and how to do it, he is known as a commissar. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is asserting a similar authority in Australia, for this amendment is a blatant attempt to fasten the commissar system upon the Australian producers. Yet it is being suggested that the producers are to be in charge of their own marketing organization ! The Minister has travelled up and down the countryside talking about grower-control organizations and the like; but the moving of this amendment exposes the hollowness of the assertions of the honourable gentlemen that he believes in grower-control. I make no apology for opposing this amendment, although I am not a wheat-grower and represent very few wheat-growers. If the principle of this amendment can be fastened on the wheat industry it will undoubtedly be extended . shortly to other primary industries. If the wishes of the Gotralian Wheat Board will not be able to do anything in regard to the sale of wheat or. wheat products, or the purchase of cornsacks, jute or jute products, or any one of numerous other activities usually associated with the wheat industry, without first obtaining a direction from the Minister. In fact, all its actions will be subject to ministerial directions. The honourable member for lndi ( Mr McEwen) has eloquently brought this fact to light. If a principle of this description be embodied in the bill it will not matter whether there were ten, twenty, or even 50, growers on the board, for in the final analysis, the board can act only by direction of the Minister. That is not grower-control.",57,Pairs

Can ministerial supporters deny that this is a socialistic means of controlling industry? How can the Government socialize an industry more easily than by this method? I am not suggesting that the .Minister has in mind an ulterior purpose; hut I do claim that there are influences which desire that all boards of this character shall be so controlled that they will be able to assume command of the whole economy of Australia whenever they consider that the time to do so is opportune. ""We know that ' the Communist party has infiltrated the unions. honourable member is getting wide of the mark. analogy, and I am not wide of the mark. Just as the Communist party has secured key positions in the unions and has thus become enabled to dictate the whole policy of powerful industrial elements in the community, so will it also be able to put its drafted. policy into operation without effort whenever it chooses, if it can obtain control of what ought to be grower-controlled organizations. That may seem to be farfetched and a figment of the imagination, but it is not. The Prime Minister( Mr ter and the Parliament to retain the Chifley) has demonstrated whattremendous influence this party wields in industrial matters. If the Minister wants the growers to have control of this board, he should not persist with the amendment. He will be able to exercise control by reason of the power to be vested in him to nominate the chairman of the board. In my view, the elected representatives on the board should have the right to choose who shall be the chairman of it. The Minister wants to make doubly sure of having control of the board. He may be unconvinced that the chairman will become solely his instrument; consequently, he now proposes to take to himself power to direct the activities of the board. . If that is not the power that is to be conferred on him, let him make a denial of my submission, by withdrawing the amendment. I know that the amendment will be carried, because the Government has the numerical strength to ensure its acceptance. ""Every ministerial supporter, whether he believes in the amendment or not, will vote with the Minister. The honourable gentleman has exploded the claim that the policy of the Government is to enable the growers to control their own organization. bers of the Australian Country party have indulged in a good deal of "" piffle "" in regard to this clause. The honourable himself into quite a frenzy in his attempt to make out a case in opposition to it. It is time that its actual intention was realized. The simple purpose of it is to extend certain powers to the board, The subject to the direction of the Minister. The objection to the amendment is that it proposes to set up a dictatorial authority or to take power from the Parliament and the people. Even the Russian practice has been mentioned. words I am moving to insert was a typographical error when the clause was prepared to hand over the power of the Parliament to any board or other outside authority. The purpose of the amendment is merely to enable the Minispower to deal with the matters mentioned in the clause. The Minister will always be subject to the direction and control of the Parliament. The board will not be subject to such direction, except through the Minister. involved. general principle of government, and the policy of the ministerial party, that the whole of the administration of this country shall be under' the control of the Parliament through responsible Ministers.

It may grist or arrange for the gristing of any wheat, and sell or otherwise dispose of the products of the gristing. It may carry out certain functions at some times and not at other times. It will merely discharge such functions, as the Minister may, from time to time, direct. We offer no apology for the retention by the Minister of the power to deal with such matters, because by that means the Parliament will retain control and it will not be given to any board which may become a dictatorial authority. Leader of the Australian Country party) [5.49] -The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) has asked the committee to consider the intention of the amendment. That is exactly what we want to do. We desire to have a more satisfactory reason for it than has already been given to us. The amendment would bestow enormous power on the Minister, because it provides that the board may do certain things "" subject to any direction of the Minister"". That power is wide enough to enable the Government to implement the policy of the Labour party for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Jn order to understand the reason for this amendment it is necessary to delve into history. I direct the attention of honourable members to the debate which took place on the Government's referendum proposals, with particular reference to the proposal for orderly marketing. When the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr oninvestigation that its verbiage* is Bernard Corser) tried to insert a safeguard to ensure that the proposed new power would not be used to socialize the means of production, his amendment was defeated on a party vote. Now, a further opportunity has been created by the Government, to place wide powers in the hands of the Minister so that he may do practically anything, including the caking over of flour, mills, the gristing of General and the honourable member for wheat and the sale of the proceeds of gristing. This proposed power is too wide and dangerous for any vigilant opposition to allow to pass unchallenged. It amounts, in effect, to a power of veto, and it is ironical that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) should be overseas protesting against the power of veto in the United Nations while action is being taken here to place that very power in the hands of a Minister of the Crown. I draw attention to the excuse made by some Government supporters for the placing of this power in the hands of a Minister. They have claimed that the plan will involve Treasury responsibility, and that it is, therefore, only right that the Treasury should have a representative on the board in order to protect Treasury interests. This practice has been followed in the case of other boards, and it is a reasonable proposition, but it is not necessary in this instance, because no financial. obligation will devolve upon the Commonwealth-immediately , at any rate. The scheme is to be financed with the wheat growers' money, 50 per cent, of the difference between 5s. 2d. and the export parity price being paid into a fund. At some time in the future, the Treasury may be called upon to make a contribution, but that is not likely to happen for many years to come. If it does, it will then be time enough for the Government to provide for Treasury representation on the board. Eveni f the Treasury were immediately involved, and there was justification for bestowing certain powers upon -the Minister, they should not be so extensive as is proposed in the amendment. Sitting suspended from 5.55 to 8 p.m. Clause 10 deals with the powers of purchase and acquisition to be vested in the Australian Wheat Board. I have noted almost precisely the same as Statutory Rule 96, which was promulgated on the 21st September, 1939, under the sponsorship of Senator McLeay who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; it was issued under the authority of the Menzies Government, in which the. Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) was PostmasterFawkner( Mr Holt), Assistant Minister. Of that Ministry the honourable members for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) and",59,Pairs
242,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,,60,Pairs
243,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [8.0],"pliant supporters, and as far as I am aware, they suffered at that time, no physical disabilities that prevented them from protesting against that enactment as they have protested to-day against this clause. Apparently the proposal was acceptable then, and it becomes anathema now only because it emanates from this Government. That is the real kernel of their opposition. I have said that the verbiage used in both instances was almost ' identical. The Argus-eyed honourable .member for Barker detected a difference and went to great pains to extract from the Minister information as to why there appeared in the clause the words, "" purchase or otherwise acquire"". The honourable gentleman realizes that this hoard is the only authority that may acquire wheat, and that consequently, the insertion of the additional words are necessary to prevent farmers from'trying to extract from the Government different prices in respect ^ of wheat delivered. Power to acquire is necessary when the government is the only buyer and this power may have to be exercised in respect of cornsacks, jute, and jute products, without which the board could not function. portant that power should be vested in the board to avoid exploitation by those who may 'control supplies of cornsacks and other jute goods. If the board were merely given power to purchase, it would be left to the tender mercy of exploiters who, realizing that it was the largest purchaser of the materials they had for sale, might seek to take advantage of it. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr would dictate what it should do. In McEwen) who faced the committee with the air of a political neophyte and called to high heaven to witness his just wrath and indignation at this proposal, by some mysterious reasoning has discovered to-day that there is a vast difference between a proposition which emanates from the present Government, which he bitterly opposes, and the same proposition when it was made by a government which he slavishly followed. He now says that the amendment proposed by the Minister will mean ministerial dictatorship. The clause as proposed to be amended provides that the board may, subject to any direction from tlie Minister, do certain things. The regulation, which he accepted without question when an earlier government was in office, provided that, "" on behalf of the Commonwealth and subject to any direction of the Minister"" the board could do exactly the same thing. Yet he works himself up to passionate wrath, because, he says, this now means another step towards socialism. Did the same provision in the regulation not mean another step towards socialism? with the conduct of the war. gentleman says the producer owns the wheat and the Minister dictates what shall be done with it. Did not the producer produce the wheat'in 1939, and did not the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the Menzies' Government dictate to the board what should be done with the wheat? The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country party cannot get the Communist bug out of his hair, so he says it is because the Government is subject to communistic control that this step towards socialism has been taken. It is imWould he say that the Menzies Government was subject to Communist control when it promulgated the regulation which was phrased in almost precisely the same language as this clause? He said that the proposal now before us means socialism. Did it'mean socialism when it was made by the Menzies Government? One of the principal objections of the honourable gentleman was that, having appointed a board, the Minister 1938 when the Wheat Industry Assistance Act was passed, the Lyons Government was in office and the Minister for the Interior was the now indignant honourable member for lndi ( Mr 'McEwen), the Minister without portfolio was the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture-was no less a person than the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page).

The Lyons Government was determined not to lose its majority on the committee which dealt with assistance for the wheat industry, and therefore inserted a provision in the legislation giving power to the Governor General to appoint deputies to take the place of committee members who might be absent from any meeting. So the Minister not only appointed the committee but also took care that in the absence of a regular member an appropriate substitute would be provided. Yet the honourable member for Tndi protests about ministerial control. In the legislation to which I have referred provision was also made under which the Minister was given power to ^decide which States should receive assis-tance and the 'amounts which should be paid to each of the States. Not only did -the Minister"" r i g "" the committees, but . Ke also reserved to himself the right to determine to which State assistance-should .'be granted and how' much should be paid ""<to 'each State.

ROSEVEAR^-Whether the' wheat ""industry is assisted by subsidy orby ! t]Se evolution of a stabilization plan which"" guarantees a fixed price matters nothing,because, in the last analysis, if there be a shortage the Government has to make it'good. The argument advanced -by the honourable member for lnd i therefore falls to the ground. Let us return again to the statutory rule in regard to which, as I have said, the honourable members for lndi and Barker were strangely silent. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has said that the difference between the present and the earlier proposals is that in the case of the latter treasury money was being expended. How can the right honourable gentleman know that before the end of the five years during which the ' plan is to operate, treasury money will -not again be needed ? Does he think that because the world is starving now and must have wheat a't any price, five years hence it will be able to pay the same price for our wheat ? responsibility in respect of the. first advance ? ing, however, with the overall effect of the proposal. The right honourable gentleman said that there is no risk of financial responsibility being imposed upon the Treasury. It. is true that at present one-half of the world is starving for wheat and is prepared to pay "" fancy"" prices for it ; but is he a seer or a prophet who can look five years into the future and say that the starving world will then .be able to pay the prices which it is obliged to pay to-day? To-day's high prices are made possible only because so many people are hungry for this staple product; but there is no guarantee that the same condition of affairs will exist five years hence and that by that time, no responsibility will, devolve upon the Treasury. The honourable gentleman talked about . socialism. I remind him that every bounty given to private industry is an instalment of socialism^-a recognition that private industry, in certain circumstances, cannot exist in the' anarchy of the present-day capitalist society without government assistance. The fact that we are dealing with this matter now proves that private industry, as represented by the wheat-farmers, cannot market its own products and guarantee -a stable price. Because of that, it is looking for government aid. Without this measure, there can be no stabilization of the wheat industry. When the wheat board was established by a government supported by honourable members opposite, two representatives of the producers were, appointed out of a total of nine members. Now, the whole board will consist of the representatives of the primary producers. The Government believes in grower-control, but not in grower-dictation. Why should we pass legislation giving to a board all these wide powers, and legislative sanction to do as it desires in respect of the wheat industry, and then relinquish what obviously is a government responsibility by saying, "" Now that we have given to you",61,Pairs

It would be one of the worse combines imaginable. orable"" member's time has expired.' pose I should feel complimented that the Rosevear) has descended from the Olympian heights to join in this debate and attempt to put . me in my place. If he had made any substantial references to the points that I made when I spoke earlier on this clause and had substantiated his own points, I should have been grateful for ""his intervention. But this skilled debater entered the lists with the one purpose of endeavouring to save the Government by diverting the debate from the issues that I raised to a cockshy of his own. The issue is clear. The bill is designed to establish a board to organize the marketing of a commodity grown in this free land by free meh . a product that until now had been regarded as the private, property of the grower. The Labour party claims that organized marketing of primary products is its policy. Soon it will be going on the hustings to proclaim that policy. How the Government will reconcile an appeal to the-people for power to organize the marketing of primary products with this bill, which, by the time the referendum takes place, will have become an Act of Parliament, under which it will be organizing the marketing of wheat, 1 do not know. I should not like to try to reconcile the two, but no doubt the Government will attempt to do so. The bill purports to deal with the organized marketing of the wheat-growers' own wheat. WhatI object to is the lastminute afterthought of the Government. It intends to insert in the operative clause that sets out the powers of this vaunted growers' board a few words that mean that the board shall do nothing except with the consent of the Minister, was made in the wheat regulations made by the Menzies Government. I have said in describing this as a completely, authoritarian set-up is to be destroyed by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) and the speech of the honourable member for Dalley, both of whom claim that this legislation is substantially the same as the national security regulations that were introduced by the Government of which I was a member. the same. We will not argue about, fine distinctions. The circumstances ins which this legislation is to operate and! the occasion on which it is initiated are not the same as when our regulations were made. The honourable member for Dalley read the regulations that Were made by the Menzies Government on the 9th September, 1939. On that date .the most terrific world-shaking war in history had just broken out. Honourable members opposite did not know that the war was on, because, within a few days, their then leader, the late Mr Curtin, submitted a motion which can never be expunged from the records of the Parliament, that no Australians should participate in the war outside Australia. It is very unpleasant for honourable members opposite to be reminded of that. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) muttered something about New Guinea.

The Minister said that the growers received only "" two bob"" a bushel from the first pool. True! The honourable member for Forrest( Mr directions will he giv^e?

Has the present Government ever done that ? No prospect existedat that time of any free trading in ""wheat. There was no prospect of this' great industry continuing to live jnless the Gover'nmenttook over and paid for all existing wheat and all future production. That was done. The Minister didnot arbitrarily and autocratically set himself up as the sole authority. Instead a wheat board, with fair representation of the growers, was established. It is true that the growers were not in a majority. merchants and two growers on it. untrue. to advise the Ministry because it had assumed complete financial responsibility for all wheat in existence or in* prospect, and it would have been stupid for the then Minister or anyone else in a responsible position to say that in circumstances like that the entire control of the wheat should be handed over !o someone outside the Government, when no one but the Government could pay for it and ship it. So the circumstances then are not comparable with those to-day. Not even a skilled debater like t) J honourable member for Dalley can trick us by pointing out that certain words in the National Security Regulations are the same as those contained in this bill, because this bill is intended to embody conditions which will decide the fate of the wheat industry for the nex 1 five years, and the Labour party, which has made a million speeches vaunting the policy of grower-control, has the incredible temerity to come into this chamber with a bill which stipulates that the board to be established shall be mainly composed of growers, and then seeks to slip into it a provision that completely abrogates the authority of the board and leaves it as nothing but a facade behind which the Minister will exercise complete control. What kind of imagination. In the course of a few weeks we have seen the Minister sell from the same silo wheat for bread at 5s. 2d. a bushel, wheat for a power alcohol distillery at 3s. l i d . a bushel, wheat for export to the United Kingdom or to some port east of Suez at 5s. 6d. a bushel, wheat to go to a gin distiller at 3s. l l j d . a bushel, and wheat for a pig farmer at 3s. lOd. a bushel. That indicates the kind of directions that a Ministeri n the presenlt Government will give. What more than that do we need to aid our imagination? I received in answer to a question a table setting out that wheat owned by the wheat-growers had been sold from the one silo at prices ranging from 3s. lOd. to over 7s. a bushel at the Minister'sdirection. All the sales took place at practically the same time at prices which I declared in this chamber would involve the growers in the loss of £10,000,000. The Minister laughed in scorn. But later, under the pressure of public opinion and. That board was set up owing to the indisputable correctness of my charge the Government was compelled to pay more than £9,000,000 in partial compensation: incorrect. loss that can be imposed upon the wheat growers by a ministerial direction.

They would be bold men who would stand in their places and attempt to justify that. No! I gather that it is sufficient for the party opposite to take charge of wheat.

If that were true, no necessity or the amendment. would arise for this legislation. What has been the story of the wheat industry since 1930? Nearly every year, legislation has been passed granting assistance to it. In 1931, the Parliament passed the Wheat Advances Act; in 1932, the Wheat Bounty Claims Act; in 1933, the Wheat growers' Relief Act; in 1934, the Wheat growers' Relief Act; in 1935, the Wheat-growers' Relief Act; in 1936, the Wheat-growers Relief Act; andin 19373S, the Wheat Industry Assistance Act. Honourable members opposite pretend that because of the inflationary conditions, prevailing overseas, the wheat industry will not require assistance from the Commonwealth during the next five years.

Anticipating, that they would be quoted, I brongh'. a copy of them into the chamber. When listening to the honourable member for Dalley, one might be excused for believing that there was a fault in the regulations which the Opposition should have discovered. The volume containing the regulations states that they were still iii force on the 1st August, 1944. If the regulations were at fault, as one would understand from comments made during this discussion, surely to heaven the Government had plenty of time to correct it ' thing was wrong with the regulations. It is the Opposition that is finding fault. referring to the amendment which the. Minister has moved. All the strawsplitting and silken thread splitting which that most capable of debaters, the honourable member for Dalley is capable of, cannot alter the salient initial 'statement that he made, namely, that the clause is almost the same as that contained in the regulations. Unfortunately for the honourable member, the clause is not exactly tbe same as the regulations. I invite the honourable member to compare paragraph a of sub-clause 1 of clause 1.0 with the corresponding paragraph in the regulations, and he will find that there is a salient omission. He will also discover other important omissions that are vital to this discussion. The. honourable gentleman.will also.understand, unless he has ceased lo understand, that the National Security Regulations of 1939 were promulgated for war purposes and for nothing else. But this bill will deal with a situation in peace-time. Under those regulations, the Government took control, not only of primary produce including wheat, but also of houses, factories, transport and labour.

But for such legislation, and government assistance in one way and another, the great majority of the farmers would have been forced into the bankruptcy courts. free, and how many farmers are.free of debt? Yet. the honourable gentleman talks about free men, free land and farmers who own their own products. He knows that the great majority of the farmers have had to mortgage their crops practically as soon as the seed was sown. To a very large degree the wheat-farmers have been in bondage to the exploiters, the wheat merchants, and the shipping companies for so many years that they are to-day unanimously clamouring for the stabilization of the industry as the only solution of their troubles. They want a"" guaranteed price for their wheat.

If this is socialism and Communist dictatorship, it must have been been socialism and Communist dictatorship when the Menzies Government and the Lyons Government were in office, for, as I have pointed out, exactly the same provisions were enacted by the Menzies Government in regulations and by the Lyons Government in legislation. The honourable member for lndi and the honourable member for Barker were silent on the subject of socialism and Communist dictatorship in those days. This provision was good when those governments were in office, but it is said to be bad now that a Labour Government is in office. The honourable gentlemen have declared that members of the Labour party are bound by caucus decisions and dare not criticize the actions of the Government. They continually twitted Government supporters on that subject this afternoon. Yet they slavishly followed government policy in 1938 and 1940, when precisely the same thing was done. The honourable member for Barker complained that the board was to be given power to acquire cornsacks and other jute products and said that under this power it could buy sacks for potatoes and all sorts of other primary products. He draws upon his vivid imagination in suggesting that the wheat board will bother about acquiring sacks or jute for bagging primary products other than wheat and wheat products. If the board is to he the sole authority in the Commonwealth for acquiring sacks, it is important that it should have the power to acquire at a fair price sufficient sacks to bag all the wheat harvested. If it could not acquire sacks at a reasonable price it might be forced to pay an extortionate price fixed by exploiters. Obviously, it is necessary that the board should have the power to acquire sacks at a just price. Would the honourable member for Barker suggest that the board should not be empowered to acquire sacks at a just price? Would he suggest that the exploiters should be left to fix their own prices for sacks? If they could do that, they could bleed, the wheat-growers. could impose their ' own prices on the Wheat Boardi t is obvious that in the end, either the farmers or the taxpayers would have to .meet their extortionate charges. The honourable member has been playing the old game of drawing a red herring across the trail. We have heard a great deal of talk from Opposition members about the merits of grower control. The strange thing is that the only wheat board appointed by a government supported by honourable gentlemen opposite included only two representatives of the grower* out of a total membership of nine. The board which this Government will appoint will include seven representatives of growers, . elected by the growers, one representative of the millers, and a chairman nominated by the Government. Can it be imagined that the growers will not take care to appoint reliable men to the board? Their own elected representatives will constitute an overwhelming majority of board members. The honourable member for Barker waxed indignant because provision was being made for ministerial direction to be issued to the board in certain circumstances. Let me remind the committee of a remark made by him soon after he resigned from the Country party to join the United Australia party. Speaking iB this House on the 31th December, 1940, he saidIt is a pretty piece of impudence on the part of the representatives of the growers to contend that the farmers should direct the operations of tlie scheme. ment of the honourable gentleman. the committee with a long extract from his diatribe.

I still contend that the board should consist of and be elected by growers, for the simple reason that nobody knows more than they do about the growing of wheat. The bill makes provision for such a board. No body which did not have the wisdom and knowledge of practical farmers would be a competent one. The Government is giving phenomenal powers to the board; in fact, the' whole of the responsibility which normally would be exercised by the Minister will be exercised by the board. But the Government must not shed.itself of all responsibility in the operation of such schemes. It must not allow the board, however it may be constituted, to have a monopolistic grip which will enable it, having the sanction and authority of the law, to operate to the detriment of the community generally. .It has become apparent, from the bouquets that have been thrown by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr have the power to purchase such things .Rosevear), and from his harking back 30' or 40 years in the history of the wheat industry, that the wheat-grower has again become a chopping block. The issues in . this matter appear to have become some-what confused. Before the amendment was submitted, the clause plainly stated that, for the purposes' of the "" export of wheat and wheat products, the interstate marketing of wheat and the 'marketing of wheat in the territories of the Commonwealth, the board might perform the functions set out in paragraphs a to e. At this late stage, the Minister has proposed that the board shall perform those functions only according to his directions. When the bill was introduced, the main principle which it enunciated was that the stabilization scheme was to be producer-controlled. AU the .newspapers blazoned that. They stated that the majority of the members of the board were to be representatives of the producers, nominated by organizations party is trying to prevent it from going of producers, arid that the board was to through. be constituted on a Commonwealth basis, its members being bona fide producers. never spoken truer words in his life. He The The present proposal is. that, although the board is to be composed of producers, it is not to have controlbut is to be subject to the directions-of the Minister. That honourable gentleman has stated that conferences which he attended in Sydney had approved of the bill. Did he tell them that he intended to insert in it this latest provision? Had he done so, would they have approved of it? Every wheat grower throughout the country knows that they would not. Why it has been submitted at this late stage, mystifies everybody. I should think that the sole reason ""for it is that the Minister'decided he would not have enough control, and-is determined to make himself a .dictator. The honourable member for Dalley has said that the board should have the power to ensure a sufficient supply of cornsacks. Certainly it should. But even without this amendment it would have that power, because .the clause provides that the board may purchase or otherwise acquire any wheat, wheat products, cornsacks, jute or jute products. The honourable member for Dalley has tried -to confuse the issue by contending that the board would not Without a direction from the Minister. The honourable member must underestimate the intelligence of the representatives of the producers if he considers that they will, need to be directed by the Minister. Those men.have been brought up on ""the land, and have a wide knowledge of agriculture and of primary production generally. Surely they can market . 'the product that they grow! It is.obvious that the Government will not have to finance this scheme to any degree. The scheme is to operate for only five years, and it seems as though the fund will have a surplus. From what has heen happening in this Parliament, one can readily realize what will happen when the Minister can dictate to the Australian Wheat Board. All the wheat-growers know that long before this bill was introduced the Minister had declared that he would see that it went through.",69,Pairs

312,Mr Turnbull,"The Minister haswants to have complete control of this organization of growers. That will be absolutely unjust. He always adopts a dictatorial attitude, because he is assured of sufficient support in this chamber to out-vote the Opposition, and to ignore the wishes of the wheat-growers throughout Australia. We recently had a clear example of this dictatorial attitude. It is said that "".might is right"". The Government has ""might"", but not "" r i g h t L o n g before the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting bill, was debated, microphones had been installed in this chamber. No matter what had been revealed in debate, the Government was determined to proceed with its proposal. The Minister now considers that, in order to be consistent, he must adhere to some point he has made, no matter what is revealed. Consistency is revealed, not in stubbornness, but in being willing to change one's mind when there is reason for doing so. I am sure that the Minister has found reason for changing his mind many times since the bill was introduced ; yet, because he has made a certain statement, he wants to pose as a little dictator and put the bill through at all costs. When I say "" at all costs "", I mean it. I believe that the future of the wheat industry, which is Australia's No. 2 asset, is being jeopardized by the dictatorial amendment that we are now considering. It will prevent Australia from providing the wheat that is so necessary for the making of the bread that is needed by the people in the Old Country. On behalf of the wheat-growers of Australia, I protest against the incorporation of the amendment in the bill. The producer owns the wheat that he grows, yet the Government assumes control of it and sells it at any price it deems fit, paying to the producers whatever portion of the proceeds the Minister decides shall be paid. When it was said that there was to be producer-control, wheat-growers all over the country naturally thought that that was the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is no matter for wonder that the honourable members for Swan( Mr Mountjoy) and Forrest( Mr member's time has expired. Lemmon) are not anxious to have the representation of their State on the hoard increased. This afternoon, when the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) proposed that Western Australia should have two representatives, they voted against his amendment, being content with only one member. Time reveals many things. It has been revealed to-day that those two members were aware of the amendment that was to be submitted by the Minister and realized that the additional representation proposed by the honourable member for Barker would not benefit their State, because there would not be producercontrol when the Minister became a dictator. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen) has asked, ""What is the story of the wheat industry ? "" He made a long review of its history, dating back to 1930. Ever since I became a member of this Parliament, I have endeavoured to prevail upon members on both sides of the chamber to view matters in the light of existing circumstances, and not to delve into the past. If the honthe honourable member for Barker, or any other honourable member, did something in 1930 which was not in the best interests of the wheat-growers-whic h is problematical-ho w could that be a reason for not dealing justly with the primary producers to-day?

There are no wheat-growers in my electorate, but there are many consumers, and I cannot see any reason for the hostile, reception' which this amendment has received. Under the amendment the. Minister would still be responsible to-Parliament, which in turn is responsible to the people. Honourable members opposite have often complained that we are seeking to take away the power of Parliament and to hand it to outside bodies, but to-night they are complaining of the opposite. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) become all hot and bothered in trying to explain what he had said. I wrote down his exact words. He said,. "" I don't want this bill to go through "". Later, he said, '-' I am not here to destroy the b ill "" . I Queensland function as business authorido not know any more effective way of destroying a bill than to prevent it from being passed. Honourable members have complained that the Minister is a dictator who will use the Government's majority to force the bill through. Honourable members seem to forget, however, that the Government enjoys its majority because the people, during the darkest hours of the country's history, gave it a mandate to govern. I have on a previous occasion explained where the election funds for the party opposite come from. The Labour party has been accused of being under the domination of Communists, but I remind honourable members opposite, that on the day that war broke out the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) issued an invitation to the Communist party to broadcast over the national stations. This clauseprovides that the board shall consist of seven representatives of the growers, elected by them, a miller and a chairman nominated by the Government. If that does not provide for democratic control, I do not know what the term means. Evidently, the honourable member for Wimmera does not want the bill to be passed, because it would give the control of the industry to the growers. He wants the industry to be controlled by the interests for which he works. I stand for grower-control of the marketnation in matters of policy. I believe ing of primary products. The Minister that the elected representatives of the for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr growers will have enough ability and Scully) has given an assurance that a majority of the members of the board will be growers directly interested in the industry. Let us compare this proposal with the marketing legislation in force in Queensland. There, the growers have the right by vote to establish an organization for the marketing of their products. That is very different from the proposal in this bill under which the real power will rest with the Minister, not'with the elected representatives of the growers. In Queensland, there is no ministerial control over the marketing boards. The Minister has power to approve or otherwise of the payment of fees and expenses to members, and there is no objection to that. In every instance, the' boards in ties, making decisions for which they are responsible, and putting those .decisions into effect. There is a government representative on each board, who -is an employee of the Department of Agriculture Because of his association with other boards, he brings with him knowledge that is of use. Sometimes, the Government representative is instructed by the Minister how to vote, and he votes according to his instructions. His vote may not be in conformity with the vote of the.majority, and the will of the majority prevails. I oppose the amendment because it means that if members of the board are not good boys they will have to take orders from the Minister. We remember that the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture overrode the decision of the Australian Wheat Board to send all surplus wheat to Britain and other countries in need of it and ordered that 50,000 bushels be used for making biscuits to feed racing dogs. Speaking on the stabilization proposal for 1938, the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that he had yet to see successful business administration by any organization under government control. The difference between the Queensland marketing system and that proposed in this bill is the difference between grower control.and government, control. I am against ministerial domi-",71,Pairs

The board must have wide powers. The elected representatives of the wheat-growers should administer the affairs of the board without let or hindrance. The regulations governing the wheat industry issued by the Minister in the past have operated very unfairly against growers in Queensland who have been unanimous in their opposition to them. As the result of the restrictive policy of the Government, one-half"" of the wheat consumed in Queensland was brought into that State from the southern States at a minimum 'price of 5s. 7d -The amendment moved by the Minister a bushel, and as local growers could have supplied the local market at as low a price as 4s.

The. board should be composed of representatives of the growers who have had practical experience in the industry and have the interests of the growers at heart. of this measure. The bait held out by They should have unfettered control. I oppose the amendment. opposition to this clause voiced by honourable members opposite proves clearly that they wish to destroy the wheat stabilization plan as a whole. The amendment merely seeks to embody in the bill a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy. Honourable members opposite cannot explain away their change of attitude in this matter merely by saying that a' similar provision was inserted in Statutory Rule 96 of 1939 to cover special war-time conditions. As a matter of fact that enactment was brought into operation before the outbreak of war. Do honourable members opposite fear that the Minister will abuse the powers proposed to be vested in him ? To quote an extreme case, tlie members of the board may decide to export so much wheat from this country as to leave the population short of this staple food. Would not the Minister then be justified in exercising his power of direction? Too frequently honourable members opposite complain about the vesting of too much authority in boards and commissions established by the Government. Do they now believe that the board controlling this great commodity should be unfettered and that Parliament should be ignored? That the.object of honourable members opposite is to destroy the planwas freely admitted to-night by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull). I advise the leader of his party to have a quiet talk with him so that lie may restrainhimself from making such frank statements in the future. Honourable members opposite have clearly demonstrated that they are opposed to the continuance of democratic control and parliamentary responsibility. for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) strikes across the very principles of this bill. The public should realize that the wheat-growers of Australia who produce the wheat and own it are to be called upon to place vast sums of money into a trust fund which is to be established in accordance with the provisions the Government to coerce the' wheat growers into acceptance of this plan is that provision will be made for producer control of the Australian Wheat Board. In his second-reading speech on the bill the Minister saidA wheat board will be set up to handle and sell the crops. Here we have the benefits of our war-time experience, and of an efficient organization which has met all war-time difficulties. It is established, its working is familiar, and wheat-growers want to keep it . That is true. The wheat-growers want to keep the board, on which they hope to occupy a powerful position, and through the agency of which they will be able to control their commodity and the funds which will be paid into the trust account. The Minister also saidWhen prices are high, growers will contribute up to 50 per cent, of the excess above the guaranteed price of export wheat. The money so subscribed will go into a stabilization fund, and will be used to meet the guarantee when prices fall. The fund will be a trust fund. Who are to be the trustees of the fund? Who but the growers-themselves have a legitimate right to be appointed trustees of the vast sums of money which, will be poured into the fund? And provision has been made for the growers to have",72,Pairs
318,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [9:32],The,73,Pairs
319,Mr Abbott (New England) [9.36].,"predominant representation on the board. The board, however, cannot function unless it is given adequate power, and ample power is already provided in the -clause as it is printed. However, at the last'moment the Minister seeks to nullify the whole of those powers by providing that the board shall exercise its powers only subject to his direction. It is extraordinary that neither in his second reading speech on this bill nor on legislaAgriculture, instructions have been clearly tion covering the meat industry in which a similar provision occurs did the Minister mention that the powers of the respective boards could be exercised only subject to his direction. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr .McLeod) claims that it is undemocratic for growers to have sole control of their own product through their elected representatives on the Wheat Board. The honourable member believes that the Minister should be given the powers of a dictator so that he may nullify the decisions of the board when it suits him to do so. I advise the honourable member to purchase a dictionary and see for himself what the word ""democracy that in all countries which have suffered from the rule of a dictator-and some are still so suffering-the shams of democracy have been preserved, and that behind those shams lies a power such as that sought by the Minister in the amendment now before us. The first to describe this power was Machiavelli, in his book The Prince, in which he pointed out that a dictator must preserve the forms of democracy if he desires to retain control of the people. If one reads the history of Soviet Russia to-day one finds that provision.is made for the holding of elections and that numerous candidates submit themselves for election. The only difference between the system in Russia to-day and that prevailing in the democracies is that in Russia all candidates are of the same political, colour. If the Minister is permitted to have his way with this amendment we shall shortly find the Government seeking to insert a similar amendment in the Electoral Act to provide that elections may be held subject to the direction of a Minister. Let us consider how some of these powers have been exercised in the past. Some time ago, I mentioned in this chamber-and the matMr Abhotl. ter is so apt as to justify my mentioning it again-that on the 11th February, 1946, the State Superintendent of the Wheat Board in New South Wales, Mr G. A. H . Holborow, issued a circular, M466, to millers and wheat distributors, in which he'saidPor gome months past, acting on the advice of the Wheat Allocation Committee, representative of Federal and State Departments of given to all concerned that Wheat and Wheat products (other than bran and pollard manufactured from the gristing of Wheat into Flour) may only be supplied to the priority of livestock, pigs and laying hens and pullet chicks. The fact that these instructions must be .taken literally and that Flour or Wheat and Wheatmeals must not be supplied for feeding any stock other than that specified and underlined above, has been emphasized on all occasions, but nevertheless reports have reached the Board that some Millers and others have been supplying Wheat products for other stock including the manufacture of dog biscuits. This advice is therefore given to all concerned that a serious view w ill be taken of any future departure from the instructions in this regard and that offenders w ill be liable means. It is well known to have supplies of Wheat discontinued. The circular stated that for some months past instructions had been given that wheat was not to be used for the manufacture of dog biscuits, that these instructions had been broken, and that wheat was being sold on the ""black market"" and illegally used for a purpose for which the board said it should not be used. On the 4th March, 1946, three weeks later, the State Superintendent of the Australian Wheat Board of New South Wales issued another circular to millers and wheat distributors, M 846, which reads1(1-18 O'Gonnell-strcet, Sydney, 4th March, 1946. Doc BISCUITS. Dear Sirs, With reference to Circular H.4./46 we have now to advise that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has made available 50,000 bushels of wheat for the manufacture of dog biscuits from 1st March to the end of tbe present ration period. The price of the wheat will be 4s. l i d . per bushel Sydney bulk basis and is not to be confused with the allocations made for feeding priority livestock. The wheat will be allotted on a percentage basis of the quantity used by millers for dog biscuit-meal between 1st March and 30th November, 1944. If you 'are interested in this trade, please fill in replies to questions hereunder and return by first mail. As the allocations must be made as quickly as possible replies must reach this office by Friday Sth inst., otherwise they must be excluded. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) G. A. HOLBOROW, State Superintendent. I ask honourable members and members of the public who happen to be listening to this debate to heed this. On the 27th March, I asked the MinisterWhat price or prices are at present being Minister overrode the board and, in his charged by the Australian Wheat Board f.o.b. explanation to the House, he misled it as for wheat for export, or for the manufacture to what had taken place. of flour for' export, bagged basis ? The reply was10s. 4|d. per bushel trucks port basis. According to the circular issued under of the facts. the instructions of the Minister, wheat was to be sold for the manufacture of dog listen, he will probably find that his biscuits at 4s. l i d . a bushel. That means memory is astray. The Minister Went on a loss to the wheats-growers of 5s. 5f d. on to sayevery bushel sold for the purpose. ' bread was rationed in the United Kingdom? time. That is a perfect example of what ' ministerial control of the board may lead to. Asi t is .proposed to be amended the clause will read:"" The board may, subject to any directions of the Minister,"" do certain things. What a perfect piece of camouflage that is! The public will not know that it is the Minister who is directing the board. The Minister may be able to make the board pliable by holding over the heads of its member's the threat of removal from the board. I ask honourable members to note that no provision is made for triennial elections of members. Once elected, members remain on the board, unless it suits the Minister to get rid of a man who is not pliable and replace him with someone more to his liking. The scheme has all the elements of a perfect dictatorship, because the Minister will be able to direct the board to carry .out his own wishes' notwithstanding that the carrying out of them may result in a dead loss to the producers. When the Minister replied to my charges about the allocation of wheat to manufacturers of dog biscuits he saidI t is not the Australian Wheat Board which determines the allocation of wheat for stock feed or sectional stock feed users. This is done by a committee consisting of representatives of my department, including the Director General of Agriculture, the State committees, and the Wheat Board. In New South Wales, was, during the period mentioned, chairman of the Wheat Allocation Committee; Decisions by this committee are implemented by the Australian Wheat Board. That is the board that previously said that wheat was not to be allocated for the manufacture of dog biscuits, but the is stating an untruth when he says that I misled the House. He is totally ignorant Wheat has been used in Australia for the manufacture of dog biscuits for a great number of years. In view of the urgent demand for wheat for export, a survey was made of all the . . ways in which wheat was being used, as it was considered that some saving could be made in the amount of wheat being released for various -purposes, including the manufacture Of-dog biscuits. This inquiry, which was of a""searching character, naturally made dog biscuit manufacturers and dog owners' organizations nomewhat apprehensive about future supplies. They called on me, and requested that the matter of supplies be reviewed as speedily as possible. But what the Minister did not tell the Souse was that earlier instructions had been clearly given by the Australian Wheat Board through the Wheat Allocation Committee that wheat was not to be used for the manufacture of dog biscuits. What the Minister did was to condone the black marketing operations of the dog biscuit manufacturers and mill owners, who were illegally allocating grain for gristing into flour for the manufacture of dog biscuits. Within three weeks the Minister smashed the decision of the Wheat Board and the Wheat Allocation Committee. If those directions represent the kind of directions that he will give to the new board, .the farmers must unanimously protest at the polls in order",73,Pairs

He saidIf an industry is subject to grower-control, there must also be grower-responsibility. The financial responsibilities under this bill will be borne, not by the wheat-growers, but by Australian taxpayers.

342,Mr Lemmon,"The facts are thathonorable member for Dalley that as the Government will be required to provide finance for this scheme, it should be represented on the board. It has been said that the growers are financing this pool. The right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Eadden) was particularly insistent on that point. If that were true, and if it were unnecessary for the Government to provide financial backing, there would be no need for this scheme at all. But we know that the Government must support the fund. If this were not so, the wheat-growers could manage their own pool. This, as every informed person is well aware, would be utterly impracticable, for strong government support is essential. If wheat falls below a certain price the Treasury will be called upon to keep the fund stable. The right honourable member for Darling Downs was fair enough to say that if such a time arrived a representative of the Treasury should be appointed to ""the board. If the price of wheat should fall below 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at ports, producers engaged in the pig, poultry, dairying and certain other rural industries will be called upon to contribute to the pool, for they will have to pay 5s. 2d. a bushel for the wheat they require. So, logically, they also could request representation. If the world wheat market should decline to it's 1938 condition, with a similar'low price for wheat, the Treasury and therefore the public of Australia would be required to provide £21,000,000 to keep this fund sufficiently solvent to ensure to the farmers 5s. 2d. a bushel for their wheat f.o.r. at ports.

This is one of a series of amendments I intend to move with the object of changing the clause to the pattern approved by the Australian Country party and described in detail hy members of that party during the second-reading debate. Our object is to exclude from the stabilization scheme the 1945-46 crop, to provide that the price to be paid a bushel bagged at growers' sidings, and to ensure that the price to be paid for the three subsequent crops which will be included in the stabilization period shall, be based on production costs. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will see the justice of this policy. As the Government has neglected to make provision for an inquiry into present production costs, we are without any data, except that",77,Clark
343,Mr Scully (Gwydir,Minister for,78,Clark
344,Mr Mcewen (Lndi) [10.21],"Iprovided by tbe wheat-growers' organizations. The Minister has been ready enough to accept the advice of representatives of growers' organizations in certain respects, and ' to regard it as a sufficient justification for doing certain things, so I hope that he will follow the same procedure in this instance. have demonstrated beyond doubt that a fair and reasonable price for this year's crop would be 5s. 2d. a bushel bagged at sidings, as against 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at ports, which is the price that the Government has adopted. We have enough information also to say with confidence that the Treasury is not likely to be called upon to make any contribution to the stabilization fund if the wheat from the next crop be acquired at 5s. 2d. a bushel bagged at sidings. As to the remaining three years that will be included in the stabilization period, we propose that a competent commission of inquiry should be constituted to take evidence and report on production costs. We are now dealing with one of the vital provisions of the bill. It . is at this point that the Government is farthest astray from the wishes of the wheat-growers of Australia. If it continues with its present policy it will perpetuate ""the gravest injustice that has ever been inflicted upon the Australian wheat-growers, in that it will break the spirit, if not the letter, of the law of this country. It has always been regarded as a fundamental principle in compulsory acquisitions' of any description in this country that the government shall acquire on just terms. We believe that wheat will not be acquired on just terms if the 1945-46 crop be included in the scheme at 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at ports and if the price for the 1946-47 crop be not varied as 1 have suggested. We shall have other opportunities to discuss the iniquitous proposal to include the 1945-46 crop in the scheme, and we shall take advantage of them. At the moment I am dealing with the 1946-47 harvest. Whatever the Minister may tell the House about the favorable views of hand-picked representatives of growers' organizations in regard to certain aspects of this scheme, he, as the representative of a wheat growing constituency, knows very well that the great majority of wheat growers in this country are not only opposed to the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop, but are also unshakably convinced that its inclusion would be the gravest possible injustice to the industry. I appeal to the Minister to The growers' organizations review his attitude on this subject, and to give effect to the well-established principle that all compulsory acquisitions shall. be made on just terms. The growers are collecting funds with a view to fighting the Government through the courts, in order to establish their rights. That is a sorry state of affairs. The Government ought to realizeclearly that, having promulgated a National Security regulation last October, designed compulsorily to acquire wheat in the crop then about to be harvested, it assumed the obligation to pay for that wheat what it was worth. That obligation cannot be satisfied by taking from the proceeds of the crop a total of £7,000,000, and placing it in a fund, the purpose of which is to aid some wheat-growers on a future occasion. Heaven knows, the wheat growers need badly enough to-day every penny that they can get. Justice demands that they shall be allowed to enjoy the full realization of that crop at the high level of export parity which prevails to-day, in order that they may mend their broken fortunes so far as they are able to do so. I appeal to the Government to accept my first amendment, thus indicating its willingness to exclude the 1945-46 crop, and subsequently to accept my later amendments, which are designed to alter the guarantee for the next crop from the paltry 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports to the fair price of 5s. 2d. a bushel, bagged basis, at growers' sidings, which is the only price so far ascertained that can be related to the cost of production. Commerce and Agriculture) [10.33] I am not prepared to accept the amendment. Argument in connection with the exclusion from the stabilization scheme of tlie 1945-46 crop would be merely tedious repetition, the only result of which would be to delay the passage of the bill, and I do not propose to engage in it.",78,Clark
345,Mr Scully (Gwydir,"Minister forof the Australian Country party) [10.34] I cannot allow the occasion to pass without voicing a protest on behalf of the party which I have the honour to lead. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), in the course of a most eloquent speech on the motion for the second reading of the bill, directed attention to what he regards as the constitutional requirements in this matter. He pointed out that this .stabilization scheme is to come into operation subsequent to the acquisition of the 1945-46 crop under the war-time powers conferred on the Government by the Constitution, which provides that property can be acquired only on just terms. That this wheat is the property of the growers cannot be denied. Its inclusion in the stabilization scheme will impose a levy on the growers of approximately 2s. 2d. a bushel. That tax on the proceeds of the crop is to form the . nucleus of the stabilization fund. Quite apart from the legal points that have been raised by the honourable member for Warringah, who is an eminent lawyer, does the Government consider that it is treating the growers equitably? Is it not confiscating this crop? It cannot be argued that equity is being observed. In order to minimize its responsibility, remote though that may be, the Government is acting inequitably, if not illegally. I should like to know whether it has obtained an opinion as to its legal position, having regard to the requirements of man of foresight and enterprise. The section 51 of the Constitution, and with particular reference to the points raised by the honourable member for Warringah. That question has never Been answered. The Minister, in his reply to the secondable to meet their financial obligations, reading debate, did not refer to the doubts that had been expressed by the honourable member for Warringah. So far, he has evaded the issue. The position should be clarified immediately. Apart altogether from the legal position, equity demands that the 1945-46 crop shall not be included in this stabilization Some of the growers may be involved to scheme.' I , too, am of the opinion that the 1945-46 crop should not be included in this stabilization scheme. The Government cannot justify its action in that regard. There is no warrant for inclusion, but countless reasons could be advanced in support of exclusion. Perhaps never before' has it been so necessary for the wheat-growers to have the extra money which should be available to them from the 1945-46 harvest. Up and down the country, fencing is in a state of disrepair and houses are dilapidated. During years of war and drought, the producers have carried on at a loss in the national interest, and their position is now uneconomic. Last year, there was drought in many places. Nevertheless, some wheat-growers produced crops. Those who did so are jiustified in asking that what they produced shall be excluded from this scheme. Many wheat-growers entered into financial commitments, believing that they would receive the full value of their crop, and these have to be met. A member of the Government has told me that long before harvesting the wheat-growers knew that the Minister intended that the crop should be included in the stabilization scheme, and they had not then entered into any financial commitments. That Minister represents a wheat-growing constituency in Western Australia. His statement proves how little he knows about the obligations of the wheat-growers. The wheat-grower undertakes financial obligations long before his crop is produced, perhaps before the'fallow of the previous year. He has to look ahead. He is a Government is now determined to include his 1945-46 crop in the stabilization scheme, and thus leave him "" high and dry "". Many of the growers will not be which they undertook honestly and fully intended to meet. In a time of desperate need, after a war, any amount, however small, is important to the primary producer. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has said that the aggregate amount will be £9,000,000. an amount of £1,000, whilst others may expect to receive only £100. I impress on the Government the necessity for making this money available. If I have to fight the whole scheme on no other",79,Clark

359,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [10.52].,"I believe that tbe price should be paid for the wheat at sidings. This would give the growers a more reasonable return, and would also be a step towards decentralization. Only by achieving decentralization can we maintain our present' standard of living. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, said in Melbourne this weekMelbourne is becoming too unwieldy. There cannot be a balanced economy until the population is more evenly distributed. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) said that production was the key to further relief from taxation. Therefore, I believe that it is important that the proposed price of wheat should be paid at sidings, because that would be a step in the direction of decentralization. Why should the growers have to send their wheat to a port in order to get a price? Why should they not be able to deliver it at a railway siding and get a price there? It reads very well in the newspapers that the growers are to receive 5s. 2d. a bushel, but in actual fact they will receive only 4s. 2d. or 4s. 3d. after rail freights have been deducted. Why should farmers have to sell at Melbourne prices and buy at Melbourne prices? Country residents have suffered all the time. If a farmer has to telephone to Melbourne for a duplicate part for his tractor it may. cost him 10s. by the time he has had a couple of extensions. On the other hand, a Melbourne factory owner, who wants a duplicate part for a machine, rings up the manufacturer and places his order at a cost of 2d. or less, and he may talk for as long as he likes. This Government has talked much of promoting decentralization, yet it is not prepared to bring in a plan under which wheat-growers will be paid for their wheat at country sidings. I am not one-sided, and I commend the Government of Victoria for establishing wool stores at Portland, because I cannot see any reason for hauling wool or any other commodity all the way. to the metropolis. does not favour putting the stores at Portland. mitted to the policy of the Liberal party, but to what the Australian Country party stands for. The building of wool stores at Portland is a step towards decentralization, but the payment of growers for their wheat at country sidings would be a much more important step. It is necessary to attract people to the country from the city, and this -ean be done only by improving living conditions in the country. member favour the selling of superphosphate at country sidings? Mr .TURNBULL -Yes, but I know that it would be impossible to achieve at present. At, the present time, the farmers must buy their superphosphate in the capital cities, and sell their wheat there. If they must buy in the city, at least they, should have one side of the deal, and sell their wheat at country, sidings at the stabilized price. That is the principal point in his amendment. It will aid decentralization and put this country on a better footing. The population of Melbourne is at present being retained in that city largely by what we might call the artificial growth of prosperity brought about by the expenditure of vast sums of deferred pay and other allowances by discharged members of the forces and by the wages of government officials em 1 ployed in departments which impose restrictions that are hampering production. That artificial prosperity cannot last. Only when the representatives of the people legislate with the knowledge that the land is the true basis of prosperity shall we attain anything approaching security. move That in sub-clause (3.), sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) be left out.

In order to oblige the representatives of wheat-growing electorates to reveal where they stand I propose to .move that the clause be postponed as an instruction to the Government to recast it in such a Way as to provide a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel bagged basis at sidings. That will enable us to discover the attitude not only of the Government-w e know that in advance-bu t also of individual representatives of wheat growing constituencies. If the amend-, ment be carried it will have the effect of raising the price of wheat to 5s. 2d. a bushel at growers' sidings, but even if it is rejected it will at least reveal how representatives of wheat-growing electorates vote on this particularly vital issue. I point out to the Government and to representatives of the wheat-growing electorates that this amendment will not involve the Treasury in the expenditure of one additiorial penny in respect of the forthcoming crop. The bill will no doubt be passed in such a form as to ensure that every bushel of wheat sold in Australia, for whatever purpose it be used, shall realize 5s. 2d. on a ports basis. We know that on -a rising market for wheat the Australian Wheat Board's price to-day even to Unrra and the London Food Council is 10s. 4£d. f.o.b. and it is clear that realizations will go higher than 5s. 2d. at sidings, which is the equivalent of 6s. Id. at ports. Honourable members may accordingly rest assured that if they vote for the amendment the Treasury will not be involved in any way. It may however, ;do violence to the*principles of those who slavishly follow the dictates of caucus and of a party which is concerned more about the interests of the consumers than about the dues of the producers, and which obeys the dictates of outside authorities such as the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. In order to ascertain whether these outside authorities are the masters of members or whether members are more concerned with the interests of those who elected them to this chamber, I move That the clause be postponed. rustic Bourbons opposite apparently have learned nothing and have forgotten nothing in the last three years. They forget the Dutch auction of their wheat policy at the last election-and their offer on that occasion was 2s. a bushel more than was provided in the Scully wheat plan yet they were ""lef t with the goods"". The people would have none of their policy. They are now playing their old game, . forgetting the lessons of the past. Exactly the same state of affairs will prevail at the coming elections. This scheme and the whole of the price-fixing structure and the guarantee have been agreed to by farmers' representatives and by massed meetings of farmers, and the States have made themselves responsible for the implementation of the scheme. Accordingly, the attempts of honourable members to sabotage the plan at this stage will not succeed. We gladly accept their challenge. As the representative of a wheat growing constituency with a knowledge of the wishes of -the wheat-growers, I assure honourable members opposite that the growers want security not for to-day or for to-morrow or next year, but for a long period. They know that honourable members opposite who make specious promises had an opportunity to do something for them over the last ten years but failed lamentably t'o grasp the opportunity. When witnesses are so suspect as are our political opponents, we need have no fear that the farmers will again commission them to look after their interests in this Parliament and will endorse whole-heartedly what is proposed .in this bill.

It is true that I did not inquire why the government did not go on with the proposal after I had left the Ministry. Possibly, as has been, fhe case to-night in respect of the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country party, the Government, acting on the advice of the Crown Law officers, finally rejected the proposal on the ground that it would increase the approj>riation. Close examination of the wheat industry and'in fact of any primary industry forces us to recognize the fact that the circumstances prevailing under the licensed crop system are totally different from those prevailing £11 13s. _4d. a ton. under an open market system. Under the latter system a grower does what he likes with his land; it is his business to determine what area he w i ll sow, whether he be engaged in the production of wheat, barley or oats. A t present, however, he is restricted by other factors. When he is not subject to restriction he may enter other forms of production, hut usually being away from the large centres of population, only in competition with others who may be more favourably situated. The honourable member for Swan referred to the desirability of imposing a flat rail freight on superphosphates. He will find that a uniform rate has been imposed on the transport of superphosphates in New Zealand for many years. In South Australia a somewhat similar arrangement has been made, the difference in freights between haulage over 50 and 100 miles being negligible. The amendment should be accepted by. the Government. occasion been guilty of influencing a Premiers Conference to agree to such a proposal, I am in the happy position of being able to vote for it to-night. It was at one time the policy of the party with which I was associated, and I trust that before long it will be generally accepted, particularly while restrictions of acreage and control of the wheat industry remain the law of the land. Honourable members opposite are persistI n my ent in their effort to destroy the wheat stabilization plan. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr. McEwen) is of the opinion that the present high wheat prices will continue indefinitely. In an interesting article headed ""Doubts of World Wheat Future "", which was published in the Melbourne Herald of to-day's date, the following pertinent statement appeared:Australia House Commerce Department officials are interested in the Ottawa report ol Canada and Britain signing a four-year wheat agreement within a fortnight, and the proposed different prices for the first two years and the second two years. According to the Daily Telegraph's special correspondent in Ottawa, the guaranteed price for the first two years will be £14 9s. a ton, and for the second two years a minimum negotiable price of On the price ruling it would be about £18 a ton.

368,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [11.13],"We know that is truebut future Indian imports will be smaller because of the recovery in the Far-Eastern rice areas. Countries, which at present are a good iharket for Australia, may be practically valueless in a few years. Australia is shipping no wbeat to Britain now. but is anxious to resume Anglo-Australian trading as soon as possible without prejudicing plans for trading on an international basis and assurances against gluts That is very importantAlthough the world wheat balance-sheet for 194546 showed a deficit of six million tons, the total estimated world wheat surplus for 194647 is 19 million tons. As the pre-war average eud-of-the-season surplus was 1.1 million tons, elements of a world glut can already be seen within a year. Australian commerce officials aregreatly prc-oecupied over future wheat trading. T impress upon honourable gentlemen opposite that this plan must be passed, not only by this Parliament but also by the State parliaments, and I urge them to use all their influence on their colleagues in the Legislative Councils in favour of the passage of the complementary State legislation because of the facts that are coming to notice. If honourable gentlemen opposite had their way, there would be no stabilization plan and within twelve or eighteen months of Unrra's disappearance from the market, the Australian wheat-farmers might have to accept 3s. a bushel for their grain. The Labour Government has guaranteed in that event to make up the difference between the market price and -5s. 2d. a bushel. That may commit it to the expenditure of many millions of pounds. opposite are quibbling over the proposal that the Minister shall be entrusted with the final responsibility to Parliament for the direction and management of the plan. I. enjoin the farmers not to listen to their propaganda. I warn them, too, that reports indicate that within five years we may once again have a world wheat glut. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), himself a practical farmer, knows that the wheat industry can go from one extreme to the-other very quickly. farmer know that is so. The last harvest [100] iu western Victoria seemed doomed to failure, but rain in October saved the crop and, as the honourable member for district had a bountiful harvest with so much hay to spare that the farmers have stacks of it standing to-day. The threatened disaster was averted in one month. Instead of opposing this bill all honourable members opposite should be acclaiming it. 1 agree with the honourable member foi may fall, but let us examine the position from that point of view. World parity for wheat is about 10s. a bushel f.o.r. ports. Now that the 1945-46 harvest is to be-included, the stabilization plan will cover the next four harvests. Suppose that four years hence wheat toboggans to 5s. a bushel. That would mean an average, price over the five harvests of 7s. 6d. a bushel. Tbe wheat-growers are to receive half of the difference between the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel and the realization, and, taking the realization at an average"" of 7s. 6d. a bushel, we have left in the pool Is. 2d. a bushel for every bushel grown in the five years. In order to simplify the reckoning, I take the difference left in the pool as Is. a bushel, which, for 1,000 bags, amounts to £150 a year, or £750 for five years. That would be the cost of the scheme to a grower who disposed of 1,000 bags a year. Another reason why I believe that the price should be at sidings, instead of f.o.r. ports, is that the wheat belongs to the growers, and the Victorian growers Yet honourable gentlemen favour a price at sidings. I have quotedfrom the Warracknabeal Herald before in order to show that the farmers agreed to the proposal made by the Perth conference of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. The newspaper, reporting a meeting of farmers at Warracknabeal, .=aid that it decidedThat pending the settling up of the commission of inquiry to ascertain the guaranteed floor price, the 5s. 2d. be accepted as first advance payment only; that any difference between the 5s. 2d. f.o.r. as a first advance payment and the determined guaranteed floor price as found hy the commission be made up by retrospective payments to the gtiaranteed floor price.

Disclaims Duty to Give Right to Reply"". It refers to a request by Mr Jeffrey Blaxland to the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting' Commission, Mr Moses, that he be permitted to broadcast a reply to what he described as an attack that I had made upon him in this House. Mr Blaxland's request, arose out of a question which I directed to the Minister for Information ( Mr misled. I make no attack on Mr Calwell) on Tuesday regarding the activities in Australia of the advertising firm, J. Walter Thompson and Company. The land, or make any attack upon him. I did mention a plot which was being hatched to betray .supporters of the Labour party at the forthcoming elections. Mr Blaxland is playing a very minor part indeed. I find it peculiar that the press allotted very little space to my question ai-cl the Minister's answer, but provided a column, with prominent headlines, for Mr Blaxland's complaint. J. Walter Thompson and Company, which employs Mr Blaxland, is a well-known advertising firm-one of the biggest in the world-and has ample opportunity to reply to any of my statements over the commercial broadcasting stations or through sections of the press which it influences from time to time through their advertising columns. As a matter of fact, a campaign has been in progress for some months to build up political opposition to me. and belittle my'own candidature, while I have been attending to my parliamentary duties in Canberra. In addition, paid organizers and ""whisperers"" have been working in my electorate for twelve months in the employ of certain interests to whom I . shall refer later. Smith's Weekly has published a full-page article-the author, I understand, was employed by Australian Consolidated Industries-and other inspired articles to build up opponents to me and belittle my candidature. I understand that these articles are sponsored by this advertising firm in conjunction with persons associated with the Century newspaper. It is remarkable that this firm is handling the advertising for the Liberal party in Victoriafor the forthcoming election campaign, and for the opposition to the referendum on behalf of the Lang party in New South Wales. It also sponsored Lang's broadcasts over what is known as the "" Freedom Radio"". I understand that in the coming campaign this firm will manage the advertising for the Lang party, which, of course, will oppose the Government. The articles in the Century are being sponsored, and paid for at advertising rates, but are not appearing as advertisements, so the reading public is being seriously Blaxland, because I believe that he is playing a very small part in the whole unsavoury business.

To my mind, this is a most unworthy procedure, which will put the '""'new blood"" candidates of the Liberal party in a very false light. Apparently, the Liberal party candidates will give their second preferences to the Lang party candidates in certain metropolitan seats in consideration of the Lang party candidates giving their second preferences to the Liberal party candidates or Australian Country party candidates in border line seats. This policy has nauseated the local committee of the Liberal party in my electorate, which objected to Liberal party candidates being required to advocate the giving of second preference to the Lang party candidate. The Lang party, as everybody knows, has done a great deal for many years past to undermine the Labour movement, and it has been associated with tin hares, fruit machines and other undesirable affairs. The bosses of the Liberal party, Mr Spooner and Mr Bridges, are apparently forcing this policy on Liberal party candidates in metropolitan seats. The Lang party candidates are engaging in the same sorry practices which they followed when they undermined the Scullin Administration. It is deplorable, in my opinion, that the Liberal party should' engage in this propaganda, which is entirely contrary to the customary practice of the respective political parties. It is, indeed, a peculiar situation. The Liberal party is apparently prepared to sacrifice its so-called "" new blood "" in order to bolster up the. decadent Lang party, and it is more concerned to bring about the possible entry into this Parliament of destructive Lang party candidates, who will set up a disruptive cave in this House. Such tactics ill become those who claim to stand for stable government. AlthoughI first mentioned this matter in the House only the other day, I learned of the proposal about two years ago. Tn fact, it conies down to us from the last State elections in New South Wales, when certain anti-Labour candidates That article made exchanged preferences with the Lang party. I refer honourable members to 1944 in which they will find reproduced A facsimiles of several "" How to vote"" cards under the heading ""Lang's Treachery Proved"". These ""How to vote "" cards relate to the Dulwich Hill, North Sydney and .Bondi electorates. I refer particularly to the Bondi situation, in which a person named Hallett, the Lang party candidate, authorized the giving of bis second preference to Frank Browne, the United Australia party candidate. Browne happens to be an employee of the firm of J. Walter Thompson and Company, and so is a fellow-employee of Mr Blaxland, who is campaigning against me in the Reid elec-. torate. It is a serious .commentary on election procedure that, in both New South Wales and Commonwealth election campaigns, Liberal party candidates should be advised to give their second preference to Lang party -candidates. This relates particularly to the metropolitan ' constituencies. of Reid, West Sydney, Cook and Dalley. I understand that a man named Harold Coote was selected as the Liberal party candidate for Reid, but when he discovered that he was to be regarded as a "" stooge "" or a "" tool "", and that he would be expected to advocate the giving of his second preferences to the Lang party candidate, he protested, and, under pressure from the Liberal party bosses, withdrew his candidature. We all. know, of course, of the disclosure to the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) that, for a consideration of £3,000, an attempt was made to ""sell out"" 200,000 Lang party votes during the last referendum. The negotiations were conducted, I understand, between Mr Sommerlad, M.L.O., and Mr A. C. Patterson, of the Century. The money was paid by cheque, aiid a receipt given by the Century. separate cheques, three of £1,000 each and one of £400. fortunate for the parties concerned that those negotiations came to light.

395,Mr Morgan,"It was rather unremarkable feature of current partu politics also that representatives of the Century newspaper are overseas at present negotiating with certain isolationist interests. It would be against the best interests of this country if such isolationist interests secured a footing in Australia. J. Walter Thompson and Company already seems to have a ""leg-in"". It claims to have power to buy and sell governments. From what I have heard of its activities in Europe before Hitler marched in there may be something in its claim; but I do not think that it is likely to succeed with its tactics in this country. I have heard that it is going to use its influence in every way possible to bring about my defeat at the next general elections, and will even go so far as to purchase local newspapers in my electorate. In effect, the "" heat"" is going to be turned on me in the coming campaign. It has been said that I should not use my privilege as a member of this House to defend myself against such attacks. Yet, while I am attending to my duties here, articles attacking me are being published, and organizers are going around the electorate attempting to undermine me. In order to show that this matter concerns not merely myself individually, but also the Labour movement as a whole, in the coming general election campaign, I quote the following from Smith's Weekly. of the 13th July last, from notes appearing under the heading ""Political Form Guide"":Lang's prospects are -worthy df a little study because the appearance of Lang in Canberra would provide news, entertainfnent and trouble, and the trouble would be for Chifley.

Too often we have heard honourable member's opposite make statements in this House traducing and vilifying persons outside who have not the opportunity to defend themselves in any way against such attacks. The honourable member for Reidsaid that he did not mention the name of the man who has had his case stated in the press to-day. I agree. All that he said in relation to this matter wasIs the Minister further aware that this unholy alliance has been conceived in the office of J. Walter Thompson and Company, an overseas big-business advertising firm with international ramifications ? He was referring to some plot being hatched by some true-blue Labour supporters and blue-blooded Liberals who were going to be sacrificed in order to appease Jack Lang. The honourable member's question was obviously a "" DorothyD i x "" . It was a question which he drafted in collaboration with the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) because the Minister, in using the name of Blaxland, showed that he knew all about the matter. It was obvious from the Minister's reply that he knew what the honourable member really wanted. The reply was as followsThe firm of J. Walter Thompson and Company has been engaged in a. great deal of ployee of that firm, named Blaxland, has been -endorsed as the Liberal candidate in opposiI t is obvious that the question was prearranged between the Minister and the honourable member for Reid. When the question was asked, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) took a point of order and drew attention to the fact that it constituted political propaganda of the worse possible kind.

We predicted that honourable member's opposite would indulge in these tactics once debates in this chamber were broadcast, and would take advantage of the air to indulge in political propaganda, and traduce and defame persons outside. Had these attacks been made in the press the victims would have had some redress, because the press would be obliged to make a fair report. However, once such statements are broadcast from this House the victims have no opportunity to use the same medium in order to answer their traducers. The honourable member for Eeid now aggravates his offence by traducing other members of the Liberal party. He has mentioned the names of Spooner and Bridges. alleged that an arrangement had been made by those men in regard to the electoral campaign in the division of Beid. The honourable member should make those charges outside the House and give an opportunity to the persons he attacks to defend themselves. name of another gentleman, a man formerly selected as the Liberal candidate for Reid, and said that because that gentleman refused to lend himself to a suggestion that his preferences be distributed in favour of the Lang-candidate-he was refused selection by the Liberal party. The honourable member should know different. If that statement is on a par with his other statements, then the latter are sadly lacking in truth. I do not. want to go into the reasons why that gentleman was asked to withdraw his name as a Liberal candidate. After all, it is not easy for a political body to ask a selected candidate to stand down. However, it was unfortunate that the honourable member should have used that gentleman's name in the way he did. I give the assurance that the reason why the man was asked to stand down was not the reason alleged by the honourable member. I shall leave the matter there. The article about which the honourable member has spoken contains protests from very reputable people in the community, including Dr. Duhig, Professor of Pathology ij» -the University of Queensland, the Anglican Bishop of Goulburn, Dr.'Louat, Professor Bland, Mrs. Constance Murray and the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Eraser), a colleague of the honourable member. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who, I believe, has interpreted the matter correctly, said thisIt is most important that a solution should be found to the problem of a person's right to reply to attacks made on him in Parliament, and broadcast in parliamentary broadcasts. A man who is personally attacked shotild have the right to reply. Good newspapers which report parliamentary attacks on people give those people the right of reply in their columns. I do not think it is a solution to the problem involved in parliamentary broadcast attacks to give the person attacked the right to demand time for a-reply through the Australian Broadcasting Commission. But a solution may be found by allowing He the person attacked to send his reply to the presiding officer of Parliament, or a specially selected committee of members of Parliament. „ Parliament could empower this officer or committee to decide whether the whole statement or a part of it should be broadcast in reply from the floor of the House. That is a fail"" statement. I hope that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro He also mentioned the has been correctly reported. It seems to me that we have reached the stage when men must demand from some authority the right, to answer traducers in this House who cannot be brought to account by any other means. The matter .is broadcast throughout the length and breadth of Australia. There is no WJV by which such calumnies can be cvrrtaken. The only redress is for the man attacked to appeal to a committee of this House, or to the presiding officer-as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has suggested-in order that justice may be done to him. The honourable member for Reid has not improved his credit by having made this further attack tonight on the other men whose names he has mentioned. He knows that he cannot be brought to account for what he may say in the exercise of his privileges in this House;but, as a legal man, he must realize the consequences if he is prepared to repeat the statements outside.

399,Mr Fraser (Eden,"Monaro) [12.6want to make it clear that, whilst what has been read by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), which I have heard to-night for the first time, appears to be a completely accurate report of what I said, it has no relation what' ever to the matter raised by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan). My ' comment was in .regard to a matter in which I am, and I imagine every member of this House must be, interested, namely, the opportunity for reply .by a -citizen whose personal or business reputation may be stake because of an attack made upon him in this House and broadcast by the national stations throughout .Australia. the honourable member in that regard. member made a mistake when he quoted me as having protested against something that had been said by the honourable member for Reid. I took my stand on a matter of principle alone. That principle is a perfectly good one, and I adhere to it. To my knowledge, no member of this House has more frequently made unwarranted personal attacks than has the honourable member for Wentworth. When I spoke on the principle of giving a means of reply to those who had been unfairly traduced in this House, I had in mind the attacks that were frequently made in this House by the honourable member for Wentworth. My comment was solely on the principle involved, and the solution which 1 suggested is one which I hope will eventually be adapted by this House. [12.8 a.m!] -It is my duty to give publicity to a system that is being operated in this country to-day, for which the Government must accept responsibility. It would be hard to conceive of more degrading tactics being employed. The Rationing Commission is taking action that is designed to make law-breakers of honest and fair-minded business people. In fact, business men may at any time be made the victims of traps that are set and misrepresentations that are uttered by "" urgera "". . Among the employees of the Rationing Commission is a law-breaking woman who visited a butcher shop in Maryborough, Queensland,'as did another woman in some Victorian cities not long ago. She pleaded with the shop assistant for some meat. Her appeal was the more pathetic in that it was made on behalf of her husband and child. She said that she had travelled a long way, and had no coupons. The assistant, a man of high repute who has a wife and four children, was prevailed upon to take pity on her and give her 14 oz. of steak. Mocking him, this government employee profusely thanked him. In order to make a further conquest, she then visited another butcher and repeated her appeal to this decent man's humanitarian instincts. Subsequently she revisited her victims-in the company of a government inspector, and laid charges against them. I am not complaining of inspectors doing their duty; but I do object to the Government employing "" stooges "" who adopt the contemptible methods employed by this woman. She later visited in Maryborough a. leading storekeeper, to whom she appealed for cigarettes, and tobacco for herself and her husband, offering at least £5 for a carton of cigarettes and more foi the tobacco which she.said that she and her husband smoked. She used all her persuasive powers to induce this storekeeper to become a law-breaker, but her efforts failed. She herself was a law-breaker in this instance; and she was employed by the Government for that purpose. If such low tactics are to be used to make law-breakers, the standard of behaviour in this country has degenerated. Some officials will descend to any depth of degradation in order to achieve their ends. If the Government does not countenance such dishonest tactics by its employees, which have been used for many months in different States, and in regard to which complaints have already reached Canberra, what action is it prepared to take to prevent their continuance? The two butchers whom I have mentioned are to appear before the court on the 24th July. I ask that these regrettable 'cases be immediately expunged from the records. Because of the early hearing of the cases, I have deemed it necessary to hold the attention of the House for these few minutes to-night. Question resolved in the affirmative.

402,Mr Bernard .Corser (Wide Bay),"The folloiuing answers to questions were circulated:senting the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, upon notice1. What members of the Federal Parliament have been granted licences to import goods into Australia? 2. What members of the Federal Parliament have been granted licences to export goods from Australia ? and Customs has supplied the following answers:1. See answers to parts 4 and 5 of Question No. 27 on notice-paper No. 116, asked by the honourable member for Wentworth, which appeared in Hansard on the 3rd July, 1916. 2. The occupation of applicants for export licences is not taken into consideration in dealing with the applications. A member of the Federal Parliament would not be disqualified from obtaining an export licence, provided his application was otherwise in order. So far as is known, no export licences have been granted to members of this Parliament; but, on account of the volume of documents concerned (approximately 40,000 licences have been issued throughout the Commonwealth since the 1st January, 1946, alone), it is not practicable to give a definite answer. that event, consideration will also be given However, if tbe foregoing information does not answer the honourable member's question, and if he will supply further details of the particular case he has in mind, further inquiries will be made. Civil Aviation, upon notice1. What is the capital value of aerodromes and controls in Australia used by operating airline companies? 2. What fees, if any, are paid by civil airand Wilcox Limited and/or any other factories lines for the use of aerodromes owned by the Commonwealth ? 3. Bo these operating companies contribute any payment for the meteorological services provided by the Government? 4. Is it proposed to instal radar equipment on civil aerodromes; if so, when it-is operating will this navigating aid be provided free to the operating companies who use it? the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. On the assumption that the honourable member, in referring to controls, had in mind air navigation aids,the answer, is that the capital value of Commonwealth Government aerodromes, including buildings provided for civil aviation purposes, as at the 30th June, 1945, was approximately £3,700,000. The air navigation aids provided for civil aviationpurposes represented approximately £1,100,000; In addition, there are aerodromes and buildings provided for Royal Australian Air Forceand Directorate of Aircraft Production purposes at a cost of approximately £6,100,000, which will be of value for civil aviation. 2. To date, it has not been the' policy ol the Commonwealth Government to impose landing fees for the use of Commonwealth landing grounds, this attitude being based on the desire to assist civil aviation during its early years. It is considered, however, that air transport operators are now in a position to contribute towards the cost of these facilities, and consideration is being given to imposing an equitable scale of charges for land fees and use of facilities. Operators do, however, pay rentals for building allotments on civil aerodromes and for Commonwealth buildings thereon and the revenue from this source for the year ended the 30th June, 1946, was approximately £12,000. 3. No. In drawing up the scale of landing fees aud charges for use of air navigation aids to which I have referred in answer to question Xo. 2, consideration will be given to including a component on account of meteorological services. 4. Tests of experimental radar equipment are now being conducted and, if these are successful, it is probable that such equipment will be installed on civil aerodromes. In to including in the scale of charges to operating companies a component on account of the radar equipment installed. ' Attorney-General, upon notice1.

Similar .searches are being carried out every day without attracting newspaper, publicity. honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) asked a question concerning action said to have been taken against certain officers of the Customs Department. The Minister for Trade and Customs has now informed me that no officer of -that department has been dismissed recently as a result of any departmental inquiry, but that certain officers have been reduced in status in connection with charges made against them under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. As other proceedings against other persons are pending, I regret that I cannot give any further information on this subject at present. I may add that the action taken against the officers did not arise out of the searches made on the Monterey and the Mariposa, as seems to have been suggested by the honourable member.
