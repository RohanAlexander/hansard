(51) Schedule 1, item 1, page 99 (lines 21 to 23), omit subsection (1), substitute: (1) This section applies to an entity (the relevant entity) that is an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) or an *inward investing entity (non-ADI) for a period that is all or a part of an income year, and each *associate entity of the relevant entity that is: (a) an *outward investing entity (non-ADI), an *inward investment vehicle (general), or an *inward investment vehicle (financial), for that period; or (b) an *inward investor (general) or an *inward investor (financial) for that period if it carries on its *business in Australia at or through one or more of its *Australian permanent establishments throughout that period. (52) Schedule 1, item 1, page 100 (method statement in subsection 820-910(2)), omit the method statement, substitute: Method Statement Step 1. Apply step 2 to each *associate entity of the relevant entity that is the kind of entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) at that particular time. The result of that step is the associate entity debt amount for that associate entity. Step 2. Work out the value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests that have been issued to the relevant entity by the *associate entity, if: (a)the debt interests remain *on issue at that time; and (b) the costs in relation to the debt interest (to the extent that they are not amounts mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) of the definition of debt deduction that are ordinarily payable to an entity other than the relevant entity) are assessable income of the relevant entity for an income year; and (c) the terms and conditions for the debt interests are those that would apply if the relevant entity and the associate entity were dealing at arm’s length with each other. Step 3. Apply steps 2 and 4 to each *associate entity of the relevant entity that is the kind of entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) at that time. The lesser of the results of those steps is the associate entity debt amount for that associate entity. Step 4. Work out the value, as at that time, of the *debt capital of the *associate entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the *Australian permanent establishments of that associate entity. Step 5. Add the associate entity debt amounts for all the *associate entities. The result of this step is the associate entity debt. (53) Schedule 1, item 1, page 100 (lines 26 to 28), omit subsection (2), substitute: (2) The entity’s associate entity equity at a particular time during that period is the sum of: (a) the total value of *equity interests that the entity holds in all of its *associate entities at that time; and (b) the total value of *debt interests issued to the entity by its associate entities that: (i) do not give rise to any *debt deductions for that or any other income year; and (ii) remain *on issue at that time. (54) Schedule 1, item 1, page 103 (method statement in subsection 820-920(4)), omit the method statement, substitute: Method statement Step 1. Work out the *safe harbour debt amount of the *associate entity for the day during which that particular time occurs, as if: (a) the associate entity were an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) or *inward investing entity (non-ADI), as appropriate, for the period consisting only of that day; and (b) if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an *outward investor (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a *financial entity throughout that day-the associate entity were an *outward investor (general) for that day; and (c) if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a financial entity throughout that day-the associate entity were an *inward investment vehicle (general) for that day. Step2 Reduce the result of step 1 by the value of the *adjusted average debt of the *associate entity for that day as if it had been the kind of entity that it is taken to be under step 1 for that day. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil. Step 3. Multiply the result of step 2 by the sum of: (a) the value, as at that time, of all the *equity capital of the *associate entity that is attributable to the relevant entity at that time; and (b) the value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests issued to the relevant entity by the associate entity that do not give rise to *debt deductions of the associate entity for that or any other income year and remain *on issue at that time. Step4 Divide the result of step 3 by the sum of: (a) the value, as at that time, of all the *equity capital of the *associate entity; and (b) the value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests issued by the associate entity that do not give rise to *debt deductions of the associate entity for that or any other income year and remain *on issue at that time. The result of this step is the attributable safe harbour excess amount.

Add to the result of step 1 the total value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests issued to the entity to which the following paragraphs apply at that time: (a)the debt interests remain *on issue; (b) each of the debt interests is a loan of money for which no fees, charges or other consideration for the purpose of enhancing the credit rating of the issuer of the interest has been paid or is payable to the entity, any of the entity’s *associates or another entity that is a *foreign entity; (c) each of the entities issuing the interests has the required credit rating for the interests concerned in accordance with subsections (4) and (5). Step 3. Add to the result of step 2 the total value, as at that time, of all the *debt interests that are assets of the entity (whether they are debt interests issued to the entity or not) and to which the following paragraphs apply at that time: (a) the risk weight of each of the debt interests is either 0% or 20% under the *prudential standards; (b) the debt interests do not satisfy all of the paragraphs in step 2.

331,An Election The Best Of Health And Every Op,"Mr TIM FISCHER (Farrer) (7.27Thursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31775 Thursday, 27 September 2001 ----Australian Taxation Office: Wollongong Job Losses Dr MARTIN (Cunningham) (9.51 a.m.)-I rise today to ask the question: why is it that the Howard government continues to kick Wollongong in the guts? I raise this in reference to the latest decision being taken by the Australian Taxation Office to slash some 40 jobs from its work force in Wollongong. I met recently with a number of workers within the tax office, all dedicated individuals and civil servants who have given a lifetime of commitment to their organisation. They have told me that 40 jobs are being lost from Wollongong-about 17 per cent of the total staff-whereas the national average is only seven per cent, given the government’s decision to axe something like 1,300 staff nationally from the Australian Taxation Office. They asked the question: is this a first step to actually getting rid of the tax office in Wollongong completely? I have to say that I ask that question myself. It was the Keating government which took the decision to build the office there. I remember being absolutely and intimately involved in the decision for getting that building. This latest decision is going to force 30 staff either to relocate to Hurstville-and that is totally unpalatable-or take voluntary redundancy. This, as I understand it, is a clear contravention of the agency agreement that the ATO has signed with its staff and will put totally unjustifiable pressures, both financial and personal, on everyone concerned. The loss of 40 jobs in Wollongong at this time of economic uncertainty is going to have a significant negative impact on the local economy. Of those 40 jobs, 38 staff are working in the personal tax business line, and their number is going to be reduced to four. The other 34 members have been offered a limited number of redundancy packages. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, on 18 September asking him to contact the tax office and put an immediate stop on this decision to eliminate 40 jobs from the tax office in Wollongong. I am doing so because at this time, with the continuing complexities and uncertainties associated with the implementation of the Howard government’s GST, I would have thought more people would have been needed there. The tax office workers say to me that the number of complaints and consultations coming into the personal business and personal tax area is increasing. Why then is the tax office making the decision that it wants to cut down the number of people in Wollongong? This comes hard on the heels of the Howard government’s shutting down, over the last five years, the immigration office and Medicare offices and turning its back on Wollongong. I have to say to the people in the tax office that we will do what we can to ensure those jobs are retained. It is up to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, to go to the tax office and say, ‘Stop this ridiculous closure; stop this ridiculous elimination of jobs.’ (Time expired) Moreton Electorate: QEII Jubilee Hospital QEII Jubilee Hospital in the heart of the electorate of Moreton. The backbone of any hospital is its auxiliary. The QEII hospital auxiliary has a proud history of achievement over the past 21 years.

They also provide direct assistance to patients under the direction of hospital staff. Over the years so many generous and community minded people have volunteered their services to the auxiliary and, in doing so, have helped an immeasurable number of patients and their families. This year the auxiliary goes from strength to strength under the leadership of Marjorie O’Keeffe-her late husband, Clem O’Keeffe OAM, was the inaugural president. In fact, seven of the original auxiliary members continue to struggle on. People like Rose O’Brien, who is well into her 90s, are there every week making their famous hamburgers and financing all sorts of amazing equipment. Well over a million dollars worth of equipment, in fact, has been put together by the auxiliary over the past 20 years. When you look back over the history of the hospital, the Labor Party in 1992 were doing their best to end general hospital services at QEII and people like me worked with the local community to reverse that approach. It took many years. In fact, it took the creation of a state coalition government in 1995 and Mike Horan, who is now the leader of the opposition in Queensland, as health minister to follow up on what the community wanted and reverse Labor’s efforts to wind down the hospital. It is astonishing to know that in 1995 QEII hospital had only nine patients admitted on one particular day, whilst at midnight on 25 March 1997 the hospital recorded its busiest day in many years with 106 patients. This came about because, during a black part of its long but now celebrated history, the community spoke about the need to keep the general hospital services at QEII hospital. I will never forget the day when Dr Michael Wooldridge, our federal health minister, attended the hospital to have a look for himself. He was stunned to go into one of the operating theatres of the hospital in 1995, when Peter Beattie was the health minister, to find the place was filled with storage of boxes and even mannequins-mannequins in the operating theatre so that people could imagine that that is what doctors and nurses look like in such a place. That is what the Queensland Labor government did to the QEII hospital in the early 1990s. The community, and I was certainly involved in the campaign from 1992 onwards to reverse Labor’s bad planning as far as health services were concerned, are rightly concerned that the QEII hospital remains under threat whilst there is a Queensland Labor government. I will continue to work with the community to make sure QEII has another celebrated 20 years or more to come.

The community has a football ground that is the home of some young, dedicated footballers who have played football together well before their teens. They love their football, their football club and the life around it. The people who make up the Woodsdale Football Club play their football in the Oatlands District Football Association. The association is now 50 years old, an impressive age for a country association in changing times. The interesting point about this club is that Woodsdale has a great history of making grand finals. This year they played in their 13th successive grand final and won, which made it their 10th premiership out of 13. This has to be some sort of a record. They beat another good team, Kempton, with which there has been keen and lively competition over many years. The football association is an important part of this area, and one of the strengths of the association at this time is Helen Scott, who is the president of the association and deputy mayor of the Southern Midlands Council.",151,Representatives Main Committee

Second Reading stration) (10.00 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 was passed by the parliament on 28 June this year. With this act, the government took decisive action to address the further spread of problem gambling. The act responds to serious community concern about the potential for online technologies to exacerbate problem gambling. Under the act it is now an offence to: provide an interactive gambling service to customers in Australia; provide an Australian based interactive gambling service to customers in designated countries; and publish or broadcast an interactive gambling advertisement in Australia. The advertising ban is a key element in minimising the accessibility of harmful forms of interactive gambling. The ban is comprehensive in its scope and includes a prohibition on the promotion of ‘words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service (whether also closely associated with other kinds of services or products)’. This provision is designed to prohibit the surreptitious marketing of interactive gambling services via, for example, the promotion of clothing or accessories bearing the service’s brand. However, it has come to the attention of the government that the ‘close association’ provision could unintentionally prohibit the advertising of land based casinos in cases where those advertisements might be closely associated with an interactive gambling service. For example, an Australian licensed land based casino might develop and provide an interactive gambling service wholly to customers outside Australia who are not in designated countries. Such a service would not be in contravention of the main offence provisions of the act. However, if the land based casino gives a name to its online service that is similar to the name for its land based licensed service, there is a risk that over time advertisements for the",152,Representatives Main Committee

The advertising prohibition in part 7A of the act, as originally introduced, did not intend to prohibit the advertising of land based casinos as outlined in this example. While the government is concerned about the growth and accessibility of offline gambling, this has always been a matter for the states and territories to address. For this reason, the advertising ban needs to be amended to allow this unintended consequence to be rectified. The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001 provides for a regulation making power in relation to the advertising ban. Using this power, regulations may be made to exempt advertisements of a specified kind from the definition of ‘interactive gambling service advertisement’. These regulations will be disallowable by parliament. The government will use the Ministerial Council On Gambling to continue to pressure states and territories to combat the socially harmful effects of land based gambling services. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. 2001 amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 to allow regulations to be made under the act to provide that certain advertisements are not interactive gambling service amendments and therefore are not prohibited under part 7A of the act. The government’s policy in introducing the amendment is to allow the exemption from the ban of interactive gambling advertisements, advertisements that, while primarily advertising a non-interactive gambling service, may also by association advertise a lawful interactive gambling service-for example, a service provided from within Australia to people outside Australia. This would occur where a particular trade name for a non-interactive gambling service was synonymous with a lawful interactive gambling service. While unobjectionable in itself, this bill only serves to further highlight the unworkability and hypocrisy of the government’s approach to interactive gambling. Contrary to the repeated assertions by the government, this is not a debate about who in this chamber cares more about the problems posed or caused by gambling. Others have spoken during debate on the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and in debate on the Internet Gambling Moratorium Act 2001 on the problems that gambling causes to individuals, their families and friends, and the wider Australian community. I do not intend to repeat those concerns that I am sure are shared by everyone in this chamber. The real issue is whether the approach undertaken by the government will be the most effective in addressing the social ill we all wish to address. The opposition regrets that it is not. The problems caused by gambling, and how to deal with them where that gambling is provided over the Internet, have been discussed extensively in recent times at the Commonwealth level. The Productivity Commission, for example, considered the issue in its report on gambling. The National Office for the Information Economy has twice considered the issue, and Senate committees have considered it on three separate occasions. The result of all that deliberation is that the overwhelming weight of expert evidence is that the government’s approach-imposing an alleged ban-is not the most effective means of tackling this problem. The government has repeatedly and disingenuously claimed that the opposition will put a casino in every Australian lounge room. Yet the practical effect of the government’s act has only been to ensure that the lounge room casino is foreign owned and operated, with possible links to organised crime and with potentially no appropriate protections for problem gamblers or consumers. The government’s legislation is, as I have described, hypocritical and unworkable, and this amendment shows itself, as I said in the second reading debate on the act itself,",153,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (10.04 A.m.),"The Interactive Gambling Amendment BillThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31779 to be a dog’s breakfast. Amendments to the act, such as the one we are considering today, only serve to reinforce that conclusion. This bill is not opposed, but that does not alter the fundamental problems with the government’s approach to this vexed issue of public policy. It proves that there are no easy lines to draw on the online world and that the simplistic approach adopted by the government fails to reflect that. By contrast, the opposition has consistently proposed a comprehensive, effective and strong regulatory approach to interactive gambling, an approach we have spelt out in detail both in our second reading amendments to this bill in the Senate and during debate on the act. I urge the government to reconsider its approach, even at this late stage, and to support a response to interactive gambling that is widely recognised as being a better response to the social ills caused by gambling, whatever its form. Consistent with those remarks, I would like to formally move a second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House; (a) condemns the Government for its unworkable, hypocritical and inconsistent approach to interactive gambling which will not reduce the social harm arising from interactive gambling and; (b) calls on the Government to show national leadership on this issue by putting in place a comprehensive, effective and strong regulatory regime in co-operation with the States and Territories and the international community as proposed by Labor”. As indicated earlier, we do not oppose this bill in the Senate. In the other place earlier this week we allowed this bill to be passed in a non-controversial fashion, to ease and facilitate the government’s legislative program. In that place we also put on the record our second reading amendment, and, whilst you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would remember more than most that on some occasions in this place I have caused divisions to occur, I would not be proposing on this occasion to cause that to be effected either here or in the other place. Amendment Bill 2001. The amendments to this bill are to ensure that the advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill. We do not want to catch out legitimate gaming operators who may market online services offshore in markets where that service is not prohibited. It came to the government’s attention that the act may have inadvertently prohibited the advertising of land based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers, so that if an Australian based casino used its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services then there would be a chance that the name would become ‘closely associated’ with the interactive gambling service. This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land based services. The ALP might argue that it is inconsistent for the government to amend the legislation to facilitate casino operation when its general policy is to encourage a reduction in gambling levels in the community. This ignores the minister’s commitment in the Senate that the advertising prohibition would only extend to those interactive gambling services made illegal by the act. Those opposite profess compassion for the Australian people, but we on the conservative side are the ones who have taken action to protect Australian families.

National Party policy on the family is fundamental. We want to see that the family as a unit in society is nurtured and made to thrive. Our policy says specifically that government policy should preserve and promote the family. The Nationals in government would deliver on this, and indeed we have. By contrast, a quick look at the Labor Party web site shows that they have no family policy. But you do not have to go online to realise that it is obvious that their opposition is to the Interactive Gambling Act. They are soft on Internet gambling just as they are soft on drugs, soft on crime and-depending on which way the wind blows-soft on illegal immigrants. Their opposition does not just go against the moral values of middle Australia; it goes against expert recommendations, economic sense and the findings on gambling addiction. The National Office of the Information Economy commissioned economic modelling that suggested the banning of online gambling may have modest or small economic benefits for Australia in terms of restricting access to harmful activity and may have aggregate benefits for the states and territories in their taxation revenues. It found the growth of interactive gambling had the potential for negative social consequences in Australia because of the increased accessibility to gambling services. Indeed, this is what the original act was all about. The Productivity Commission report on gambling revealed some staggering and sobering facts. Over 80 per cent of Australians gambled last year, spending $11 billion, with 40 per cent gambling regularly. Gambling is a big and rapidly growing business in Australia, with industries currently accounting for an estimated 1.5 per cent of GDP and employing over 100,000 people in more than 7,000 businesses throughout the country. However, the net gains in jobs and economic activity are small when account is taken of the impact on other industries of the diversion of consumer spending to gambling. Around 130,000 Australians, about one per cent of the population, are estimated to have a severe problem with their gambling. A further 160,000 adults have moderate problems which may require some form of treatment. These two groups together warrant policy concern. When we take them together, we have 290,000 problem gamblers-2.1 per cent of the population. Problem gamblers comprise 15 per cent of the regular non-lottery gamblers and account for $3.5 billion in expenditure annually-about one-third of the gambling industry’s market. You can see that about 15 per cent of the regular gamblers send off about 33 per cent of the $11 billion expended on gambling. They lose on average about $12,000 a year compared with only $650 for non-regular gamblers. Perhaps the most damning finding in terms of the opposition to this bill is that the prevalence of problem gambling is related to the degree of accessibility to gambling, particularly gaming machines. That is the point I want to stress in this address. Despite these blackand-white findings, the Beazley bandits want the one-arm bandits in every lounge room. What impact do you think it will have on families? It is interesting to note from the Productivity Commission’s findings that the Labor Party is out of step with the wider community. Seventy per cent of Australians surveyed believed that gambling did more harm than good and 92 per cent said they did not want to see any expansion of gambling activities. According to a recent survey by AustraliaSCAN, 75 per cent of Australians believe gambling on the Internet is not acceptable. The Labor Party says it is too hard to regulate the Internet. I say that is a defeatist attitude and shows a lack of understanding of the media. We have banned advertising on gaming services across all media to limit access to the Australian market.

Mr Snowdon interjectingTerritory that when the chair is talking he should be silent. Member for Hinkler, you will ignore the interjections coming from the other side and also you will not ascribe support or nonsupport for any previous bill to the occupant of the chair. You will address your remarks through the chair. Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act introduced by the ALP in 1992 as a precedent for this act that we are introducing. It is surprising, then, that the opposition should be opposing it. Offshore or Australian operators that provide online gaming services to customers in Australia are liable for an offence of providing a prohibited interactive gaming service. While members opposite may be prepared to put this one in the too-hard basket, my National Party colleagues-and, no doubt, my coalition colleagues-and I say that nothing is too hard when it comes to protecting families. In passing this legislation we will help protect the young, computer literate generation from new and immediate forms of gambling recognised by experts as dangerously addictive. We will also help prevent a situation where people can lose the shirts off their backs within a few minutes of sitting down in front of a home computer. I feel very strongly about this. I will tell you why. Of recent times I have seen the demise of a lot of clubs, a demise which has come about by an overreliance on poker machines. We had a lot of good clubs on the New South Wales and Queensland coasts, where as you know there is quite a holiday atmosphere and where people-the member for Robertson is a typical example-do like to have good clubs to enjoy social interaction, to attend sporting events, to have a drink with their mates, to play indoor and outdoor sports. They have gymnasiums. All sorts of good things come with clubs, but when you overlay it with the poker machines-and I am not saying that people should not gamble; I am just saying when you let this become the overriding aspect of the club-the minute those poker machines get into trouble the whole club collapses. We have seen a whole variety of these on the New South Wales and Queensland coasts in the last couple of years. To see these beautiful clubs close because of this overreliance on poker machines is a dreadful thing. Let me take you on from that to the damage that does to a community in terms of social interactivity. If we were to have allowed interactive gambling on the computer, can’t you just imagine some lonely soul at night with a stubbie in one hand and the mouse or the keyboard in the other, with some special facility, which no doubt would be devised very quickly, where you shove your credit card in; can’t you just see him shove the credit card in, ring up $50 or $100 worth of credit, stubbie in one hand-and away he goes, all night. You could send off hundreds of dollars like that. At least when you go to a club there is the discipline: you have to go to the counter; you have to pick up your coins; you have to put them through the machine; you have to physically go through the process of doing it. I say that Internet gambling would further exacerbate the problem. Already we have, as I pointed out earlier, more than our fair share of problem gambling in Australia. I am no moralist about this: if people want to gamble on horses, or dogs, or gallops, if they want to have a flutter on the poker machines, if they want to get scratchies from the newsagent, I make no judgments.

It is obvious that an overreliance on poker machines has damaged a lot of families. Also, those clubs that have become overreliant on them, when they cannot support the activities of the club by any means other than poker machines, promptly fall over, and there is a great loss of social interaction in the communities that they serve. I feel very passionate about this: if we were to have allowed interactive gambling on computers in homes, we would have had a whole plethora of new problems, not least of which would have been young, computer-literate people having a dabble. Even if there were security PIN numbers, not all parents are so focused in that regard. The kids find out what dad’s PIN number is, get on the machine and away they go. Worse still, imagine how many people, who at least have to make the effort to have some social interaction and go to a club, would not even go to a club. I feel that the government has done a very good job on this matter. To some extent, I feel sad for the Northern Territory. I had a very heated debate in the party room with Senator Grant Tambling on this issue. I think his treatment by the Northern Territory CLP was regrettable. He did fight bravely for the Northern Territory on this issue, in both party rooms. He was quite focused. I know that, firstly, because I am the National Party Whip-I have seen him in action-and, secondly, because I debated against him. Having said that, with all the respect I have for him, and knowing the difficulties that this may cause for the Northern Territory, I believe the government has gone down the right track in the national interest. This amendment is a sensible one because it rectifies an unintended consequence for the existing gambling industry. For that reason, I support the bill. bate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001, although I must say I was quite amazed by the bizarre contribution by the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, and I will address that in some detail shortly. Initially, I want to comment on the latter part of his speech in which he spoke about the contribution of Grant Tambling. I have no idea what went on in the party room of the National Party or in the joint party room, but he was right-this was one part of his speech which was correct-in saying that the CLP unjustly dealt with Grant Tambling. I think, frankly, that it is a matter of some concern to all of us that we have a political party in the Northern Territory-thankfully, it is no longer the government of the Northern Territory-which threatened one of its members that, if he did not vote the way it wanted him to vote in the federal parliament, it would withdraw his preselection. That is not only wrong, but I suspect there is a very good chance that it represents a breach of privilege, because no-one has the right to tell a person how they are to cast a vote on the floor of the chamber. They may, at some subsequent time, say to a person, ‘In the past you failed to vote in the way we wanted you to vote, therefore when you’re up for preselection next time you’re not getting our support.’ But that is not what occurred. He was a preselected candidate and the CLP, as a result of the government’s failure to support its view, deliberately overturned his preselection in a subsequent act. That is not only unfair; it is wrong. fended it very well. It demonstrates the absolute lack of influence that the Northern Territory CLP government had here in Canberra, despite the fact that the Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia is none other than Shane Stone, a Northern Territory resident, a former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and a member of the CLP. I know that he has now disowned the CLP.

But somehow or other, people who might be playing on the Internet are clearly a different quality of person, because they deserve condemnation. Others do not; habitual punters who might have a severe problem with betting are not a problem for him.

Somehow or other, people who sit at home and have access to the Internet are different. uty Speaker. I refer to the Bills Digest because the summation contained there is a very good one. In terms of the reason for the amendment, it states: In moving the amendments to the Interactive Gambling Bill on 28 June 2001, the Minister (Senator the Hon. Richard Alston) stated that ‘The advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill’. However, it has since come to the Government’s attention that the Act may inadvertently prohibit the advertising of land-based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers. Section 61BA(1)(e) defines an interactive gambling advertisement as any writing, visual image or audible message that promotes ‘any words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service’. If a land based casino uses its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services, then there is a chance that the name will become ‘closely associated’ with the interactive gambling service. This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land-based services. Understand what this means: if I am a casino operator and I have an interactive gambling service which goes to countries which are not nominated in this bill, that is fine; that is okay. But if Australians want to gamble on that service, that is not okay. What sort of moral duplicity is this? We are making a judgment that it is fine for people in some other country to gamble on these sites, provided they are not one of the nominated countries, but it is not fine for Australians to gamble on these sites. Conversely, there is absolutely nothing that can be done by this government or any other to prevent Australians, wherever they might live, who have got access to the Internet, from gambling on the Internet. I am happy to take the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who has just delivered the second reading speech, and any other member of the National Party and the Liberal Party, down to my office so that we can play a few games on the Internet. Let us call up some gaming sites around the world. You do not have the ability to prohibit it. Yet, instead of accepting the integrity of standards that can be applied in Australia, there is the lunacy of saying to this one small segment of the gambling industry, ‘What you do is immoral; it is improper. We’re concerned about the state of the nation.’ I tell you it is very clear that members of the National Party and the Liberal Party do not go to workers areas around Australia. They do not go to the clubs and casinos that I go to. They do not see those people playing the one-armed bandits that I see. What response do they have? They say, ‘That is a state responsibility.

It Is Worth Contemplating What This All Means, Mr Dep","31784 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 member for Hinkler was bizarre and so is the proposition that has been put forward by the government in relation to Internet gambling. It is not a sensible approach. The Bills Digest says: Of course, any casino which wished to avoid this possibility could simply use a different name for its interactive gambling services. However, this would deny a reputable casino the opportunity of capitalising on its good name with regard to its interactive services. This could be a considerable drawback, as a reputation for reliability is essential for a successful Internet gambling operation. It might be argued that it is inconsistent for the Government to amend its legislation to facilitate casino operationswhich is what it is doingwhen its general policy is to encourage a reduction in gambling levels in the community. That strikes me as a bit hypocritical. It is hypocritical and, I think, it smacks of the political opportunism which it exhibits. I have already referred to Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling has been dumped by the CLP for not crossing the floor in parliament on this issue. What we also should understand about this industry is that Australian operators make up less than four per cent of the world interactive gambling market. Ninety per cent or thereabouts of Australian interactive revenues come from international sources. Online gambling is approximately one per cent of Australian gambling-only one per cent. So here we have the opportunity for an industry to develop which could be properly regulated to ensure the security of both the punters and the institutions-the casinos or the other gaming houses or betting institutions. With that proper regulation it could address the issue of credit in a way which cannot be done on a racecourse. The member for Hinkler referred to people using their credit cards at home, slotting them into a machine. I do not gamble myself, but I go to these places and I see people lining up by the funny money machines. You see people line up with their cards-they are using credit cards or making cash withdrawals through EFTPOS-and go back in and lose money on poker machines or other games. What does the government propose to do about that? Is it suggested that the state and territory governments say that these instant opportunities for credit should not exist at gambling institutions? I am sure it is not. The main issue here is online gambling. Online gambling is the most important issue in Australian gambling. Australia has around one-fifth of the world’s poker machines, and of course this is where the real problem is. The introduction of this legislation has created the global perception that interactive sites in Australia are illegal. This has cost the economy and will continue to cost the economy. I should point out in case people are in any doubt that the Isle of Man off the coast of England has set up a regulatory environment for interactive gambling. Three international companies have been granted licences to set up shop and trade on the Isle of Man. What does this mean? One of the companies is MGM Mirage. MGM owns the Darwin Casino. Because it could not get an interactive gaming licence in Australia, it has chosen to get an interactive gaming licence to operate in a properly regulated environment on the Isle of Man. What does the government say about this? IfI go down to my computer and key ‘MGM Mirage’ into one of the search engines, what is to stop me? Absolutely nothing. Yet we have the hypocrisy of the government saying that it is not prepared to set up properly and appropriately regulated Internet gaming sites in Australia so that we can control the industry. We can be concerned about the punters, but we now have them presumably playing on the Isle of Man site and on any number of unregulated sites around the world. We know that there are estimated to be more than 1,400 Internet gaming Thursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31785 sites in existence being operated by 250 companies around the world. For some reason or other, we are saying to Australian businesses who have been responsible that they cannot participate in this business, even though the government has within its hands the ability to set up a properly regulated environment for that to happen. In the past, it was possible to forecast that we could have developed an industry which was responsible, properly regulated, informed and accountable. It would have meant increasing employment, business opportunities and technological development and would have given us the possibility of taxation revenues and the ability to regulate in ways which we saw as appropriate. I am advised that current gradable revenues from Internet gaming are about $1.5 billion-I presume that is $US1.5 billion. It is estimated that they will reach $US10 billion by the year 2005. If properly licensed, regulated and taxed, cash based Internet gaming has the potential to become a multimillion dollar opportunity for the gaming industry world wide. That is true. You cannot deny that. What we need to do as a responsible community is say that we accept the reality that this is going on and not hide our faces to this reality. We should come up with a set of proposals that allows us to participate in that process so that we can appropriately govern and regulate what happens within Australia. Not only is it silly to deny ourselves this possibility but it smacks of identifying one group of people only who are involved in gambling and saying to them, ‘We don’t trust you to gamble.’ Yet, as the member for Hinkler said, every other form of gambling in Australia gets carte blanche. Therein lies the absolute hypocrisy. I point to two companies that operate out of Alice Springs. Lasseters Casino, which is a regulated Internet gaming site and was the first major Internet gaming site to operate in Australia, does very good business. Its clients are overseas. The other company I want to refer to is Centrebet. It is Australia’s oldest interactive gambling operator and is involved in sports wagering. It was founded in 1996 and employs 40 full-time and 40 part-time staff. It contributes over $7 million to the local economy and in 2000 was rated by the Overseas Trading Magazine as one of Australia’s top 50 important exporters. We know Centrebet’s activities are okay. You and I can ring Centrebet today. In fact, I saw in this morning’s Australian reference to Centrebet’s odds on the forthcoming election. If the parliamentary secretary opposite wants to put up a wager, he can ring Gerard Daffy at Centrebet and say, ‘I want to put a couple of dollars on the Labor Party or the Liberal Party.’ moment approximately $300,000. That is fine; that is absolutely terrific. But if you go down the road to Lasseters and say, ‘I’m going to be living at Halls Creek for the next seven months. CanI gamble off your site?’ they have to say no. What is the logic? Where is the logic? There is no logic in this legislation. I mentioned before that I thought the contribution of the member for Hinkler was bizarre. Not only was it bizarre; it was contradictory, because he was prepared to support people gambling on every other activity they possibly could in Australia but not support people being allowed to participate in interactive gambling from their homes. I know that gambling is a problem and it must be addressed. But if the government think prohibition is the way to address it then I think they will ultimately come to the same conclusion as those people who were trying to prohibit alcohol consumption in the United States in the 1920s. They will realise that they have failed and not only have they failed but they have missed an opportunity. They have missed an opportunity to properly regulate, properly govern and properly administer an industry which has the potential to earn a great deal of money for",159,Representatives Main Committee

354,Mr Snowdon,"A lot of people have; let me be clear about it. They are holding at the31786 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 Australia and provide many job and business opportunities. I am pleased to support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister on behalf of the Labor Party. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (10.42 a.m.)-It is not often that I disagree with my colleague, the member for the Northern Territory but, unlike the member for Hinkler, I am concerned about all forms of gambling in Australia and I am concerned about what has been happening with the massive expansion of gambling in this country. The member for the Northern Territory says, ‘If we’ve got all of that, why don’t we have a bit more?’ I believe that what we have got to do is put a stop to new forms of gambling arising and start to reverse the trends in relation to the most insidious forms that have appeared in this country. I am talking here about the poker machine phenomenon, which has been a total disaster. When I say it has been a total disaster I do not mean simply in terms of the way people have lost so much money on the poker machines. I mean the social consequences of those losses. went through the House this was one of the rare occasions that I actually supported a bill from the government. Mr Andren, the other Independent, and I did so on the basis that we believe that this is a whole new area of gambling that is going to have disastrous consequences if it is allowed to spread. I do not say, as some do, ‘This is the only area of gambling which we need to tackle.’ No. We also need to tackle the other areas. I will come back to that in a minute. It seems to me that in what the member for the Northern Territory put forward there were two basic arguments. One was: if you have got every other type of gambling, why don’t you have this one? The answer to that is clear. If you open up this new type of gambling, you can stay in your own home, turn on the Internet and, if you are really mad, gamble away in the same night maybe all of your money. People are already doing enough of this in the casinos and with poker machines which have appeared in so many clubs and hotels throughout this country, especially in the state of Victoria. We used to have a situation in Sydney-and in New South Wales-where poker machines were only available to nonprofit organisations. What then happened in Victoria? To their utter disgrace, the previous Labor government introduced poker machines into profitable organisations-hotels, clubs and any other organisation able to make a buck. They appeared everywhere. the fact of the matter is that what happened was a disgrace. The whole social culture of Victoria has been changed because of this phenomenon, even the pubs. Pubs used to be a place where you went and had a drink and mixed with your mates. You go to a pub now in Victoria, and what do you see? You see people not talking to each other at all. They are all in front of these damn machines and losing thousands of dollars. Even the state government recently admitted how many millions and millions were lost by Victorians. But do they do anything about it? They say, ‘We might have to introduce a few regulatory things here and there to stop the number of times you do it.’ But the point is: the phenomenon has occurred. It has happened and it has changed the culture even in hotels now. You go to a hotel and people do not mix; they do not socialise. They just play these damn machines and they lose all their money. Whether it is the wife or the husband, what happens when they do not have any money to supply the basic goods and services for the children? I know about this because in my electorate we have the Salvation Army and the care centre",161,Representatives Main Committee

It is because these people lose so much money in this gambling phenomenon. Of course, you cannot ban gambling altogether. Nobody is saying that. But the more opportunities you make available, the worse it gets. There is absolutely no doubt about that. This is what happened in Victoria with the poker machines. Now it is very difficult to reverse such a phenomenon. The hotels that got the poker machines became very rich and had plenty of customers. The occasional old traditional pub that did not get them went to the wall. We have a situation now where the hotel industry has become totally dependent on these poker machines and the whole culture has been changed. Imagine what would happen if Internet gambling were to become totally available in the way in which it has been suggested. We would have the potential to bring the problem into every home. It is an outrage to suggest that there is no social issue here. I agree with the member for the Northern Territory that there could be some money in this. Since when did the Labor Party support matters only because there is money in it? I do not know where they got this idea that we should not proceed to ban Internet gambling. Of course we should ban it. Not only that, we should work for the reversal of what has already happened. I do not often agree with the Prime Minister-everybody knows that-but I agree with him on this point: the gambling disease has become a curse in this country. It has got to the point where it is affecting the social fabric in a very serious way. It is all right for middle-class and upper-class people to have their flutters at the casino. Even if they lose $1,000 or $2,000 it does not matter so much. But the poor people without big incomes who have easy forms of gambling available to them in this way include sad cases where pensioners get their pensions and go off to the poker machines and waste all their money. If interactive gambling were to proceed, not only would we have the groups that go to clubs and hotels and gamble away all their money; we would also have young people who are accustomed to the use of the Internet suddenly discovering that this was a way forward. And what would happen? Young people would be afflicted by this disease. Not only would we have the older people, the pensioners and so on, who now go to these hotels-some of them go every day and waste all their money-but also, younger people who are used to working with the Internet would get involved. We have to understand that society needs some goals other than gambling. Sport is an important Australian phenomenon. We should encourage that. We have so many cultural activities. There are so many activities conducted by different organisations in our society-which, by the way, need support from people. Many of these are not being supported because of the time being spent by individuals on the gambling disease. I refer to activities like volunteer work, which Australians are good at. We could have more people volunteering to do good works were it not for the fact that there is so much time and effort being totally wasted because of this gambling disease. We are told that, because it is there and because it is going to become more readily available at an international level, we must have it here in Australia. If this bill represents only a start in coming to grips with the gambling disease, let it be a start. Let it be an important start. Let us draw a line; let us say that we, as parliamentarians, care about this phenomenon and that we want to stop it. I am not referring to ordinary recreational gambling; I am referring to the excesses and the situation where people are absolutely ruining their lives. The member for the Northern Territory said that there are all of these responsible organisations that control gambling; therefore they could easily control Internet gambling. How responsible are these organisations? Isn’t this the same set of organisations that is constantly promoting gambling? Isn’t this the same set of organisations that has promoted the dreadful 31788 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 growth in the number of poker machines to such an enormous degree? When poker machines came in, they said, ‘We’re going to be very responsible.’ They now actively try to do everything they can to get people to invest more and more money in these gambling activities. I do not consider them to be responsible in any social sense. Maybe they are responsible in the sense that they do not resort to criminal activities, but that is not the same as their being responsible and saying, ‘This particular individual is going beyond the bounds and is destroying himself and his family.’ They do not do that. There are no controls in that way. We then have to say that at least in a social milieu some people might see this person-it does not happen often but it does occasionally-and perhaps give him a hand or advice. If Internet gambling is available in the person’s own home, with nobody knowing about it, that person could, in the space of a day or two or a week, totally lose their assets-not only their income but their assets. The number of people who have lost everything through gambling is frightening. I bring up this point: we do not publicise the statistics, but suicide as a result of gambling is a serious problem. People do come to that desperation point. The thing about gambling is, as the great Dostoevski said in his novels, the way in which it gets to you. You think, ‘The next round, I am going to win, and then I am going to win the round after that, and the one after that.’ The parliament secretary wanted me to finish within 10 minutes, and I have gone over time. But I want to say that I oppose the introduction of interactive gambling into Australia, and I believe this bill is a good move. I think we should also work together with the states. Whoever wins the federal election should bring together the state governments and tackle directly the problem of the excessive gambling with poker machines in clubs and hotels which has got to such a point that it is undermining and destroying the social fabric of this country. stration) (10.55 a.m.)-Initially, I would like to say to the member for Calwell that I was not seeking to restrict him to 10 minutes; I was just interested to know how long he was going to speak in the Main Committee. I do understand that there is a division imminent in the main chamber and so I will endeavour to complete the summing up prior to that occurring, but I could be interrupted. I listened very carefully to the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell. It is pretty clear that he does not have a lot in common with the Australian Labor Party any more, and one can understand why, after 21 years, he has taken that important step and has become an Independent by walking away from the Australian Labor Party. I am hopeful that, in the election, the Australian people will once again walk away from the Australian Labor Party because of their flip-flopping all over the place and not having any positive policies to improve this wonderful country. I thank all the honourable members on both sides who have contributed to this debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. The government is concerned about the potential for new technologies to increase the accessibility of gambling services and therefore to exacerbate problem gambling in the Australian community. The Interactive Gambling Act represents a strong response by the government to the use of new interactive communications technologies to spread gambling into Australian homes. The ban on the advertising of interactive gambling is an important element of this tough approach. However, it has never been the intention of the act to restrict offline or land based gambling or the advertising of such services. While the government remains very concerned about the socially harmful effects of poker machines and casinos-and the member for Calwell outlined the problems of poker machines-the responsibility rests squarely with the",162,Representatives Main Committee

The new exemption power provided for in this amendment will allow the government to rectify any unintentional effect that the advertising ban may have on land based gambling services. In the Ministerial Council on Gambling, the Commonwealth government will continue to pursue measures to protect the Australian community from both online and offline gambling. The shadow minister moved a second reading amendment. The government does not accept that second reading amendment. We do not support regulation as an alternative to a ban. The regulatory approach in effect provides a stimulus to the growth of this form of gambling.

There is no reason to think that states and territories can restrict the growth of new forms of gambling any more than they have been able to do with poker machines. Australia has a quite frightening percentage of the world’s poker machines in operation. During the debate, certain matters were raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In effect, it has been asked in the debate: how will the interactive gambling legislation deter the provision of interactive gambling services to Australians from offshore locations? The member for the Northern Territory referred in particular to a casino operating with an Isle of Man licence. A number of measures have been put in place by the legislation. This is a difficult area but the extension of the offence to foreign providers, which will deter them from signing up Australian customers in much the same way as the US Wire Wager Act, is one way. A ban on the advertising of interactive gambling services in Australia is another. There are regulations in development which will deal with the unenforceability of agreements, such as money transfers relating to illegal interactive gambling. There is a system under which Internet service providers will be able to respond to complaints about foreign gambling services on the Internet by providing their customers with filtering options. There is also a designated country clause which will allow complementary legislation in other countries to be recognised under the Australian act. These measures will also deter the take-up of interactive gambling by Australians. We reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth and we ask the chamber to support the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. Amendment negatived.

361,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science31790 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is to make consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in portfolio legislation to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The code contains a standard approach to the formulation of criminal offences. When it commences on 15 December 2001, the code will alter the way in which the criminal offence provisions are interpreted, including offences contained in Family and Community Services portfolio legislation. The amendments made by this bill harmonise relevant offences with the code while also ensuring that the relevant offences continue to have the same meaning in operation as they do at present. This bill is one of a series designed to apply the code on a portfolio by portfolio basis. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. cord a few comments for the Australian Labor Party about the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, even though we have agreed to support it in the House of Representatives and the Senate. This bill amends a number of Family and Community Services portfolio statutes to ensure that they are in accord with chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. I understand that this is occurring across portfolios with the intention of ensuring that all Commonwealth criminal offences have standard formulation of the elements of intention, fault, burden of proof and penalty. The approach the government is taking to the application of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code is appropriate and has already been supported by Labor in respect of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 and other like bills in other portfolios. In respect of that bill, I note that the shadow minister for justice said that there might be difficulties with some of the drafting but that the detailed problems would only become apparent as the amendments are applied across portfolios. It is neither possible nor efficient to attempt to double-check each and every offence in each and every portfolio from the position of opposition. While the Labor Party are giving support to the government’s legislation, we will monitor the application of the amendments and we will move to address any anomalies or problems which arise. In fact, Labor has been made aware of several issues by the Welfare Rights Network, an organisation we have a great deal of respect for and one that has advised the parliament previously of potential anomalies and has got it right. The Welfare Rights Network is concerned that this bill will make a material difference to the lives of some income support recipients. I would like to put some of those concerns on the record. The major forms of amendment provided for by this bill are: the application of strict liability or absolute liability to individual offences or specified physical elements of offences; the removal of defences that appear in certain provisions, instead placing reliance on the code’s general defences; and the deletion of references to certain provisions of the Crimes Act, replacing these with references to the equivalent code provisions. The main implications for social security recipients seem to be as follows. Firstly, regarding the issue of strict liability, the code clarifies the traditional distinction between the actus reus-the physical act now referred to as the ‘physical element’-and the mens rea-what the defendant thought or intended, now referred to as the ‘fault element’. Where strict liability applies to an offence, the prosecution does not have to prove fault on behalf of the defendant. The prosecution need only prove that the physical element of the offence or actus reus did occur, and the intention behind the action is irrelevant to determining whether the offence has taken place. The bill introduces several subclauses specifying that offences be now offences of strict liability. However, there is the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 of the code. Section 9.2 provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence of this",165,Representatives Main Committee
362,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.15 A.m.),"I want to take this opportunity to put on the reThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31791 nature if, at the time of the conduct constituting the physical element, the person considered whether or not fact existed and is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts and, had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted an offence. According to subsection 13.3(2) of the code, the person wishing to deny criminal responsibility bears an evidential burden in relation to showing a mistake of fact. The second issue I wish to raise is the treatment of intention. The physical elements provided for by the code are the conduct, the circumstance in which it occurs and the result of the conduct. For every physical element there is a corresponding fault element. The code does not prevent an offence from specifying an alternative fault element, but the code indicates that a default element will apply in the absence of a specified fault element. The code establishes four default fault elements: intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence. It provides that for conduct, the default element is intention; for circumstantial result, the default fault element is recklessness. The bill substitutes clauses that had referred to a person as ‘knowingly’ or ‘recklessly’ with simply ‘recklessly’. For example, section 1061ZZBW is concerned with refusal or failure to comply with notices. Currently, the provision applies the fault elements of intention-or intentionally-and recklessness-or recklessly-in relation to the proscribed physical element of conduct, namely, the refusal or failure to comply. The explanatory memorandum states: Following application of the Code, the fault elements of ... recklessness will be restricted to physical elements of circumstance or result, and intention will be the sole fault element that can be applied to a physical element of conduct: see Division5 of Part 2.2 of the Code. ... This Item recreates the offence so that intention is the only fault element in relation to the physical element of conduct. ...The Item also reconstructs the offence so that the fault element of recklessness applies in relation to the physical element of circumstances ... -namely the requirement to comply. In the view of the Welfare Rights Network, all that this effectively achieves is the reduction of the level of intention where recklessness is all that is necessary for the finding of an offence. The third issue I wish to raise is the shift of burden of proof. The bill may also shift the burden of proof in regard to the defences ‘reasonable excuse’ and ‘to the extent that the person is capable of complying’. The bill removes the phrases ‘without reasonable excuse’ and ‘to the extent to which the person is capable of complying’ from a number of clauses. This shifts the ability to take into account such factors, and their treatment as specific defences. For example-and I have referred to this section before-section 1061ZZBW is concerned with refusal or failure to comply with notices. The bill removes the defences of ‘to the extent that the person is capable complying with the notice’ and ‘without reasonable excuse’, and they are recreated in new sections. The member for Moreton, who is speaking next, might like to refer to these sections of the bill, sections 1061ZZBW(2) and (3). I would be interested in the view of the member for Moreton on how those sections will affect welfare recipients and whether he agrees with the Welfare Rights Network that this creates a potential problem. The rationale for this amendment is to prevent any future interpretation that ‘without reasonable excuse’ is an element of the offence, which would have to be disproved in the negative by the prosecution. I know the member for Werriwa is going to talk about this clause when he addresses this bill later on in the debate. The explanatory memorandum claims: 31792 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 The amendment puts it beyond doubt that having a reasonable excuse is a defence to the offence. Pursuant to subsection 13.3(3) of the Code, a defendant who wishes to rely on such defences bears an evidential burden in relation to the defence. Effectively, then, the change formally shifts the burden of proof for such matters from the prosecution to the defence. We are going to keep a close eye on these matters, which is why the Australian Labor Party, the member for Werriwa and I have closely examined this bill and gone through it in such detail. We believe that you have to keep your eye on this shifty government, particularly when it comes to areas of welfare, because we know what its view is-if it can slip something in that will punish people, then it will be for it. A future Labor government will have, by the end of the year, a large task in making fair many aspects of social security legislation that have been skewed against the disadvantaged during the time of this government. This government is a government that believes in punishing the poor and the vulnerable in our community. WhilstI believe that, in this instance, there is no intent other than to achieve consistency across legislation, I want to say very clearly that we will look at the impact of this legislation and we will move to reform it if the concerns raised by the Welfare Rights Network have a real and negative impact on the lives of income support recipients. and wish to place on record my congratulations to the member for Grayndler for his detailed assessment of aspects of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. My only fear is that after having been on the outer of the Labor Party for so long he may be succumbing to some illness. I suspect he has been a bit cold out there all these years, but I wish him well and hope that his health returns soon. This piece of legislation before us is part of an ongoing package of measures that the government has had to introduce to try to bring some consistency when dealing with the application of the Criminal Code across all portfolios. In particular, this bill will, in fact, apply amendments across a range of acts, including A New Tax System (Bonus for Older Australians) Act, the family assistance act, Child Support Assessment Act, Child Support (Registration Collection) Act, Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act, Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act, Disability Services Act, Farm Household Support Act, First Home Owners Act, Home Deposit Assistance Act, Home Savings Grant Act 1964 and 1976, Social Security Act 1991, Social Security Administration Act 1999 and the Social Welfare Commission (Repeal) Act 1976. Whilst this particular matter may seem consequential of changes to the way the Criminal Code operates, it nevertheless does involve a great deal of considered repeal and amendment to a variety of acts. I am a bit like the member for Grayndler-I am not sure what the member for Werriwa will say-in this way because I always share some concern about the consequence of public policy, which may impact in an unintended way on some in our community. I can assure the House that my role as a member of parliament is always to look for exceptions to the rule and to deal with them. It is very important that rights are always balanced by a sense of responsibility, which the government has attempted to do in this area of community services legislation. We accept that a great range of Australians are on low incomes and are, for whatever circumstance, in a position where they are not able to fully support themselves. We want to ensure that they do rightly gain access to assistance. It is a fundamental principle of fair go. The availability of this particular assistance means that equality of opportunity, the opportunity to get to the starting line of life, is of course assured for all Australians. The so-called social safety net is something that I fundamentally believe is an important and great mark as far as a decent society is concerned.",166,Representatives Main Committee
363,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.25 A.m.),"I am pleased to contribute to this discussionThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31793 At the same time it is important that those who do claim falsely are not getting in the way of those who really need it. The responsibility factor of anybody who claims access to social benefits is to ensure that they are keeping the agencies which dole that money out fully across their circumstances. If their circumstances change, they should report those changes and ensure that they are getting the correct share, not their excess share, of assistance that they are entitled to. Why? There are a couple of reasons. One reason is that the sense of a fair go means that those who need it most should get it and those who do not need it most can wait or perhaps should not get it. Those who have the capacity to do something for themselves should go on and do it and make a contribution to the overall good of society to ensure that those who do not have the capacity to do something for themselves are well looked after by society. It is important that, when we deal with anomalies, we understand that anomalies only stand out because the great bulk of people are doing the right thing. The proper laws, the proper application of them and the proper understanding of all individual citizens involved in the various systems are enforced. I would like to place in the context of this debate the congratulations I offer to the compliance and control section of Centrelink. The government has not changed any laws as far as bringing in new draconian measures, as those opposite often try to suggest; all we have done is enforce long standing principles and arrangements that were in so many ways legislated by those opposite when they were last in power. We have simply enforced long standing accepted practices that, for lack of will from ministerial level down under the previous Labor government, allowed too many people to claim too much, too often, at the overall cost to the community and to the detriment of those who legitimately claim. Those who are on welfare services are often looked down upon by others; they have been looked down upon in the past. We often hear terms used in our community about welfare recipients. But in the last couple of years the legitimate receivers of welfare have been able to hold their heads high and say, ‘Look, compliance, control, tough measures-they are there. They are enforcing the long standing principles. I get what I get because I am entitled to it.’ A great sense of dignity is now being restored to those who need that dignity because, for whatever reason, they are not able to look after themselves. They get the dignity knowing that the system now enforces their right to gain access to benefits by ensuring that those who do not have the right are not getting the benefits. It is interesting to note that Minister Anthony, who has been doing a fine job in this portfolio area, recently announced that at this time last year there was an increase in reviews into welfare fraud resulting from public tip-offs-an increase of 32 per cent in Queensland alone, between 1 July and 31 December 2000. The most recent Centrelink half-year compliance report shows that as a direct result of tip-offs from Queenslanders, $2.8 million in debts was realised. That is a massive amount. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.32 a.m. to 11.42 a.m. to benefits should of course be assured of that entitlement. Those who do get access to benefits are now more understanding that they have a responsibility to make sure that they get what they should get and no more, because the money should be released to go to those who are more needy. In that regard, $2.8 million worth of debts was located for the second half of last year. It is a saving of almost $153,000 per week but, more particularly, it is the opportunity to redirect money to those who need it more. It is beholden upon a responsible government to ensure that assistance in the form of any social welfare is directed to the most needy first of all.",168,Representatives Main Committee
364,Mr Hardgrave,"Queenslanders have realised that those who are entitled to get access31794 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 Across the country the figure was far greater. Nationally the tip-offs increased by 58 per cent. Centrelink conducted 36,423 tip-off reviews resulting in 8,211 payment cancellations or reductions and debts of $16.1 million being raised. I know that every one of those dollars and every one of those figures and statistics underlie and point to one particular person or a family. In a lot of cases, this is a difficulty for those families involved. I know that the government has worked to try and alleviate some of those problems for some of those families. At the same time, the pressure will be maintained to continue to implement long standing rules and regulations in regard to entitlements. The message must be clearly understood-and it is being more clearly understood. The application of the Criminal Code across this particular area to bring this department and the important work they do into line with other departments is a welcome reform. I commend this bill to the House. Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 amends a number of statutes within the Family and Community Services portfolio. In fact, it amends so many laws within that portfolio area that it provides members with an opportunity to talk about welfare reform more generally. This opportunity has been taken by the two previous speakers, the member for Grayndler and the member for Moreton. I wish to add my thoughts on this important area of welfare reform. I wish to place two ideas on the agenda of the parliament. I wish to add to the debate about how we can alleviate poverty and disadvantage in our nation; and how we can produce a more equal, caring and just society. This government has claimed to have embarked on welfare reform. I believe that it has done no such thing. The government has done nothing more substantial than fiddle around with the transfer payment system. It has adjusted at the margin the way in which material resources are paid to Australians on welfare, and it has done this in response to so-called expert committees. I believe they have missed the all-important social dimension of poverty. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that, in your electorate in Tasmania and in your own personal work, this is something on which you have placed a great priority. It is a concern that I share. I believe we need to treat poverty as a social issue, not just as an economic question. That is why I am a great supporter of what I call human scale welfare. Human scale welfare, which gets the relationships right between people in their communities, is the first and essential foundation stone for alleviating poverty. In the past, as a parliament, we have treated welfare as an economic issue. We have made payments to people to improve their material standard of living, but through this process we have lost sight of the social dimension of poverty. We need to face the reality that long periods of unemployment and economic disadvantage alter people’s behaviour, especially when the problems pass from one generation to the next. I see this in my own electorate. The curse of intergenerational unemployment is very corrosive when it comes to the quality of our society, the bonds between people, the strength of our communities. In particular, young people lose sight of the role models for a successful life. They lose sight of the difference between right and wrong; they lose sight of the social norms and values of community life. At the end of this corrosive process, the social problem, the breakdown in families and communities, is actually worse than the economic problem that commenced the process. So these problems start with the economic dimension-people falling out of the work force, people falling into material poverty-but then, after long periods of that experience, the social dimension, the social problems, are so vast that they are indeed greater than the economic issues themselves.",169,Representatives Main Committee
365,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (11.43 A.m.),"The Family and Community Services LegislationThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31795 This is the curse of social poverty. I believe that social poverty is as big an issue in our nation as economic poverty. Social poverty is reflected in record rates of loneliness and isolation, a record number of Australians living by themselves, living without family and community support. It is also reflected in the escalation of street crime, youth gangs and enormous public concern about the fabric of our society. There are some depressing stories that we need to face up to. I have always believed that in welfare reform you need to take an evidence based approach. Understand the evidence: don’t worry so much about dogma, ideology and textbook theories; look at the evidence and work out practical solutions to these social and economic problems. Intergenerational poverty is corrosive of self-esteem and ambition. Probably my saddest experience as a member of parliament was to talk to a school principal in a public housing estate in my electorate about the school’s careers day. The principal told me stories of how some of the young people, when they are asked what they are going to do after they leave school, say, ‘We’ll do what our dads and grand-dads have done before us-we’ll go on the dole.’ This is the way in which long-term poverty erodes social ambition, self-esteem and confidence. It erodes the sorts of values and norms that we in this place would take for granted. I had another reminder of the extent of this problem. Just recently, I have been talking to Father Chris Riley’s Youth Off the Streets program. On MondayI had the opportunity to look at their wonderful retreat school at Canyonleigh in the Southern Highlands. They undertake great work there for troubled adolescents-trying to bring young people back into the mainstream of society and to put their personal and drug related problems behind them. Recently, Youth Off the Streets had a segment on the A Current Affair program on TV. It was a wonderful example of how they help troubled adolescents. I am told that in the week that followed that TV program they had 300 calls from parents around Australia, saying, ‘Can you take my child off my hands? Can you do the same sort of thing for my child?’ I think that is a terrible situation in our society-that parents are willing to say, ‘Take my child off me.’ Their circumstances are so desperate, the problems are so severe, that they are looking, out of desperation, for any sort of help to overcome the difficulties within their own homes. In the public housing estates in my electorate-areas with 40 per cent unemployment and welfare dependency rates of 80 per cent-people do not necessarily say they want more deregulation and market forces; they do not necessarily say they want more government spending or a bigger public sector. Their first priority is the social dimension. The social problems have become so important that people are saying, ‘Normalise our neighbourhood, rebuild our communities.’ The first priority is not necessarily what we hear in this parliament. We have a debate with one side talking about economic deregulation and the other side talking about the size of government. The public wants to talk about the size of society, the bonds between people and the good relationships of a strong and growing community. People in public housing estates in my electorate talk about the need to normalise the neighbourhood, to live in a normal community where people work together instead of against each other. We need to get the relationships right between people, to deliver welfare services on a human scale. Getting the human and social dimension right is the first step towards the alleviation of poverty. The great contradiction is that we have built the post-war welfare state around large, impersonal bureaucracies. These government bureaucracies are good at some things-they are good at dispensing entitlements to people-but they are not so good at other things. Large, impersonal bureaucracies do not have any capacity for building relationships of trust and confi31796 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 dence between people. We have built a public sector that is not necessarily good at the human scale of welfare reform. I think it is simply a matter of common sense. Despite all the programs and all the money that is spent by this parliament in welfare services, the reality is that people are not likely to make best use of those services and entitlements without social capital, without the selfesteem and trust of a normal neighbourhood. Unless we are building stronger communities, it is very unlikely that people will make good use of the services that are provided by government. In fact, in my electorate I cannot find any evidence of government bureaucracies solving poverty. I cannot find evidence of government bureaucracies addressing the social dimension of disadvantage. I cannot see ways in which the public sector is actually breaking the poverty cycle. Of course we need material support. People need income support from government to put food on the table and to keep a roof over their heads but, as a parliament, we need to recognise that that is not a sufficient form of support for breaking poverty. We need to recognise the need to address the social dimension of poverty. I would like to suggest three ways in which this can be done. The first is to back the work of social entrepreneurs. These are special people who combine the best of social and business practice. They are very good at local community work, building stronger networks of community support and social cooperation, but they are also good at taking risks. They are not willing to sit back and think that government will do it all; they are not willing to sit back and underestimate the need for entrepreneurial flair and spirit; they are not willing to sit back and just complain or demand more government resources. They actually want to use their own initiative, take a risk and inject some entrepreneurial spirit and flair into these disadvantaged communities. That is why we call them ‘social entrepreneurs’: they are good at social work, but they are also entrepreneurial in their outlook. They support social justice, but they think like business people. It is an example of boundary crossing by people who combine the best of the social and business sectors. One of them is Brian Murnane, a wonderful man in my electorate, who has undertaken superb work in the public housing estate of Claymore. When I first became the member for Werriwa in 1994, I wondered how we could ever get progress in Claymore. It was a tough suburb. It was a suburb that was regarded as one of the worse in New South Wales. There was one street, Proctor Way, that had 60 police incidents a month: that is two a day. We are talking about a really tough suburb with severe social problems. In 1995, there were some terrible fires in two of the town houses. Six people passed away in those fires. The New South Wales Department of Housing needed to face up to this tragic reality. They decided to move out of Claymore, and they looked to expressions of interest from someone who wanted to come in and provide the housing management and community support. The person who put his hand up was Brian Murnane from the Argyle Community Housing program, a division of the St Vincent de Paul Society. Brian Murnane took a very important first step: he moved into Proctor Way, Claymore. He moved his office into a town house next to where the two burnt-down town houses had been. So he was not going to be part of a remote, impersonal bureaucracy like the New South Wales department, locked away in some head office tens of kilometres away. He actually became a local; he became part of the community. I think this is a great lesson. We hear so much about government funded community work but the workers do not come from the community. It is a real paradox-almost an absurditythat we talk about community workers but they do not actually come from the community itself. Brian Murnane overcame that problem by becoming a local. He then sent a notice Thursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31797 around to invite people to come to a morning tea and talk about ways in which Claymore could be improved-dealing with the crime problem and dealing with the lack of community spirit and cooperation. Nobody turned up. He put out the notice for the morning tea and nobody turned up. But, as a social entrepreneur, he was not going to be deterred. He decided to rent a barbecue and start cooking sausages and onions in the middle of the street-almost taunting people to come out of their homes and talk to him about the things that could be done. This is social capital formed from the smell of sausages and onions in Proctor Way, Claymore. People who were not used to talking to each other and helping each other were peering out through their curtains. Kids were saying to their parents, ‘Mum, there’s a madman in the street cooking sausages and onions,’ but people did come out of their homes for the first time to talk to each other. They talked to Brian Murnane. He said to them, ‘What can we do here? What is your first priority for improving this area?’ The people said, ‘We want to clean up this street and get rid of all the garbage and rubbish.’ They organised a clean-up day and got a vast amount of rubbish out of Proctor Way. This was such a significant act: it was the first time that people worked together for a common community purpose. From this steady commencement of the habit of helping each other, things began to grow. They formed a Neighbourhood Watch scheme. They formed a wonderful community garden where they grew fresh vegetables-good for the budget and good for the family diet. They established a low interest loan scheme, whereby people could purchase household items. It was a real community financing scheme. They established employment and training schemes. Brian Murnane now wants to take over the local half-derelict shopping centre as an opportunity for business cooperatives, for local training programs and for connecting local people to the real economy. He is wanting social venture capital to achieve this purpose. Social entrepreneurship in Claymore has been a slow, methodical process. I have whizzed through the things that have happened but, over five or six years, this has been long, slow, methodical work-rebuilding the connections between people and overcoming the social dimension of poverty. Now the neighbourhood has been normalised. Claymore is a normal neighbourhood where people work together instead of against each other. Through this process of social and community building it is possible to set the foundations for economic success. People now have the habits of cooperation; they now have the confidence and selfesteem by which they can reconnect and re-enter the real economy. This is the process that we need to foster. As a parliament, we need to make social venture capital available to social entrepreneurs. One of the best developments in our country is the emergence of a Social Entrepreneurs Network. It is something that has been formed to bring social entrepreneurs together so that they can share experience and share their success across the nation. I am very supportive of that network. I am very supportive of new ways in which the parliament can fund its work. We need social venture capital to support these special people who get results in communities. We also need to refashion the role of government. Government needs to act as a junior partner to people like Brian Murnane-not the senior dominating partner, with bureaucrats walking into suburbs like Claymore, as they did for many years, thinking that they know best. Government needs to act as a junior partner to social entrepreneurs. We also need to establish a national mentoring program. The biggest issue in my electorate is the trouble with boys-boys dropping out of school, boys getting on the streets, boys forming into gangs and boys engaging in negative behaviour in our community. Unfortunately, it is possible for boys to grow up in my electorate and go through life without male role models. We see this in the growth of single parent families; we see it in the absence of 31798 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 male teachers in our primary schools; and we see it in the loss of the apprenticeship scheme. Apprenticeships were not only about work force entry; they were actually about social mentoring, where boys could find out and learn what it meant to grow up and be a man in the work force. The loss of the apprenticeship scheme has added to this problem. We need to mobilise mentors from the business, sport and community sectors. Any successful Australian has a responsibility to put back in to our community. Just do not pull your success out of our society; put something back in by acting as a mentor to a boy who does not necessarily have the right guidance and role models in life. There is a great opportunity here to reconnect younger Australians with older Australians. We know that we are an ageing society. We need to mobilise the vast and growing army of retired Australians to act as mentors for adolescents who lack role models and moral guidance. We need a role for government to act as the bridge from older to younger Australians. We need a role for government to call on successful business, sporting and community people to act as mentors in our society. The third step is service devolution. We cannot build a stronger community unless people have things to do in common. We often hear community demands for better services. My attitude is that people should not be campaigning for better services; they should be running them. People should not be calling on government for better services; they should be stepping up and running these services at a community level. When I talk about the public sector, I prefer to talk about community schools, health mutuals, social cooperatives and community banks. There is a public sector beyond the role of government that lies in the cooperation of people in local communities. It is not possible to create social capital unless people have things to do in common. This is an argument over big or small-scale government. It is not the polarised debate that we often hear in this parliament, where one side supports small-scale government and the other side supports big government. I am talking about human scale welfare and human scale government that recognises our first challenge is the social dimension of poverty. In effect, we need to put the ‘social’ back into ‘social justice’. We need to get the relationships right between people to tackle the social dimensions of disadvantage. With the fall of the Berlin Wall the world witnessed the end of state socialism. I prefer to talk about civic socialism: building a better society at a local level through the sorts of reforms that I have mentioned in this speech. I had another idea I wanted to talk about but I think time will get away from me. It is asset based welfare reform to provide incentives for disadvantaged people to save and accumulate assets. It is one of the great paradoxes in the welfare debate. The reality is that poor people cannot leave poverty behind on a permanent basis unless they can save and accumulate assets, but all we ever get from the welfare system is income support for disadvantaged people. We never get access to asset accumulation. There was an example recently with the news that millionaires are cashing in on the first home ownership scheme. I think it is immoral for people buying $2 million homes to be receiving a government grant. It is an example of how we have made asset support and accumulation available to the middle class but we have not provided that same opportunity to the underclass, the low income people. There are many pilot schemes and great demonstration projects in the United States which demonstrate that poor people can save and accumulate assets if they receive the right incentives and support from government. It is a great shame that in this nation we have not embarked on asset based welfare. As I mentioned at the beginning, all this government have done is fiddle at the margins of the transfer payment system. They have fiddled at the margins of material support for people, without doing two critical things. They have not addressed the social dimension of poverty Thursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31799 and they have not made asset based programs available to the poorest Australians. The government have much to learn in the area of welfare reform. Hopefully we will see great improvements with a change of government at the next election. and Resources) (12.03 p.m.)-in reply-In speaking to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 I would like to thank all the honourable members who have taken their time to contribute to this debate. I would like to just raise some of the issues that were commented on by the member for Grayndler with regards to amendments made by the bill. One of the issues concerned the treatment of intention. Section 1061ZZBW was mentioned as an example. However, the comment did not reflect the full understanding of what the amendment seeks to achieve. The existing provision requires that the prosecution should show either knowledge or recklessness in relation to failing to comply with the notice. After the amendments, recklessness will not be sufficient grounds for prosecution under this section. After the amendment’s intention there will be the requisite fault element in relation to the making of the statement. If anything this represents a tightening of the requirements for a successful prosecution. The second issue raised by the honourable member related to the removal of certain defences from section 1061ZZBW. However, the amendments simply provide for the same defences to be inserted as discrete paragraphs of the offence provision. The defences are not removed. It has always been the case that a person seeking to rely on a defence has the onus of establishing that defence. These amendments do not alter that approach. The member for Moreton highlighted the positive actions by this government to return the integrity to our social welfare system. He recognised that there was now a greater level of respect afforded to those that are actually in genuine need of welfare support. The member for Werriwa raised some very interesting views and serious concerns on the issue of social poverty and how it differs very much from economic poverty. He recognised the wonderful contribution and value to the community of people that he called the ‘social entrepreneurs’. He gave an excellent example from Claymore, a suburb in his electorate. He also raised another issue that I am particularly interested in: the need for a youth mentoring scheme. He quite rightly highlighted the desperate need within the community for young boys to have male role models. Because of the way in which our society is going, there is a need for adult males within the community to offer a contribution. I will be seeking to talk to the honourable member later on. We actually have a pilot program specifically on this-it is happening now-and I am fortunate to have had it in my electorate. It has been operating for over a year very successfully, and I will be giving him details so that he can further his interest in this matter. Hopefully it is something that we can eventually get up as a national scheme. An important component of the bill is to provide clarity about the application of strict liability to some offence creating provisions. Under the Criminal Code, strict liability must be identified for an offence; otherwise the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to each element of the offence. The bill also ensures that the strict liability nature of some provisions is not lost in the transition to application of the Criminal Code’s general purposes. If relevant offences are not adjusted in this manner, many may become more difficult for the prosecution to prove, thereby reducing the protection which is intended by the parliament to be provided. This bill will similarly improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences by clarifying physical elements of defences and amending inappropriate fault elements. This measure has the potential to save many hours of court time otherwise spent in complicated and sometimes",170,Representatives Main Committee

The Criminal Code is a significant step in the reform of our system of justice. It is important that it be implemented in a way that is considered and that pays careful regard to the way the Commonwealth offence provisions are to work in practice. This bill is an important step in that progress. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001 Consideration resumed from 18 September. Second Reading and Resources) (12.09 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is to amend certain offence provisions in legislation within the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code) to all criminal offences in Commonwealth laws. The amendments are intended to ensure that when chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the code) is applied from 15 December 2001 to all Commonwealth criminal offences, those provisions will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously. If legislation containing offence provisions were not amended to have regard to the code, the code, upon coming into operation, may alter the interpretation of existing offence provisions. The Criminal Code is set out in schedule 2 to the Criminal Code Act 1995. It contains the general principles of criminal responsibility that will apply to all Commonwealth criminal offences when the Criminal Code Act comes into force, on and after 15 December 2001. Chapter2 of the Criminal Code codifies the general principles of criminal law and adopts the common law approach of subjective fault based principles. It adopts the traditional distinction of dividing offences into their physical elements (the actus reus) and fault elements (mens rea). The general rule is that for each physical element of an offence it is necessary to prove that the defendant had the relevant fault element. The prosecution must prove every physical and fault element of an offence. The physical elements are ‘conduct’, ‘result of conduct’ and ‘circumstances of conduct’ and the fault elements specified in the Criminal Code are ‘intention’, ‘knowledge’, ‘recklessness’ and ‘negligence’. The ‘default fault elements’, which the Criminal Code provides, will apply where a fault element is not specified and where the offence (or an element of the offence) is not specified to be a strict or absolute liability offence. The default fault elements set out in the Criminal Code are ‘intention for a physical element of conduct’ and ‘recklessness for a physical element of circumstances or result’. Fault elements will not be applied where an offence is specified to be one of strict liability. This bill specifies where an offence is one of strict liability. This is necessary to ensure that offences currently interpreted as strict liability continue to be interpreted as such after the Criminal Code is applied. In addition the bill amends certain offence provisions to remove the defence and restate it is a separate subsection. This is to ensure that the defences are not interpreted as an element of the offence.",175,Representatives Main Committee
367,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, ScienceThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31801 The amendments fall into the following broad categories: specifying that an offence is one of strict liability (with an express statement on the face of the offence that is an offence of strict liability, referring to section 6.1 of the Criminal Code); restructuring offence provisions which include an inappropriate fault element for conduct; restructuring offence provisions which include an inappropriate fault element for circumstance; restructuring offence provisions where part of the conduct element of the offence includes breach of a condition; restructuring offence provisions to proscribe the actions of a person whose conduct causes damage, injury, destruction or obliteration of prescribed property; restructuring criminal offence provisions containing a defence, by putting the defence provisions in separate subsections, in order to avoid a defence being mistakenly interpreted to be part of the elements of the offence; specifying whether a defence places a legal or evidential burden on a defendant; restructuring an offence to resolve an internal conflict between the offence and the complicity provision of the Criminal Code; restructuring ancillary offence provisions so as to apply the relevant ancillary provisions of the Criminal Code; extension of meaning of ‘engaging in conduct’ to include omissions; restructuring offence provisions so as not to require knowledge of law; specifying in provisions which establish criminal responsibility for corporations whether or not part 2.5 of the Criminal Code (dealing with corporate criminal responsibility) is applicable. This bill ensures that the current criminal offences will operate in the same manner as they currently operate, following the application of the Criminal Code. I present the explanatory memorandum. support for the general thrust of the legislation which the parliamentary secretary has so comprehensively explained this morning. It is of course consistent with the wide range of acts which the House has been considering in recent weeks covering the implementation of the Criminal Code from 1995 and the way in which that will apply to existing offences from December this year. Of course, it is, as the parliamentary secretary has said, necessary to bring up to date the various existing pieces of legislation within the Industry, Science and Resources portfolios to ensure that the appropriate legal standards are brought to bear from 15 December, when the changes take principal effect. As with other similar items of legislation associated with these measures, the opposition have indicated support for this bill. We do so again this morning. In light of the fact that the parliamentary secretary has so adequately and comprehensively explained these diverse legal provisions, it would be unnecessary and inappropriate for me to take the time of the committee by further elaborating on and duplicating that explanation.

I certainly greatly appreciate his contribution and bipartisan support. The Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 advances the government’s program to harmonise offence creating and relating provisions in Commonwealth legislation with the Criminal Code. This bill is similar to other Criminal Code harmonisation bills introduced by other ministers. The Criminal Code will codify the most serious offences against Commonwealth law and establish a cohesive set of general principles of conduct responsibility. The harmonisation with the Criminal Code by creating a related offence in Industry, Science and Resources portfolio legislation, while technical in nature, is an important step in the government’s program of legislative reform, which will achieve greater consistency in the application of Commonwealth criminal law.

Radio is a very important information medium, particularly in regional and remote Australia. It is cheaper to produce and broadcast radio programs than television programs. A radio is also far cheaper and more portable than a TV set. There are far more radio licences than TV stations, and they are located in local communities, so they are in the best position to provide news and information about local communities to local communities. Local radio is, and should be, the ‘local voice’, as it is the title of this report. We have seen in the last few years that this is changing, however, and not necessarily for the better. New technology has been a double-edged sword for regional Australia. There has been an increased use of networked, prerecorded, automated and syndicated programming. In some instances, this has led to increased hours of operation by local stations, but it has also led to the loss of that local voice. As I said, it is a double-edged sword.",177,Representatives Main Committee

373,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.31 P.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to be able to makeThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31803 This has been a very extensive inquiry. We received some 290 submissions, heard from 169 witnesses and held 18 public hearings throughout regional Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the committee who, as always, have done a marvellous job in keeping the inquiry on track. I would also like to thank the chairman and the deputy chairman of the committee. They provided a really good unity ticket, which I think was of great benefit to the committee. The report makes some 20 recommendations across a broad spectrum of issues, but I would like to concentrate my remarks on just a few of them. The first I would like to comment on is recommendation No. 7, which states: The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts should prepare amendments to the Broadcasting Service Act 1992 to require all non-metropolitan commercial, community and narrowcast radio services to identify the originating source of programming when giving their call signs. This recommendation is born out of these changes that I speak of, namely, increased networking and syndication of programs. People have a right to know that the program they are listening to is not local but a network program from a major centre or another station. One witness told the committee about how a program got the weather completely wrong. The weather was fine where the announcer was broadcasting from, but it was raining in the area where this witness was listening. Whilst we cannot stop networking programs-nor would we wish to-we do believe that they should be labelled correctly. Recommendation 14 deals with emergency service announcements. This is a vital recommendation dealing with fundamental safety issues. If ever there was an absolute necessity for local radio to be precise, it is during storms, bushfires and floods or any other emergency situation. If a station is carrying a networking program from somewhere hundreds of miles away, local state emergency service personnel must have the ability to cut across the program to put out their alert and warn locals. Without this ability the safety of hundreds of lives could be compromised. Emergency service personnel need to know who to contact, and the staff of local broadcasting stations need to know which contacts are state emergency services. I am sure we would all agree that this is a necessary recommendation that the government should act upon as quickly as possible. I would like to briefly comment about recommendation 6, which concerns training of community broadcasters. The recommendation calls for government expenditure in a dollar for dollar scenario to provide accredited training for community broadcasters. This is an important recommendation. There is a cap of $5,000 per station. That would be more than adequate to provide the type of training envisaged by the committee. It is important that it is accredited training. Long gone are the days that the words ‘I have been doing it for years’ would suffice when it comes to trainers. Courses need to be accredited and run professionally. The qualifications gained from attending the courses must be transportable. Providing accredited training to regional and rural radio broadcasters will allow them to gain employment elsewhere in the industry should they so desire. Government initiatives are important in order to kick-start and sustain such a program. The focus of this report is on local communities. Each community has a different character and radio is a great way to reflect and protect that character. While economics has determined an increase in the number of networking programs on regional radio, we must not allow this to dominate the local voice. More than ever in this shrinking world, where we can tap into so much information from around the globe, the local voice is very important. I will just comment on one of the very important issues that the committee addressed, the question of localism. In the report, reference is made in 3.1 to the fact that it became apparent early in the inquiry that one of the issues of most concern was the impact of changes in the 31804 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 broadcasting environment on the nature of local radio. Most of the discussion concerning this centred on the degree to which radio services in regional areas are providing a genuine local radio service. A challenge for the committee has been to define what it is that makes regional radio service local. I take issue with some of the submissions to the inquiry, particularly from the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters and also from the DMG group relating to their different definition of localism. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters said, in part: Localism ... should not be measured according to how much content is produced by a local announcer or how much is produced in a local radio station. The DMG group also said: Localism does not mean the live broadcasting of programs around the clock from a local studio. Localism is not the same as physical presence. I disagree with those two statements. I do really believe that is what localism is about. It is about a local broadcaster actually broadcasting from a local studio. If you have an announcer in a local studio you can be assured that you are getting the correct weather broadcast. In the event of an emergency broadcast, you have an announcer who is familiar with the local landscape. I would like to conclude by saying that local communities should not be forced to lose their voice because of local economic factors. The local voice is important, and radio is the best means of ensuring that it is heard. Local businesses should have the opportunity to advertise on local radio. Many small rural businesses could not afford to advertise on a network syndicated program, nor would their businesses benefit all that much by doing so. Local radio with local announcers helps to build local communities, and it should be supported by the government. A way to help this happen is to implement the recommendations of this report. I urge the minister to examine the recommendations contained in this report and to bear in mind the extremely exhaustive processes that the committee went through to arrive at its conclusions and recommendations. I commend the report to the committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Motion (by Mr Neville) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Isaacs Electorate Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (12.41 p.m.)-I guess we are all expecting that this will be the last day of parliament, and I think this is a good opportunity for me to talk about and reflect on the things that I have learnt in my first 12 months as member for Isaacs. In doing so, I think that what is happening in Isaacs is actually typical of what is happening around Australia, that this government has let down the people of Isaacs very badly. First of all, it introduced the GST-the never ever GST, the GST that would leave no-one worse off, the GST that would cut red tape for small businesses. Having done that, it then ignored our health needs. It ignored our right to a decent education; it ignored our right to decent care for our elderly people. As I move around Isaacs, I hear over and over again about how the GST is hurting people. People tell me that their household expenses have gone up way beyond any compensation that they received 12 months ago. Pensioners tell me how they feel insulted by the non-existent $1,000 that they were supposed to get. That was last year; this year some of them have received $300, but it is only an insult. Thursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31805 Families tell me they are facing increased bills and they are not amused that they fork out every single day for this new GST. In Isaacs, some businesses have closed up shop because of the GST. Others are worried that they will soon have to close because of the financial effects of GST and the load of paperwork it has brought with it. The small businesses in Isaacs are not alone. Australia now has a massive number of small businesses going bankrupt, far more than before the GST was introduced. Forecasts suggest that this trend will continue. It is no consolation to these small operators that the big businesses are also experiencing these problems. People in Isaacs are also worried about getting good care if they need to go into hospital or if they need to find aged care accommodation for their parents. There is a big shortage of aged care beds in Isaacs, and it is not getting any better. This shortage impacts on people in acute hospitals. Aged people in need of aged care often end up in an acute hospital while they wait for a bed. That forces queues for elective surgery. But it gets worse: a number of people who work in aged care facilities have contacted me over the last 12 months to say how difficult it is for them to work in an industry that forces them to deliver unprofessional care and in which they are forced to watch residents suffering as a result. This problem stems from underfunding. The lack of funding puts pressure on nursing homes to cut costs, which means cutting the wages bill. The lack of staff means that the staff who are left are forced to rush from resident to resident, delivering the basics but not able to stop and deliver the human touch. If the evidence I hear is not enough, it was backed up this week by a leaked report from the Department of Health and Aged Care that showed that an additional $300 million a year is needed to ensure proper care for our frail elderly. The other thing I keep hearing about is education. One of two things happens at this point: parents and teachers at government schools talk about lack of funds for their students and children; those associated with category 1 schools start the conversation a different way but it becomes very interesting. People with children in one of the category 1 schools in Isaacs talked to me about why they chose an independent school for their child. They said that when they went shopping for a good school for their child they came to the conclusion that the independent school had better physical facilities and a wider range of experiences to offer than did their local government school. These parents, understandably, chose the school that would offer their child the best they could afford. That is interesting-if some children are able to go to a school with better facilities why can’t all children? Why shouldn’t every child have access to excellent education facilities and experiences, regardless of their parents’ financial circumstances? It is very clear to me that, as a community, we cannot increase taxpayers’ support for the schools which are already relatively better off before we ensure that all students have access to decent and excellent education facilities. It is clear to me that the people in Isaacs are concerned about the basics of life: a good education for their children, a reliable health system and financial security, which means jobs and an equitable tax system. Goods and Services Tax: Vietnam Veterans’ Nambus the member opposite. Unfortunately, it is typical of the Labor Party’s lack of understanding of the new tax system and the effects of the GST. The member for Isaacs raised concerns about the GST and made no mention of scrapping Labor’s wholesale sales tax; no mention of the large income tax cuts that have been a great benefit to families, certainly in my electorate; and no mention of the lowest interest rates for 30 years, which have given many young people and many families in my electorate the chance to buy their first home-a dream that was taken away from them by the 13 years of the Labor government with 17 per cent interest rates.",178,Representatives Main Committee
374,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (12.46 P.m.),"It is interesting to hear some of the comments from31806 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 A good example of the lack of understanding that the Labor opposition has of the GST is the stunt that the Labor candidate in my electorate tried to pull recently. She basically conned a couple of members of the Vietnam veterans’ Nambus committee into having the bus parked outside her campaign office to collect signatures against the GST and the effect that it has on charities. This caused a great uproar from the members of the Vietnam Veterans Gosford City Sub-branch, which is a non-political organisation that works very hard to secure benefits for veterans. The Nambus is a great facility-it is a mobile museum which the veterans take all around New South Wales to help educate and inform children about the Vietnam War. The Nambus committee contacted my office on 13 August and sought some advice about some GST concerns. I referred them to Christine Drakeford, the federal government’s small business assistance officer, who spoke to them and explained that as they were a registered charity they could choose whether they wanted to pay the GST or not; they simply had to tick the box. What the committee had not realised was that they could reclaim all their GST payments on repairs, fuel and other expenses. Because they were a low income earning charity but had high expenses they were better off staying in the GST system because they would get it all back. Under the Labor Party’s old wholesale sales tax system they could not get anything back. I also know that they got back the full amount of the diesel fuel rebate on diesel to run the bus. That amounted to several hundred dollars that they were not aware they could claim. They were not aware because of the scare campaign that the Labor opposition continually runs about the GST and the complexities of it. It is great that the federal government has spent money to employ people such as Christine Drakeford as the small business assistance officer, as she has been able to give people the facts about the GST and the new tax system. That is just an example of how the Labor Party continues to mislead the community. This will be shown up in the forthcoming election. What people want in Australia is a strong leader. They certainly have that under our Prime Minister, John Howard. Whether you agree with some of his decisions or whether you do not, he is a decent man and a strong leader, and he makes decisions which are right for the future of this country. I am very proud to be part of a government that has been led by John Howard since 1996. He is prepared to make the tough decisions-going back to the gun legislation that made this country safer and the tough industrial relations reforms that we were told could not happen. The waterfront reforms have resulted in the waterfront being competitive and up to world standards. After the unions and others said that it could not be done, they are now up to over 25 crane lifts per hour, on average, over all our ports. This is very important for our exporters, which are doing wonderfully well at the moment. With respect to the tax reforms that we as a government were prepared to make, that has not been an easy thing to do, but it has taken many wholesale sales taxes off exports and it has stimulated business. I congratulate the business community because this process has been tough. This has been a huge reform. The small and large business communities have got behind us. They have worked hard to make sure that this has been implemented and to make sure that it has been good for small business and for the country. These are just some examplesimplemented Work for the Dole. We have doubled the number of apprenticeships for young people since we came into office in 1996. We have fought against Labor’s policy to scrap youth wages, which would have destroyed employment opportunities for young people in this country. I look forward very much to facing the Australian community very shortly at the next federal election. I am confident that they will support our Prime Minister.

376,Mr Lloyd,"of the wonderful decisions that the Howard government has made. We haveThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31807 Holt Electorate: Muslim Community and facilitated on 21 September. It is an event that, I believe, brought great credit to the community of Holt-a community that I very proudly represent. It was a gathering of Muslim community leaders, members of the interfaith network, the City of Greater Dandenong and other supportive residents. They came together at the request of a number of people to discuss issues of concern to them. Initially, they wanted to allay some misapprehensions within the community that the Muslim community endorsed the barbaric act that was perpetrated on the World Trade Centre on 11 September, because some within the community were, in fact, putting that out. They wanted not only to condemn that act but also to seek tolerance by their fellow Australians. Notwithstanding the fact that they as a community were all shocked by what transpired, they were the unwilling scapegoats of people who were trying to make sense of an event by making an unfair association. At that event, the President of the Islamic Society of Melbourne, Mr Hesham Mobarek, read a statement to the gathering of Muslim community leaders. He has asked me, as their local federal representative, to read it to the House, which I will now do. The statement is dated 21 September. It reads: We as Muslim community leaders coming from many nations have gathered here today to unequivocally and collectively condemn the abhorrent terrorist attacks committed on the United States of America on 11 September 2001. We share with our fellow Australians’ a deep sense of grief and anger at these senseless attack on human life. We extend our condolences to the friends and families of the victims of this mindless aggression. These attacks were evil acts committed against not only innocent US. citizens but on all of humanity. Attacks of this nature claiming the lives of thousands of innocent civilians have no moral, legal or religious justification whatsoever. For this reason, we are deeply concerned about those that seek to portray these attacks in terms of a “war of religion” or a “clash of civilisations”. Terrorism has no religion. Islam is a religion of peace, harmony, forgiveness and tolerance; and in Islam the sanctity of human life is paramount. These terrorist attacks are a fundamental contradiction to the principles of Islam. Suicide and the killing of innocent human beings are anathema to Islam. The Quran stipulates that, in the eyes of Allah, the killing of one innocent life is like the killing of all humanity. We ask that our fellow Australians not judge Islam and Australian Muslims on stereotypes predicated on misconceptions, and the evil actions of a lunatic fringe who claim to act in the name of Islam. It must be stated from the outset that Islam deplores all acts of terrorism regardless of the perpetrator. Justice is a fundamental principle of Islam and hence we pray that the guilty are found and brought to justice, irrespective of who they are. We implore our political leaders to take a responsible stand with the international community against terrorism. We need to ensure that in taking this stand more innocent lives are not taken in the process. This requires wisdom and true justice be served maintaining that we cannot fight one crime with another crime. We are committed to, and proud of, Australia, its democratic institutions, its religious, ethnic and cultural diversity, and its egalitarian philosophy. We extend a hand of friendship to our fellow Australians, and ask that they embrace the Australian Muslim community as compatriots and friends working towards making this great nation even greater. I think that statement brings great credit on the leaders of the Islamic community in my area and great credit to those that participated in drafting this statement. I would like to briefly acknowledge the organisations that were actually present at this event. They were the Australian Albanian Association, the Islamic Society of Noble Park, the Afghan Australian Welfare Association, Afghans Against War Criminals, the Fijian Indian Association, the Oromo Community, the Eastern Turkistan Association, the Keysborough Turkish Islamic and Cultural",182,Representatives Main Committee
377,Mr Byrne (Holt) (12.51 P.m.),"I would like to speak about an event that was organised31808 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 Centre, the Muslim Women’s Association of Australia, Minaret College, the Pakistan Muslim Association, the Islamic Study Group, Isik College, the Islamic Society of Melbourne (Eastern Region), the Emir Sultan Mosque and the Afghan Mosque of Doveton. As I said in my statements to the collective gathering, these people who were united in sharing our grief, our incomprehension about how such a barbaric evil was committed, should not as a consequence of misguided perceptions within the community be made to be the scapegoat. An evil has been committed upon the people of the United States. Let not those who are seeking to define and explain that action perpetrate an evil amongst those in the community who are blameless and innocent, in an act which I believe would be un-Australian. Herbert Electorate the people of Townsville and Thuringowa in the parliament as their federal member for Herbert. I have worked very hard over the past three years and achieved a lot using the resources of my office and the resources of the government. From time to time others will say, ‘He has not done anything.’ Just for the purposes of the public record I thought I might put on the record the sorts of things that have been done over the last three years. It has been just truly amazing. In defence, my electorate has had Australia’s first combat training centre at Lavarack Barracks, about $250 million worth; $37 million for defence housing; the Mount Stuart training area road; the Mount Stuart training area grenade range; $70 million in RAAF stage 1 development; $72 million in RAAF stage 2 development; $139 million in Lavarack Barracks stage 2 redevelopment and $170 million in stage 3; and a whole lot of support for the Defence Community Organisation-altogether significantly more than half a billion dollars in Defence in Herbert. In education, Annandale State School, Annandale Christian School, Belgian Gardens State School, Holy Spirit School, Marian School, Currajong State School, Garbutt State School, Weir State School, Willows State School, Saint Joseph’s College, Southern Cross College, Saint Michael’s on Palm Island and Good Shepherd at Rasmussen have all received significant money from the Commonwealth. In higher education we have had the James Cook Medical School, a landmark in what it has done for JCU; JCU’s bandwidth problems fixed, at the same time as fixing every other regional university; 980 new Backing Australia’s Ability places at JCU; and the list goes on. In employment we have had $600,000 for Gough Industries; the Yabulu Extension Project, protecting 600 jobs and more; 219 new jobs for Telstra; 110 new jobs for Centrelink in the city; and money for employment services Advance Employment, NQ Biotech Cluster, Endeavour, NQ Competitive Employment Service and Impact Employment. In infrastructure we have had the Victoria Bridge redevelopment, CBD revitalisation, the Pandora Museum, the ATSI community cultural centre, the Saunders Creek flood bypass project, the Federation Bridge at Kirwan, the Mount View Park detention basin, fixing the TV black spots at the Upper Ross, the Louisa Creek hydraulic upgrade and the Strand redevelopment, and $1 million for the maritime museum-and so it goes on. For families we have had a family assistance office for the first time at Aitkenvale; a youth and student centre for Centrelink for the first time at Aitkenvale; a new Centrelink office for the first time ever in the Willows; money for Lifeline and for many of the childcare centres; a federal magistrates service in Townsville, one of only three in regional Australia; money for Relationships Australia; and so on.",183,Representatives Main Committee

In aged care we have had money for Good Shepherd and for the Blue Nurses, for the wonderful work that they do. For home and community care we have had a huge amount of money, for the Northern Carer Respite Centre, Villa Vincent Nursing Home, the Garden Settlement, the Masonic Home, Centacare and the St Vincent Community Centre in South Townsville. On roads, I am particularly proud of the $20.35 million that I got for the Douglas arterial road, but it was a disappointment that the state government would not come to the party with their fair share of that road of national importance. There is the Roads to Recovery program money for Ann Street, Ross River Road, Elizabeth Street and the money for the Mount Low Parkway intersection-vitally important. There is $1.2 million for the AIMS turn-off, Denham Street, Hugh Street, Fulham Road, Charters Towers Road and Bayswater Road. It goes on and on. There is money for Palm Island, Kings Road lights and so on. On the environment, there is $30,000 for the Billabong Sanctuary, money for the Ross River strategic rehabilitation, $17 million for AIMS refurbishment, $6 million for Reef HQ, half a million dollars for cleaner waterways in the city, money for the GBRMPA Moorings Program and a whole raft of NHT programs. I have been working hard for the electorate, and I intend to continue to work hard for the electorate because there is a hell of a lot more to be done. I just hope that I will be privileged again to represent Herbert in the next parliament. Ryan Electorate: War Veterans Ms SHORT (Ryan) (1.01 p.m.)-I wish to draw your attention to the plight of war veterans in my electorate. I am sure all members would agree that our sick and frail veterans deserve the best of nursing care. Yet it appears to me that those who rely on community nursing are now at the sharp end of the government funding cuts. Not only are the veterans unhappy; so too are the nurses who care for them. Community nurses want to know why veterans who require what is considered high cost home nursing care are the targets of funding cuts, so much so that many have to consider leaving the comfort of their homes and the love of their families to go into residential care. These funding cuts attack both nurses and veterans. The nurses who take on these clients are required to complete application forms every three months, and each one takes five hours to complete. On top of this, many experienced nurses have had their pay reduced. Not surprisingly, they are leaving the system and our veterans are missing out on their expertise. Those who stay have less time to tend to their clients. They have a grand total of 26 minutes to shower, dress and feed a patient. How is it possible for a nurse to give someone the benefit of companionable small talk when she is so rushed? The only winner here is the government, and it is only winning in a most insidious way. Let us take a look at the showering policy. High care veterans are now entitled to only two or three showers a week. My electorate of Ryan is a hot and humid place in summer, as are many other places across Australia. Just last week I received in my office a brochure from the Council on the Ageing, which advised the elderly to take extra baths and showers during the hot summer months because they are at greater risk of heat stroke than the rest of the population. But our high cost veterans-those in most need-can only have two or three showers a week. It is shameful that our veterans are treated in such a way. I am sure they do not understand why, in their later years, they are forced to suffer the indignity of being unwashed; why the nurse can only spend 26 minutes tending to their needs; why they must provide their own 31810 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 September 2001 bandages and get their own prescriptions filled. If these people need help showering, how can we expect them to get out to the chemist every time they need a medication? Our veterans who fought for this country, and whose courage we honour on ANZAC Day, are being reduced to a 26-minute block of time which is being funded as cheaply as possible. Where is the gratitude and where is the compassion? It is not the nurses who lack compassion. They certainly do not stay in community nursing for the money. It is our government that lacks the compassion. It is a government that has spent millions of dollars advertising its GST and millions of dollars more trying to fix the economic downturn this very GST caused. While this government is busy spending million of dollars advertising and atoning for its own bad policies, our veterans our being told they can only have two showers a week and their carers are being underpaid. I am not relaxed and comfortable about that. Regional Radio into regional radio of the committee which I chaired. I speak on behalf of Gary Hardgrave, David Jull, Kirsten Livermore, Stewart McArthur and Stuart St Clair-all of whom would have liked to speak about this report but who will now not have the opportunity in the term of this parliament. We nearly called this report Where is Walpole?-Walpole is a little town in Western Australia with only 300 or 400 people-because it was indicative of many places around Australia that we found had no radio service at all. Seventy years on since the introduction of radio, some people did not have that immediacy and intimacy that radio brings to every community. The inquiry arose out of the concerns of Liberal, Labor, National and even Independent members on the perception that networking was depriving regional radio of its character and its localism. The minister gave us four terms of reference: firstly, the social benefits and influence of radio in regional areas; secondly, the future trends in broadcasting, including employment; thirdly and, in particular, the seminal reference of what effect networking was having on local news, sport, community announcements and the like; and, finally, what might happen as a result of the introduction of digital radio. After addressing the matter of these places that did not receive any radio at all, we decided to make a recommendation that we have a radio black spots program that would parallel the television black spots program, where a community, through its local shire council or some other registered body, could apply for a transmitter so that they would at least have the local regional ABC service and one commercial service as an absolute minimum. I hoped it would be more than that if the minister agreed to the recommendation. We did find evidence that localism had faded, although there was not one particular model. Some networks provided generic programming but local news; others provided generic news and local programming. Some provided programming from 6 a.m. till midday; some provided generic programs only and no localism at all. And then there were the independents that worked largely as they had over the years. We were sufficiently concerned and the alarm bells were ringing. We made two recommendations in respect of that. Firstly, we need to stop the sort of fudging that is going on under the pretence of providing local radio when it indeed is not local. We suggested that radio stations should be required to say from where the program was coming as part of their call signalling. That would put those networks under severe psychological pressure. Secondly, we have said that, after the Australian Broadcasting Authority has completed its LAP processLicence Area Planning process-it should concentrate on having an audit of all regions to see what the diversity of radio programming is in those areas and to what extent they have been deprived of localism. If after that-and the minister accepts that recommendation-we find",184,Representatives Main Committee
379,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (1.05 P.m.),"I rise to speak about the report Local Voices: inquiryThursday, 27 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31811 that some networks are not complying, the ultimate sanction could be invoked, with the ABA awarding a licence to someone who would provide those services. So it was a very good report. In other respects we also looked at emergency services. We put networks on notice that the fact they were networking or syndicating, or using pre-recorded programs, did not absolve them from the responsibility of broadcasting emergency service announcements. We found some classic problems in that area. That we are on the right track was indicated by the fact that even before we finished the inquiry the ABA, the ABC and FARB had worked on that matter. I pay tribute to the secretariat who did a marvellous job on this inquiry: to Grant Harrison, to Jan Holmes and to their very dedicated staff, including Rachel Carew, our researcher, and Katie Hobson, our administrative officer. I think this will be one of the reports that will play an important part in the 40th Parliament, and I commend it to the Main Committee. tion to the Main Committee, I understand it is the wish of the member for Hinkler to seek my indulgence, and on this occasion I am quite willing to grant that indulgence.

In his absence, on behalf of all members, opposition and government alike, and especially on behalf of the whips and the committee chairs who carry out duty in this chamber, I would like to thank him for his contribution to the Main Committee. I understand he was a member of the first Procedure Committee, which recommended in 1993 that this Main Committee be established. His commitment is well known, and from the first meeting of the Main Committee on 8 June 1994 he was an active participant. Since April 1996, when he became Deputy Speaker, he has been responsible for chairing the Main Committee. He, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, has presided over this chamber without fear or favour to government and opposition members and has dealt firmly with members whenever the occasion has warranted. We all know that every decision he has taken has been motivated by the desire to establish the Main Committee and to defend the role of the Main Committee and the dignity of the House itself. The Main Committee has become firmly established in our parliamentary system, and through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we would like to convey to him in his absence our tribute to his significant contribution to its success.

(2) Is this service the same service and operation which was operated by Ord Air when the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a Show Cause notice and subsequently refused to issue Ord Air an Air Operators Certificate, on the grounds that it considered the operation an unauthorised Regular Public Transport flight, contrary to subsections 27(2) and 29(20) of the Civil Aviation Act and not a ClassA aircraft. (3) If so, on what grounds has CASA not taken the same action against the current operator; if not, what is the difference between the two services. (1) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) advises me that the services you referred to are conducted as charter operations in a ClassB aircraft. The Civil Aviation Regulations permit the carriage of passengers on charter services under certain circumstances and CASA has confirmed that an appropriate arrangement, permitting the carriage of passengers, is in place between the charterer of the aircraft and the aircraft operator. The aircraft operator is not selling tickets direct to the public or entering into contractual arrangements with the passengers; the aircraft operator’s dealings are direct with the charterer of the aircraft. (2) The ‘Western Mail run’ had previously been operated by Ord Air Charter. The circumstances leading to CASA’s regulatory action against Ord Air Charter included, but were not confined to, concerns that the airline had conducted unauthorised Regular Public Transport (RPT) flights. CASA’s ‘show cause’ letter to Ord Air Charter detailed a broad range of safety regulatory concerns. (3) The present operator holds an Air Operator authorising, among other things, charter operations and the present service is being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to charter operations. Brisbane Airport: Aircraft Movements (Question No. 2626) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) How many flight movements have occurred into and out of Brisbane Airport between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. each year since and including 1995. (2) What proportion of flight movements into and out of Brisbane Airport have occurred over Brisbane suburbs compared to the proportion of flight movements which have occurred over Moreton Bay between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. each year since and including 1995. (3) When was the planned phase-out of Chapter2 aircraft from service at Brisbane Airport lifted. (4) How many flight movements involving Chapter2 aircraft have occurred at Brisbane Airport each year since and including 1995 and what proportion of these flight movements have occurred between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. (5) Are there any discussions under way between Airservices Australia, his Department and the industry concerning a possible further reduction in the hours currently covered by Brisbane’s de facto 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. curfew.

The requirements of the Air Navigation (Aircraft Noise) Regulations, which specify the phase-out of Chapter2 aircraft by 31 March 2002 at the latest, remain in place, Australia wide. The Regulations permit low by-pass Chapter2 jet aircraft, such as the F28 and the B727, to operate until either 31 March 2002 or until the 25th anniversary of the initial issue of an aircraft’s certificate of airworthiness, whichever occurs first. High by-pass Chapter2 jet aircraft, such as the B747-100 series, are permitted to operate until 31 March 2002. As the statistics in Question4 demonstrate, Australian operators have phased out the great majority of their Chapter2 aircraft well ahead of regulatory requirements.

Year Total Chapter2 Chapter2 movements Proportion of movements movements 11pm to 6am 1995 11,965 80 1 out of 150 movements 1996 7,168 139 1 out of 51 movements 1997 1,343 173 1 out of 8 movements 1998 2,146 134 1 out of 16 movements 1999 1,673 88 1 out of 19 movements Year Total Chapter2 Chapter2 movements Proportion of movements movements 11pm to 6am 2000 792 1 1 out of 792 movements 2001 (end May) 83 5 1 out of 17 movements (5) There is no curfew in place at Brisbane Airport. There are noise abatement procedures in place at Brisbane Airport, which are designed to minimise aircraft noise over residential areas. Family Court of Australia (Question No. 2681) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) What is the process by which Family Court matters are assessed for listing in the Family Court and local courts in (a) NSW and (b) Australia. (2) How many applications to the Family Court and local courts in (a) NSW and (b) Australia were there for family law related matters for years 1998 to 2000, inclusive. (3) How many of those applications are refused for want of being considered vexatious, oppressive, unjust or administratively incomplete such as including an insufficient filing fee, having a defective application form or having insufficient evidence or affidavit. (4) What Court Rules, policies and guidelines is the Registrar of the Family Court and local courts bound by in respect of adjudicating what threshold must be reached in order to determine whether there exists a prima facie case that a matter ought to go to trial. (5) What is the average cost of litigation for litigants commencing principal or ancillary relief orders in the Family Court. (6) How many contraventions of child orders have occurred in (a) 1998, (b) 1999 and (c) 2000. (7) Has the number of contraventions of child orders increased, decreased or remained the same over this period. The Family Court of Australia has been consulted and provided the information detailed at Attachment A. State and Territory authorities have also been consulted in relation to the ‘local courts’ aspect of the question. The responses received are consolidated at Attachment B. Attachment A Family Court of Australia Response (1) There is no assessment process in respect of the allocation of the first return date allocated on the filing of an application for orders. This process is regulated by the Family Law Act 1975 (the Act) and Rules. The Act prescribes the jurisdiction of the Family Court of Australia (FCoA) and hence the nature of the orders that can be sought from the Family Court, and the Family Law Rules provide for the allocation of court dates (listing). The allocation of the court date is dependent upon the nature of the orders sought in the application. The Rules do provide for an earlier listing in circumstances where urgency can be demonstrated. The Family Court, through its Rules and Case Management Guidelines, provides parties with the opportunity to consider the resolution of their dispute through primary dispute resolution processes and without recourse to further litigation. Matters which do not resolve at a primary dispute resolution event are referred to a Pre-Hearing Conference conducted by a Deputy Registrar for the allocation of dates for final hearing. (2) The following are the number of applications lodged with the Family Court of Australia (excluding the Family Court of Western Australia (FCWA)) in the calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000. 1998 1998 Application Type FCoA (total) FCoA (NSW) Application for Divorce 48,155 15,854 Application for Final orders 21,271 6,469",188,Questions On Notice
385,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:1998 1998 Application Type FCoA (total) FCoA (NSW) Application for Interim orders 21,520 5,256 Application for Consent orders 13,903 3,826 Other application forms (ancillary) 6,208 1,625 Total 111,057 33,030 1999 1999 Application Type FcoA (total) FcoA (NSW) Application for Divorce 48,306 15,757 Application for Final orders 21,285 6,320 Application for Interim orders 22,638 5,302 Application for Consent orders 12,748 3,566 Other application forms (ancillary) 6,127 1,719 Total 111,104 32,664 2000 2000 Application Type FCoA (total) FCoA (NSW) Application for Divorce 35,852 11,015 Application for Final orders 20,432 6,155 Application for Interim orders 21,644 5,046 Application for Consent orders 12,268 3,257 Other application forms (ancillary) 5,642 1,602 Total 95,838 27,075 Note: NSW figures are a subset of the FCoA figures. NSW includes the applications filed at Sydney, Parramatta and Newcastle registries. These numbers may include applications of non-NSW residents as an applicant may file at any registry, not just the state in which they reside. The Federal Magistrates Service commenced accepting applications for various family law matters on 1 July 2000, hence the number of applications for 2000 is marginally lower than for the previous two calendar years. (3) The Family Court does not keep data about applications pertaining to these categories. (4) The Act does not require parties to establish that a prima facie case exists (except in applications which are quasi-criminal in nature). Accordingly, there are no provisions in the Rules, policies or guidelines of the Court that require a Registrar to determine whether a prima facie case exists before a matter proceeds to trial. The Court has in place processes by which the parties are assisted by a Deputy Registrar in identifying the issues in dispute, and directions made for the trial management of that case, but there is no adjudication by the Court or Registrars prior to hearing as to the merits of the application. Registrars consider the ambit of the dispute and the nature of the relief sought by the parties when making directions for trial management. Such directions include consideration of the amount of hearing time to be allocated to each case. In cases when a party considers that the other party’s application to the Court fails to meet any threshold test as to jurisdiction or merit, an application to the Court to dismiss the application can be made. (5) The average cost of litigation for litigants commencing principal or ancillary relief orders in the Family Court is unknown. However, the current fee structure applied to applications lodged with the Family Court of Australia is as follows: Application for Final Orders-$158 Application for Divorce/ Nullity/ Declaration of validity-$526 Application for Notice of appeal to full court-$648 Application of notice of appeal from court of summary jurisdiction-$648 Final Hearing Fees (required if client has a final hearing before a judge)-$316 These fees are adjusted for CPI on 1 July each year. Many clients receive exemptions or waivers from paying the application fees. This can be as a result of, for example, holding a health care card, being a recipient of a social security payment, being under 18 years of age or being able to prove financial hardship. (6) The number of contraventions of child orders is unknown as many would not come to the notice of the Court. However, applicants may lodge a Contravention of child order application (form 49) in the event of a contravention. The following data shows the number of applications lodged which sought a determination for the contravention of child orders. Calendar Year Lodgments Application Type 1998 1999 2000 F49 Applications Contravention of Child Order 1968 2087 2273 (7) There has been a marginal increase during this period in the number of applications for contravention of child orders. Attachment B State and Territory Responses (1) New South Wales: The Registrar of the Local Court is responsible for the listing of applications under the Family Law Act 1975 before the Local Court. The Registrar of the Local Court is required to comply with Family Law Rules. Order7 rule 2(a) specifies a return date not earlier than 21 days. The time for listing takes account of the time for service of the application on the respondent. Applications requiring urgent ex parte orders are usually placed before the court as soon as possible. Victoria In Victoria, family law matters are filed in the Magistrates’ Court. At the time the application is filed a return date for the application is fixed. There is never any assessment made of whether a matter is ready to be heard before it proceeds to court. Most matters are resolved and orders made with the consent of parties to the matter. Contested matters are generally transferred to the Family Court of Australia. Queensland In Queensland, family law matters are filed in the Magistrates’ Court. Upon filing the matter is registered and set down for mention before a Magistrate. Urgent matters are brought before a Magistrate immediately. If a matter is not urgent, it comes before a Magistrate on the next available date, usually within 4 to 6 weeks. Western Australia In the Family Court of Western Australia (FCWA), registry staff (counter officers) assess matters for initial hearing. Matters of a similar type are usually listed for an initial hearing in multiple lists before Magistrates as prescribed by the Family Law Rules and the Court’s Case Management Guidelines and Directions (CMG&D). The Rules provide applications for principal relief (divorce) to be listed: in the case of a joint application, at least 21 days after the day on which the application is filed; and for all other applications – if the respondent is in Australia, at least 42 days, or – if the respondent is outside Australia, at least 56 days, after filing. The Court’s CMG&D provide that joint applications be listed for hearing as close as practicable to four weeks from filing, and all other applications as close as practicable to ten weeks from filing. Applications other than for principal relief are to be listed as near as practicable to 42 days after filing unless interim orders are sought, in which case the application is listed not earlier than 28 days after filing. The only matters listed for first hearing before Judges are those matters that are outside the jurisdiction of Magistrates and include appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction and applications for review of decisions of Registrars. If a litigant seeks a listing of an application earlier than the time prescribed by the Rules, the request is assessed by a Registrar of the Court, a Duty Registrar, or by a senior member of the Court staff. In the Magistrates’ Courts outside the metropolitan area, members of the court staff list all matters for hearing as prescribed by the Family Law Rules. (The FCWA has exclusive jurisdiction in family law matters in the Perth metropolitan area.) South Australia Port Augusta Magistrates Court Matters are listed before a Magistrate on next allocated Family Court date, unless the lodging party indicates to the Court that the matter is urgent. Urgent matters are listed as soon as possible on the next available circuit date. Whyalla Magistrates Court All matters are listed before a Magistrate on circuit, who determines the status of all applications. Tasmania No significant response received due to the accessibility of the Family Court of Australia’s registry and sub-registry in Hobart and Launceston, respectively. Australian Capital Territory Matters lodged with the ACT Magistrates Court must comply with the requirements as to form and substance as prescribed in the Family Law Act 1975 and related legislation. In certain circumstances, a filing fee is applicable. After lodgement, a first return date, where the matter is to be listed for mention only, is fixed with the documents being issued for service upon the respondent. Applications for child support are fixed for Order 24 (Conciliation) conferences in accordance with a practice direction issued by the Chief Magistrate. If no agreement is reached at the conference, the matter is listed for hearing before the Court. Matters not listed for conference are set down for hearing if contested. Northern Territory Applications are filed in accordance with the Family Law Act 1975 and Rules. Urgent applications for “interim” custody or injunctive relief matters will be listed in consultation with the Listing Registrar for a time before the magistrate. (2) Applications lodged, other than with the Family Court of Australia, in NSW and elsewhere in Australia were as follows: NSW VIC QLD WA SA TAS ACT NT FCWA Local Courts 1998 11,690 3247 2,942 14,972 1,029 21 Approx 115 62 106 pa 1999 10,374 2966 2,843 14,996 857 8 Approx 115 31 36 pa 2000 10,051 2731 2,791 15,685 981 10 Approx 115 14 16 pa (3) State and Territory local courts do not maintain statistics about applications pertaining to these categories. (4) New South Wales The Registrar of the Local Court does not exercise discretion as to whether an application will be listed before a Magistrate. Victoria Family law matters in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria are generally resolved by the filing of consent orders. Therefore, there are no trials nor any necessity to determine whether matters should go to trial. Matters likely to involve dispute are transferred to the Family Court of Australia for resolution. Queensland In the Queensland Magistrates Court the Registrar has no judicial function. The matter is determined by a Magistrate. Western Australia The determination of whether or not there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial is a matter of judicial discretion. Registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia and Clerks of Local Courts do not have authority to determine that issue. A party who considers that a matter should be dismissed summarily prior to trial is entitled to make a formal application to the Court and to seek a listing before a judicial officer. South Australia The same guidelines as for the civil jurisdiction apply ie if the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable outcome, the matter is listed for trial. Tasmania No information supplied. Australian Capital Territory Rules of the Family Court of Australia provide guidance to the Registrar of the ACT Magistrates Court. Northern Territory No information supplied. (5) State and Territory courts do not have access to data relating to the cost of litigation to parties in family law matters. (6) Western Australia The Family Court of Western Australia does not record statistics of the number of findings of contravention of child orders. The Court does, however, maintain statistics of the number of applications filed for contravention of a child order which, for the relevant years, were as follows: 1998: 298 1999: 268 2000: 233 New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory No information is maintained on contravention of child residence and contact orders in these States and Territories. (7) State and Territory local courts do not maintain statistics on contraventions of child orders. Rail: Alice Springs to Darwin Railway (Question No. 2798) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: (1) With respect to the Government’s employment and training programs for indigenous Australians, what sum has the Government committed to the Alice Springs to Darwin Railway project, and as part of that commitment, what guarantees did the Government receive on employment and training of indigenous Australians. (2) Beyond the 13 July 2001 announcement to train indigenous people from Wyndham and Port Hedland in preparation for employment on the gas pipeline, as Darwin has become the central point for Australia’s engagement in the Timor Sea Gas Pipeline project, what agreement has the Government put in place for the training and employment of indigenous Australians from the NT for employment in the project. (3) What is the level of unemployment, including CDEP participants, of indigenous Australians, and the level of youth unemployment of indigenous Australians in the NT as against the level of unemployment and youth unemployment in the NT. (1) ADrail, the project manager for the Alice Springs to Darwin Railway, has accepted, in principle, an offer made by my Department to assist in the employment of about 100 Indigenous Australians on the railway project, through the provision of flexible financial assistance under the Government’s Indigenous Employment Policy. Specific details are not available, as the contract is yet to be finalised and until this occurs, it is not possible for the Government to commit to a specific amount of funding. The Commonwealth is also working in partnership with other government and private sector companies to maximise employment opportunities for indigenous people in work related to the railway project with assistance provided under the Indigenous Employment Policy. (2) My Department has had discussions with the office of the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory concerning the Timor Sea Gas Pipeline project. The Government is keen to work with the Northern Territory Government to ensure that there are job opportunities for indigenous people on the project. However, I understand that work on the pipeline has been deferred and, therefore, it is not possible for the Government to commit to a specific amount of funding at this stage. (3) Information from the Census of Population and Housing for 1996 include estimates of unemployment, which are provided in the table below. Source Unemployment Unemployment Unemployment Unemployment Rate-NT-all Rate-NT-all Rate-NTRate-NTunemployed under 25 years of indigenous unindigenous under age employed 25 years of age Australian Bureau of Statistics (Census of 7.4% 13.1% 17.6% 23.3% Population and Housing-August, 1996) The Australian Bureau of Statistics also undertakes a monthly labour force survey. However, given its relatively small sample size it is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown of data to identify indigenous and non-indigenous unemployment rates separately. If participants in Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) in the Northern Territory are included, the level of indigenous unemployment would be higher than in the above table. Australian Customs Service: Service in East Timor (Question No. 2835) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 7 August 2001: (1) Is the Minister aware of the contribution made by personnel of the Australian Customs Service (ACS) who served in dangerous conditions in the UN peacekeeping contingent in East Timor. (2) If so, (a) what are the details of the number of ACS personnel who provided this service, and the dates and duration of their East Timor service and (b) is the Minister also aware that these personnel have not been awarded the UN medal for East Timor. (3) What steps, if any, has the Minister taken to ensure that ACS personnel receive appropriate recognition of their contribution to this important operation. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. I am aware of the contribution made by Customs staff who served in East Timor as part of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).",190,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
386,Mr Abbott,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,195,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
387,Mr Williams,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toCustoms staff in East Timor were responsible for setting up customs and immigration controls along the Western land border at Batugarde, Maliana and Suai. Two additional Customs staff were posted to Dili to design training programs and to provide on-the-job training for East Timorese employees of the Border Control Service. (2) (a) Customs sent two contingents of six staff to East Timor between March and August 2000. The first Customs contingent was in East Timor from 6 March 2000 14 June 2000. The second was in East Timor from 5 June 2000 – 7 September 2000. In addition, two staff remained in East Timor in a training role until January 2001. (b) Yes. I am aware that Customs staff have not been awarded the United Nations medal for East Timor. Recipients of the UN Medal must meet the eligibility criteria set by the UN. Under these criteria, only those individuals attached to the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) or the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) as military personnel or civilian police would be eligible. (3) The leader of the first Customs contingent was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal in the Australia Day 2001 Honours List. In June this year, the Australian Government honoured the efforts of Customs contingents through the Australian volunteers in East Timor ceremonies. These ceremonies, hosted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, recognised all civilian volunteers in East Timor. I also presented a medallion (struck by the Perth Mint) to both contingents of Customs staff. This acknowledged their contribution in East Timor providing policy development and administration support in difficult circumstances. Australian Defence Force: Balkans Service (Question No. 2836) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2356 (Hansard, 26 March 2001, page 25693), how many of the 259 Australian Defence Force personnel who served in the Balkans have now been contacted by Defence and have completed (a) blood and urine tests to check the functioning of their kidneys and blood forming systems and (b) the questionnaire to assess their exposure risk to depleted uranium. (2) Has Defence conducted any preliminary analysis of the data that it has obtained to date; if so, what are the details of its analysis. (3) Are Defence personnel who served in the Balkans eligible for any medal in respect of that service; if so, what are the details. (4) Does service in the Balkans confer eligibility for any repatriation benefits; if so, what are the details. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Questionnaires were sent to all of the 259 personnel initially identified as having served in the Balkans. 21 individuals of the original 259 have since reported that they did not deploy to the Balkans due to mission cancellation or other events. (a) Blood and urine tests have been completed on 59 personnel. (b) 107 questionnaires have been received from the initial mailing. Additional attempts to contact Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel who have not responded to the initial questionnaire are being implemented. (2) The number of returns and subsequent blood and urine tests is too small to provide a statistically significant sample size of the total population which served in the Balkans. (3) Yes. The Australian Active Service Medal is awarded for warlike operations in the Balkans from 12 January 1992 to 24 January 1997 for service of one day or more which members of the ADF were engaged with the United Nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation activities. The Australian Service Medal is awarded for non-warlike operations in the Balkans from 25 January 1997 to present for service of 30 days or more which members of the ADF were engaged with the United Nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation activities. (4) Yes. Four relevant Determinations of ‘non warlike service’ have been made to cover members of the ADF assigned for duty in the area of operations comprising the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Adriatic Sea and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation bases in Italy. A member of the ADF who rendered ‘non-warlike service’, who has an injury or disease that they believe may have arisen from their ‘non-warlike service’, may claim a disability compensation pension, treatment benefits and related allowances under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. Member for Griffith: Administrative Appeals Tribunal Hearing Costs (Question No. 2844) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No.2257 (Hansard, 29 March 2001, page 26087), what additional costs have subsequently been incurred by the Commonwealth in its legal action before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan. (2) What is the cumulative cost incurred by the Commonwealth in its legal action against myself before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court over the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan. (3) In respect of the legal action, what is the (a) cumulative cost incurred by the Commonwealth for the engagement of Queen’s Counsel, (b) cumulative cost incurred by the Commonwealth for the engagement of Senior Counsel and (c) costed-out value of solicitors used from the Australian Government Solicitor and elsewhere. (4) What other costs have been incurred in respect of the legal action. (1) The Commonwealth has not brought a legal action before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) over the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan. Further to the answer to question no.2257, the additional costs incurred by the Commonwealth as respondent to the action brought by Mr Rudd in the AAT are $24, 313. This figure represents costs of Junior Counsel, AGS professional fees and disbursements, and includes GST. (2) The costs incurred by the Commonwealth in its legal action before the Federal Court is $37,441.22. There have been no additional costs in relation to the Federal Court action since the answer to question no.2257 was provided. The cost incurred by the Commonwealth as respondent to the action brought by Mr Rudd in the AAT is $24,313 as stated at point (1) above. (3) In respect of the legal action brought by Mr Rudd in the AAT, (a) the cost of Queen’s Counsel is $nil, (b) no senior counsel is engaged, and (c) the costed-out value of solicitors used from the Australian Government Solicitor is $21,054.

(4) Other costs incurred by the Commonwealth in respect of the legal action brought by Mr Rudd in the AAT are $3,259 (includes GST) for a Junior Counsel. Advertising: Standards (Question No. 2866) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 20 August 2001: (1) Is he aware of a letter dated 23 July 2001 from the Australian Standards Board Ltd addressed to Reverend JohnW Woo, Rector, St Andrew’s Anglican Church, Strathfield. (2) Is he aware of the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) Advertiser Code of Ethics and clause 1.1 of those ethics which states that advertisements shall comply with Commonwealth law and the law of the relevant State or Territory. (3) Is the Trade Marks Act 1995 a Commonwealth Law. (4) Is he aware that a billboard poster at the corner of Great Western Highway (Parramatta Road) and Mosely Street, Strathfield, NSW was recently seen depicting an advertisement for Four Seasons® condoms.",195,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
388,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Is he able to say whether the trade mark “Four Seasons” in respect to its advertised relationship to the word “condom” is the registered trade mark of (a) Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Limited (A.C.N. 003 809 783 and ABN 36 003 809 783), (b) Mr Graham William Porter or (c) some other person; if so, who. (6) Does the first paragraph of the Australian Standards Board letter hold out that the registered trade mark holder of Four Seasons® condoms is Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Limited; if so, is he able to say whether this is misleading. (7) What relationship does the Australian Standards Board have in respect of his portfolio. (8) How does he police and enforce the punitive provisions of the Trade Marks Act in respect to fraudulent, misleading or other advertisements implicitly or explicitly depicting trade mark symbols or otherwise hold out to be a product as a registered trade mark. (9) Does the Advertising Standards Board Ltd have an administrative and moral obligation to ensure that advertisers’ advertisements comply with Commonwealth law and in particular, the spirit of that law. (10) Is it possible for the registered trade mark owner and the advertiser to whom the AANA standards applies, to not be the same person. (11) In respect of the advertisement described in part (5) of this question, was (a) the advertiser Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Limited and (b) the relevant registered trade mark holder of the intellectual property good called “Four Seasons” Mr Graham William Porter. (12) Does the letter from the Australian Standards Board Ltd (a) explicitly state that the Advertising Standards Board considered the advertisement at its most recent meeting and determined that the complaint should be dismissed, (b) imply that the advertisement complies with the AANA Code and Commonwealth and State Law and (c) is silent on whether the advertiser and the trade mark holder is the same person; if so, is it misleading. (13) Is the letter from the Australian Standards Board Ltd misleading in that it implies the advertisement that is depicted is the property of Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Ltd and that the product so advertised is the intellectual property of the advertiser. (14) Does the Advertising Standards Board’s implied association between the advertiser and the registered trade-mark holder create a legitimate expectation that the advertisement complies with the AANA Code and Commonwealth law and therefore the letter to Reverend Woo is misleading. (15) In light of these facts, will he empanel a meeting of Attorneys-General of the States, Territories and the Commonwealth to review the application of standards in advertising and in particular, the conduct of “self regulating” bodies, including the Australian Standards Board, who have demonstrated (a) a failure to consider the spirit of the AANA industry code, (b) misrepresentation of cases, including that of Reverend Woo and (c) a misunderstanding of their own administrative and legal responsibilities. (16) Will he also empanel a meeting of Attorneys-General of the States, Territories and the Commonwealth to review the application of standards in ancillary self-regulating organisations, including the (a) Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations in respect of television broadcasting, (b) Australian Record Industry Association in respect of the publication, sale and distribution of music and (c) Office of Film and Literature Classification in respect of videos, computer games and other materials. answer to the honourable member’s question: In the preparation of this response, I have taken the honourable member’s reference to the Australian Standards Board as synonymous to the Advertising Standards Board. (1) Yes, the honourable member’s office provided a copy of the letter from the Reverend John Woo and the Advertising Standards Board (ASB) reply to that letter. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) I have been informed that such a billboard poster was located at the site. (5) (a) No.",197,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
389,Mr Reith,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following(b) Yes. (c) No. (6) The letter makes no direct reference to who is the registered trade mark holder of “Four Seasons”. The first paragraph states “Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Ltd’s Four Seasons condoms” which could be perceived as ownership. Under the Trade Marks Act 1995, a registered trade mark owner may authorise other persons to use their trade mark in relation to the goods and/or services for which the trade mark is registered. (7) None. The Advertising Standards Board is a self regulatory body established under the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) Code of Ethics. (8) Parts 12 to 14 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 contain a number of provisions in relation to the protection of trade marks. In particular, sections 120 to 130 deal with the infringement of a registered trade mark. Section 146 deals with falsely applying a registered trade mark. The owner of a registered trade mark may use these provisions to enforce their rights under the Trade Marks Act 1995. In the case of possible or alleged criminal conduct (section 146), the decision to initiate investigative procedures ordinarily rests with the department responsible for administering the relevant legislation (in this case, IP Australia as part of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources). Advice would be sought from the Director of Public Prosecutions on whether the matter should be referred to the Australian Federal Police for action. (9) No. Responsibility rests with the advertiser to ensure their advertisements comply with relevant Commonwealth laws. (10) Yes. Under the Trade Marks Act 1995, a registered trade mark owner may authorise other persons to used their trade mark in relation to the goods and/or services for which the trade mark is registered. (11) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (12) (a) Yes. (b) No. The letter from the Advertising Standards Board makes no reference to the AANA Code or to Commonwealth or State law. (c) Yes. In my view, it is not misleading as the letter makes no direct reference to who is the registered trade mark holder of “Four Seasons”. (13) See response to part 6. (14) The letter makes no direct reference to who is the registered trade mark holder of “Four Seasons”. See response to part 6 and 9. (15) No, I do not intend to empanel a meeting with the States on standards in advertising or on the conduct of self regulating bodies at this time but thank the honourable member for raising this matter on behalf of his constituent. (16) No, I do not intend to empanel a meeting with the States to review the application of standards in self regulating organisations. The honourable member may wish to raise the matter with the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation if he has any further concerns on policy issues relating to self regulation. Convention on the Settlement of International Disputes (Question No. 2869) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 August 2001: (1) Have there been communications between the Commonwealth and WA Governments concerning the 1975 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States since his answer to question No. 898 (Hansard, 22 November 1999, page 12352); if so, what were the dates, terms and results of this communication.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2881) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 August 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2621 (Hansard, 20 August 2001, page 29765), is he the Minister responsible for the sale of Sydney Airport and other Sydney basin airports; if not, who is the Minister with this responsibility. (2) Is he responsible for the preparatory tender process for the sale of Sydney Airport and other Sydney basin airports; if not, who is the Minister with this responsibility. (3) In respect to his answers to parts (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) of question No. 2621, is he able to say whether 15% constitutes, in public corporation terms, a controlling interest in a Board of Directors for publicly listed companies; if not, what percentage of a Boards voting interest constitutes a controlling interest in a publicly listed firm. (4) Does a parent entity with a maximum 15% interest in either respective paired airports constitute a situation where a single parent company can have a controlling interest in more than one of the combination of respectively paired airports. (5) If the situation were to arise where a parent company did acquire 15% interest in any combination of paired airports, is he able to say whether this would constitute a situation of monopolistic-like market control by a single parent company. (6) If 15% means a controlling interest, has the Government legislated in monopolistic structural control by a prospective parent company in the administration of Australia’s airports; if not, why not. (7) Has he effectively eliminated the capacity of the public interest to have any statutory protection against the new regime as contained in the Airports Act that now statutorily protects the controlling interest of a prospective parent company that may have a controlling interest in one or more pairs of airports. (8) Is the policy underpinning this provision of diversity of ownership fundamentally defective in that it ensures a maximum of 15%, thus effectively guaranteeing controlling interest at the shareholder meetings of the prospective parent companies and hence their subsidiaries. (9) Does he limit strategic interest of Australia’s airports to mean only aviation gateways to the world; if so, (a) are Australia’s airports also (i) of strategic military importance and (ii) important to Australia’s border protection obligations and (b) does his answer singularly focus on the gateway role of Australia’s airports while ignoring the regulatory functions. (10) Does the ownership of operating leases by private entities fundamentally compromise the strategic importance of Australia’s assets such as airports into the hands of private persons who may include elements of foreign ownership. (11) Does the controlling interest of private companies of strategic interests such as Sydney Airport and other Australian airports constitute a serious strategic exposure. (12) Will the controlling interest of Sydney and other Australian airports fundamentally place their commercial interests of profit maximisation at odds with those Government agencies charged with border protection responsibilities, including the Australian Customs Service, Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, Australian Taxation Office, Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Environment Australia and any other Government agency charged with border protection functions. (13) How can he justify his comment that these provisions also ensure that commercially-driven decisions are made about maintaining existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure when border protection functions necessarily constitute a commercial hindrance to the free flow of people and goods between borders. (14) Must the agencies listed in part (12) be free to perform their functions without interference by the airport lessee company through commercial constraints or other pressure that the airport lessee company may exert; if so, how does the existing legislation protect these agencies against the risk of commercial imperatives overriding the free administration of these Government agencies statutory responsibilities. (15) What steps will he take to fortify those Government agencies in the performance of their statutory responsibilities. (1) No. The Minister responsible for the sale of Sydney Airport and other Sydney basin airports is the Minister for Finance and Administration. (2) No. The Minister responsible for the preparatory tender process for the sale of Sydney Airport and other Sydney basin airports is the Minister for Finance and Administration. (3) No, 15% is not regarded, in public corporation terms, as a “controlling interest” on a company board. The board of a company consists of persons appointed according to the constitution or replaceable rules of the company. What quorum is required for a valid meeting, and what the majority at a given board meeting consists of, will depend on the size of the board and the company’s constitution.",199,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
391,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:A controlling shareholding in a company, in broader corporate law terms, is usually regarded as being greater than 50%. (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) The Government’s intention is to ensure that a party with an interest of more than 15% in either Brisbane, Melbourne or Perth Airport is not in a position via a direct interest in Sydney Airport (ie equity or another form of stake) to dominate its operation or future direction Underpinning the Government’s approach to airport privatisation was a decision to move from a single centrally controlled network to a diverse ownership situation, particularly with the view to enabling the airports to be an integral part of the competitive promotion of local business infrastructure. Consistent with the Government’s objectives, any potential arrangements under which the critical business development decisions at both Sydney and another “paired” airport could, in effect, be made by parties reporting back to the same parent entity will be examined closely in the tender process. (9) No. (10) No. (11) No. Privately operated airports are subject to an extensive regulatory regime under the Airports Act 1996 including, for example, for defence-related purposes. (12) No. The Government agencies responsible for border protection measures have their own legislative framework, enabling them to appropriately discharge their responsibilities at the leased Federal airports. (13) and (14) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to parts (11) and (12). (15) These are matters for Ministers with the relevant portfolio responsibility to address. However, I would note that an example of the Government’s commitment to the important responsibilities these agencies shoulder in the public interest can be seen in the implementation of a new border intervention regime to prevent the introduction of Foot and Mouth Disease. Employment: Funding for Visually Impaired People (Question No. 2906) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 29 August 2001: (1) What level of funding is provided for the provision of employment services to legally blind individuals through specialised job placement organisations in each State and Territory. (2) On what basis is the level of funding available to these organisations calculated. (3) Is there a difference in funding provided between Vision Queensland and corresponding organisations in other States; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) what is the rationale behind the different levels of funding. (4) What effect does the rating his Department provides on performance and cost effectiveness, have on the level of funding provided. (1) In 2000-01, $231.9 million was expended for the purpose of providing specialist disability employment services. Most services do not restrict service provision to a particular disability group, though a small number of services do specialise in assisting people within a particular disability. Preliminary results from the 1999-2000 Commonwealth Disability Census show that of the 53 427 people assisted by specialist disability assistance services, 1 850 people were recorded as having ‘vision’ as their primary disability. A further 158 people recorded ‘deafblind’ as their primary disability. (2) and (3) The current block grant funding to organisations providing disability employment assistance are historically based and are not directly linked to the support needs of job seekers being assisted. To address this situation, the Government is currently trialing a new funding model which seeks to link funding to job seeker needs and outcomes. The findings of the cased based funding trial will be used to refine and implement a more equitable funding process for specialist disability employment assistance. (4) Departmental funding agreements for employment assistance require service providers to report their performance against negotiated performance targets every six months. Targets such as the",203,Proportion Of Aircraft Movements Between The Hours Of 11pm And 6am
392,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:estimated number of job seekers and the estimated number of workers to receive employment assistance in the year are negotiated annually. Performance information is used to inform the annual contract negotiation process and ensures the Commonwealth can help as many people with disabilities as possible to find and maintain employment. A service provider’s performance may lead to renegotiating more appropriate levels of funding.
