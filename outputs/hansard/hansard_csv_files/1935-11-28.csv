The famous Balfour of the said Imperial Conference) subject to declaration of that year is in these the conclusions hereinafter recited: termsThey are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and. freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I have always maintained that Australia's status existed as a fact independent of any formal declaration or any legal enactment. This was recognized by Mr Bonar Law, a former Prime Minister of Great Britain, when, during the war, he made a public declaration that if Australia wished to declare itself a republic there was nothing to stop it from doing so. Australia, so far as I know, does not desire to declare itself a republic. The League of Nations, a year or Mr Brenva/n. nary imperial conferences which had been held from time to time. On my return to Australia. I moved, on the 3rd July, Whereas the Imperial Conference held at of dominion legislation (which is to be regarded as forming part of the report And whereas the said Imperial Conference by resolution recommended (<r) that the statute proposed to be passed by the Parliament at Westminster should contain the provisions set out in the schedule annexed to the said resolution. (6) that the 1st December, 1931, should be the date as from which the proposed statute should become operative. (e) that with a view to the realization of this arrangement resolutions passed by both Houses of the dominion Parliaments should be forwarded to the United Kingdom, if possible by the 1st July, 1931, and, in any case not later than the 1st August, '1931, with a view to tlie enactment by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of legislation on the lines set out in the schedule annexed . . . The schedule to the resolution contained the substance of the Statute of Westminster which this Government and its predecessor have so inexcusably failed to adopt. I take leave to digress here sufficiently to say that, if the resolution had I think it is or ever was necessary; but been adopted as agreed upon in London, and as proposed by me, the clear purpose which the Balfour Conference had in view would have been achieved, this delay of five years would not have occurred, nor would the present motion for the adjournment of the House have been necessary. Though there has been a good deal of juggling with trifling amendments, designed, as I think, quite unnecessarily to secure the rights of the States, the fact is that the position of the States was not affected by what was done at the Imperial Conference except insofar as it may be said that their position was affected by the public declaration contained in the resolution and stated at the conference-that the rights of the States would not be in any circumstances interfered with. In the resolution which T moved these words occurNothing in this act shall be deemed to authorize the Parliament of the Commonwealth' of Australia to inake laws on any matter within the authority of the States oi It will be seen therefore that the OpposiAustralia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or Government of and that both sides in both Houses of the Commonwealth of Australia.

The tive position of the States and the ComGovernment had, however, accepted some monwealth is one to be dealt with by amendments of the resolution in order, Australians under the Constitution of if possible, to remove all doubt or susthe Commonwealth.

Under the resolution as I originally moved it , formal adoption, such as I am now seeking, was not necessary, nor do Sir John Latham, an expert divider of invisible straws, bent his very acute mind to the raising and removing of difficulties, especially to the raising of them. Amendments were suggested avowedly mainly for the protection of the States, which in my view, as I have already pointed out, were not affected at all by anything done at the conference. The right honourable member who was then leading the Opposition having had hi? way in regard to these amendments, or some of them, gave his blessing to the proposal and Sir George Pearce the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, salved his conscience with some plausible words to the same intent. In Hansard of the 27th October, 1931, at page 1207, he is reported to have saidI opposed the original resolution for reasons, which I considered were well founded, but since it has been adopted by both Houses, I intend now to vote for this supplementary resolution because, in my opinion, it putsthe States in an absolutely secure position. tion came into line with the Government the Parliament agreed that the Statute Nothing in this act shall de deemed to require the concurrence of the Parliament o r Government of the Commonwealth of Auswithin the authority of the Parliament or Government of the Commonwealth of AusNew Zealand, from which tralia, in any case where it would have been the Parliament of the United Kingdomshould mako the law without such concurNeedless to say I had no objection to that; although I conceived it to be consideration.

At any rate, of it comes, but it is obviously impossible the amendments thought to be of major for me to discuss it within the limited time importance, only the one I have just available for me to speak to this motion; quoted was embodied in the Statute.

On the whole I am bound to matter, as will be seen from the published submit, with much respect, that the then official reports of the proceedings of the Opposition rendered considerable disBritish House of Commons. service to the clear definition of Australia's position as a nation.

I also desire to know the method adopted by the administrative heads of the department to keep in touch with officers in all parts of Australia. Does the Minister arrange for periodical visits by the Comptroller-General of Customs to the States? The Minister himself and the Comptroller-General, I think, have had experience of discovering in the States young, well-equipped officers whom, with considerable advantage to the department, as well as to the officers concerned, they have brought to the central office and given an opportunity to obtain experience in administrative work. It is PHsy for efficient officers to be side-tracked when their duties are performed in outlying parts of Australia. I have met them myself in central and northern Queensland. It is all very well to say that they have the same opportunities for advancement as men at central office, but they never come under notice. It is only by departmental heads making periodical visits of inspection to all customs offices that the officers can be given an opportunity to meet them, and express complaints or show their claims for future promotion. A little more consideration regarding the customs officers in distant parts would lead to a better feeling of harmony and contentment in the department. The Department of Trade and Customs is the greatest revenue-producer of all Commonwealth departments. In recent years the revenue from that source has increased strikingly from £18,500,000 in 1931-32 to £25,2S9,000 in 1934-35. It cannot be said that the Minister suffers 'from any dearth of funds, because the buoyancy of the revenues is pronounced. Of course, that buoyancy has been -encouraged by slashing of duties on 1,500 items ancl sub-items of the tariff schedule in the last four or five years. Mr ""WHITE -The Government's -policy has increased employment. tariff has tended to increase imports into this country, and to retard the development which otherwise would have taken place in our secondary industries. Undoubtedly, more employment would have been given had the Government not .adopted a tariff-slashing policy. Chairman of Committees ( Mr Prowse), doubtless will say that the tariff has not been slashed to the extent which he would like to see. The Government also has reaped the benefit of increased revenue from excise, which has risen from £9,S00,O00 in 1931-32 to £12,570,000 in 1934-35, making a total revenue from customs and excise of £2S.300,000 in 1931-32, compared with £37,800,000 in 1934-35. T*he increase of indirect taxation, through the Department of Trade and Customs, since 1931-32 amounts to £9,500,000. Of course, the Minister for Trade and Customs would not like to admit that there has been any increase of indirect taxation through this department. He would prefer to say that there has been a drop of direct taxation amounting to £5,500,000, whereas actuallythere has been a net increase of about £4,000,000 in taxation revenue. On page 79 of the Estimates there is shown the increased proposed vote of £S35 for the Tariff Board. Probably the Minister will be able to explain the reason for that increase. According to its annual report, the board furnished 110 reports to the Minister during the year. I should like to know how many of those have been tabled, how may have received consideration by the Minister, how many are still awaiting consideration, and upon how many a decision has been reached ? During the year, Mr A. D. J. Forster resigned his position as a member of thtboard. Wa3 that action taken of his own volition, or was he asked to resign? Probably there are occasions when members of the board do not see eye to eye with the Government in matters of policy. Some of them may refuse to take a lead in regard to the nature of their recommendations. The attitude of this Government since it assumed office has been to effect a downward trend of the tariff.

This Government clothed the Tariff Board with much greater powers than I think were intended at its establishment. The fact that under the Ottawa agreement, the duties upon imports from Great Britain may not be increased unless the matter has first been investigated and favourably reported upon by the board, places the board in a very much more important position than it previously held. It is really above Parliament. Control has . largely been taken out of thehands of the Executive Goverument and vested in the board, consequently, it is of the greatest importance that members of the board should be gentlemen of the highest standard of ability, experience and integrity. The board makes the following comment on page 14 of its annual report:The work of the Tariff Board during the past year has included much tariff revision on principles formulated in the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement in 1932. Hence as a starting point for a review of the operation of the tariff the date of the signing mendations are receiving at head-quarters. of this agreement-20t h August, 19:12naturally suggests itself. Since that date, restrictions have been removed and material reductions have boon made in the duties payable on importations. The process has been gradual and the changes have been made without any serious dislocation of the business of local industries, while the result has been generally beneficial to the community. All of the changes which have affected the importation of goods from overseas since August, 1932, have not been the result of recommendations by the Board -Order! I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the tariff is not now before the committee. am dealing with Division No. 79-Tariff Board. The expenditure under this item, as I have already mentioned, shows an increase of £S35.

The board seis out the number of alterations of duties that have resulted from its review of the tariff under the terms of the Ottawa agreement. The Minister informed us on one occasion that 1,500 items and sub-items had been reduced largely as the result of the definite instruction issed to the board that it must review the whole of the tariff items in the light of articles 9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement, which unquestionably cut right across the protectionist policy of Australia without conferring a commensurate advantage upon the primary producers of this country. Apropos the subject of tariffs and trade treaties, presumably the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) will be able to state definitely when the Minister in charge of negotiations for Trade Treaties( Sir Henry Gullett) will return to Canberra.

All of those who are either directly or indirectly engaged in industry, whether they be employers or employees, await his return with considerable interest. One of the gentlemen accompanying h i m is a responsible and trusted officer of the Department of Trade and Customs, who has had the important task of advising him. The most important aspect of proposed trade treaties with other countries is the repercussion which must be felt by Australian domestic industries. Moreover, it is difficult to see how any trade treaties can be of much practical advantage to any aspect of Australia's general economic position. Despite all the good intentions displayed on both sides in tariff treaty bargaining, in the long run a country's economic policy is always dictated by the combined international requirements of employment, defence, industrial necessities and financial commitments. For these reasons, it should be borne in mind that international trade treaties may bring to Australia f a r more difficulties and complications than advantages, and may make our great secondary industries vulnerable to imports from cheap-labour accentuating the difficulty of providingemployment generally, and particularly for the 50,000 boys who annually leave school and seek employment very largely in vain.' The honourable member is not in order in discussing that matter on the vote for the administration of the Department of Trade and Customs. matter because at least three officers of the department have accompanied the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties.

The Brisbane Courier-Mail and the Brisbane Telegraph recently published the following: Commonwealth Health and Customs authorities in Brisbane said yesterday that, under present conditions, they were severely handicapped in checking the landing of Japanese Barn pan crews on the North Queensland coast. They expressed confidence, however, that the use of speed boats, as approved by the Federal Government, would place their work on an improved footing. The officials were commenting, on the statement made in Sydney by a Torres Straits countries, thus greatly shipping master that sampan crews, after long journeys from the East, landed on the coast against quarantine aud customs regulations, and sometimes came in contact with the natives.

Before his department could take any action, it was necessary to make direct contact with the sampan crews. . . . The Collector of Customs( Mr R. B. Curd) I have dealt with the agreed that the crews of sampans would probably find it easy to land on the coast, particularly about the Gulf of Carpentaria. They would, of necessity, come ashore for supplies of water and food, and mission authorities had com plained that they had come into contact with the blacks. We[ understand from a statement published in the press that a considerable time ago the Government approved of the construction of three boats to patrol the waters off the coast of North Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the north of Western Australia, particularly between Darwin and the Timor Sea, as well as.",18,Department Of Trade And Customs

So far, however, the Government has ordered only one boat to patrol the waters iu the area used by the England-Australia air mail service from Darwin in the direction of Singapore. that that vessel will shortly be delivered in Australia. So far as I can ascertain, the Department of Trade and Customs has taken no action to procure the other two boats to prevent' in these waters illegal fishing by Japanese, and to ensure that there will be no breach of the quarantine regulations. Their presence is also necessary to impose a check on the drug traffic, and on smuggling operations. Nothing has been done, however, and a complaint has been received from the department's own officers in Queensland that they are unable to carry out their work properly because they lack the necessary equipment. The offenders are becoming more and more daring. It is said that if patrol boats are not provided at once they will be of no use, because the sampans are rapidly cleaning up all the trochus shell on the reef. The following report dealing with the subjec was published recently in the Brisbane Telegraph:Japanese sampan crews in Northern Australian waters had now reached such a pitch of arrogant defiance of this country's laws that they were almost openly landing on parts of the mainland coast north from Ouoktown, said a northern shipping man to-day, commenting upon the published statement by Captain IJ. S. Diamond, well known in Torres Straits waters that the Japanese had dropped all pretence of concealment ancl were openly working what rem'aincd of the trochus shell grounds along the Barrier Keel. It was probable that no patrol boat at all would be necessary after the end of this year, by which time practically the whole of the trochus shell on the Barrier Reef would have been removed. Some of the shell from the reef had been transplanted in the waters of the Japanese mandated islands, which would mean that by the time the Australian industry had been exterminated tlie Japanese grounds would be ready for working. Most of the sampans which were now operating on the reef, he added, were much bigger bouts than those which had first com'; there. Some of them were able to remain on the reef for months at a time withc.ut revisiting their bases for oil and stores and their object -in coining into territorial waters and o=Ual>llr. Francis. lishing camps on islands or on the mainland was, no doubt, to give their crews the opportunity of a rest and relaxation before going back to the Barrier Reef. the honourable member was in the Cabinet, yet he did nothing about it. ber of the Cabinet approval was given for the purchase and commissioning of patrol boats, and I am now asking that the work which I began should be finished. Already this matter has been too long delayed. The patrol boat that is being provided by the Defence Department was put underway when I was Assistant Minister. I appeal to the Minister to stand behind his officers, and provide them with the means to do their job. I have masses of evidence from press reports which I could produce if necessary, to prove the presence of Japanese sampans on the reef and to indicate the damage they arc doing. I urge the Government to take action immediately, so that, before Parliament re-assembles, the patrol boats may be in commission. Means should be devised by which the Customs Department can exercise a check over motor vehicles imported into Australia to ensure that only those that aTe .safe to handle are admitted. At the present time, there are a_great many new motor cars on the road that are positive death traps because of faulty mechanical construction. Numerous instances of the kind have been brought to my notice, but I shall content myself for the time being with reciting my own personal experience. Recently, I bought a new Ford V8 motor car, and set off with my wife and family for the South Coast. It was only by sheer luck that we were not brought home on stretchers. There weTe three major mechanical defects in the car which rendered it unsafe. In the first place, the windscreen wiper was either an old one or was defective, and would not work. Then the gear box was defective, so that the car was apt to jump out of geaY into neutral on an incline, and, finally, the brakes were defective. On the journey of which I speak it began to rain heavily before I reached Bulli Pass, so that, with the defective wind-screen wiper, it was impossible for me to see, and I was driv-",19,Chairman Order The With The Machinery At Our Disposal Said Dr

Then, when I reached the incline at Bulli Pass, the gears went into traffic superintendent in New South neutral of their own accord, and the car plunged down the steep grade. I applied the brakes, and, fortunately, they acted sufficiently for me to obtain control of the vehicle, though afterwards, when 1 had the car examined, it was found that the brake on one wheel was not acting at all. The brake drum was ful l of oil, and pieces of the brake lining could be plucked off the brake band with the fingers. Had the car been in the hands of a nervous or inexperienced driver at the time it is probable that a fatal acciwould not be able to sell them. We dent would have occurred. Traffic authorities, as we know, are gravely consystem of laissez-faire, manufacturers cerned at the pTesent time over the number of road accidents, and it is usual to attribute such accidents to careless or reckless driving. I hold no brief for the man who drives recklessly. I believe that IUB licence should be cancelled, and that he should be prevented from driving again, but a great many road accidents are due, not to careless driving, but to mechanical defects for which the manufacturers of the cars are responsible. One on the road. most fruitfu l cause of accidents is skidding, the result usually of defective brakes. The law requires that the driver shall keep his brakes in good order, but car. the driver does not expect that the brakes on a new car should require attention. In my own case, I have treated the brakes with every consideration during the time. I have been driving a car, and I always make a practice of descending steep hills in second gear so as to take the strain off the brakes. In order to exercise proper control, it would probably be necessary to obtain the co-operation of the State authorities, but something could be done, I am sure, through the Customs Department to ensure that only those cars which measure up to a certain standard of mechanical safety shall bo admitted to the country. The trouble is that the manufacturers are so anxious to speed up production and to make profits, that they do not take the proper precautions to ensure that the vehicles they make aTe safe. We read that in some instances the iron ore is taken out of the company who sold him the car. ships at 8 o'clock in the morning to be used in the manufacture of cars which are driven away from the factory the following evening. Recently, I discussed the subject of road accidents with the Wales, and he mentioned that, in most cases, accidents occurred to drivers who, up to the time of the accident, had had good records extending over a number of years. I am certain that, in a great many cases, the fault is due, not to the drivers, but to mechanical defects in their cars. When I brought this matter up about nine months, ago in the House, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) tried to answer me by saying that if manufacturers made defective cars they know, however, that under the economic will always take a risk for the sake of profit. In the car which I bought, the electrical system was also faulty, and there were rusty bolts which broke off when they were touched, but at the moment I am more concerned about those defects which made for danger on the road. the agents before they are allowed to go a very poor tester who did the job on my ber would have cause for action against the company which sold him the car. the company are not particularly the concern of this Parliament, but the safety of the public is. As a matter of fact, I have letters from the company admitting that, the gears were faidty, and would not operate properly. The point I am making is not whether the company should or should not rectify the fault in the car, but that a check should be. exercised by the Customs Department to prevent the importation into Australia of faulty motor cars which, when placed on the roads, constitute a danger, not only to the persons who drive them, but also to every other road user. ber should have sought redress with the tion of redress.

I now ask him to confine his remarks. made my point long ago but-for the constant interjections. If I may continue I wish to say that the question of redress does not arise. The point I make is that a check should be exercised by the Customs Department to prevent the importation of faulty motor vehicles, which, as I have said, constitute a danger not only to those who use them, but also to every person travelling on the roads. Trade and Customs) [4.5] -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has referred to the increased expenditure of the Customs Department. As a former Minister for Trade and 'CustomsI think the honourable member will agree that some extra expense is warranted in view of the increased burden of work imposed upon that department within the last few years. Of the £26,000 representing the increased vote for that department, £3,000 is for automatic increments payable to officers, £8,200 for adjustments in cost of living allowances, £6,738 for new positions considered essential in the central office and in all the States, £4,618 for salary restorations under the Financial Relief Act, and £7,324 for general expenses in vespect of the central office and the offices in all States. There is no time to examine the figures further than to say that, comparing administrative expenses with the revenue collected by the department, the increase is very slight. During the last financial year the revenue collected was £37,850,000, and the increased administrative cost this year shows a rise from 1.62 per cent, to 1.72 per cent, of the revenue collected. In 1901, at the inception of federation, the cost of administration was 3.42 per cent., of the revenue collected, and was thus nearly three times as great as it is> at present. then it has been nearly as high. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also referred to the position of officers engaged in out-stations. As I informed him in reply to a similar complaint last year, the senior officers of the Trade and Customs Department, particularly the Comptroller-General, have accompanied me to various States and there have been many cases in which officers, because of their ability, have been moved to other positions. Every officer in the department has a right to apply to the Collector in his State forany position which becomes vacant in the department. In regard to Tariff Board reports I feel sure that the honourable member will not be disappointed to-morrow when some further reports will be tabled. It may even be possible he will receive a surprise to-day. Regarding the retirement of Mr Forster from the Tariff Board, the facts are that he did not desire to be reappointed, aa he proposed to engage in private business. views were not in accordance with those of the Government? Mr Forster is an engineer and a manufacturer, who, for some time, has occupied the position of secretary to the Standards Association. Of all the applicants who applied, he was the best qualified for appointment. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) inquired about a launch that was to be built, and quoted reports from the press regarding the activities of poachers-in our northern waters. I was successful in getting the Government to agree to the building of three launches for the use of the Departments of Defence, Interior, and Trade and Customs. The first launch to be supplied is to be used by the Defence Department -in patrolling the Timor Sea. For this purpose a fast launch, capable of maintaining a speed of at least 20 knots, is required. When the Defence launch arrives it will be inspected at the Cockatoo Dockyard and elsewhere to see if it is possible to construct similar launches in Australia.

63,A Memorandum Showing Mr White,"Whil e the honorableto provide a convenient avenue for expressing the level of the duties which the Government is prepared to accord to those countries with which it succeeds in concluding satisfactory treaties. When introducing the Customs Tariff Proposals on the 6th December last, I stated with regard to the general tariff, that the Government had adopted a rate which was generally midway between the Tariff Board's "" A "" finding for the present exchange conditions and its "" B "" finding for conditions that should apply when the exchange rate between Australia and the United Kingdom is normal. I also stated at that time that the Government wished to be in a position to negotiate with foreign countries in respect of those items and that its decision was based on the principle of having something to give to those who treat us well and something to withhold from those who treat us badly. Speaking generally, the rates of duty appearing in the intermediate column of the schedule now submitted conform to the findings of the Tariff Board, and accord to Australian, producers and manufacturers the measure of protection deemed necessary and desirable by the Tariff Board. In every instance the margin of preference which the Commonwealth is obliged to preserve in favour of the United Kingdom by reason of the Ottawa agreement has been maintained. I emphasize that the rates proposed under the intermediate tariff will not operate immediately. The object of inserting them at this stage is to facilitate current treaty negotiations, and; particularly the drafting of any treaties that may be arranged. an intermediate tariff it would be necessary to adopt some less flexible and satisPapua and New Guinea Preference Tariff factory means of expressing any tariff commitments which the Commonwealth is prepared to accept under treaties such as the introduction of special bills as has been done in tlie case of Canada and New Zealand.

The report on oregon cannot be tabled because negotiations which were proceeding with another dominion in regard to this item were interrupted by an election, and tlie time is not yet ripe for the re-opening of them. The Excise Tariff Proposals No. 4 will be found attached to the Customs Tariff Schedule on pages S3 and S4. They incorporate the amendments made by proposals of the 6th December, 1934,. the 2Sth March, and the 23rd September, 1935. The only new provision is in Item 19 which imposes a duty of 2s. each on wireless valves. This carries out the intention of the Scullin Government-as stated when the existing revenue duty under the Customs tariff on wireless valves was introduced in 1931-to impose an excise duty when the Australian industry was fully established. The main purpose of the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Proposals No. 3 is to eliminate from the operation of the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 1933-34 those items and parts of items for which provision for exchange fluctuations is now made in the items themselves. The Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Proposals No. 2 provide the necessary adjustment of duties on certain Canadian goods consequent upon the alterations of duties under the ordinary customs tariff. The principal objeet of the Customs Tariff (Papua and New Guinea Preference) Proposals is to remove a minor anomaly which has long existed in the In the absence of tariff relations of the Commonwealth and the territories under its jurisdiction. The of 1934 specifies certain products of the territory of Papua and the mandated territory of New Guinea which shall be admitted into the Commonwealth free of duty and embraces all the major products of those territories; but from time to time small quantities of other commodities are sent to Australia.

69,Mr White,"We have heard tlieh i Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from page 2043. Proposed vote, £116,6S0. I have in my electorate an important organization which has operated during the last few years for the purpose of bringing under the notice of the proper authorities the necessity for an impartial investigation of the claims of a gentleman named Mr C. J. Barnes regarding his cure for pulmonary tuberculosis. Mr forced to recognize the value of her work. Barnes, together with a number of other interested persons, has made frequent attempts during the last few years to convince the health authorities, both State and Federal, that his claims should be fully examined and steps taken to prove beyond doubt, whether the treatment he advocates for attacking this awful disease, will produce the results claimed to have been obtained by him. It is extremely unfortunate that there is a tendency in Australia totally to disregard claims made for the cure of any disease, particularly if made by a layman or one who happens to be not a member of the British Medical Association. I urge that the officers .of the Department of Health should not be influenced by the high handed action of this association. order to establish my case, I shall refer, at the outset, to definite and candid statements made by Mr Weaver, the ex-Minister for Health in New South Wales, who, speaking of his intention to make arrangements whereby persons could attend hospitals for a medical examination at a fee ranging from 30s. to £5 5s., saidTlie moment I said that was my intention, the medical fraternity, through the British Medical Association, immediately notified the doctors we were going to engage that, if they attempted for 30s. to £5 5s. to give people an Surely it cannot be said that we are askax.'unina.tion which would ordinarily cost 18 guineas to 30 guineas-, they would be ostracised and probably excluded from tlie British Medical Association. I suggest that, if the department refuses to recognize ihe justice of the claim for an impartial investigation of Mr Barnes' claims, I can only arrive at the same conclusion as did Mr Weaver, and say that the strength of the British Medical Association is too great to permit of a private person having an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of his treatment. OF HEALTH. A notable example of the success of lay persons in the treatment of disease is provided by the work of Sister Kenny. The claim that she could cure infantile paralysis was at first ridiculed, and efforts were made to lead the public to believe that her methods weve not in accord with medical practice. Yet, by sheer persistence, public interest in the matter was finally aroused, and the Government was I am fully aware of the danger of heeding the false claims that are advanced from time to time regarding cures effected; but I consider the time now opportune to sift Mr Barnes' claims fully. With all due deference to the medical profession, I suggest that it behoves the health authorities to give the most careful consideration to matters which affect the health of the people. Treatment given by laymen has sometimes proved successful where members of the medical profession have failed. Mr Fitzsimons, the Minister for Health in New South Wales, recently received a letter from a man in a country district, who had been experimenting for some years regarding the treatment of cancer In in stock, and Dr. Morris, the Director General of Public Health in that State, recommended an immediate investigation of the results of the work. It was pointed out that, although the experimenter -was not a medical man, impoTtant discoveries had been made by laymen in the past. If it is desirable to examine the claims of an experimenter in the treatment of cancer in stock, of how much greater importance is it to investigate the claims of a layman regarding the cure of the dread disease of tuberculosis? ing too much when we demand a full inquiry into the claims advanced by Mr Barnes. It may be contended that this is a matter which should be investigated by the State authorities, but I suggest that this Parliament cannot so easily wash its hands of the subject. It is as important for this Parliament to give consideration to the cure of tuberculosis as it is to concern itself with the treat-",113,Excise Duties Continued
70,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.33].,"ment of infantile paralysis by Sister Kenny, or witb efforts in regard to infantile mortality. The health authorities in New South Wales appear to be Teluctant to treat the claims of Mr Barnes seriously, and the opinion is held that their attitude is due to the influence of the British Medical Association. Therefore, I urge the Commonwealth health authorities to make the necessary investigations, or cause the State health authorities to change their present attitude of apparent indilference. The ex-Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) recently made certain inquiries from t h i Department of Health in New South Wales, and forwarded particulars which I had furnished to the Director-General of Health regarding the Barnes case. The reply received from the Director General, however, is anything but satisfactory. He offers a number of criticisms, and questions, for instance, the nature of the medicines prescribed, the methods of treatment, &c, but Mr Barnes has submitted a complete answer to those criticisms and has also offered his methods of treatment as a gift to the nation. I suggest that this method of dealing with such an important problem as the cure of tuberculosis will not produce a satisfactory conclusion. The matter has been left in an atmosphere of extreme doubt, and I urge the Department of Health to have it fully investigated. It has been placed before the health authorities in New South Wales on many occasions, but no real progress has been made. In January, 1930, Mr Barnes requested Dr. Baret, the Director-General of the Tuberculosis Division of the Health Department of New South Wales, to select a number of cases to.be placed under his charge at one of the government institutions. This request arose out of a petition from 52 inmates of the Bodingtpn Sanatorium, who begged the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bavin, to utilize any medical services available for the treatment of their complaint. They stated that at the sanatorium the only treatment given for "" T.B."" cases was fresh air and food. The offer made was that Mr Barnes should proceed to Bodington and give a demonstration at his own expense, that the department should be handed the necessary data, prescription, &c, and that Dr. Baret should guarantee personally to administer and supervise the treatment and issue weekly or triweekly bulletins. Dr. Baret stated that the offer could not be accepted. During the last five years, many efforts have been made by representative bodies in Balmain to have the claims of Mr Barnes investigated, but the unseen hand of some powerful organization has always prevented tangible results being obtained. The interested organization in Balmain is most desirous of co-operating with the health authorities. Mr Barnes claims that many chronic cases have been cured and restored to normal health under his treatment. The scourge of tuberculosis still remains one of the diseases that are unconque'red by science, and, therefoi'e, those who are afflicted by this awful complaint anxiously await the day when the brain of man, whether layman or doctor, will conceive some method of successful treatment. I submit that this matter is so urgent, and of such national importance, that the Government should be made aware of the fact that Mr Barnes maintains that he can cure tuberculosis, and that he can produce living testimony to that fact. I have interviewed some of his patients, and they do not hesitate to declare that they have greatly improved through being under his treatment. I have also in my possession letters from individuals, who speak in glowing terms of the results of the treatment, and of their improvement in health after following Mr Barnes' instructions. In Balmain and the surrounding districts, a body has been formed known as the Citizens Tuberculosis Association, with the object of securing recognition by the health authorities of the remarkable results obtained by Mr Barnes in his methods of treating pulmonary tuberculosis and kindred diseases. The association merely desires that the Department of Health should take such steps as are necessary to probe the claims fully, and to decide beyond doubt as to the genuineness of the cures and the methods of treatment. This matter should not be lightly brushed aside. Those who enjoy reasonably good health cannot possibly appreciate the anxiety and suffering of those who are afflicted by the scourge of tuberculosis. I have made it clear, I think, that the claims advanced should at least be carefully investigated. The Government should indicate that it is willing honestly and sincerely to investigate the claims and I ask the Minister for Health to instruct the Commonwealth Director-General of Health to disregard any influence which Medical Association might have, make his investigations and report whether the claims made are bona fide or not. minor importance which the Department of Health occupies in the eyes of this Government and governments generally is lionorable members will be allowed to consider the proposed vote for the department for only 30 minutes, which is the shortest space of time allowed for the discussion of any of the departmental Estimates. support for the contention that the administration of health measures is one of the most important functions of any government. The time is long overdue for a change in the view that health should be regarded as merely a matter for the individual. Thati t is of importance to the Government and the nation as a whole is shown by the fact that this year 'in Australia more than 76,000 persons will be drawing the invalid pension. period allotted for the discussion of the Health Department is due not to the fact that it is considered to be unimportant but to the fact that it is considered non-contentious. members would have expected from an active and intelligent Government an opportunity to make suggestions for efficient administration in connection with the most important question of health. limit on the discussion of the proposed vote on the Health Department is half an hour will prevent at least 20 members from participating in the discussion. opportunity will be given to honourable members to give adequate consideration to the Health Department. In his classic work, Erewhon, Samuel Butler has written of a hypothetical community in which ill-health is a punishable criminal offence. There is a lot of substance behind the point which he has made. There can be no question that a person in ill-health eventually becomes a burden on the community. Persons who come into contact with the invalids are often endangered and thereby damage may be the British done to the community as a whole. The Government would be well advised to endeavour to improve the general standard of health in the community, and as a first step in that direction it should give consideration to measures of a preventive character. It is not too much to suggest a compulsory medical examinashown by the fact that tion at regular intervals of every citizen of the Commonwealth.

Some time ago I asked the Minister for Defence( Mr Parkhill), on notice, questions regarding the number of volunteers for military service rejected on the ground of physical infirmity. The figures show that 55 per cent, of the volunteers for the permanent military forces were rejected on this ground. Of the applicants for admission to the Royal Military College, the nominations the of 70.6 per cent, were refused for a similar reason. Of the volunteers for the permanent naval forces 45.1 per cent, were rejected, and 43.3 per cent, of those who sought entry to the Royal Australian Naval College were also rejected. Only 3.9 per cent, of volunteers for the militia were refused because of physical unfitness, but the Minister for Defence pointed out that the standard of physical fitness required for those forces was very much lower than in the other cases. Two conclusions are to be drawn from exam-' ination of these figures. The first is that the physical fitness of what should be the healthiest body of Australians is very much lower than it should be in a young and allegedly healthy country. The second conclusion is that while the standard of health required for admission to the militia remains very much lower than for the permanent military and naval forces, an opportunity is presented",114,Depaiitjijsnt

' I wish the same could be said It is obvious that in about tjhe discovery of processes for the improvement of health in the community. But I should object to the Commonwealth Diredtor-General of Health (Dr. Cumpston) being appointed to carry out the investigations suggested 'by the honourable niem'ber for West Sydney. His 'history shows that he is not fitted for the task. When he was definitely asked to investigate the Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis in Switzerland, he neglected to do has been taken by the so. He went the wrong way about the job. When he found that Dr. Spahlinger was not in the neighbourhood in which he himself was located, he failed to telephone, write a letter, send a telegram, or in any other way seek an .appointment with that gentleman. Possibly, if the Spahlinger treatment had been introduced in Australia aniany years ago, tuberculosis in oattle in this country would have been eliminated. I contend, therefore, that there iar© in the Health Department -better men than the Director-General to do the work of investigation whioh has been suggested. I wish 'to express regret at the departure from Cabinet of the right honourable member for North .Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was undoubtedly one of itjhe best administrators of the Health Department am the history of the Commonwealth. His establishment of the Jubilee Meraiorial Fund for maternal and imfant welfare shows how valuable his services were to the country in his capacity as Minister for Health.

The publication of the work marks a new step in the policy of the Health Department, which previously had contented itself with the preparation of a volume that doubtless was welcomed by the medical profession, but was far above the heads of -the general community. The Health Department would be well advised to take a lead from the great insurance companies whioh recognize that prolongation of life is essential to good business. These companies spend tJhousands of pounds a year in advertising in various periodicals, especially tlie National Geographic Magazine. That publication each month contains a f u l l page advertisement, inserted by insurance people at very great expense, which gives advice on health matters and issues warnings against disease. The Health Department could contribute to the 'better health of the community by issuing brochures aimed at improving the health standards of the nation.

The members of my party believe that expenditure in this direction would be of considerable value to the community at large, and that films should be made available to State Departments of Education and other education authorities There is in existence in Victoria a body known as The Children's Cinema Council of Victoria. It consists of very prominent, earnest men and women, who strongly desire that the Federal Government shall make it possible for the Departments of Education of the States to derive advantage from films that are in the possession of the Commonwealth under the control of the Department of Commerce. In making this request I point out that such institutions exist in other countries, particular attention now being paid to their development in English-speaking countries. Activities of this kind are being developed in the majorit y of European countries, and Australia should not be allowed to lag behind them. Such expenditure would assist those who feel that so f a r sufficient has not been done. It may he asked why it should be necessary for the Commonwealth to interest itself in such a matter. Obviously, the scope of the matter is too broad for the States to handle separately, and in the event of their doing so, considerable overlapping and probable confusion would result. I advocate the establishment of a central bureau controlled and developed by the Commonwealth Government. I understand that the Department of Commerce has a number of films of educational value which could be made available to the Education Departments of the States for exhibition to children during school hours. Other suitable films companies and other sources, with the result that all subjects of educational value would be exhibited in the schools. It is well known that some parents w ill not allow their children to attend motion picture theatres. Although prejudice may be the guiding motive in a number of cases, there is a strong feeling that some of the films exhibited at I urge consideration of the many theatres are such that their screening should not be witnessed by children of tender years. I do not necessarily subscribe to that view; but I know that some parents in the neighbourhood of my home keep their children away from picture theatres because crime is, to a certain extent, glorified, and scenes of violence are depicted which they feel that their children should not witness. All programmes probably contain desirable items of educational value; but in order to cater for different tastes, features that are regarded by some persons as objectionable, are also included in them-for example, sex problems. These persons would welcome the opportunity for their children to witness the screening of pictures designed to promote educational purposes. I shall quote data that I have gathered to show what is being done in other countries. During the years 1929 to 1932, a commission on educational and cultural films investigated the matter in Great Britain, and in 1932 submitted a comprehensive and an illuminating report entitled TheF i l m in NationalL if e . I commend that report to any honourable member who is interested in visual education; it may be obtained from the Parliamentarv Library. Those who made the investigation were most, representative; I doubt whether it would be possible to secure a more representative body. They performed the task voluntarily, because they considered that something of the kind had to be done. When a man of such eminence as Sir Benjamin Gott,",118,Depaiitjijsnt
79,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"M.A., Middlesex, and other high educational authorities, undertake a task of this nature in an honorary capacity, considerable respect must be paid to their recommendations. In chapter 5, the report statesThe comniission has not been concerned merely with a sectional or a scholastic issue, but with the future of cinematography as a cultural influence whose power we do not yet know. It is, as we have said, a new medium which we may turn to our service, but which may easily be turned to our disservice. Even with children the needs of the school are not only the needs of tlie classroom-the y would bo simpler if they were. For a generation of lilm-going children is learning to pick up points and impressions on the screen very quicklyhow quickly and how permanently we do not yet know. Their rcccptivcness and their power of association are being trained; anil this training is possibly nbt the least of the services which the new medium may renderif the material is right. It is as important to train their taste in films as in music; from the social point of view, more important. "" W c cannot provide our children with a better equipment than a strong dislike of the inferior and the common-place even in this sphere."" The taste of the next generation is largely formed at school; tlierefore, the school cannot afford to neglect so important a factor as the film in the education of a generation which goes regularly and naturally to the cinema.

"" The function of the carefully planned sound film will be to present the material of the lesson, whether in geography or science or mathematics or any other subject, in the most perfect form that tlie best teacher can devise. Wc envisage the ultimate use of sound films, not merely as an illustrative medium, although we recognize their great value in this respect, but also as an actual teaching medium."" Here again is a suggestion which should be tested i in mediately by the production and use in schools of experimental films. I emphasize w h a t f o l l o w s : ""The outstanding need appears to be for some organization to undertake the establishment of adequate machinery to bring producers on the one hand, and teachers on the other, into contact with each other, so that films carefully adjusted to the syllabuses of the schools can bo produced."" Mr Drakeford. ex-Secretary for Education, I should have appreciated an opportunity to place on record in greater detail the valuable data which is available in support of this reasonable request, the granting of which would confer a lasting benefit on the people and the future generation, of Australia.. It is necessary for me to deal with the matter rapidly, because other honourable members wish to speak to the proposed vote. I offer no apology to those honourable members who, by voting for the application of the guillotine, are responsible for only half an hour being devoted to this department. The findings of the commission, which are to be found at page 155, read as follows:Wc therefore have the honour to recommendThat a national film institute be set up in Groat Britain financed in part by public funds and incorporated under Royal Charter. We have considered the organization and establishment which would be needed for an institute with public status. We recommend(L) that a board of governors be appointed by the Government; that they be seven in number; and that their term of office be for five years and renewable; (2) that it be the duty of tlie governing body to set up an advisory council, including representatives of learned and scientific societies, educational associations and education authorities and of the film industry, together with persons nominated by government departments concerned, or individually co-opted, and representaI n another chapter the tives of the self-governing dominions and of India appointed by the governments concerned; (3) that the duties and powers of the advisory council include advice and assistance to the permanent staff in carrying out the work of the institute, together with power to submit to the governing body suggestions for new activities. Those are only three of the recommendations, and they are very much in line with the wishes of the Children's Cinema Council of Victoria. I also direct the attention of honourable members to a table at page 174, which gives a schedule of activities of film institutes in various countries. The countries dealt with number thirteen, in seven of which-Austria, Erance, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, and Japan-the institutes are State bodies. In Japan there is also a private institution. That proves that already the need for such an organization is being edited by Lord Eustace Percy, M.P., recognized abroad, and the time is overformerly president of the Board of due when something of the same sort Education in England:should be done here. Dr. has provided £2,700 more for this work this year than was devoted to it last year. hear that, ancl I would appreciate the personal interest and help of the Minister. Time will prevent me from dealing further with that schedule, which shows the advances made in other countries. I propose now to quote from a recent issue of a valuable magazine called School Life, the official organ of the Office of Education in the United States Department of the In t e r i o r . The extract is as f o l l o w s : which shows what is being done at the Under tlie able leadership of Dr. George V.

Secondly, it may be noted that the The growing interest which is apparent at the present time among teachers in the vast inventions, such as films, wireless, gramophones, epidiascopes and similar apparatus, is a sign of the times. Wc live iu an age of mechanical devices, and inevitably the technique of teaching is being more and more affected by the gradual introduction of machines into the schools. Such changes can and must bo effected without any loss of the vitally important personal clement in education. The teacher w ill always remain of paramount importance, and his scholarship and skill w ill be not less, but more essential, in a system of education which takes f u l l advantage of modern scientific inventions.

I emphasize the point that there is a very earnest body of qualified men and women giving generously of their time and interest who feel that the Government should commence at once the establishment of a film institute. Amongst them are many prominent people in the educational and civic life of the community. The functions of such an institute would be(a) To act as a clearing house for information on all matters affecting films at home or abroad; (6) To influence public opinion to appreciate the value of films as entertainment and instruction; (c) To advise educational and other institutions on the supply, use, and exhibition of films; (d) To act as a means of liaison between tliu trade and cultural and educational interests; (e) To undertake research into the various uses of the film and of allied visual and auditory apparatus; (/) To maintain a national repository of films of permanent value; (y) To catalogue education;! 1 and cultural films: (ft) To give advice to government departments concerned with films; (i) To certify films as educational, cultural, or scientific. The establishment of a Commonwealth educational film bureau or institute could be brought about by the following means:1. Tlie creation of a visual education bureau subsidized by the Commonwealth Government and controlled by representatives of each State and the Commonwealth. 2. The office of the library could with advantage be located at the Commonwealth Cinema Branch, Melbourne, and use made of cinema facilities, projection room, and office staff, thus saving considerable expense. 3. During the first twelve months, the aim would be to build up a substantial library. An amount of not less than £3,000 should be Mr Drakeford. sufficient to make a start. The children's cinema council would recommend that(1) A secretary would be necessary but during the first twelve months, a part-time officer should be sufficient; (2) When films have been secured, and the necessary copies made, sub-libraries should be opened in each State under the direction of the State representaI propose that tive on the council. States could draw their supplies of films from the central federal library, thus saving unnecessary delay and cost of transport ; (3) A largo number of films would be obtainable free of charge, and while many others could be obtained in exchange for Australian films, other suitable films could be purchased from private sources; (4) Australian films couid lie exchanged for films of overseas subjects and that for this purpose, the Commonwealth Government could make necessary Australian films available free of charge as the publicity value to tbe Commonwealtli in having such films distributed through educational institutions abroad, would oJfset the eost involved; (5) That when such a library has been obtained, a full-time secretary would be necessary together with typistclerk and possibly a film examiner. The secretary could prepare the synopsis for new Australian films or alterations to existing .films and would confer with the cinema branch technical officers regarding the preparation of new films or alteration to existing pictures; (0) Tbati t sliould not be necessary for the council to meet more than annually and meetings should be held in each State iu turn. This should ensure the interest of the SLnte3 and enable the committee to gain an insight into local requirements; (7) Summarized briefly, the necessary action to launch the scheme is(a) Commonwealth Government to approve of the scheme and provide funds, to a limited amount; (6) Council to be formed; (o) Acting secretary to be appointed; (d) Cinema branch to provide typist, office and storage accommodation: (e) State committees to be formed to work out methods of distribution and showing of films in each State. Much more might be said in support of this proposal, but I do not propose to take up the full time, because I desire to afford an opportunity to the Minister to indicate his approval of the scheme, and to say what the Government proposes to do in order to put it into operation. Those who are interesting themselves in this matter are responsible persons who hold no particular political views, but realize its importance, and feel keenly the fact that Australia is lagging behind other countries to the detriment of our children. Government to give the matter its most earnest and favorable consideration. desire to protest against the iniquitous practice which still persists in regard to the sale of wool whereby a draft allowance amounting to 1 lb. in every 112 lb. is „ deducted on all wool sold. This practice dates back to the time when scales were clumsy and inefficient instruCommerce has expired. ments, but to-day exact weighing machines are available in all wool stores, and there is no longer any justification for it. The wool-growers through their organization, and the wool-brokers in Australia and overseas, have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the practice, and the Committee of Enquiry, wool industry in 1932, recommended that the Commonwealth Parliament should legislate, to put an end to it. According to the Commonwealth Year-Booh, the value of the Australian wool clip for 1933-34, the latest year for which figures are available, was £64,400,000, and the draft allowance deducted from the value of the wool amounted to £561,000. figures alone afford sufficient proof of the necessity for taking action to put an end to this pernicious practice. I am not quite sure whether this Parliament possesses authority to legislate in regard to the draft allowance on wool; but, if it does not, I ask the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), as chairman of the Australian Agricultural Council, to place this matter on the agenda-paper for the next meeting of the council for consideration, so that, if necessary, there may be co-ordination of action between the Commonwealth and State Governments. of the draft allowance on wool, as I have mentioned, has been advocated, not only by individual wool growers, but also by such organizations as the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the United Country party of Victoria, on numerous occasions, the Federated Graziers Association of Australia, and the Australian Wool Council. It was inquired into by Mr Devereux, the representative of the wool industry in Loudon, whose salary is I appeal to the partly paid by the Commonwealth, who reported that, as it is impossible to get unanimity amongst wool-buyers in all parts of the world in regard to the desirability of abolishing the allowance, it would be necessary to deal with the matter by legislative action. time allotted for the consideration of the proposed vote for the.

I am of opinion that the Government is not obliged to pay this amount to the Auditor-General on retirement, but that the payment of salary in lieu of furlough may be regarded as an ex gratia payment. The payment of salary in lieu of furlough is governed by section 73 (2) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1934, which reads as follows :When an oiltcer who has continued in the Commonwealth Service for at least twenty years is retiring from the Commonwealth Service, the board may authorize payment to him on retirement of a sum equivalent to the salary for the period of leave not exceeding that which the officer could have been granted under the last preceding sub-section. The last preceding sub-section readsWhen an oflicer has continued in the Commonwealth Service for at least twenty years, the board may grant to him leave of absence for a period not exceeding one month and a half on full salary, or three months on half salary in respect of each completed five years of continuous service; . . . Honourable members will note in the particular sub-sections dealing with this matter the use of the word "" may "", and it appears to be entirely within the discretion of the Government to pay such sums or to withhold them. Mr Cerutty knew full well the provisions of the common with other public servants, he should, on attaining the age of 64 years, have commenced his long-service leave, for which he would have been paid; and it seems strange that this gentleman, who so seriously, severely, and unwarrantedly My amendment affords castigated the pensioners of this country, on the eve of becoming an £8 a week pensioner himself, should not only secure from the Government payment for leave which he should have taken prior to retirement, but after getting that additional twelve months' salary, should also expect to receive further salary in lieu of furlough in addition to a pension amounting, I understand, to £416 per annum. This gentleman who so seriously castigates all others for their administrative acts, is blind to his own shortcomings, and expects the Government to pay him a further twelve months' salary in respect of leave which he should have taken outtwelve months previously, and thus made way for somebody else.

96,Mr Rosevear,"Yes; it seems toseveral matters mentioned therein. I do not know whether it is the practice for the Auditor-General to do so, but the fact that some of his criticism has been levelled at the Treasurer himself seems to indicate that it is not likely that there was any such consultation. Whatever honourable members feel about the criticism of the Auditor-General regarding the manner in which the budget is compiled, I do not think that one member of the committee would seek for a moment to endorse his criticism of the most defenceless section of our community-ou r invalid and old-age pensioners. The Auditor-General has said that our pensioners are, in the main, totally unworthy of the sympathy and support of the Government, and that the vast majority of them are worthless 23eople who did not, during their working life time, make the necessary provision for their old-age. He then went further and sought to assume the authority of the Government itself, for he set down the lines of policy which this and future Governments ought, in his opinion, to follow, giving of the last call the Treasurer was His dabbling with such a subject .as national insurance is, h i my opinion, quite beyond the scope of his duties. It is noticeable and worthy of comment that while this officer devoted one and a half pages of his report to a most unjustifiable criticism of our pensioners, he devoted only one and a half lines of it to a reference to some hundreds of income tax dodgers who, by the submission of fraudulent returns, failed to disclose ingiven to the Treasurer on this occasion, come to the extent of £2,000,000. He also made only a very brief reference to certain other taxpayers who, last year, were in arrears in their payments to an amount of £6,500,000. In these circumstances, his clap-trap about the pensioners is all the more unworthy, unjustifiable and reprehensible. I regret that the brief time allowed for the discussion of these Estimates will make it impossible for honourable members generally to express their view of the report of the Auditor-General in regard to our pensioners, or of his questionable endeavour to obtain £1,53S in respect of long service leave which he should have taken, as many other public officers liave had to do, before the time of his retirement. His effrontery in this [74] connection is all the more objectionable in view of the fact that upon retirement he will enter into the enjoyment of a pension in excess of £8 a week. I therefore invite honourable members who will not have an opportunity to express their opinions on the Auditor-General's conduct in the form of a speech, to do so in the form of a vote iu favour of my amendment. In this way they will be able to indicate, in one act, their total disagreement with the Auditor-General's condemnation of the pensioners as a class, and also with his endeavour to obtain a large amount of money from the Government, to which, in all the circumstances, he has no legal right. Their attitude in regard to both these matters will be indicated by their vote. [5.52] I wish order. While it is the usual practice for the presiding officer to give the call to a Minister who rises to address the committee, I point out that previous to the not in his place in the chamber. In view of the fact that the guillotine has been brought into operation in connection with the consideration of these Estimates, I remind the Chair that if every minister took the opportunity available to him to address the committee, no time would be left to other honourable gentlemen to do so. I ask therefore whether, in view of all these circumstances, the call should be particularly as. he was not present when the previous call was given to a Government supporter?

The honourable gentleman intimated that the Government would make provision for the setting aside of £100,000 this year for the purpose of subsidizing the interest and sinking fund payments of certain local government instrumentalities in respect of expenditure to provide sewerage, water works and other amenities for people living in country towns. The 'brief history behind this decision is interesting. About twelve In defence of my months ago, 'tihe Prime Minister announced that, with tihe object of relieving unemployment, the Government proposed to make funds available to assist various local governing authorities to provide water and sewerage works in provincial cenitr.es, and we all remember that, £1,000,000 for this purpose. The Prime Minister intimated at that time that, while the decision as to the exact works to be put in hand would be left to the State governments, it was desired that the money should be spent in improving the amenities of life in provincial centres, and that it should be expended over as wide a geographical area as possible in each 'State. One of the conditions laid down was that any Commonwealth grant of this kind should be subsidized, £1 for £1 by either the State Government or a local governing body. In pursuance of this policy, schedules of works were submitted by the authorities concerned. Arrangements were made, for example, for works to be undertaken in nine money provided locally for these works was to be subsidized to itJhe extent of one third by the Commonwealth .and one third by the Government of New 'South Wales. Arrangements were also made foT sewerage facilities to be provided at Shepparton, Benalla, Kerang and Bairnsdale in Victoria. Unfortunately, catastrophicfloodsoccurred in certain parts of the State about that time, with the result that the Government of Victoria found it necessary to place the necessary repair works at the head of the schedule of works submitted to the Commonwealth for approval. Expenditure oh sewerage works had therefore to be placed lower on the schedule. That order of preference being observed",125,Vices £1 199 460 Refunds Of Revenue

104,Mr Mcewen (Echuca) [5.56],"Iby the Government of Victoria and acquiesced in by tbe Commonwealth Government, the whole of the Commonwealth subsidy, amounting to £225,000 in the case of Victoria, was used for the relief of those suffering from flood damage. The relief was not spread over a wide area as desired by the Commonwealth Government, but was given only in the south-eastern corner of Victoria. Those are the circumstances which precluded four towns in that State receiving assistance from the Commonwealth and State governments similar to that given to towns in New South Wales. For instance, I believe that Corowa received a subsidy from the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments, of not less than two-thirds of the estimated cost of its sewerage works. The Government, 1 think, should have regarded the grant given to Victoria as something in tlie nature of a special emergency grant, for, undoubtedly, the wide-spread floods experienced there were a national calamity. The country -towns of Victoria were led to believe that they would receive a Commonwealth subsidy, and they should not be denied the assistance expected by them. If effect is given to the policy, which the Lyons), during the last election camTreasurer is now applying, of endeavouring to make an arrangement between the State and Commonwealth governments to subsidize interest arid sinking fund payments on loans raised by local authorities for these undertakings, I believe that he will agree that the towns which have undertaken preliminary surveys, and are now ready to begin the sewerage works, should not be debarred from participation in the arrangement. themselves and the governments of the agreement on a joint scheme, so that the States. that the fact that they may have already begun the work will not prevent the Comnotice that an amount of £5,000 is promonwealth Government from giving them vided for.

It is incongruous that the City of Canberra should be marred by an unsightly railway station, when, strange as it may seem, ihe federal portion of the railway to the capital shows a' surplus of revenue over expenditure. There are several honourable members in this Parliament with civic experience who have watched with interest and admired the civic growth of the City of Canberra. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the Commonwealth, but it has probably one of the worse railway stations in the whole of Australia. I recently received from a friend in London an article which appeared in the London press. In it the writer referred to the "" woopwoopian"" appearance of the Canberra railway station. to be like a one-man station away in the back-blocks of Australia. I do not suggest that the Government should spend a large sum on replacing the existing station, but it is at the f r o n t door of Canberra, and first impressions mean a great deal. ployment relief money could very well be diverted to building an ornate structure consonant with the potentialities of Lyons, J.

Since the 1st July last, several McBride, P. A. M. hundred employees have been dismissed Gullett, Sir Henryf r o m the Postal Department. The dismissals came as a shock to the men who, by reason of the report that the department had made a handsome profit, had reason to believe that their positions were votes COMMONWEALTH safe. The Postal Department is a profitable concern, and last year the revenue considerably exceeded expenditure. I I think that the Minister will agree that the public had reason to believe that the works programme of the Postal Department would not be interrupted at least unti l the end of this year. I have been concerned in several deputations protesting against the dismissals. The Victorian section of the department has suffered severely, but I daresay that, on a percentage basis, other States have been similarly affected. More than 200 dismissals have occurred in the Victorian section in the last two or three months, and the men concerned were employed mainly about Melbourne. FiguresI have received from the various industrial organizations covering the dismissed men make it appear that the number of dismissals is considerably larger than I have previously stated. However, to make sure of my position before I raised the matter, It seemed to bim I last week questioned the Minister representing the Postmaster General, and received the reply that since the 1st July last 158 linemen and 50 mechanics had been dismissed in Victoria alone, the reinstatements numbering only two.

116,"Parkhill, Archdale Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports)","rt-aited upon me and other honourable members, and when .the Minister was asked how many of those dismissed were returned soldiers the answer was "" 153 linemen and about 30 mechanics ""'. To show how difficult it is to get'anything done-and there must be something wrong with the administration of tbe department to cause the difficulty-the only result of my endeavours to have the notices of dismissal postponed was that the notices given to three married returned soldiers in South Melbourne were cancelled, and other notices were issued to single returned soldiers. A single returned soldier in these days must be either middle-aged or elderly, and is probably equal to those of the married man, by assisting to maintain relatives. Consequently, I was rather sorry that I had made the overtures; although I agree that where preference is given, it should be enjoyed by the married man, some single men, because of their responsibilities be classified as married men. I ask the Minister whether, in view of the approach of Christmas, he cannot secure the reinstatement of some at least, if not all, of these men. The majority of them were out of work last year, and honourable members of all parties did everything possible to have them placed in employment. Linemen and mechanics all over the Commonwealth had been out of a regular engagement for lengthy periods, and had had only a few weeks' casual work periodically. We agitated to have them re-engaged in connection with something like a planned works programme, so that they would have at least six or seven months' regular work. In the early part of this year we were advised that there would be no dismissals during the year; yet, 20S men have been dismissed in Victoria alone. They cannot understand the reason for their dismissal, because the department has made a profit on its operations. All the evidence that I have been able to collect goes to show that it is not because there is no work to be done, or that the foremen in charge of the various branches do not desire to push on with the works programme. The only conclusion left is that funds have been withdrawn. Mr Jiolloipay. that should be the case, when there is an insistent demand for postal services throughout Australia, particularly in country districts. In the Gippsland district of Victoria alone, for miles on end the telegraph and telephone lines are a danger to the people who drive through the district. The poles are eaten away, and are on the verge of collapse whenever a wind of more than ordinary strength is experienced. Gangs are sent out from time to time for a few weeks to patch up the worse places. There is plenty of work for linemen. It cannot be contended that any services provided are unprofitable, because all the work undertaken leaves behind it an asset. The mechanics shouldering' responsibilities who are employed in the department's workshops are highly-trained men. During the last year or two, probably because of the withdrawal of funds and the deflationary process put into operation by this Government and other governments, a sufficient number of juveniles has not been trained. The highly-skilled artisans in tlie department will be lost to it if to dependants, should they are not given work to do. There is no excess of trained juveniles. A programme has been partly drawn up. and could be put in operation if the necessary funds were provided. The only other reason that can be assigned for the failure to provide necessary services is that there is a shortage of some of the material used in the workshops. That is a matter of management. There should be no shortage of material in these times when there is not half enough demand for the output of every industry in the country, and manufacturers are almost on their knees begging for purchasers of their surplus stocks. I urge the Minister to do his utmost to have the dismissed men reinstated. South Melbourne happens to be the district in which the Postal Department has one of its principal garages. This particular garage is an old ramshackle building, standing upon piles 100 years old that were taken out of the original Princes Bridge, and, where eaten away, have been patched up. TJnder-carriages of drums filled with cement are used to keep the roof from falling in. Two or three years ago, when a member of the Royal Family visited Australia and an I cannot understand why air pageant was held in Melbourne, one of tlie aeroplanes fell on the roof of this building, broke through it, and set the structure on fire. The damage done was merely patched up. At some period of every 24 hours this garage houses between £50,000 and £60,000 worth of motor vehicles. They are crammed into the building in such a way that there is not room to pass between them. No provision is made for the men's clothes, and there is no decent lavatory accommodation. I am. particularly concerned about the matter because, in common with others, I take a keen interest in our public departments. The staff which works at this garage is the envy of a wide circle of people, and the vehicles that they drive are much better in appearance than any others seen on the roads. drivers of the machines are the most competent in this country, one reason being that they constantly compete for medals, badges, or stripes for efficiency on the road and inside the garage. But their enthusiasm, which should be maintained at the highest pitch, is being killed. The garage houses 90 vehicles, their average value being about £1,000 each. If a driver runs his vehicle on the roads for a certain period without denting or scratching it, he is given a medal. These men have been employed there for upwards of fifteen yeai'3, and they vie with each other in an endeavour to reach the gold-medal standard. Marks are placed against them if they disfigure a machine inside the garage. I have moved among them for years. They tell me that they can drive in the thickest traffic anywhere at the fairly high speed demanded by the nature of their work, without getting a scratch on their machines, yet cannot enter the garage without losing marks, because the operation is in the nature of a jig-saw puzzle. Two or three weeks ago, I witnessed the removal of a ministerial car. Three or four other machines had first to be taken out, and the time occupied was over a quarter of an hour. The garage is 50 years behind the times, and because it has become so dangerous, the department has at last reached the conclusion that some alterations must be offected to it. I ask the Minister to note particularly the fact that it has been decided to spend about £3,000 in patching up the building, and enlarging it slightly by pushing a wall back and removing some of the old piles. In this day and generation, building architecture demands that there shall be no piles or pillars, but only steel girders. Thousands of pounds worth of tires, machinery and material lie exposed to sun, rain and wind, deteriorating all the time. When undertaking any work, the department should look ten years ahead. I believe that that is one of its rules. The expenditure of £3,000 can only have tbe effect of patching up the building. The money might a9 well be thrown down a sewer. The land is available for a completely new structure, and it should be provided. The ground is there, and it is only necessary to erect a square building around a The central courtyard, together with proper quarters for the men, such as are provided by private employers. I suggest that the department should reconsider its proposal to patch up the existing garage, and have plans prepared for the erection of a new building on the same site. Perhaps some parts of the old building might be worked into the new one. The floor of the present building is below the level of the street because it is so old, and the drainage system is out of date. There is always a certain amount of oil leakage from motor vehicles, and this oil runs along a shallow, open gutter underneath the vehicles. If a fire were to break out 30 or 40 expensive vehicles would probably be destroyed. The main entrance to the garage at present is from the most important street in South Melbourne, along which tram and motor traffic is continually passing. At the back of the building there is a wide street which carries very little traffic, and I suggest that in the interests of safety and efficient working the main entrance be changed to that street. gah-Minister for Defence) [S.33] -The sum of £5,000 has been placed on the Estimates for the erection of a new garage at South Melbourne.

A little while ago I drew attention to the unfair action of the department in 'dismissing before they had completed a sufficiently long term of service to entitle them to recreation leave. I mention the case of Mr W. H . Rhodes, of Young, New .South Wales, who was within three hours of completing twelve months' service, which would have entitled h i m to recreation leave. This matter was brought under the notice of the department, and the following letter was received from the Postmaster-General (Senator The arrears of work which had A. J. McLachlan)Referring to the remarks made by you in Parliament recently in regard to the dismissal of temporary employees of the department just prior to their becoming eligible for recreation leave, the instructions which have boon issued Everything possible in this matter provide that, in all eases where the discharge of temporai'3' hands is contemplated, special efforts are to be made to retain The number those employees who would become eligible for leave within a short period. Retention in any case is, however, dependent upon tliere being essential work ,to ibe performed, and no employee can be granted leave before it actually becomes due. It is recognized that, iii the particular case referred to by you, the employee concerned But is there not conwas specially unfortunate, but, as further essential work was not available at the time, it was impracticable to retain his services I sufficiently long to render him eligible for leave. The statement that the department could not find three hours' work for this man when he was within that time of comtemporary, casual and exempt pleting his year's service w ill not be accepted by any reasonable person. I hope that the Minister w ill see that when employees are on the verge of completing the necessary period of service to entitle them to leave, they w ill be allowed to complete the term.

From time to time. I have made representations to the Postmaster-General on their behalf and, knowing the sympathetic nature of the Minister now in charge of the committee ( Mr Parkhill), I feel sure he will, with added force, carry the representations I now make to the responsible Minister. At the moment we are engaging the services of a number of telegraph messengers to fill vacancies caused from time to time by wastage due to retirements. The Public Service Act contains a section dealing with preference in employment to returned soldiers. In the course of my representations, I have made appeals to the Public Service Board and have received from it certain rulings with regard to this matter. I propose to read extracts from a letter which I have received from the chairman of the Public Service Board in which certain provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Actare quoted.

I ask honourable members to note that. Selection for temporary employment must be made in the order of registration, of applicants for the work in which employment is required. Section 84(9) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act reads as follows:In the making of appointments to positions in the Commonwealth Service of a non-clerical nature tlie order of preference to returned i-.oldiers shall be as follows:(a) Returned soldiers temporarily employed in the Commonwealtli Public Service, who have parsed the prescribed examination; (ft) Returned soldiers employed under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1U20 or under the War Service Homes Act 101S-H120, who have passed the prescribed examination; This is the paragraph under which these men claim they could be re-instated(c) Returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed continuously for not less than two years, but have not passed the prescribed examination, and in respect of whom the chief officer certifies that their duties have been performed in a satisfactory manner.",133,General S Department £9 704 000

These men have a very good case and plead that more sympathetic consideration should be given to it. They originally left their positions in the Public Service to go overseas and fight for their country, and when they returned they were employed in a temporary capacity in the public service of the country for which they had previously fought, thereby reducing their opportunity to obtain employment outside the Service. As a matter of fact, their training has fitted them for postal work only. Yet they are denied the right to re-enter the Service although, as I read it, the act expressly provides for their re-employrnent. give more sympathetic consideration to their claims ancl ascertain why the chairman of the Public Service Board refuses to permit these men to re-enter the Public Service. These men claim that as they have fulfilled the terms of their contract they should be re-ernployed immediately, and that as the department is continually absorbing telegraph messengers into higher posts, their previous service in the department should be taken into -consideration, and they should likewise be absorbed in the ratio of say 1 in 4. That is their suggestion, but if the whole 30 affected in New South Wales were given re-employment the costto the department would be only approximately £5,000 per annum. they in employment now? Mr E. J. HARRISON -No. They 1924, whether in a permanent or a temhave been out of employment for five porary capacity, have their period of emyears-eve r since their dismissal took ployment counted for the purpose of place. One of the men who stated hi> case saidTliere are 250,000 postal employees. Practically every day some of these men are retiring from positions and other vacancies are caused by death. If you put down the wastage at 1 per cent, there are 250 jobs available a your; two-fifths of these would probably there would be 100 vacancies a year. To put the 30 men back would only bold up the permanent appointments of telegraph messengers for four months. When these men went overseas to fight for their country they were just at the age at which many telegraph messengers are now being appointed. In view of tbe fact that the Postal Department showed a surplus of £1,750,000 last year, I suggest that greater consideration should bo given to the claims of men who have already faithfully served the department, as I have said, for periods ranging from four to thirteen years. I suggest that it would need only a direction from the Postmaster-General for these men to be employed. I appeal to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to examine the facts I have presented. If he will interview these men, and see the couditions under which they are living at the moment, he will quickly realize that, owing to their prior employment in The Postmaster-General should the Public Service, they cannot be absorbed by commercial activities. They became postal employees, and their only opportunity to earn a livelihood is to remain, postal employees. Another matter which I desire to bring forward in connection with the employment of returned soldiers in a temporal"""" capacity in the Postmaster-General's Department, is that their temporary service should be included in their total service for furlough purposes. These men say that from 1916 onward a number of them, temporarily employed in different branches of the Postmaster-General's Department, were transferred after the usual period of temporary employment to positions of a permanent nature. This request affects a certain section of employees who direct attention to a precethat officers of the Defence Department employed before the 26th November,",134,General S Department £9 704 000
128,Mr Aeokuale Pakkhii.i.,"Are not dent for the granting of their request, infurlough. It is unfair that auy discriminalocal town, which is typical of thousands tion should be shown against the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department. A person who did not go on active service in 1916, but was appointed to a permanent position in the department is certainly in a better position than a returned soldier who was on active service that year. A number of these returned soldiers had up to six years' continuous temporary service before they were appointed to the permanent staff, and they feel that they have been penalized to the extreme as against the non-returned soldiers appointed to the staff in 1916. I feel sure that an investigation will clearly reveal the reasonableness of this request. wish to make several requests which I hope the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will submit to the Postmaster-General. The practice of the department of charging a local call in respect of every trunk line call that is booked is unfair, and should be discontinued. While the charge for a local call is small, I submit that when the department has fixed its scale of fees for trunk line calls, it ought affects country telephone subscribers not to make the additional charge to the subscriber for booking his call. bounds of equity are broken when the double charge is made. practice bears particularly heavily on country telephone subscribers, who, by reason of their isolation, are obliged to m.ike many more trunk line calls than arc usually made by city subscribers. Moreover, the hours of service provided by country exchanges are generally limited, whereas city exchanges invariably give continuous service. The fact that many country telephone exchanges are open only from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., should influence the department to give special consideration to them, instead of which we find that country subscribers are required to pay what amounts to a double fee in respect of many of their calls. Following a request that I made to the Postmaster General's Department some time ago for a statement setting out the proportion of trunk line to local calls made by subscribers in country districts, I have obtained some interesting information. Taking the case of Stanhope, my own of other similar towns throughout the Commonwealth, I find that last year, of 58,600 calls made, 18,900 were trunk line calls, which means that about 25 per cent, of the calls were on trunk lines. This proportion is very much higher than that shown by metropolitan telephone exchanges, and it emphasizes the unfairness that country subscribers are subjected to in having to pay for a local call every time they make a trunk line call. Another request that I submit is that a reduction of the fee for trunk line calls should be made when the call extends beyond the usual three minutes. After the department has gone to the initial trouble and expense of connecting one subscriber with another on a trunk line, it is only reasonable to expect that an extension of the call should be made at a lower rate. Such a practice would bein conformity with ordinary business custom. To put it in another way, I am asking that a "" cut"" be given for a repeat order that entails no additional expense to the department. This also more than city subscribers, for the reason The that they make a proportionately greater number of trunk-line calls than do city The present subscribers. I wish now to direct attention to the need for a reconsideration of charges for telegrams, particularly in the case of districts on the border of two States. The minimum charge is Is. for a telegram within a State, and Is. 4d. for an interstate telegram j but if a citizen on one side of the Murray wishes to send a telegram say, 20 miles across the river, he is required to pay the interstate rate. The department should consider the feasibility of introducing the zone system, so that a telegram could be sent for, say, not more than 100 miles at the State rate, irrespective of whether its destination is in the same State or not. Sir LITTLETON Gitooar -Such a provision might work unfairly in a State like Western Australia. that is likely to happen, although Western Australians might not reap so much advantage from it as people who live adjacent to long boundary lines such as",135,General S Department £9 704 000

I cannot believe that the department would be in any way embarrassed by the adoption of the zone system in connection with its telegraphic service. I trust that these requests will receive of the department accord to those who the favorable consideration of the Postmaster-General. this is one of the few opportunities honourable members get to mention relatively minor matters that affect their constituencies, I feel justified in bringing under notice of the Government a long-standing complaint of some of my constituents who reside at Ballarat East. office clock in that locality is erratic in its operation. Periodically it stops altogether. the Postmaster-General's that as the clock is installed in a. post olfice building, the department should maintain it in proper order. partment, however, considers that this duty should be undertaken by the municipal council. As the expense involved in keeping the clock in good order would not be great, and the clock is installed in the post office, I make a personal appeal to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to obtain favorable consideration of the request of my constituents. The department has been subjected to a good deal of criticism to-night, but I wish to compliment it on two or three recent actions that it has taken. is gratifying to country people that the hours' of a number of country telephone exchanges have extended. happened in about 500 cases. in my electorate have had their hours of service. He may have a holiday only on service extended, in most cases from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. This is of great advantage to country people who, unlike city dwellers, do not cease work at 5 o'clock, but often maintain their operations until about 7 o'clock. To have their telephonic service made available to them until 8 o'clock is an advantage that is much appreciated. I also congratulate the department upon the steps it has taken recently to expedite the delivery of mail matter by the extension of the motor car mail contract service. Country people are now receiving very good treatment in this regard. In conclusion, I express appreciation of the courtes3' that all the officers have business with it. agree with all that has beeu said by honourable members regarding postal employees, but I desire particularly to present the case of the allowance postmaster or postmistress. Large numbers of these officials are employed throughout Australia, and they are greatly overThe post worked and underpaid. There are 9,830 post offices, of which 1,145 are official. The S,6S5 non-official offices comprise: 68 It has been suggested to semi-official; 6,801 allowance; and 1,816 Department telephone offices. Over 9,000 persons are employed by the department in the non-official offices, and each contributes its The defull share of the department's earnings, which last year amounted to £12,500,000. The net profit on those earnings, after the payment of interest was £1,192,000, which compares more than favourably with the profit of £736,000 in 1931-32 and the loss of £67,000 in 1930-31, when the earnings were nearly £13,000,000. In the metropolitan area of Melbourne there are non-official post offices with a turnbver exceeding £100,000 per annum, and the same may be said of other large cities of Australia. The allowance postmaster not only gives his own labour, but, freIt quently, his wife, son or daughter also assists him, and devotes at least one-half of his or her time to postal work without been considerably pay.

I desire the Minister representing the Postmade to those who toil so hard and so master-General to reconsider the whole scale of allowances to these officers, who, for their responsible work, receive from £4 to £5 a. week. Their monthly pay is greater than this, but they have to meet the cost of rent of the building, proper lighting, and all labour required for postal purposes. offices are usually conducted in conjunction with their private businesses. officers give the whole of their time to the allowance. work, although I admit that in some cases they conduct small businesses. In my own district, the average non-official postuse of one additional salary sheet-Form master would show a profit to the depart ment running intofour figures; but there are men receiving £3 a week whose health is impaired through the strain of the work, and who pay an assistant 10s. a day to help them on the two busiest days of ihfc week. This means that the post, master works for a full day and carries the responsibilities of his office on those two days a week without pay. Country postmasters do not work under such a continuous strain, but in all of the bigger offices they are at call for 24 hours a day, giving a continuous telephone service iu addition to discharging their ordinary duties. In many small centres, local residents, particularly farmers, have to travel long distances to the post office, and the postmaster is fremessengers. Surely those non-official quently called on duty at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in order to deliver mail matter to them. In of faithful service to their credit, arc cases where a. money order post office is conducted in conjunction with a business, experience proves that when the allowance for such officers approaches £3 a week, the postal work is practically a full-time job for one person. Semi-official postmasters are paid a margin for skill of about 10s. a week above the basic wage for their arduous and responsible work. Taxpayers' associations and other representatives of big business interests are rates; but, before one moment's consideration is given to such requests, justice demands that the whole system of payment for non-official postmasters be immediately reviewed, and that the first allocation of the huge departmental surplus should be in regard to the allowance long to earn it . Payment of allowances only once monthly to non-official postmasters is a serious and recurring inconvenience to them, and I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to see that they are paid twice monthly, say on the 15th and at the end of each month. Many postmasters employing a staff endeavour to pay them weekly or fortnightly, and they suffer financial inconvenience through having to wait until the end of the month for their own The additional cost of paying them twice a month would appear to be infinitesimal, involving merely the 47A-eac h month, and the checking of such form by the accountant. I urge the Minister to give consideration to the following facts:.1. The non-official postmaster has not only a greater volume of work to handle, in many cases, than the official postal clerk who enjoys annual leave, but he ha""^ also to carry the full responsibility for the proper conduct of his office. 2. This dual strain seriously impairs the health of . the non-official postmaster, making an annual holiday a real necessity. 3.

The Postmaster-General, in reply to representations I recently made to him in favour of increased allowances and annual leave, expressed regret that he could not comply with rny request. Dealing with annual leave, he said the matter had been carefully considered but the conclusion reached was that the department would not be justified in varying the present practice, as the fact that non-official postmasters were not granted holidays with pay was taken into consideration when fixing the scale on which they are remunerated. He also contended that paying twice monthly would involve a considerable increase of work in the department and that heavy additional expenditure would be entailed. I am at a loss to know how the Minister arrives at this conclusion. I now ask him to reconsider the whole matter. I should like the Postmaster-General to that the people should be encouraged to make inquiries as to why a third channel on the Rockhampton Murray-Multiplex go back to the land. The only way in was cut out on the eve of last Christmas? which the people will be encouraged to I.understand that it was the department's take up rural pursuits on a larger scale intention to restore the third channel will be by the provision of amenities such when aparatus was available, but nothing as telephone ancl postal facilities, and has yet been done. Rockhampton has to improved reception from broadcasting work on two channels, which are autre stations. The following is typical of the inadequate for the Christmas loading. numerous replies with which the Postal in reconverting the Murray-Multiplex to three channels, and the advantage accruing to the Rockhampton district, I urge the Postmaster-General to endeavour to have the necessary additional channel provided before Christmas. The growth of closer settlement along the Dawson Valley, the undoubted progress of Miount Morgan, and the increased telephone revenue, are facts which should be taken into consideration. A communication has been received by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Postal Electricians TJnion, the executive of which urges that the Government should build in his office as he cottages for the housing of the PostThe department will master-General's staff at the newly-established broadcasting station at Lawrence, near Maclean. A similar request could be made concerning the officers at newlyestablished broadcasting stations in Queensland and other parts of Australia. Regarding the station at Lawrence, the union submits that the Government should build cottages near the station and charge the officials occupying them the usual rentals provided for in the Public Service Regulations, or alternatively hold an inquiry into the whole matter set out in a memorandum supplied by the union to the Postmaster-General. If the accommodation asked for were provided, the department would effect savings. These permanent officers should not have to take their wives and children to hotels. They have to be abstemious, and are required to be on duty whenever needed. Thousands of residents of country districts in Australia frequently receive from the Postal Department adverse replies to requests for improved telephonic and postal facilities. There is a great deal of talk, particularly among the more conservative classes of thought, Department meets requests for improved postal and telephone facilities:The revenue received from the two telephone offices is very small, and is not even sufficient to cover the little remuneration given to the telephone office-keepers, apart from the charges for interest, maintenance and depreciation. In view of this, it was stated that the continuance of the telephone offices could only bo agreed to if the attendance was given without charge, and providing the residents would maintain the line, including the renewal of a large number of supports, free of cost to the department. Since the receipt of your communication, a letter has 'been received from the Local Producers Association, East End, submitting certain general reasons to justify the continuance of the telephone facilities, and, in reply, they have 'been advised that, if the service is of value to the residents as claimed, they should be prepared to make some personal effort to justify its retention. Tlie yearly revenue received is so very small that the justification, of the telephone offices under the present conditions cannot be seen, and it is proposed to permanently close the two places unless the suggestion concerning maintenance and attendance is agreed to. Is that a fair request to put to these struggling farmers in closer settlement areas, who are working twelve to fourteen hours a day f o i an income of about £2 a week? made to the people who live in the cities of Australia when they ask for daily mail deliveries. special duty to the people livin g under adverse conditions in the country districts, and the Postmaster-General should reconsider his attitude. [9.35] -My reason for taking this opportunity to speak is to criticize the official outlook which, unfortunately, influences Commonwealth Ministers when they curtail ordinary services and amenities of life provided through the Postal Department to the sparsely-populated areas of the Northern Territory. Men employed on work connected with the overland telegraph line from Darwin to Adelaide, as a rule, are not. allowed to take their wives to isolated repeating stations. was surprised on the last occasion which I visited Daly Waters, to find that the postmaster there had been allowed to bring his wife to the district, but linesmen and men employed in what might be termed the lower grades of the postal service in the outback areas of the Northern Territory are not given the same consideration. The linesman* at Katherine River, when off his guard, agreed to go there, and leave his wife in Adelaide. She followed him, however, and paid her own expenses. The regulations should be so amended as to provide for the Commonwealth meeting the expenses of an official taking his wife to wherever he is detailed for service, and providing her with a suitable residence, whether it be a post office or a police station. ThoughI am pleased to see that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) is taking an interest in improving the amenities of l if e in the outback country, there still remains much to be done to improve the lot of women in the more remote parts of the Northern Territory The Minister for Defence( MrP a r k h ill) was a former Minister for the Interior, and travelled through the areas to which 1 am referring.

The people in the f a r outback see the mail planes pass overhead, hut reap little advantage from the service. The AngloAustralian air mail brings benefit to the people at Darwin, and, undoubtedly, to the thickly populated areas which can rapidly be reached from the terminus of the Australian section of the service at I Cootamundra. But prompt delivery of fashion plates from Paris is of no value to the pioneers blazing the trails in the interior.

140,"Echuca ( Mr Mcewen) From The View Phone Services Is A Costly Matter, But","The matter of border telegraph rates has been frequently raised, and an explanation in regard to it is due to the committee. The geographical areas of the six States are so widely divergent that their recognition as tariff zones is inseparable from anomalies in regard to charges. For many years, the question of the introduction of a tariff based upon the zone system, as in the case of the trunk line service, has been repeatedly reviewed. Adoption of the suggestion to introduce a minimum charge of 9d. for telegrams between offices not more than 15 miles apart, and Is. for telegrams between points separated by a distance not greater than 50 miles, notwithstanding their location in different States, would not remove many other anomalies that are inseparable from the basis of existing charges. For example, a telegram of sixteen words sent from Coolangatta. to Thursday Island, a distance of 1,915 miles, would cost only Is., while a message which traversed a distance of just over 50 miles would cost a minimum of Is. 4d., if the sender and the addressee girls are appointed after examination, in were located in different States. A serious loss of revenue amounting to nearly £90,000 per annum would follow the introduction of a minimum rate of Is. for interstate telegrams, as approximately 29 per cent, of the ordinary telegrams lodged are despatched to interstate destinations. A complete plan for a zone basis of charges for telegrams was prepared by the department in 1929. It will be appreciated, however, that the introduction of any tariff based on distances would involve additional cost to those who use the service over the greater distances. ""While the introduction of such a system would be in harmony with the federal principle and would remove existing anomalies, it is felt that the present time is inopportune for its introduction. However, the matter will not be lost sight of. I desire to point out that the special provision of £100,000 will enable the department to undertake the erection of additional trunk lines to serve country centres. It is estimated that approximately twenty of these lines will be provided. Already, 26 rural automatic exchanges are in operation. Those in course of installation number five, and 26 further installations were contemplated, and preliminary action in regard to them was well in hand before the special appropriation was decided upon. That, appropriation will enable additional installations of .this description to be undertaken. The details have not yet been worked out, but it is estimated that the number will be increased to about 44. I mention these matters to show that the department is observant of the urgency, the necessity, and thedeserving nature of them. That the department is progressive will be admitted. I beg honourable members to believe that the requirements of country districts will receive in the future the progressive attention that has beeu given to them in the past. direct the attention of the Minister representing tlie Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) to the position of juniors employed, in the Service, many of whom are not receiving the consideration to which they are entitled. Telephone exchange many cases, as temporary hands and. as assistants in various post offices. When they attain the age of eighteen years they are dismissed, and girls of fifteen years of age are taken on in their places. That is a totally unfair practice, because at such an age the girls have lost opportunities of employment in many other avocations. If vacancies actually exist for the employment of telephone operators, those girls who have passed the required examination and have discharged their duties for a period of two or three years should be given permanent employment; and if temporary positions become vacant, further examinations should be held and juniors should be appointed to them. The department should not employ girls up to the age of eighteen years, and then dismiss them. A similar practice is adopted in regard to boys. A Sydney firm advertises "" SuTe to get it at Grace Brothers"". The comment of a "" wag "" in regard to it was, "" Sure to get the sack when you are 2 1 "" .

Every facility is given to the residents in the towns, but country residents are frequently put to great expense in bearing portion of the cost of erecting the lines over great distances. desire to say a word or two in commendation of the service rendered by the Postal Department. I had sent to me a day or two ago, through the courtesy of the Director of Postal Services, a little bookparticular public telephone, I hope that let, entitled Express Messenger Service, which contains a fund of information showing that residents in the cities and provincial areas have received very great consideration at the hands of the department. I join with other honourable members in expressing appreciation of the Government's action in extending the hours of business of country telephone exchanges. SinceI have been a member of this Parliament I have on many occasions received complaints from people in country areas, who find it necessary to use tlie telephone more frequently after 6 p.m. than at any other time during the day. For that reason I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to afford them this facility. As a Tasmanian, I greatly appreciate the fact that the cable telephone service between Tasmania and the mainland will shortly be put into operation. It will be of great value, not only to Tasmanians, but also to residents of the mainland, who often need to get into urgent communication with residents of the island State. AlthoughI have commended the department in certain respects, it is inevitable with"" a public undertaking of such magnitude as this is that both individual and collective complaints should be made on behalf of people who consider that they are not receiving the service to which they are entitled. In this connection, I refer to the necessity to provide change its policy in regard to this locality reasonable facilities for the users of public telephones I have raised this issue on other occasions, hut so far without favorable results. By providing public telephonic facilities, the Postal Department has, inferentially, accepted the responsibility to furnish suitable equipment for the purpose. I feel, therefore, that I am entitled to ask that the cabinets in which public telephones are installed shall, at least, ensure telephone users of a reasonable degree of privacy. Unfortunately, in some case3 this is not so. I have in mind a public telephone in connection with an unofficial post office in my electorate which is quite unsatisfactory for the purpose for which it is used. As I have on a previous occasion made definite representations to the department in connection with this steps will be taken to remedy my complaint. I wish now to refer to the unsatisfactory circumstances under which the unofficial post office at Iuvermay, a suburb of Launceston, is being conducted. This complaint is in the nature of a hardy annual, and was brought under the notice of the department by gentlemen who represented the Bass constituency before I had the honour of being elected to do so. It has been pointed out to the department that the postal service of Invermay has been provided in the present building for about 30 years, and that improvements have not been effected in conformity with the growth of the suburb. In a letter which I have recently received from the Postmaster-General (Senator A. J. McLachlan) on this subject it is stated' As yon are no doubt aware, tbe remuneration pn.ijl to the postmaster nt Invermay includes an amount for the provision by that official of alf necessary office accommodation. Tlie question of effecting improvements has been taken up by him on a number of occasions, and it is understood that, up to the present, he has been unable to persuade his landlord to increase the accommodation. That statement is quite true; but one of the reasons why the landlord will not improve the accommodation is that lie has no guarantee that, if he does so, the premises will continue to be used for postal purposes. The department may and put in hand the construction of a building on a block of land that has been acquired for the purpose. It has been requested that the front of the building at present being used for the post",146,General S Department £9 704 000
146,Mr Barnard (Bass) [10.27],"Ioffice should be reconstructed and brought out to the building line of the street in conformity with the other buildings in the locality. If the landlord were given an undertaking that, in the event of his putting this work in hand, the department would continue to use the property for a few years at any rate, I have no doubt he would be willing to incur the expense. Another difficulty in the way of an agreement in this case, however, is that the remuneration of the unofficial postmaster includes an amount for office Hccommodation. If the present building is improved, undoubtedly the landlord would expect a higher rental. The unofficial postmaster naturally would not be willing to pay more than he is at present paying unless his remuneration from the department were also increased. department should go carefully into ways and means of providing the people in this locality with better postal facilities than they at present enjoy, and make provision on next year's Estimates for this purpose. I wish now to refer briefly to the broadbut most of them are attributable to the casting arrangements in Launceston. The establishment of the regional station 7LA has improved the service available to the people, but, unfortunately^ the office accommodation of the station is of only a temporary character. I urge that a modern studio be constructed at Launceston, so that the broadcasting servico there may be put on a basis commensurate with the importance of that city. So far we have not been furnished with any information as to the specific postal works to be put in hand in the ""various States this year. I ask that the Minister representing should obtain information for us on this point. As I am always willing to give praise where it is due, I commend the department for the improvements that have been effected in connection with the island mail service. In the last year or two, postal revenue has increased considerably, and in view of the surplus for last year the department might anticipate increased profit during the current year. to the consideration of these votes has now expired.

Others have been almost as eager to describe the wrongs of Australia. [Quorum formed.'] In reviewing the statement which the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) was prevented from making, one naturally asks: "" What is wrong with the Northern Territory?"" TheI realize that the Minister is trying to do the best he possibly can for the territory. I liave been, and, I hope, will often again be a critic of the Government in regard to territory matters; but I can always give the Minister credit for good faith and a sincere desire to help. The residents have many grievances and troubles, kind of representation that the territory has had in the past and to the apparent anxiety of my predecessor to hinder the Government and to make territory affairs r. party matter rather than act as an independent advocate of the development of the territory as a whole on sound and sane lines. At any rate, the Government can rest assured that while I shall fight for my electors to the last ditch, knowing their troubles as only a confirmed territorian can, I shall at the same time do my best to be constructive and to help in every way, rather than to hinder. the Postmaster-General Knowing what pioneering conditions are. I find it difficult to be patient, but J shall try to be so when I see that a real effort is in progress to effect improvements. I greatly welcomed the visit to the territory during the recent Parliamentary recess of the Minister, and several other honourable members, in order to see how its affairs are administered. I sincerely hope that more members of all parties will follow their example.

I am sure that if every honourable member were to gain a first hand knowledge of the hardships of the settlers, much more attention would be the astonishment at the eagerness during recent months with which everybody has been led to recognize the importance of our tropical problems, and the dangers of the territory remaining practically empty. In the success of my efforts to secure this recognition I feel that part of my mission here has been achieved. On agreed, irrespective of their political creeds, except, perhaps, my friends who sit behind the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who seem to be far more interested in Russian extremists, and in the protection of imitators of Guy Fawkes who desire to destroy the Constitution, than in the welfare of any pioneer, unless he be a destructive element like themselves. of the honourable member that members of the party with which I am associated are not interested in the Northern Territory. not unparliamentary. orable member being allowed to read his speech. honourable member is referring to his notes. statement, said that the disabilities suffered by the settlers have been receiving attention, and he cited certain measures which are being taken to remedy their grievances. these do not go nearly far enough, does not mean that I do not congratulate the Minister. The reduction of railway freights, subsidies for boring for water, the bearing of part of the freight costs on fencing material, road construction, a review of pastoral rentals and the assistance granted to gold-mining are all steps in the right direction; but a bold policy is required. But these are only palliatives at best, and I am sorry that there is no large scale constructive plan, which I am sure we should have if we had administration of the right type. I cannot help comparing, in my own mind, the government of Papua by that world-famous administrator, Sir Hubert Murray, with that of paid to the problems of the Northern Territory. I have had the north. YetI admit my opportunity lately to meet some of the young men whom he has trained, and I have been impressed by the unity of thought and purpose among them. Their minds are clear as to the policy which their administration aims at, because it has a policy. They know exactly what they are trying to do with both native and white development. They realize this matter all seem to be that the work goes beyond mere government. They are schoolmasters for the black, and an example to black and white alike. I should be proud to be in an administration which, from home-bred material, can turn out civil servants like J. G. Hides. But, though we have the right material among our northern lads, they will never get their opportunity while the Government sends nominees, and officers out of a job, to run the territory, and to deal with complex pastoral and native problems, for the handling of which they have not had the slightest preliminary training. Persons bred in Darwin receive little encouragement, even as apprentices, &c, in the ordinary walks of life, let alone special training to solve the problems of that tropical region that leap to the eye. I often ask myself what I should do if I were suddenly to be handed the portfolio of the interior. Because of knowledge gained by practical experience, I have a good idea of the lines I should follow. In the first place, I should seek an administrator of national standing and with pastoral experience. If necesThe fact that I consider sary, I should pay him a high salary. Surely this would be worthwhile, since a man capable of handling the problems of an area comprising one-sixth of Australia must have a strong character, and a broad outlook. The men who now administer the territory are not to be blamed for their mistakes. Putting them into their jobs is like sending a farmer with no financial training to manage the Commonwealth Bank.

I hope these remarks will induce the Minister to reconsider his decision, and allow the ratepayers to administer their own affairs. In administering the territory I should lay down certain broad lines of procedure. The preliminary would be an economic survey by an expert staff. advocated such a survey so that we might know the value of our assets. Only by soil and topographical surveys can detailed information of value to our mining and cattle industries be gained. This might be costly, but the expenditure of half a million pounds in the right way at the present time would be amply justified. We cannot have effective developstocktaking, what we have to develop, how it will re-act to developmental measures, and what tools are needed for the job. The present method would be paralleled by a carpenter who proceeded to make something out of any old bits of tools that he could lay his hands on in the dark. As a first step I would ascertain what land could be made payable pastorally, water and communications, and how these could be provided most cheaply after a hydraulic survey. Unpayable lands I would leave alone. Next, I would lay down a port policy duct of power alcohol, manufactured by I am rapid transport of perishable commodiThenI would consider the stock at where, with freight reductions and increase of carrying capacity, station properties would pay their way, which now is not possible in many instances. I would establish farms for the breeding of stud bulls, and acclimatization stations for grasses at four or five points, [ would introduce plants, timbers and grasses likely to suit territory conditions, and increase production. Buffel grass and' Townsville lucerne would be the subject of immediate investigation to improve the carrying capacity of the country. There would be a special water and mining survey by a hydraulic department, and officials under the .control of Sir David Rivett. Instead of allowing his outstanding abilities to be wasted as at present, Sir David would be given an immediate and wide charter to carry out his practical planning on a scientific basis. partment to reverse this process. I shall This would call for the appointment of a nucleus technical staff having the highest qualifications. Finally, there would be a native survey by an experienced Papuan official with the aid of the existing police officers to determine a permanent policy of reclamation. In the preliminary years I would spend money, and encourage others tc spend money, on development. I would sectionalize the territory according to the report made on it, and, section by section, [ would see it capitalized, as much as pospolicy. sible, by encouraging to the limit private enterprise with light rents and taxation, and leases sufficiently long to induce corporate effort to invest provided the lessees improved their holdings after being given the advantage of a preferential tariff. E would recommend even perpetual leases in some dry areas. I would retain certain coastal lands suitable for agricultural development at a later date. Unless some such policy as this is adopted, the territory will remain unpayable with a few people wasting its resources, pulling their own legs, and getting little out of the waste, and, having lost their youth, going cut disappointed. Any business man who owned land which was an incubus for want of development, would follow this course. The main difficulty is to obtain a suitable man a general manager, let us call him rather than mere administrator-wh o could plan and carry out such an important undertaking. I am sure that Australia can provide such a man. If the job were advertised at a reasonable salary, instead of the applicant being chosen from amongst ministerial and departmental acquaintances, a suitable man familiar with conditions in the Northern Territory would offer his services. I should have liked to deal with this subject in more detail, but refrained in order that the first principles of the proposal might be made clear and understood by honourable members. I am, however, constrained to give an outline of the work to be done by the administration. Until the last few years in Australia, road-building has followed settlement. It remained for the Queensland Lands Denot enlarge on this, but I refer honourable members to the last report of the Queensland Land. Administration Board with its splendid photographs and graphs of the highways which are being driven, like tunnels, into rich scrub lands which, in a few years, will feed smiling farms. This publication, under the guiding hand of Mr Payne, could actually be classified as a treatise on land administration, and I earnestly suggest that honourable members should peruse a copy in the Library as a guide for a real developmental East and west of Darwin lie two regions. One, Arnheim Land, is known chiefly as the haunt of the buffalo and of the wild blackfellow of Caledon Bay. It is half the size of Victoria. What is it like? Except for the fringe where Ministers and tourists are taken, scarcely anybody knows. Why? Because there is no communication. Two years ago, in the course of my duties, I penetrated some portion of this area. As soon as I left the roads which touch its edges, I was as much completely lost to civilization and to my head-quarters in Darwin as if I had been with Mawson in the Antarctic. I am diffident about painting the hardships of the journey-of rivers infested with crocodiles, and of many other hardships. I mention them merely to emphasize my conviction that it was criminal that such a splendid area, which was within coo-ee of a railway and a port for overseas steamers, should be so isolated from civilization in a country that has been settled for a century. In that area I noted unclassified leguminous grasses, on light country, and higher carrying country of heavy soils, timber, fertilizing rivers, profurther inland. This basalt country is mising mineral belts extending to the King River and beyond. But the sound of tlie settler's axe and miner's pick has never been heard in it, because the western half of it is locked up as a reserve for a few stray natives. Because of its peculiar physical characteristics, the soil in that area will stand heavy rains. During the dry season the low country carries swamp grasses which feed thousands of buffalo. The carrying capacity of the high country is as yet low during the dry seasons, but some day Australia will realize that this class of councomprehensively later in a carefully try should be tbe first to be developed for agricultural purposes, because the rainfall is assured. I would not recommend long leases on perpetuity. this particular area as it could carry a large population if handled properly with due regard to its tropical location. described east and west of Darwin, where Wild cattle are to be found in this heavily the real territory problem, as I see it, is timbered country, but at present its carryto be found. This is country which can ing capacity pastorally is insufficient to only be opened by roads going east and warrant fencing for pastoral pursuits. west, one going east from Pine Creek, I of from a railway through a mineral belt Downs, thence to Wyndham. I wish to from Pine Creek to another mineral belt make it quite clear that these routes are in Arnheim Land, traversing en route, at present impassable during the wet light agricultural lands that stand rain season; they could, however, be utilized -land s that have an added carrying later for a light tram line to feed the railcapacity, pastorally, during tlie wet seaway. The tram line would intersect the son, but which are supported by low counheads of navigable rivers such as the try, almost inaccessible during the wet King, South Alligator, Adelaide and Vicseason, which has a high carrying toria, on which small craft ply. This capacity during the dry seasona decided would give access to the Finness River advantage for small holders. To the western side of Darwin lie the that could be shipped to the east in vessels distant Kimberleys, essentially a pastoral of 5,000 tons, and large barges could be belt of large areas of good carrying used in concentrating ship loads at capacity on the interior open level coundelivery points. Eventually cattle will try, but of low carrying capacity in the be killed on these rivers to defeat the preheavy timber near the coast. We know that there is gold in that I country. It is a land of rich pastures for baulking at the cost involved, watered by a regular tropic rainfall. because all governments are hampered There are big rivers and there is much by the old tradition that only when the timber, but the resources of this area have pioneer has shown his mettle must he bo Mr Blain. not been surveyed in detail. Small men will eventually be called upon to develop by pasture improvement the timbered country which is now classified as inferior country and embraced in the large holdings that were taken up because of the attractiveness of the rich basalt country too far inland to .receive the heavy rainfall that induces the tropical growth necessary for agricultural areas, but it forms the basis of some excellent cattle runs that are unable to carry on because of their remoteness, the lack of transport facilities, and the pressure of economic forces. On this occasion I do not propose to deal with the high carrying pastoral lands of the Barkly Tablelands, an uplift from the sea floor. This area will be treated planned scheme, as can also the light carrying country around Alice Springs, where small men should havi; their leases granted, in most cases, in I return, however, to those two areas would favour the construction and the other going south-westerly from an all-weather road leading theAdelaide River to Victoria River country, and Bynoe Harbour-a n excellent port. All this country carries cattle sent wastage in transit to distant works. do not blame any government rewarded with the access and service with the necessary equipment to do his work for which he aches when he first pioneers new country. Such individual effort without fail to-day in a remote region. Corporate effort must he invoked, too, and planned corporate effort at that. Let us look at it from an economic point of view. If a road 500 miles long were built linking up Arnheim Land and the Kimberleys with Darwin it need not be an expensive road. It could be cambered to keep off the rain, and linked over and in confidence, without the fear which the heads of rivers with drum ferries such as many New South Wales and Queensland rivers possess. It might cost £500 a mile, say £250,000 in all, but if it resulted in the production of even 10,000 ozs. of gold per annum and £100,000 in new production, it would pay for itself easily in increased taxation within ten or twelve years, even on the present scale, in their endeavours to l if t our people out while it is unthinkable that that would be the limit of its earning power to those who know fhe potentialities of the country. As feeder roads were built to it. and the land around it went into production as it must, because, except for the reflected on the frontier-the Northern basalt scrub country, it is as rich as much of the east coast of Australia, it would gradually form a new province capable of being turned into a fairly thickly peopled State. But, as in the case of Queensland;, tbe necessary administration must guide this project. This is merely an example of what may he done with a little vision by an administration that has a plan. I ask honourable members to think it over, and realize that there are a dozen other avenues of development which are likely to be equally productive. There is also the possibility of building up an inland fisheries department which could be combined with the department of agriculture. I hope that the Minister will welcome further discussion of the matter both inside and outside the House, and that he will see my viewpoint, and not allow a natural loyalty to his officials, which I would be the first to respect, to blind him too many lanky limbs of futile endeavour to the need for a great change in the local management of the territory. I feel that a step has been made in the right direction in the appointment of Mr J. A. Carrodus as secretary to the department. Mr Carrodus has administered the territory, and knows its conditions and people: he has the right type of mind to undernational assistance must stand its problems. I look forward to working with him and hope that he and the Minister whd. controls policy will keep me informed confidentially of these viewpoints and consult me whenever they think my experience may be of value. I can assure them that trust in me will not be misplaced, and that they can discuss any problem of development frankly has obviously existed in the past that this attitude might be used against them for party political purposes. I feel that there is a general tiredness in our Australia in regard to further primary development. Two opposing forces liave succeeded in producing the static state. Although both are sincere of the trough of despond, one force is endeavouring to do the job by constructive measures, while the other is adopting destructive methods. The resultant static state, however, spells stagnation and is' Territory. The people are sensing it already, and are seeking a lead. They want an outlet for this pent-up energy, not an evasive palliative based on ignorance of real resources, and a disinclination to take an inventory of nature' ' 1 endowments for fields of future endeavour. This Parliament must be bold within the next twelve months or must write an elegy on the futility of effort. It is regrettable that this country of sunshine is not united in making use of qualified Australians to intensify the development of its tropical assets to the utmost for further internal activities and endeavour. Snow countries would welcome the natural advantages we possess, and science is knocking at our door to assist in their development. This static state of affairs which, for obvious reasons is dangerous, must cease. Faulty administration in Australia has allowed the sappy fruit tree to throw out without consulting the wise pruner who develops as the years go by the maximum area of fruiting wood as each limb is allowed to grow. Choice fruit at the end of bare limbs is hardly worth harvesting, the area of endeavour being too great for the quantity of fruit recovered. There is only one way out, and that is to reconstruct from the base, and develop the same tree with fruit wood throughout by planning and using the old root system a3 the initial force. Only correct administration can do this. The south is faced with this for its own salvation now, but the Northern"" Territory, and the tropics in general, are a new tree, waiting for its main limbs of development to be strengthened to carry a greater crop of Australia's population for Australia's salvation. I , therefore, ask that the Minister and the Parliament apply to it sanity and science on the lines outlined to assist it to take its place on equal terms with tbe rest of Australia's activities. compliment the Minister on his administration of the Northern Territory. He has gone about his work in the right way by visiting the territory, and endeavouring to ascertain at first hand what is 'necessary for its development. -Some years ago an agreement was entered into between the governments of the Commonwealth and 'South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. It provided that the Commonwealth should construct a railway line from Oodnadatta to connect with the line running south from Darwin; but although many years have elapsed since that agreement was entered into, the line still remains incomplete. It is high time that the Commonwealth Government honoured its undertaking. that railway would be a waste of money. honourable member, because of the potentialities of the country through which the line would run. So far I have not visited the extreme north of the teri-itory, but on three occasions I have visited Central Australia, where I was astonished to find such wonderful country. It is generally agreed that as regards both its mineral and its pastoral resources the Northern Territory has great possibilities. This Parliament has a duty to discharge to those pioneers who are prepared to develop the outback districts of this continent. A few weeks ago the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) somewhat alarmed me when he advocated the construction of a railway from Birdum to the border of Western Australia and another to the border of Queensland. In my opinion, the gap of about 550 miles between Alice Springs and Birdum should first be bridged. After that line has been completed, spur lines could be constructed with advantage, to the territory. Another great essential for the proper development of the Northern Territory is the provision of adequate water supplies, and I appreciate what has been done at Tennant's Creek in this connection. When the Minister visited that area he took a water diviner with him, and I am pleased to know that a good supply of water has now been provided there. diviner responsible for finding it? supply was located; but I am assured that excellent water is now available for the residents of Tennant's Creek, 'who number about 800. I understand that other water found was brackish, but it, could be used at the batteries. Railway facilities should be provided for them. I urge that a railway be constructed from Alice Springs to Birdum, via Barrow Creek ancl Tennant's Creek. The contract entered into between the governments of the Commonwealth and South Australia should be honored and the line constructed without further delay. The members of the Minister's party obtained an excellent insight into what is construction of being done in the Northern Territory. As honourable members are asked from time to time to vote substantial sums for works in the territory, they should make themselves acquainted with its conditions by paying a visit to it. Regarding the shipping facilities to Papua and New Guinea., one of the matters that camo under my notice while travelling along the coast of North Queensland was that the passages used by vessels on regular trade routes in the neighbourhood, of the Barrier Reef have been only partially surveyed, and are devoid of beacons or other aids to safe navigation.

Honourable members may attemp to make light of this matter, but I assure them that from a navigation viewpoint it is all-important. A certain proportion of the dues collected from shipping should be utilized in the provision of aids to safe navigation. Listening to the remarks of the last, speaker in regard to the development of the Northern Territory, and having in mind the statements made recently by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) concerning the work that has been done there, .one must come to the conclusion that little will be achieved unless the Government is prepared to launch out on a bold scheme of development. Any attempt to render assistance by the reduction of freights or tlie provision of additional water supplies will be quite useless unless the lessees are given an outlet for their produce. That is one obstacle to the development of the territory today. During the three years in which the meat works operated at Darwin the value of produce exported was approximately £1,000,000, and even with the limited railway transport available the total amount paid for freight was about £50,000. Small secondary industries came into existence, with the result that there was an era of prosperity. But immediately the meat works closed the conditions began to change, and in the three succeeding years the value of goods exported dropped to practically nothing, and all the industries associated with the development of the north declined. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) has spoken of spur lines of raihvay. The task which confronts the Government is to construct lines to strategic points for the carriage of stock to the meat works, thus avoiding long treks over waterless tracks and roads that are devoid of feed, causinjv the cattle to arrive in store condition ining £12,523,830. stead of being fit for export as chilled beef. for the consideration of the proposed votes for the Territories of the Commonwealth has expired.
