Of course, if there is serious objection to this experiment being made, it will be discontinued, but a representative of the Wireless Telephony Company sought permission to make it in this Chamber, with a view to seeing if it be possible to transmit the speeches made here to other portions of the building, .and the temporary test is being made in the Prime Minister's room. I do not know with what degree of success the experiment has met, but honourable members might find it convenient, later on, perhaps, if wireless reports of their speeches could be conveyed to their own rooms without imposing on them the necessity of coming into, the Chamber. honourable members' constituents.

If necessary, the Government will come to Parliament and ask for indemnification for any action they may take to give effect to them, so the honourable member may, therefore, be quite easy in his mind. Some have already been laid on the table, and nothing will be allowed to interfere with the operation of any of them. I am not sure that I have not heard some people asking that these awards be not laid on the table of the House-that they be not approved.",23,Repatriation Soldiers Co Operative Enterprises

We could have gone on with the debate and then adjourned it and met again, but if this motion is carried there will be no further sitting of the House until next year, and we shall be precluded from discussing the basic wage question unless we unduly extend this sitting in order to do so. I am strongly opposed to this motion. I think i the House should proceed in the ordinary way to do the business before it. The Government and those supporting them are greatly mistaken if they think that the solve the great problem of the living wage for the people of Australia. It is simply head in the sand, thinking that by doing so it has solved the problem, of how to escape from its pursuers. We may adjourn, but this great problem will still be facing us. Industrial affairs are becoming so unsettled in Australia that it becomes more necessary every day to make an attempt to solve this question, otherwise serious consequences will ensue to the people generally.

I hope the Treasurer will not press this motion I agree with the sentiments expressed not permitted to make a statement, may I say, by way of interjection, that the Government have no idea of closuring the debate on the basic wage question in any shape or form. If honourable members wish to continue sitting this afternoon and through the. night, the Government are prepared to sit with them, and tomorrow also. a very unwise thing to do. Undoubtedly the public of Australia are very much agitated over the question of the basic wage. I moved the adjournment of the debate yesterday because I thought it inadvisable to have such an important matter discussed at an all-night sitting, and I would very much prefer to have it discussed until a reasonable hour this evening, and then again to-morrow morning) until the debate is concluded. Nothing will give a certain class of the community stronger cause for complaint than the fact that this Parliament, with such an important question before it, has rushed it through at an all-night sitting, as the motion suggests.

He has made a lengthy statement upon the question, and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has done the same, aud the remarks of both will be read all over Australia. Any attempt to close Parliament with an all-night sitting debate on this matter would be such an exceedingly dangerous course that I think the House ought not to contemplate it. by the honourable member for Erankliia with the method he has suggested for discussing this very important question of the basic wage-the most important ever launched in Australia. In response to a deputatioii the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) announced in his p*olicy speech at Bendigo-and his promise was repeated by all of his followers-that certain steps would be taken to fix the cost of living, and a Basic Wage Commission has been for ten months engaged nn the task of deciding what is the cost of living in Australia. Having concluded its labours, it has now presented its report to Parliament, and it is the duty of Parliament, I take it, to solve the question in accordance with the terms of the Commission's report. But instead of the House devoting sufficient time and proper hours to the consideration of this problem, the suggestion is made that we'should sit on to-day and perhaps to-morrow to deal with it. The proposal does not appeal to me. This House, if it takes the report of the Basic Wage Commission seriously, and has any realization of the true position, will adjourn at a proper hour this afternoon and meet next week at a proper time; and if the matter cannot be settled next week, it will sit here during the following week and continue sitting until the subject is I know that honourable members whose The a problem confronted them.

I hope the Treasurer will not press his motion, or, if he does, that it will Be defeated. It is extraordinary that the right honourable gentleman should have moved it at the outset of a very important discussion. His motion means, in other words, that Parliament, on the rising of the House, shall be practically prorogued. Wouldi t not be better for the Government to wait until the debate upon the basic wage has proceeded, at any rate, until some stage this afternoon, by which time they might be in a position to know whether finality can be reached and a specific announcement made? I do not wish to repeat the cogent and forcible arguments advanced by honourable members on this side, and I need scarcely remind honourable members that this very important public matter is one that is agitating the minds of many thousands throughout Australia. It behoves Parliament, then, to gjpve that attention to the subject which the public expect of us.

Before a motion of this character is agreed to, we should have some definite assurance that the pledge of the Government will be honoured. I am not satisfied that we have the assurance as yet; and, that being so, I shall vote against the motion . the honourable member for P'ranklin ( Mr Mcwilliams) moved the adjournment of the debate on the basic wage last evening, protests were raised by honourable members opposite, and it was alleged that honourable members on this side did not wish to discuss the subject.

When there is important business before the House, and it appears obvious that honourable members are "" stone-walling,"" I am always prepared to closure.

It was in timated at the beginning of this week that the Government were prepared to fix a basic wage for public servants, b u t the Prime Minister did not reveal what, the amount would be. I consider that a definite proposal of the Government should be before the House, and t h a t , otherwise, it is of no use to debate tlie question at a l l . As there is no proposal before honourable members, the only way to intimate to the Government what we thank, is to debate the matter in this Chamber. It has been said on many occasions by honourable members opposite that supporters of the Government discuss subjects such as this in our party room upstairs, and that we arrive at our decisions beforehand. The Treasurer knows, and will confirm me. I am sure, when I say that nothing qf the kind has occurred with lespect to the basic wage. We have not had an opportunity to discuss it at a party meeting. If the House is given an opportunity to decide what is to be the basic wage, I shall press the view that this Chamber is not the proper tribunal for determining such a matter.

I should have thought that an inquiry of the kind would have made some reference to the number of basic wages already established up and down Australia by various bodies of various kinds and have tried to reconcile them for us. in New South Wales a basic wage which has been declared by a Board of Trade, after an elaborate inquiry.

It does not matter very much whether we call it a basic wage or any other kind of a wage; it is the recognised standard"" wage. these various declarations are the standards for the various States. One would have thought that a Commission such as we set up would take these bases of wage payments in the different States, and that it would have made some pronouncement concerning them. know that we cannot take the basic wages applying in various States, and reconcile them without further inquiry. We are driven back, therefore, to see how our own public servants are faring as they stand related to the various determinations of the States. That is our immediate obligation, and the Government are preparing to meet that obligation at the earliest possible moment. One thing stands out' from all these inquiries, that is, that the rate of payment for our public servants is not an adequate rate, having regard to the decreased spending power of the sovereign and to conditions as they exist today in the Public Service. It is thatconcrete practical difficulty that the Government are immediately responsible for. It is that concrete 'practical difficulty which we propose to solve; and I know of no better way in which to solve it than, after having given the most caref u l consideration to the whole matter, to fix, at the earliest possible moment, irrespective of all the differing State rates, a rate for our own servants such as will do fchem substantial justice. now propose as a basic wage for public servants ? able member prepared off-hand with a solution of all these problems ?

My suggestion, however, is the basic wage of New South Wales. the event? judging from what the Prime Minister said, and I believe he will propose between £ 4 and £ 4 5s., and I suggest that we should err on the side of generosity. I shall vote for £ 4 5s. W it h such a wage, it is my opinion that the Public .Service would be satisfied, and I am not prepared, under all the circumstances, to seek popularity and a few extra votes by supporting a higher figure. scope of the inquiry referred to the Basic Wage Commission was, in my opinion, altogether inadequate. mission conceived in election times, and that the scope of the inquiry was inadequate is evidenced by the nature of the report and the necessity for additional information. This additional information is the most salient and important of alleven an ore important thau the report itself. Thei Commission set out to ascertain what is a reasonable living wage for a man, his wife, and three children. The Commissioners estimated variously that amount at the present time to be something in the region of £ 5 16s. per week; but after the Commission had submitted its report, .and had been asked for in awarding that amount as a basic wage, it is awarding something which is to be provided for 2,100,000 non-existing children. We find that, instead of 3,000,000 children, the number estimated to be possessed, as it were, by 1,000,000 workers, is .90 per cent, for each worker. TheI t will be the duty of the report of the Commission, therefore, does not reveal the real position. Again, the Commission was not asked anything in regard to the possibility of the Commonwealth being able to pay the wage it considered adequate. It is highly important that this should be determined. We entered into a war along with the whole of. the Empire and certain Allies, and was it expected by any honourable member in this House that we could fight a bloody war of the kind against the greatest military power in the world, continuing it for nearly five years, and still enjoy all the privileges we had before it started ? I am sure that many of us felt that if we could succeed in holding our liberty, and living through the terra of our natural lives after a struggle of that kind, we would not be doing badly. But the proposition that here in Australia we have a right to expect to maintain a higher standard of living than obtained before the war is I am utterly unreasonable. I value the supplementary report of Mr Piddington, the Chairman of the Basic Wage Commission, dington says, in fact, and in effect, that the wage of £ 5 16s. cannot be paid without rendering the Commonwealth bankrupt. In other words, he means that we would be called upon to pay for our production more than would be the value of that which is produced. It is a fanatical and utterly unreasonable request to ask for the payment of this basic wage as recommended by the Commission, and I It was a Comfeel quite sure that those who put it forward are paying too much consideration to their political position, and too littl e regard to the welfare.of Australia. We are also told in the supplementary report of the Commission that if a wage of £ 5 16s. be granted, trouble w ill commence in the first three months, because with such an addition to the cost of living, the purchasing value of the sovereign will so decrease that tbe Commission will need to be called upon again to institute a new inquiry, and fix upon a new standard.

If 1 am called upon to pay this increased wage, particularly at a time when I am selling my wheat to Australia at less than the world's parity, that is to say, if I am asked to continue producing wheat a t a very much higher cost, my position will be that I shall expect my children to work night' and day for me without the basic wage, simply in order people with a high wage and cheap bread. If the basic wage is applied, it must increase the cost of production and also reduce production. And it has only to continue long enough in force to extinguish production altogether. must call a halt at some reasonable point. In this HouseI have said before that the principle adopted in our Public Service is quite wrong. We have nearly 250,000 public servants in the service of 5,,000,000 people-one Commonwealth. altogether, and the services rendered are not sufficiently co-ordinated lines. I am thoroughly in favour of the adoption of business methods nexion with our Public Service, and I was hopeful that the Government bring forward their Bill, which proposed to institute an inquiry into the management of the Service, and the possibility of adopting business methods. would rather we had first proceeded with that Bill instead of dealing with the question of adopting the principle of a basic wage. I would like to see all public servants for whom a reasonable amount of work cannot be obtained in the provided with other work in outside the Service. Their removal would allow the payment of reasonable wages fo those who would be left in the Service. The Commonwealth £40,000,000 each year to the persons who render public service-I state of affairs would be found if the work were let on contract subject to specification-and should be practically doubled, and we are asked to pay close on £90,000,000 for the public services rendered people. advice of the Economies Commission, and rid the Commonwealth Service of men for whom a reasonable amount of work cannot be provided. In this way we could pay Mr Prowse. those remaining in the Service a decent salary. Those persons who are so inconsistent as to advocate the payment of a basic wage of £ 5 16s. per week regardless of where the money is to be obtained with which to pay it , and at the same time urge a reduction of hours of labour, are, in my opinion, rushing headlong to destruction, and trying to drag down everything else with them. I rise to oppose the amendment moved to provide other by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). A few moments ago we had the opportunity of deciding, on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Tudor), whether we were in favour of having the necessary machinery estabTherefore, we lished to enforce the principles contained in the report of the Basic Wage Commission; but the House by a majority voted against the amendment.

Upon these matters Mr Piddington wrote a memorandum which the Prime Minister will not say whether he accepts or rejects. Therefore, those who vote for the amendment moved by the Treasurer, first of all reject the report of the Basic Wage Commission, and, secondly, do not know whether or not they accept the memorandum made by Mr Piddington. In his policy speech at Bendigo, the Prime Minister made a specific pledge to the people of Australia that he would appoint a Royal Commission to investigate these matters, and would enforce the findings of that Commission; but this House is asked to excuse him from carrying out that pledge, and to say, "" We do not want any findings of the Royal Commission upon the Basic Wage, but we want you to do something which is fair and reasonable."" members opposite want to have another standard set up. Of course, they are not appealing to the electors now, and, although they have been returned upon the pledge given by the Prime Minister, they are now seeking to excuse him from honouring it . They are to share the disgrace that would otherwise rest upon the shoulders of the Government. me that the Prime Minister did not agree to accept the finding of .the Commission. the right honourable gentleman's own words, as delivered at Bendigo, and which are as follow:The Government will at the earliest date possible create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. That is, to the principles that would be laid down in the findings of the Royal Commission. That is a definite pledge, and we are asked now to excuse the Prime Minister from its fulfilment, although the people have sent the Government back to office because that pledge was given, or, at all events, because it was part of the programme which the Government submitted to the people. The honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Tudor) has submitted an amendment which, boiled down, means this: ""Carry out your pledge; give effect, in some way or other, to the principles which are contained in the report of the Royal ComThe amendment moved by the Treasurer, on the other hand, says, "" W ill members of the House please excuse us from carrying out our pledge? Honourable members w ill please take a share of the responsibility with the Government."" The Prime Minister says, "" I reject this pledge "" ; and he does not know what he is going to do about Mr. Piddington's recommendation. Now, the Government, beyond saying that their actions w ill be f a i r and reasonable, ask us to give them carte blanche, to give them authority to fix on what, in their opinion, is f a i r and reasonable, and to release them from their solemn pledge. I shall not vote for such an amendment, and every honourable member who does vote for it must take the responsibility of excusing the Government from honouring their pledge. Here is the definite pledge, as I have just quoted it ; and here Honourable are the definite and unanimous findings of the Commissioners, in answer to clause 1 of the Letters Patent, which sets for t h that the main task of the Commission was to ascertain definitely the cost of living according to reasonable standards of comfort for the typical family The actual cost of living at the present time, An honourable member tells according to reasonable standards of comfort, including all matters comprised in the ordinary espenditure of a household, for a man with a wife, and three children under fourteen years One has only to look to of age, is in £ s. d.

But no honourable member opposite has suggested that that principle should be laid down. I do not know whether any of them would support such an amendment, but it is absolutely within the power of this Parliiiment to establish that principle in this B ill . It is of no use merely to listen to speeches from them proclaiming that the Arbitration Court cannot do certain things because this Parliament has not the power to lay down principles. We have the power to do so in this Bill.

We have the power to lay down the principle that the Public Service Arbitrator in arriving at a decision on the In fact, those question shall not prescribe any wage less than the basic wage fixed by the Basic Wage Commission now sitting, or by any duly constituted I am authority that may take its place.

I recall my remarks on that occasion, in order to show that I am not now seizing upon some new-fangled idea, but that I have always stood for what I say that there I am at this moment advocating.

The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) showed clearly, in the course of his speech last evening, that while, during the war, there were some rise3 in wages, the manufacturers made proportionately far greater increases in profits. The cost of -living during the war years became so great that some increases in wages were found to be absolutely necessary; but the rise in prices has been far in advance of the increases in wages. Now the Government wish to continue the same policy. They will not acknowledge their mistake, and they say, "" The recommendations of this Commission cannot be adopted."" The Prime Minister has two replies. First, he says, ""As far as the outside workers are concerned, we have not the constitutional power."" says, "" If we had the power to grant this basic wage, the country would be ruined by granting it . "" As for the first argument, tbere is ample power in the Constitution to give effect to the findings of the Basic Wage Commission, not only with regard to Commonwealth public servants, but in respect of industrial workers outside. Minister does not deny that he has the power with regard to Commonwealth public servants; and I remind him that there can be no dispute concerning whether there is power to grant the basic wage in connection with all matters such as InterState trade and the handling of commodities which are intended for transmission from one State to another. 'The Government have the power to fix a payment, as the b-'jic wage, according to the recommendations of the Commission. It is of no use, then, for the Government to allege some constitutional difficulty. I say there is no constitutional difficulty, and I assert that with some authority and with some knowledge of the subject. The time has come when this House must make some sort of declaration that will condemn the breaking of solemn pledges. The Prime Minister has broken every solemn pledge that he has made, and their violation has been condoned by the people. Was it not a solemn and definite pledge that the Prime Minister made in this case? Will any honourable member say that that pledge did not mean that The profiteer effect was to be given to the findings of the Commission? Will any one say that the Prime Minister did not intend to convey to the public of Australia that he regarded the wage of a man with a wife and three children as the unit from which we should build up ? If the right honourable gentleman found that he had made a mistake, why did he not at once admit it? Why did he not come to the House, and say, "" I find I . have made a mistake. I want to be excused from the carrying out of my pledge."" The fact is that this is but another illustration of the barefaced making of a pledge in order to get political support, and a subsequent barefaced breaking of that pledge. Honourable members are now asked to be parties to the breaking of that pledge. being used by honourable members opposite for party purposes. Labour party all through has contended for what my colleagues 'and I are contending this afternoon. We are not now raising this contention for the first time.

They do not, however, avail themselves of that power. They talk, but do nothing. Why have they allowed public servants during all these months to be paid a wage of only £3 5s. or £3 12s. a week, although they have wives and families to support. must some of these public servants and their families have gone hungry? We know that it is a characteristic of the Australian people to grin and bear their troubles. But during all that time honourable members opposite have had power to compel the Government to take action, and have seen fit only to talk about the matter. Why do they not act ?

The House has power to compel the Government, to take action, and it is up to us to use that power. All the country, which usually support the Government, are ashamed of their tactics with regard to the basic wage. The Government are barefaced enough'to make any pledge to a trusting public, and to break their pledges over and over again, merely that they may retain place and power. And to remain in power to do good for whom? For the class that made the Prime Minister a present of £25,000 -This is only another of a long series of broken pledges on the part of the 'Government. But in regard both to this and the pledge anade with respect to the wheat guarantee, honourable members are asked to condone the breaking of them. They are asked to excuse the Government -to actually vote to excuse their failure to give effect io a solemn pledge, and to give them carte blanche to do what they How often like. I am going to oppose this further amendment. If honourable members opposite wished, they could even now see to it that before the House adjourns we shall know exactly what the Government intend to do. If the amendment submitted on behalf of the Government is carried, all that we shall know is that they are going to scrap the Commission's reportthat they will go back upon it and upon their pledge. If honourable members opposite would take action even now, we could have some definite pronouncement as to the specific amount which will be paid to the public servants of the Commonwealth, and I , personally, shall not be satisfied with anything else. just awakened to the fact that the public servants of the Commonwealth during the past fortnight have secured from some honourable members of this House assistance which has never before been forthcoming at their hands.

The main body of public servants remained outside, but f if t y or sixty went on to the platform and gave one of the worse exhibitions of larrikinism I have seen. I told some of these men that they were not doing the Service any good, and advised them to go away and hold their meeting without harassing the Prime Minister; that there was nothing to be gained by that. This matter has been used for political party purposes, and the agitation is being engineered largely by the disloyal element in the Service.

But, although the Government does consider it absolutely impossible to put this report into effect, there are honourable members who make an attempt to' achieve the impossible, namely, to wage of £ 5 16s. per week to the least efficient workman in the community -that is what the payment of a basic wage means-Avhil e paying a proportionately higher wage for skill and more arduous work. I am prepared to question the contention of the honourable member for ""West -Sydney( Mr Ryan) that this Parliament has the power to put into effect this basic wage in all the industries of the Commonwealth. Commonwealth Government can certainly fix upon a basic wage for its own employees, even at the amount which the Commission has recommended as necessary to enable a workman to pay for what are considered reasonable comforts; but it certainly would not be riglit for the Government to fix for its own employees a wage that could not be earned by those doing similar work outside the Service. ""We must pay our public servants a wage that w ill enable them to live in reasonable comfort, and a wage equivalent to what they could earn outside the Service. Otherwise we shall lose the best of them, and the Service w ill become very much less efficient tha<n it is to-day. Many honourable members contend that it is Buti f we are to pay our public servants a wage of £5 I63. per week for the lightest and easiest class of work, what are we to pay the men working in the mines, --It has forests, and fields, who do hard and rough work? Surely they are entitled to a higher wage than is paid to those who have light employment in our Public Service, and who enjoy all the nice comforts demanded by city dwellers? Of course, if persons prefer to live in the city they oan have all these comforts; 'but if we choose to ill-pay our servants, some of them w ill have the courage to face the hardships of life, and, being anxious to enjoy what every man desires, a comfortable home, will leave the Service, leaving I repeat that it is fine behind them the worse to do our work, when we ought to have the best. However, if we pay £5 16s. per week to those employed in the Public Service and those engaged in city industries, whose cause the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Tudor) particularly supports, the men who work in our forests, mines, and fields w ill be compelled to work for less would remuneration, because this wage has to be earned before it can be paid. If a pay a basic man in the city is paid a wage over and above what he actually earns, it has to be made up from somewhere, and certainly the loser w ill be the man who works in the fields to provide food at the cheap rate demanded by the city dweller. The honourable member for Yarra and others have said that an industry that will not pay what they consider to be a fair wage should not continue to exist. There never was a greater absurdity utThe tered in this House. Are we going to close down one-third of our mines in Australia because they w ill not return £0 16s. per week to all the men employed in connection with them ? Wouldi t not | be equivalent to a man cutting his throat because he could not have all the comforts he desired?

There are men employed in the occupations I have referred to who do not earn £5 16s. per week, and who cannot expect to do so in view of the prices ruling for their productions. If all the men employed to-day in producing butter were to receive a wage of £5 16s. for a week of forty-four or fortyeight hours, instead of butter being 2s. lOd. per lb., as it is to-day, it would have would attempt to put it into effect. to be 6s. per lb.» ""Will the honourable member for Yarra and other honourable members opposite say that because the dairying industry does hot return to all employed in it £5 16s. for a week offorty-four hours they should cease to milk cows and produce butter ?

This Basic ""Wage Commission took evidence from partisan witnesses on both sides. said that they required much higher wages than they were getting, and they gave evidence as to the prices they paid for food, clothing, .and rent. suppose that any one will deny that some of the evidence given before the Commission with regard to the cost of commodities and the cost of living was very greatly exaggerated. other side put the cost of commodities at a much lower rate, and differed from the other witnesses as to the food and clothing required to give a reasonable standard of comfort. veyors of the commodities give evidence? Commission struck a balance between the two testimonies in trying to arrive at a wage necessary to provide for reasonable comfort. I believe that three members of this House, by a little reckoning, could, in the course of a day, decide the real cost of living to-day and the wage [288] necessary to enable men to live in reasonable comfort, and be very much nearer the mark than the amount fixed by a Royal Commission that has cost thousands of pounds, and occupied -many months in its inquiry. I say, without any hesitation, that the proposal put forward by Mr Piddington in his memorandum for differentiating between married and single could not be given effect, and will not bear examination. It is quite unworkable.

I am of opinion that this House should not be turned into a wage-fixing tribunal. We have already too many such tribunals in Australia. Every The witnesses for one side State has its own.

356,Mr Parkermoloney,"It is rer i d of the Government. Who is responsible for the findings of the Commission? Why was the basic wage established at 6uch high rates ? Can the Government relieve themselves of responsibility ? The .recommendations of the Commission were placed at such a high standard because .profiteering has been allowed so to flourish that the purchasing power of the sovereign has been tremendously decreased. If the Prime Minister had not made known to the country that it was not the intention of the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Commission, he would not have journeyed to Sydneyi n quite such good heart to receive that g if t of £25,000.

368,Mr Parkermoloney,"I amtake a case, which is typical of many, of a postal employee who was sent to an irrigation area just beyond my electorate at a wage of £90 per annum, or 35s. per week. This unfortunate employee, although receiving such a small remuneration, compelled to pay £2 10s. per week for board. Of course, he was not able to do it, and after endeavouring while, and finding that he was running into debt, he obtained work with Irrigation £4 lis. 6d. per. week. striking contrast? Heydon fixed the basic wage for New South Wales at £2 Ss. per week. I have before me particulars clerical officer in grade 2, class 4 of the Oommonwealth at that time receiving £245 per annum, Or £120 per annum above the basic wage which represented an additional for skill and responsibility. officer in the same class is being paid £245 per annum, plus a war bonus of £32, which makes his salary £277 per annum, which means that the amount that he can claim for skill and responsibility apart from his bonus is £21 as against £120 previously. bf the Royal Commission's finding, which provides £5 17s. per week, he would not receive even £30 as an additional muneration but there would be a deficit of £26, as that margin has been entirely with. There are a number of other cases which I could mention. In New South Wales, for instance, the railway are paid in accordance with a basic wage of £4 5s. per week, and to institute a striking comparison I may mention wages of the railway telegraphic staff in New South Wales and the postal telegraphic staff. One officer with years' experience in a country receives £280 per annum,.whilst an officer on the railway telegraphic staff in a town a few miles away with ten vears' service receives £315 per year. the case of an officer with years' in the Commonwealth vice and who receives num, . graphic service with six years' service who is in receipt of £255 per annum. There are also two officers, one on the rkilway telegraphic 'staff and another on Mr Parker Moloney. the Commonwealth telegraphic staff. The Commonwealth employee w it h six years' service receives £126 per annum, and the State employee on the railway telegraphic staff, also w it h six years' was experience, receives £ 2 55 per annum. I do not suggest that the amount paid to the employee on the Railto do so for a way telegraphic staff is too much. According to the findings of this Comthe mission, he is not getting enough; but it Trust, which paid him w ill be seen that whereas a CommonIs this not a wealth officer in the Post and Telegraph In 1914 Mr Justice Service receives only £126 a year, an officer doing similar work in the State railway service is receiving £255 per of a married annum, or £4 18s. as against £2 Ss. per week. While officers in the telegraph Public Service who was branch of the railway service have been receiving a basic wage for a number of years, not a supporter of the Government, payment before the presentation of this report, was To-day that prepared to utter a word in favour of the levelling up of Commonwealth servants.

He knows that if lie can only succeed in dividing our public servants amongst themselves, the whole issue will be side-tracked. And so he resorts to his old tactics. I do not believe, however, that his attitude is endorsed, or that it will be countenanced, by the great bulk of those who sit behind him. It is inconceivable that they could endorse it. When the right honourable gentleman wants to extricate himself from an awkward position, he invariably raises as a side issue something that will appeal to the passions and prejudices of the people. That is what he did this afternoon. It was a most discreditable action. He referred by name to a gentleman who, I presume, was voted to the position of president of the Agitation Committee by the great body of public servants in New South Wales. known Nationalist. know that. In order to camouflage the attitude of thc Government, he refers specially to this man's name, and says that the demand for the basic wage is being made, not by the Public Service generally, but only by a section of it, and that this agitation is -being engineered by some hidden force. In this way the Prime Minister endeavours to cover up the shame of his having violated a solemn pledge. He is not likely, however, to bamboozle the Public Service or the great mass of the people. The Public Service of the Commonwealth are alive to their own interests, and will not allow themselves to be influenced by any such consideration as that suggested by the right honourable gentleman in such attempts. I think he largely stands alone. There is only one other aspect of this question to which I desire to refer. Prom time to time discussions have taken place in this House, as well as on public platforms, as to the efficacy of Labour Governments in certain States. heard the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) say, on many occasions, as was said during the recent Queensland and other State elections, that the cost of living in Queensto what is a fair basic wage. There is, land, where a Labour Government has ; been in power for some years, is not less than that in any other State. We. now have the definite finding of an independent Commission that a basic wage of £5 6s. per week is sufficient in. Queensland, as compared with a basic wage running up to £5 17s. per week in States whore anti-Labour Governments have been in office for years. No one can deny these figures. They show that, as the result of a Labour Government having been in power for years in Queensland, the cost of living there is from 16 per cent, to 20 per cent, less than in any otlier State of the Commonwealth. distribution of population. There is no reference in the report to any Labour Government. honourable member will, of course, put his own construction upon the figures. the same in Western Australia., where there is a similar distribution of population. honourable member cannot get away from the fact that the report of this independent Commission shows that the cost of living in Queensland is less than in other parts of the Commonwealth. ' If every State had been controlled by a Labour Government, as Queensland has been for some years past, the Commonwealth today would not be in the hopeless position. of being financially unable, according to the Government, to give effect to the findings of the Commission. These figuresof an independent authority prove that,, as a result of Labour legislation in Queensland, the people there have a cheaper loaf, and a cheaper breakfast table, and are able to enjoy a greater modicum of comfort than the people of any other State. That is a very pleasing feature of this report. It is sad to learn from it that the public servants of the Commonwealth have been ground down for a number of years, and have been living under conditions infinitely worse than those of their fellow servants in the emI have ploy of the States. The Commission has made the fullest inquiries, and has occupied over twelve months in collecting the data upon which it bases its findings a3 therefore, no reason for further delay.",62,Lamond Ther E T R U Ly Member Is So Anxious To Get His B I L L

'Surely tbe findings of the Commission can be depended upon. The members of the Commission have had over twelve months in which to ascertain the facts, and every person in the community who believes in a f a i r thing w ill regard as most discreditable the action of the Government in violating the solemn pledge which they made to the people at the last general election. convinced that every honourable member of this House desires to do the right thing by the employees of the Commonwealth. The only question that concerns us is how are the Government going to give effect to the recommendation of the Commission ? got different basic wage rates declared by different tribunals. I doubt very much whether these inquiries have 0 duced any very satisfactory results, but it is one thing to criticise a report and another to suggest a remedy. I regretthat the scope of the Commission did not include an instruction to inquire how the basic rate of wage to be declared could be given effect to, and I agree with the honourable member Tudor) that the first requisite of any democratic country is that its employees shall be paid a sufficient living wage to insure all the reasonable comforts that people may expect to enjoy. We are now confronted with the deliberate statement that it is impossible to'pay every employee £ 5 16s. or £ 5 17s. per week, according to the State-in which such employee lives, which the Commission has declared to be the basic rate of wage'for a man, his wife, and three children. The Chairman of the Commission ( Mr Piddington), whose opinion must be respected, has made a suggestion as to how the recommendation may be carried out, namely, by paying one rate of wage to the unmarried man and another rate to the married man with children. to? marriage. age the bosses to get r i d of the married men. been made several times, but so far as I understand Mr Piddington's suggestion, the employers would be called upon to pay the'same wage to all employees, whether married or single, but that in addition to such payment the employers shall pay into a special fund .a per capita amount for all their employees, married or single, from which a payment of 12s. per week shall be made for each child. This is rather a revolutionary scheme, but it is not altogether I am new. It is similar, I think, to the proposal made by the Holman Government not very long ago in New South Wales, but which, I believe, was found to be impracticable. by the Nationalist party in the UpperI am afraid we have House. but I know the suggestion was made, and I regret that it was not given effect to. proI t might not have been successful, but I think we shall have to experiment along those lines. According to Mr Piddington, the payment of the basic wage to every employee in 'the Commonwealth would represent an additional expense of £93,000,000 per year, and according to Mr Knibbs, an additional expense of for Yarra( Mr £101,000,000. It needs very little thought to realize that this would be an impossible burden for the industries of the Commonwealth. The honourable memshown that it would be impossible for some of the most important industries to pay this rate of wage, and that, if it were adopted, they would have to close down altogether. In the interests of the workers themselves, it is only fair that the Go-, vernment should have opportunity for further consideration of this report. It -is generally acknowledged that the wages at present being paid in the Public Service are not sufficient, and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has promised to increase the amount up to the old basic rate of wage, plus the present purchasing power of the sovereign, that is, the wages shall have the same purchasing power as in 1907.

384,Ber For Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams) Has,"into the recommendations of the Commission, and the drastic suggestions made by the Chairmani n his memorandum. The suggestion that the report will be pigeon-holed and forgotten is altogether unfair. The whole position is to be reviewed, and the Government will make a suggestion as to how best to give effect to the report of the Commission, so that every man and woman in the Commonwealth Public Service, at any rate, and, incidentally, all those employed in Australian industries, may get a fair living wage. I do not see anything unreasonable in this proposal. It appears to me to be the only way by which the difficulty may be overcome. For that reason I welcome the amendment proposed, and intend to give it my support. As the representative of the city of Sydney, where a large proportion of the population of Australia is concentrated, I feel compelled to say a few words about the report of the Commission that was appointed by the Government to inquire iuto the basic wage question. It is to be regretted that certain honourable members are in a flippant mood, because, in my judgment, no more important document has ever been presented to the Commonwealth Parliament. The Basic Wage Commission was appointed to give effect to an election promise of the Prime Minister, and no one knows better than he that it was intended that its recommendations should apply to the whole of the industrial l if e of Ausshould have been similarly treated. As tralia, and not to the Federal Public Service alone. pointed out that the fixing of a basic wage was first discussed in 1906, and in 1908, in what is known as the Harvester case, a basic wage was embodied in an award of the Arbitration Court. Prom that time unto the present that award has not been reviewed. No exception was taken to the composition of the Commission, because the men appointed as representatives of the employers and employees were closely identified with those sections of the' commu-* nity respectively; nor has it been said that the Commission's recommendations are not based on the evidence which was put before it . Before any matter affecting conciliation, arbitration, industrial peace, and the like, can be dealt with, there must be an agreement as to .the basic wage of the industry concerned. This National Parliament ie the only body that can settle the matter for the whole of Australia. Y et honourable members opposite have employed all their ingenuity to prevent a direct vote being taken, and to avoid facing the issue. It will not be disputed that the party in power is under the influence of the employing section of the community, and, when the Commission'6 report reached the Prime Minister, his first thought was for the interests of that section, not for those of the public servants or of the general community. Therefore, he took steps to obtain a document-whic h was produced at a speed hitherto unknown-to cloud the recommendations of the Commissioners. I do not think that he should have done that. His course was to take the House into his confidence, eo that one of Australia's chief problems might be solved, and the cause Of industrial peace advanced thereby. Undoubtedly the Crown, as an employer,should, in its treatment of the public servants, set an example to other employers. But this Government has paid no proper regard to the Pederal Public Service. Honourable members generally have complained that the public servants are not paid what they should receive for the work that they do for the community. W ill any one say that the people of Australia wish their, servants to be underpaid? The State Governments have applied basic rates in the payment of their public services, and the Federal Commonwealth Service for the cry that the country cannot afford My Leader( Mr Tudor) to pay the recommended basic wage, I say that there never was a reform which meant the shortening of hours, the. increasing of pay. or the improvement qf any condition without the objection being raised that it could not be done, ber cause it would ruin the country. We never hear it said, however, when railway and tramway fares are raised, ' when farmers are getting 9s., 10s., and 15s. a bushel for their wheat, when the prices of meat, butter, and other foodstuffs are increasing by 100, and in some cases 200, per cent., and when there is a general rise in prices, that the country will be ruined,'and that the people cannot afford to pay what is asked of them. The members opposite display a spirit of callous indifference. They show an utter disregard of the interests of the workers. I well remember the occasion upon which",64,Lamond Ther E T R U Ly Member Is So Anxious To Get His B I L L
385,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.29],"the late MrE . W. O'Sullivan, Minister for ""Worksi n the Government of New South ""Wales, decided to increase the pay of railway navvies to 7s. per day. The proposal was denounced by the press as a n impossible one, and the cry was immediately raised that the country could not afford to pay it . fact, the country did pay it , and no serious results followed. This afternoon, the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) stressed the point that the fruit-growers of the Commonwealth would not be able 'to' grow f r u it if the industry were compelled to pay this basic ""wage. But of what use is it for anybody to produce .commodities if the people do not possess sufhcient money to purchase them? seems to me that honourable members have not realized the true significance of the report of the Basic Wage Commission, and how intimatelv the adoption «of the recommendations of that body will affect the da:ly lives of our people. I intend to send a few copies of that report to the Old Country, and also to America, accompanied by some comments, and I am confident that before very long the Labour-party in those countries will be following in our footsteps. What a splendid advertisement it would be for Australia, especially when it is seeking to attract a large stream of immigrants to its shores, if we could point with pride to the fact that we were paying the basic wage which has been recommended by the Commission ! As honourable members are aware, a supplementary report upon this matter ""has been issued by Mr Piddingtona report-containing a mass of figures. The impression conveyed by this supplementary report is that the industries of Australia cannot afford to pay the basic wage recommended by the Commission. I have no hesitation in sayingthat this country is well able .to pay a basic wage sufficient to enable all workers to maintain themselves and their families in a reasonable degree of comfort. Sir member has not said a word about the report. He has been talking all round the world. some yearsago when an increased wage was being sought by the miners of New South Wales. We were then assured that the industry could not possibly pay it a suggestion which was vigorously combated by the present Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). He also affirmed that industries which could not afford to pay a living wage ought not to continue to exist. That is not so Very long ago. As a representative of Sydney, I know that I am expected to voice the opinions of m y constituents. As I said before, I am But, as a matter of sorry that the House has not displayed that spirit and frame of mind which are necessary to the proper consideration of this question. Whether the report of the Comimission be a proper one or not, we should have set ourselves determinedly to solve the problem involved. Howeveri n different honourable members may be, or however much they may t r y to Side-track the issue, it is an issue which must be It settled sooner or later. What is the good of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act, or our Industrial Peace Act, unless there is some standard on which decisions may be based ? There is no doubt that once a standard is available, much of the work of the Court wil l be rendered unnecessary, and the congestion of business to that extent relieved. The question of wages crops up in almost every case which conies before our arbitration tribunals, and it is a great pity that one of the most i m portant reports ever tabled should lack proper consideration because of mere political prejudice. have to admit at the outset that I have not given a great deal of study to the report which is the subject of discussion today; but to the extent to which I have dipped into it I feel that it provides no reliable store of information to enable me to solve the difficult problem that is before Parliament at the present time. This Commission has taken twelve imonths for its investigations, and has covered a great deal of ground. It-has produced a report abounding in much pseudo-scientific terminology ; but it seems to me to have missed altogether some of the simplest and most fundamental propositions that ought to be embodied in a report of the kind. The idea of determining a basic is no such'thing as a basic wage, in spite ""of the amount of talk devoted to the subject. When the suggestion was added that I can recall the occasion the Commission should consider and in quire into some methods by which wages may be identified with the rise and f a l l of the-value of the sovereign, I say without hesitation that it was given an absolutely impossible task. I am surprised, indeed, at any practical man attempting",65,Lamond Ther E T R U Ly Member Is So Anxious To Get His B I L L

387,Mr Fowler (Perth) [5.53],"Ito carry into effect the suggestions embodied in the instructions by the Prime Minister. The Commission deals very learnedly, to all appearances, in scientific terms of quite formidable character. It speaks of "" tentative regimen,"" "" calories,"" and "" coefficients,"" u n t i l one would men who constituted this Commission. imagine that the members of the Commission are highly technical and skilled experts in these matters. That, in my opinion, to a large extent is misleading the country. I do not think that any of those gentlemen are anything more than amateurs in regard to investigations along these lines, and I feel sure that in some regards they are fundamentally at fault. It is suggested that a basis can be fouud for the cost of liviug in the amount of calories-to use the so-called scientific term-require d to enable a man to carry on an average day's work. Here is where the mistake is made by the Commission, and it is a mistake habitually made by all theorists in dealing with matters that refer to huiman beings. The elusive human element is l e f t out of sight or forgotten altosibility. The suggestion he made was one gether. When any one talks to me about so many "" c a l o r i e s "" being required to produce a certain amount of health and vigour, I say, as one who has had considerable association"" with working conditions of various kinds, that it is a notable fact that men who sometimes live on the most meagre diet ihow more energy, and carry out more work, than others alongside them who eat three times the quantity. argument for starving men. observation, which I commend to the honourable member for a little more study than he has given to the subject up to the present. I remind honourable members that a certain quantity of goods can be bought from the grocer, baker, or butcher,, which, handed over to one housewife,' will produce sufficient satisfying and healthy food for a big family for a whole week, while the same materials, handed to another woman, will starve a family in a couple of days. These are facts which have to be taken' into consideration. When I am told that it requires £ 5 16s. to keep a family of five-tw o adults and three children, I say that, while a man is entitled to that amount, if he earns it . there are numerous larger families maintained,oand well maintained, in Australia to-day on considerably less. I do not for a moment say that there should be anything less than a living wage for everybody in this country j I am merely indicating one of the reason? for discounting, to a large extent, the findings of the gentleThen, -again, if they had taken into consideration the simplest facts of political economy, they must have realized that, in establishing this basic one to-day, they were creating conditions that would require a recasting of the wage a few days later; in other words, the addition to the extent suggested to the cost of production would undoubtedly increase the prices of production, so that the communiy would, to use a homely allegory, be exactly in the same position as a puppy dog chasing its own tail. Therefore, I say that the money and time devoted to this inquiry are very iir.uch misapplied, and I cannot acquit the Prime Minister himself of a considerable proportion of the responwhich is somewhat 'characteristic of him as a way of getting out of a difficulty, but it was an ill-judged suggestion. He had sufficient evidence before him, if he wished to treat the public servants fairly, to.have taken action without waiting for twelve months for this ponderous and unpractical report. The Opposition have made considerable play on this issue. I suppose it is one of the misfortunes in regard to politics and parliamentary action, that when a subject does offer an opportunity for anyI t is a very sensible party to make good upon, the opportunity will be seized. I am certain that if members of the Opposition had been sitting on the Government benches when this report was presented, they would have had to take up exactly the position that has been taken up by the present Government. It would have been forced upon them by circumstances. There is indeed no alternative offering to any Government in regard to the propositions included in the report. I admit that the time is more than ripe for some attention to be given to the conditions affecting particularly the lower classes of the Public Service. These men and women have been grossly underpaid for many years past, and the manner m which the vast majority of them have continued to carry out their work under",66,Joseph Cook The Honourable Wage Is Altogether A Pernicious One There

I do not think the most biased person in Parliament would call the Sydney Daily Telegraph a Labour journal. its vember, discussing the report of the Commonwealth Basic Wage Commission, prints an article with the significant heading, "" TypicalB it of Hughesism."" This journal refers to the appointment of the Commission, and in an examination of the reasons which actuated the Government gives the history of the Commission as follows: The question naturally is asked : If the Commonwealth authorities have no power to fU a basic wage applicable to the Commonwealth, why was this Royal Commission issued ? What was to be gained by this lengthy and expensive inquiry if its findings are to' be made applicable only to the Federal Public Service, and perhaps a few industries? The answer .is found in the history of the Commission. It represents a typical bit of Hughespeople. Now that the Government has ism. The first announcement about the Commission was made by Mr Hughes, when, prior tn the last election, he delivered his policy speech at Bendigo, on 30th October, 1919. On that occasion he said :-Means must be found which will insure that the minimum wage shall be adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with the cost of living, so that, within the limits of the minimum wage, at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of the necessaries of life. That That briefly discloses the purpose for which the Commission was appointed, apart altogether from the vote-catching aspect of the matter. It was intended that the Commission should lay down a decent standard of comfort for those people in Australia who are obliged to work for wages ister was thinking about was votes. the chickens come home to roost in the shape of the report delivered by the ComThey are not missioners, he raises the cry that it is impossible to give-effect to it . In a lengthv, rambling, theatrical speech in this chamber he claimed that it was impossible for Australia to pay the living wage as laid down by the Commissioners. He said, When, "" The, wealth is not in the country."" If the wealth is not in the country, it is because the Prime Minister and his party sold the primary products of this country during the war at far less than they were worth, causing the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds to Australia.

It has been stated that, by raising wages, we are only going in a vicious circle, since every rise in wages is followed by an increase in the cost of living. unduly increase the price of commodities, it is no solution of the nroblem to increase wages. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) has pointed out that the undue profits made by big businesses were made from prices that were proportionately greater in excess of the increase in wages. No effective machinery has been provided during the last four years by this Government teering, and the legislation passed by the present Government has been intended rather to protect the interests of the profiteer than those of the worker. Some members of this House carry on_ private businesses from which they derive considerable incomes apart from their parliamentary salary, and the struggle for existence does not greatly concern them. Some of them are so patriotic as to say that if the Federal Capital is transferred to Canberra tbey will resign from the National Parliament. We cannot expect such men to have much sympathy with tlie hardships of the under-dog and the sweated worker. Many of the men to whom I refer belong to the class of profiteers who made huge profits out of the participation of Australia in the war. It would be well if the scales were drawn fro m the eyes of the people in order that they might understand what Nationalism or "" Hughesism "" has done for the workers of this country. It has been responsible for increasing enormously the cost of living, and as I have already said, the bungling of the Prime Minister has been responsible for the fact that men who are not wage-earners, but producers of primary products, have not received a fair return for their labour because of the low prices obtained for their products overseas. We have been robbed, and the workers have been robbed, whilst the profiteers are the' only persons who have gained any advantage through the present Government being in power. They have looked after the in terests of the profiteers, and, either wilf u l l y; or because they lacked ability, have failed to prevent the plundering of the wage-earners of the community. As One who has worked in Queensland, I am in a position to say that wages have been higher and the cost of livin g cheaper in that State than in any other State of the Commonwealth. We know that there has been the grossest misrepresentation of the conditions in QueensWhile the profiteer is allowed to land under a Labour Government. It is left to the report of the Basic Wage Commission to vindicate all that we have said about the better economic conditions in Queensland under Labour administration. During the war the worker in Queensland was 10s. a week better off than the worker in any other part of Australia so f a r as the purchasing power to prevent profiof the sovereign was concerned, and at the same time the wages he received were higher than those paid To workers in the other States. This proves that Labour administration in Queensland was better for the worker than the administration of the Commonwealth Government 'has been. fiteers hated me so much. they vilified the honourable gentleman at every turn, and endeavoured to misrepresent the true position of Queensland uncier his rule. The report of the Commission w ill do more than anything else to l if t the scales from the eyes of the workers of Australia and show them that Ryan does not mean ruin, as was represented by honourable members opposite during the last election. The report of their own Commission has been repudiated by the Government and their fol lowers, but it justifies the Queensland Labour party and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), who led that party during the war.

The whole matter bf the basic wage has been discussed and deI refer to the official publicacided upon, and the most cogent arguments which honourable members on this side could advance would now be unavailing. The Prime Minister and his supporters appointed the Commission to catch votes. Now they have repudiated its report; and they give, as a reason for so doing, the excuse that the Commonwealth cannot pay its servants a decent One can hardly living wage. However, the people will be the judges of that. If the Commonwealth cannot pay a fair thing it will be because the primary products of Australia during the past four years have been practically given away to people on the other side of the world, with the result that the workers of this country, have to sweat and pay more than ever for domestic necessities. All this is because From the exhibition of tactics of the bungling and mismanagement of the Government, ruinously led, as it is, by the Prime Minister. I am reminded Many members of the Public Service are not getting anything"" like the remuneration which they should receive; but when the Government are asked to pay a basic wage of £5 16s. 6d. the question inevitThen ably arises whether the resources of the country can stand the strain.

It would not be fair to the Service. I believe that when a majority of its members know that an honest attempt is being made to mete out justice to them, and after they have had an opportunity of carefully considering the report and realizing what is involved, they will be quite prepared to abide by the decision of the Government. I am anxious to see the public servants adequately paid; but I do not wish to express a definite opinion at this juncture, particularly when we do not know exactly what additional expenditure the country can carry. There is reason in all things, and I know the members of the Public Service will be among the first to admit that there must be some limitation on our capacity. The Commonwealth public servants, in common with other public servants, are in a very strong position in one sense, because when they are permanently appointed on the staff of any particular Department they are there unti l they reach the ret i r i ng age-that is, of course, if their begrasping its import. AlthoughI have haviour has been satisfactory. The same cannot be said of men wh.o are in private employment, because if their services ar«* not needed they can be dispensed with . For that reason, if for no other, Commonwealth public servants are in a comparatively safe position, and if work cannot be found for them in one Department there is no difficulty in transferring them to another. course, feel keenly, as do other members of the community, the appalling increase in the cost of living, and if we are going to pay £ 5 16s. a week, it will naturally mean that employers outside will be forced to follow, with the result that prices will be increased to such an extent that their position will not be improved in the slightest degree. It will simply be pursuing a vicious circle. If the basic rates mentioned in the report were to be adopted, the primary producers would, of course, be penalized, and the cost of everyday commodities would rise to an alarming extent. Do honourable members opposite think that if these rates were enforced that our primary and secondary I products would remain at present prices? In such circumstances increased wages would be of little value, and the GovernThey should receive the best ment are taking a very wise step in adopting the course suggested. The Prime Buti f we pay them more Minister( Mr Hughes) has made a fair offer in saying that the', Government but w ill go into the matter, and within a fortnight will announce what they consider a fair wage, which will operate from the 1st November. That is a reasonable proposal, and if we debated the matter for days I do not think a more satisfactory one could be suggested. do not wish to give a silent vote on this question, more particularly as I am in somewhat of a quandary. I certainly would not have voted for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), and I find myself confronted with a considerable difficulty in voting for the amendment moved by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). I do not suppose any report has come before this Parliament that is of greater importance than that which has been submitted by the Basic Wage Commission. It has far-reaching tendencies, and I question whether there is one member in this Chamber who has had an opportunity of thoroughly perused extracts from the document in the newspapers, it was not u n t i l this afternoon that I received a copy of the report. I doubt very much whether any honourable member has read the whole of it,, and I do not think any member would give a vote which may be the means of doing serious in ju ry to the f u t u r e prosperity of the The public servants, of Commonwealth. If the Government agree to pay a basic wag© of £ 5 16s. per week, it would not rest with the Public Service alone, but it would have to become the basic wage for the whole Commonwealth. It would be absurd. I always consider tliat the members of the. Public Service are holding permanent positions, and obtain benefits that are not enjoyed by those in private employment. I am not attacking members of the Opposition, but they are demanding that the rates mentioned in the report shovld be adopted. vernment to keep their pledge.",72,Joseph Cook The Honourable Wage Is Altogether A Pernicious One There

The Commission had reported upon the wage which it considered necessary to enable a man to support his wife and three children in a reasonable degree of comfort. There is not an honourable member in this Chamber who dares to go before the electors and say that a man ought not to receive a wage sufficient to enable him to maintain his wife and family in comfort. Had honourable members opposite been sincere, they would have voted for that amendment, the adoption of which would have given effect to the finding of the Commission. the basic wage which the Commission recommended could be paid or not. the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr. Atkinson) that the Royal assent has not yet been given to the B ill which we passed through this Chamber a night or two ago.

That is the proposal which the honourable member for Parkes rushed across from Sydney to assist the Government to carry.

I have said that I earnestly looked for some Nationalist supporter of the Government, or for some member of the Country party, at the meeting last night, thinking that, perhaps, as in Sodom and Gomorrah, there might be one good man ready to assist the public servants in their fight for justice.

Although this exhibition on ""the part of the Government and their supporters would have been a surprise to me before I knew them so well as I do now, it is no surprise to find them voting to assist the Prime Minister to-day, as in the past, to break another of his election promises.

It expresses approval of the statement made by the Prime Ministeri n regard to the basic wage, and, personally, I do not at all approve of it . I regard his statement only as second in importance to the report of the Commission itself, and with almost as much consternation. The whole history of this Basic Wage Commission proves it to have been a most mischievous idea. It started as an election pledge, regardless of the fact that it could not be carried out without certain alterations in the Constitution. Now that the report has been T h a t is so; and, produced, it is being used entirely by the Opposition for purely party and political purposes. The Labour party desire to have this proposal carried willy n ill y , without regard to consequences,' simply because an election pledge was given, and despite the fact that the Chairman of the Royal Commission himself admits that to carry it out in its entirety would absolutely dislocate and. destroy Australian industries. The position that has arisen is most serious. The question of providing a living wage for everybody in the community is one The fact that should be absolutely beyond party, going down, as it does, to the very root of our national progress, and being one of the girders of the fabric of Australian society. It should be determined in a most impartial and detached manner. I regret that, in an off-hand and haphazard fashion, the Prime Minister and the Government are going to dispose A b o u t 8,000. of the question of the application of the It was 5,000 before principle to the public servants, simply as the result of this report, which bear?

In fact, I think I am one of the few members who have received a definite vote of thanks from Public Service organizations for the manner in which I have advocated payment for the members of the Servicei n accordance with what other people in the community are receiving. WhetherI were in Parliament or out of it . I should always insist, and have always insisted, as f a r as was in my power, that men and women receive a fair return for their labour. But I believe in a proper adjustment of the whole problem. If the Government said, "" This is the basic wage, and we must carry it out,"" and if at the same time they submitted a proposition whereby the whole of the Public Service was to be properly overlooked and supervised, and the in cpmpetents, of whom there are many, weeded out, one could approve of their policy on this question.

The result of paying low wages in any Service is that only the .ncompeteut hands or those who are tied lip by financial and domestic burdens remain. do in the Public Service of the Commonwealth is to weed out incompetents, and pay decent wages to the good men who are left, giving them a sense of responsibility, and getting a proper idea of the true value of their work. I take it that the Government, in the business undertakings they are handling, are not to be regarded as a benevolent institution. They may pay old-age pensions and maternity bonuses, and in that respect act in a benevolent capacity; but when it is a question of getting value in the shape of work for money paid out to public servants, they should be as strict as any other business concern. Quite apart from this, I do not think a simple increase of wages to public servants, according to a report founded on evidence, such as we have had submitted to us and which inevitably raises all other wages, is a proper way to improve the general condition of the public servants, or, indeed, of the public at large. It is admitted in the report that it must make the condition of salaried men worse. I-object to the whole process by which the various basic wages have been built up during the last twelve or fifteen years. It is said that Mr Justice Powersi n 1917 laid it down that these awards should be buil t upon scientific and humane principles, and arrived at only after securing all the authentic materials available. The construction of the report before us is not scientific, nor has it been built up on all the authentic materials which could have been, and ought to have been, obtained in the proper consideration of a subject of this kind, which reaches riglit down to the basis of Australian society. humane than it is humane to give a youngster lollies indiscriminately to suck.

Mr Piddington says that if effect is given to the basic wage the Tariff would be wholly inoperative to prevent the market from being flooded with cheaper goods from overseas.

However, M.D., Sir this is an ideal of the future. Mr Bellhouse, A t present, because in each State the Mr J. people are living uuder haphazard systems, and a basic wage has been fixed by a local Mr Tribunal on unscientific lines it is i m perative that the Commonwealth Government should do something to bring its own servants at least up to the standard of the basic wage in each particular State, and I will support that. If , in the Public Service, we are going to start a sys-. tem of wage payment according to the 6ize of a man's family-whic h may possibly be a correct and a . just system-it must be remembered that the method cannot be applied to employers generally without bringing about a serious result. It is introducing a new principle into industrial arrangements that deserves very f u l l consideration. having no children, or only one or two, ployment. "" Then, to prevent and to encourage the rearing of families, the Government will have to step in and subsidize employers, to insure the payment of commensurate wages to familied employees. I would like to see.this principle, which in itself is almost as far reaching as the subject of the basic wage, discussed at a stage of the session when it is likely to be debated on its merits. first for having, in a mischievous way, handed tlie problem of the basic wage over to a Commission which, in my opinion, was .not competent to investigate it , and for having presented to Parliament and the people the findings of the Commission, knowing they cannot be put into operation except in a very small particular, and can only unsettle industry. AndI further condemn the Government for having brought forward the subject matter at a time when it cannot be considered as a question of such magnitude should be. [9.49] -The only trouble with the report of the Basic Wage Commission is that, when it was presented at the head of the Government, it was found to be ability to govern the Commonwealth, it loaded. When the Prime Minister prois time they made room for those who mised to create such a Commission, and can.

The Commission has fixed varying rates averaging approximately £ 5 16s. per week, and the Government and their supporters now say that such rates cannot be paid. It is. an absurd stand to take, and the suggestion isi n keeping with the general policy of the Conservative section of this chamber. As has already been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), a similar statement was made when the basic wage was fixed, at 42s. per week. It was said that Australia would be ruined, and now when a Royal Commission clothed w i th Menf u l l powers to make a'thorough investigation has come to the decision that £ 5 16s. will receive preference of em6d. per week is a living wage for a man, that, his wife, and three children, we are told that if it were paid, industries would be ruined, and that financial chaos would prevail.

The suggestion to reconsider the rates every three' months is ridiculous, as it would only give the proI condemn the Government, fiteering class a further opportunity of exploiting the workers, and making more money. The rates should be re-arranged every fortnight, and, although such a suggestion may seem ridiculous. I believe it is one that .should be adopted.

The wage-earners were told to vote for the great National Party, because its policy was one that would be the means of improving the conditions of every member of the community, and some silly idiots believed them. I could mention six constituencies in Victoriai n which the electors were hopelessly deluded. Although the basic wage rate for Victoria has been fixed at £ 5 16s. 6d., I believe the Government do not intend paying more than £ 4 4s.. which means that they are going to ask a man who has a wife and three children to support to accept £ 1 12s. 6d. less than the Commission, which was ""specially appointed to make an investigation considers necessary. have been waiting patiently for many months for a decision to be reached, and men have charged the workers' representatives on the Commission with delaying the publication of the report. The working men toria are in a more serious position than those in New South Wales, where the Government have to a degree settled the question. When the New South Wales basic wage was fixed at £ 3 17s., the Victorian rate was about £ 2 8s., and when the New South' Wales rate was increased to £ 4 5s., the Victorian basic wage was' £ 3 2s. workers in Victoria have been waiting for the decision of this Commission, and now it has beeni received, the Government say they cannot give effect to it . We are -told by honourable members opposite that we are only in fayor of the public servants receiving an increased basic rate, but that is incorrect. This Parliament can effectively control the wages of the public servants. for public servants, other workers will naturally demand a similar amount. because they have been the worse paid section in the community. It is impracticable for a private employer to pay less than is paid in the Public Service. We deny the statement that this Parliament cannot assist the workers outside as well as those in the Public Service. increase the price of commodities, wages must also be increased, and, as I have said on a previous occasion, a daily wage of £ 1 is not too high, because it really requires that amount to enable a man with an average family to live in comfort. One hears on every hand of increasing rents, which are rising to the extent of 4s., 5s., and even 10s. a week. The Government guaranteed 5s. per bushel for the farmers' wheat at the railway sidings; but wheat is now 9s. per bushel. All other commodities have risen in price, and wages must be increased to meet the altered conditions. I doubt very much whether a discussion on the subject will ha've any effect; but it is the duty of honourable members to place their views before the people. I believe it would be in the interests of the public servants if they held stop-work meetings every day unti l their demands were conceded. I know there are many honourable members oppoThe workers of Australia site who would welcome such an event, because they believe they would then have an opportunity of dealing with them. and women in Vicweapon which has been used by industria l unions with great success during the last few years, and it would benefit the public servants if they adopted a similar course.

That strike, brief though it was, disorganized the whole State, and had it The continued much longer would have brought about a condition of chaos. The position would be the same in the event of a strike of Commonwealth public servants. If the seamen or those engaged iu the buildiug or carrying trades go on strike, the effect is injurious to many of the'r fellow workers, but such occurrences open the eyes of the community to the real sore in our social system.

526,Mr Wise,"We have been here for tenhave had a long session, aud that attendance in Parliament entails heavy work on Ministers, but we might very well have continued the sitting for another week in order to deal with a report for which the ""workers have been waiting* for so many months. This report relates to the very life's blood of the wage-earning section of the community, and they expect us to deal with it at once. The Prime Minister this afternoon did not display the good temper that I should have shown had there been thrown at me the little present that he received a night or two ago. He dealt with this question in a way which, no doubt, was amusing to some of his supporters, but he might well have asked the House to sit next week m order that this quest'on might be f u l l y considered,and a definite decision arrived at. The public have not been taken by surprise. Thev have been expecting the fixing of a basic wage. W ill any one say that it was thought that the Commission would recommend a basic wage involving an increase of only four or five shillings per week on the existing rate? that the Prime Minister had no such anticipating. He is too keen a student of economics to have expected anything of the kind. is as bad as you would have us believe, wby is it that whenever there is any industrial trouble you people run to h i m to get you out of it? Prime Minister of Australia. If there is -any industrial matter that comes within his jurisdiction, and concerning which njy constituents complain, I shall not hesitate to bring it before him. Another point is that he has taken.good care to clothe himself with more power than has. any other man in Australia. He is, indeed, the only man in the Commonwealth with any power. The people have not yet recognised that fact. They gave him a new lease of power last December, and I shall continue to put before him every industria l grievance with which he has power to deal. It is my duty to do so, and it is his duty to listen to my representations. I do not want to see any trouble over this matterI am afraid that I am too often speaking of threatened trouble-bu t I am satisfied that the public servants of Australia are determined on this occasion to secure their rights. It is nonsense to I admit that we say that the country cannot afford to pay the basic wage. The Commonwealth can pay it , but it is useless to pay it unless at the same time the Government take steps to keep down the cost of' living. Unless that is done, a re-adjustment w ill be necessary from time to time. A word now as to the position of the womenfolk of the community. In dealing with the basic wage, I hope that the Government will not discriminate between married and single men, nor as between the sexes. A woman nowadays needs as much to live on as a man. We are told that the women want to dress too well. That may be a weakness on their part; but every man prefers to see a woman well drassed, rather than dressed in a dowdy fashion. In respect of clothing alone, apart from the cost of board and lodging, a single woman wants the same wage as a man. member think that a man with a wife : and family should have more than a single man ? I am sure differentiating in this regard between married and siugle men, for the reason that if the wage fixed for a single man is less than that for a married man, private employers w ill employ only single men. There are many ways by which a man with a family may be assisted without differentiating between his pay and that of a single man. The Statei n many ways can assist his children from their birth. The State should provide them with medical attention and medicine, and, where necessary, with nurses. It should also provide for the education of the children, from the primary .school to the U n i versity. Not only should it provide them with free instruction, but with all school requisites, and if the child of a poor man has brains, and goes to the University, the State, where necessary, should provide that child with food and clothing. In the olden days, when a man paid £ 1 a week for his board and lodging, a woman had to pay only 10s. or 12s. per week. To-day it is not possible for a woman to get decent board and lodging for less than 30s. a week, and, in addition, she must keep herself in clothing and all the other necessaries. I do not want to labour the matter, but I trust sincerely that this question of .sex in relation to the basic wage w ill not be dealt with now as it has been in the past, and",88,Joseph Cook The Honourable Wage Is Altogether A Pernicious One There

Of course, if a woman cannot perforin the work done by a man, she should not expect the same rate of pay; but it is the duty of the Government to see that' every person in the community gets a fair living wage. It has been stated that the industries of the Commonwealth w ill not be able to pay this basic wage. What nonsense! If an industry is in that position, it is clear that the public are underpaying for its p r o ducts. mines throughout the Commonwealth > are to be brought up to the standard fixed by this Basic Wage Commission. should like to see many mines closed down, for I know it would be much better, from the point of view of health, if the men engaged in them were employed on the land, even if , after a few years' work there they turned round and ' voted not for the party that made it possible for them to go on the land, but for the Conservative section of the commuunity. The statement that an industry cannot afford to pay the basic wage is nonsense. fellmongering industry was the lowest paid in Victoria; but when it was demonstrated that if the industry could not pay better wages it would have to go out of existence, those connected with it very soon found it possible to pay better wages. Take the case of the f a r m worker. If the effect of paying the basic wage to him w ill mean increased prices for f a r m products, well, it w ill be nothing new. Wheat, butter, and other products have already gone up in price, so that this w ill only mean another re-arrangement. But if we agree to pay the basic wage throughout the Commonwealth, and do not take prompt steps to put down profiteering, the basic wage w ill not be sufficient for very long; there will have to be a rearrangement about every month. GladI t was laid down in 1901 as I would be to see the Government placed in an awkward position by their refusal to give effect to this recommendation, because ' I am one of those to whom political victory is very sweet, I do not want to see them in any such difficulty at all. I would rather they adopted the basic wage, in order that the people might be in an improved position financially. I hope, therefore, that before this session closes something practical will be done. -This movement for the basic wage is another declaration of the war that is going on all over the .world; but it is not, based on scientific principles. I should like to -see a wage fixed for the man and woman as husband and wife, and provision not for three children, but four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or twelve children. If the basic wage is paid to the husband and wife, there could then be no question We have been told that many of differentiation between single and married, men, because the single man, if he will have to close down if miners' wages had any sense, would hope soon to find a good Australian girl to be his ; I mate. It is. the duty of the State to look after the child. Por thirty years I have been endeavouring to persuade the powers that be to endow every woman with the right to go to the Government and claim a pension for her child. The elder Napoleon was the greatest friend of woman and child the world has ever seen. Under the Code Napoleoni t is impossible for the husband to disinherit his wife or children. No child asks to come into the world, no child ca'n come into the world, unless the There was a time when the parents meet; every child is the future unit of the State, and every unit of the State has rights that neither parents nor the State can deprive it of. It has the right to claim proper food, shelter, clothing, in order to become a healthy adult. I want to see woman idealized, and to be able to claim.'as her right, all these things for her child, as the future unit of the State. I am glad that Mr. Piddington has named 12s. as the sum which should be set aside for the upbringing of each child. What lesson is this for the Military Department in regard to their treatment of the children of deceased soldiers! W h a t a lesson it is to that mean-spirited Treasurer of Victoria",89,Joseph Cook The Honourable Wage Is Altogether A Pernicious One There

535,"( Mr Mcpherson), Who Says That Children","can be brought up on 8s. per week. wonder how he would like his own children brought up on that sum. According to Mr Piddington's figures, parents with twelve children, and for some years they could all be under sixteen years of age, would get the basic wage of £ 4 per week, and the allowance of 12s. per week for each child would bring the total income to £ 1 1 4s. per week. It has been said that the country cannot afford to pay the amount involved by the adoption of the Basic Wage Commission's.recommendation. Isi t not a fact that in Germany, Italy, and Russia wages are nominally very much higher than in Australia ? Aft e r all, although money in those countries may have depreciated, the real test is to be found in the amount of commodities that it can buy. A quarter of a century ago the publio servants of this State regarded Labour and Democracy as something not to be touched with a 40-ft. pole, and I remember on one occasion, when speaking at an open-air meeting, telling them. I expected to live to see the day when they would ask Labour unions to help them. That day has come. But will we be satisfied if pubcertain basic wage. lic servants get this basic wage, and outside employees do not? By no means. In the old days the public servants of Victoria drew £2 in pensions for every £1 drawn by public servants in New South Wales, with £50,000 to the bad. Victoria at that time paid her public servants in pensions more than was paid in all the other States of Australia put together. pension, and that pension onlya pension that should be available to every man and woman on reaching a certain age. I shall not cease from asking for every man and every woman employed outside the Public Service. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) say that no difference should be made on account of sex. Asf a r back as 1901, this Parliament, in dealing with the Public ServiceB ill , affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work.' There is not a member of this House who would permit ns to go back to the barbarous times of a comson' Ord, who was Secretary to the Labour Department of Victoria, once said, that certain manufacturers and others [289] I used to pay their girls 2s. 6d. a week, giving the money on the Saturday morning, and collecting it from them again on the Monday morning. They were actually allowed to use it in that interval. When they asked for more they were "" sacked,"" and others taken on in their places. In 1898, 4,554 women were employed in Victoria at an average wage of' 10s. 9d. a week, and of them 3,813 averaged only 8s. 7d. a week. The average of 10s. 9d. a week was due to the inclusion of the comparatively high salaries paid to heads of Departments. That brand of infamy known as sweating was supported by the laws of Victoria; but to-day the people are rising in their power. I recognise that the position has its difficulties f dr Ministers. I do not care who else may be making this a party question, I am not doing so. It may be difficult on the figures given by Mr. Knibbs to pay this basic wage. Employers w ill dismiss their hands, and close their works. But how easy would the position of Ministers be if they could say, "" This Commission recommends a We are bound to accept its recommendation, and unless within sixty days a certain number of citizens lodge a petition objecting to its payment, it w ill become the law of the land."" There would then be behind it the 900,000 or so householders who pay the whole of the taxation of Australia. With the referendum and initiative in pur Constitution the people would have, I have always stood for one the last voice in saying what should be done. Under such an arrangement M in isters would be in a much happier position. Asi t is, the alliance of the pubWhatI ask for the public servants lic servants of Australia with the LabouT party may cause them to lose a number of seats.

A German friend of mine, in sending five sovereigns to Germany, can get 900 marks for them, whereas formerly he got only 100 marks, so greatly has the purchasing power of money declined there.

It is a series of platitudes which binds the Government to nothing, and nothing, though, indeed, if it did, we should not be much further advanced. It is curious, by the way, that the Treasurer should move an amendment as a subordinate Minister, on the motion submitted by his own Prime Minister. It is said that we cannot pay this minimum wage. I remind honourable members that the basic Wage does not necessarily mean fair compensation for work done; all it means is the minimum on which a person or family can decently live. I suggest to the Government that it is their duty, in the case of married men with three children, to definitely promise the immediate payment of what has been declared to be the least that is necessary to enable them to live under decent conditions. That is not too much to' ask as a first instalment; and on that sure foundation, they might then, if they chose to regard the obvious intention of the Commission, extend 'some measure of justice to the others/""' We have deprived the Public Service of the Arbitration Court, and are proposing to 6et up a new Tribunal, though when that new Tribunal will come into operation I As an do not know. We havegranted large increases' in salaries to members of the Professional Divisionx and to ' men enjoying high salaries in the Public Service, and we have not, it is perfectly true, forgotten ourselves. In these circumstances, for a responsible Minister to declare that the Commonwealth is not equal' to paying to its public servants what a Royal 'Commission, after sitting for twelve months, declares to be the bedrock salary, is an in ; suit to the Commonwealth as a whole, as well as to our common sense. In this connection I venture to p u t in a special word for the claims of the women workers in the Public Service. I am in receipt of two communications, the first of which is1. Of every ten women in the Service it is safe to say that at least eight will have others to support besides themselves-if not all their official life, during some portion of it-and those usually, adults, who cost more to maintain than children, in many cases old people or invalids who require medical attention. This is specially true since the war, there The amendment being many cases of shell-shocked or gassed or otherwise injured members of the family, whose pensions only partly support them. 2. It is fundamentally dishonest to allow two persons to sit side by side, doing the promises same work, involving the same mental and physical wear and tear, and pay one more than the other. To pay for sex or for marriage is as illogical as to pay according to the colour of one's hair, or the size of one's shoe, or any other personal idiosyncrasy. Work only should earn money. 3. A man's children are liabilities for a certain number of years, after that they become assets, and lighten his burdens, whereas a woman has nothing to look forward to but the result of her own exertions; if either should be paid more, she should be, because she is more heavily handicapped. 4. Most women in the Service have renounced marriage because they have responsibilities towards their families, incurred, in most cases, because their brothers have married and left the maintenance of the old home in the hands of their sisters, who should surely be paid as much to maintain the old home as their brothers are to maintain the new one. 5. If men are to be paid because they are married, then it is not right to pay the same rate to » man with one child as to a man with ten nhildrfn. to a widower with neither wife nor child as to a man with a wife and three children. If it is fair to differentiate between individuals at all, it should be carried out fairly in all its details. 6. The first Federal Public Service Act gave a living wage to "" all ofBcers"" of the Service. 'We sliould never again have been referred to -as male and female officers, but all alike -designated for all time "" officers of the Public :Servicfi."" Surelyi t is a retrograde movement to luring hack distinctions that existed last tentury. 7. ""We ask nothing excessive-simpl y the 1920 equivalent of our 1901 salaries. I do not e n t i r e l y endorse t h e statement in t h a t c i r c u l a r t h a t most women in t h e Service hav e renounced m a r r i a g e . doubtless t r u e in m a n y cases, b u t I eay q u it e c a n d i d l y and seriously, speaking more especially of t h e Telephone B r a n c h , of w h i c h I have a good deal of knowledge, t h a t we have in t h e Commonwealt h P u b lic Service a splended body of women workers.

The second c o m m u n i cation is Wc would be very grateful if , when the basic wage for Federal servants is being discussed in Parliament next week, you would speak in the interests of the women omcers. At present we have women on a salary of approximately £2 9s. per week. This is totally inadequate for these times of high prices. In Mr Starke's recent awards, he made the basic wage for women £135, and for single men £162. This is a violation of the Government's .principle-equa l pay for equal work. £135-approximatel y £2 12s. per week-is a grinding wage. Boardi n a respectable locality comes to 30s. a week; washing, 3s.; lunch and train fares, 6s. 3d; total, £ 1 19s. 3d. This leaves about 14s. to cover insurance, income tax, lodge fees, and clothes. holidays cannot be provided for. I endorse those claims on behalf of t h e women, a n d I hope t h a t when t h e Gov e r n m e n t begin to look w it h a jnster eye on the c l a i m s of the P u b l i c Service gener a l l y , they w ill not for g e t t h e i r special claims.

Certain members of the Public Service desire that I should call attention in this place to a circular which they have re ceived, which is regarded as objectionable. Personally, I think that it is objectionable. It has been issued by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, apparently in the ordinary departmental routine way, and its contents are as follow: In connection with the awards recently made by the Deputy 'President of the Arbitration Court for the granting of new allowances to operate as from the 1st July, 1920, to meet increased cost of living, I have to state it is necessary that all widowers and married officers submit evidence of marriage, and it is accordingly requested that immediate steps be taken by you to obtain from all widowers and married, officers in your branch their marriage certificates for notation foy' the Department. The certificates should be forwarded under confidential cover to the Staff Section, accompanied by a list of names and designations of .the officers concerned, and special care must . he taken to see that the /locuments are duly delivered. The certificates will be returned immediately after notation. Officers between twenty-one and twenty-five years of age who have already produced marriage certificates are not required to again submit them. This matter must he treated as urgent. (Signed) I think that the word of officers as to whether or not they are married should be accepted, and that they should not be. required to produce to any officer of the Department documents which are of a peculiarly confidential and nature. date of marriage would do equally well. member says, a declaration, if solemn proof is required in this matter, should be sufficient. Everybody knows that a marriage certificate contains a number of personal details which it may not be desired to disclose to departmental officers, or, for that matter, to any one else. The production of these certificates is surely not necessary, and the practice should be discontinued. Lastly, the circular should be withdrawn. As I am upon my' feet, and although I do not represent any party in particular, seeing that the party speaks through my honoured Leader the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor), I desire to express the regret which we feel at the prospect of losing our friend, Mr Woollard. We have had a most strenuous session, and. notwithstanding what has been [290] stated of us. I am sure we have all tried to do our duty. We have had to submit to your judgment, Mr Speaker, in all things; and if I-have broken the Standing Orders,o and have had to be called to order by you, I ask you to accept my solemn assurance that, though you may have a f a it h f u l record of the number of times I have broken the Standing Orders, you can have no idea at all of the number of times I have resisted my desire to do so. , I hope I shall get f u l l credit for that. Although we have all sought for perfection, none of us, I fear, has attained it , unless, perhaps, you yourself, sir, may provide the sole exception. Honourable members have to submit to 'your judgment, while you, of course, have also to submit to your own judgment; and that, perhaps, will account for your success. The Prime Minister has been guilty -of introducing an inharmonious note to this House, but I must say that he has done so very rarely; indeed, only whenever he has come into the Chamber: The' Treasurer has been less fortunate, but more industrious, and so I congratulate him, too. In spite of the about meI hope not sincerelyI have nothing but the best of goodwill towards them.
