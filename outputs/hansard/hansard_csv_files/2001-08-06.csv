(2) Which new construction project does he plan to have (a) started and (b) completed between now and 2006. (3) What sum of Federal funds will be required for each project and over how many kilometres will each project extend. (4) What proportion of the duplication work remaining to be done does each project represent. (5) What date has the Government set of the completion of the duplication of the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo. (6) What new construction works does the Government plan to undertake on the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo after 2006. (7) What is the projected cost of each of these projects and over how many kilometres will each project extend. (8) Is he able to say whether the Victorian Government has a commitment to 2006 as the deadline for the completion of the duplication of the Calder Highway between Bendigo and Melbourne in partnership with the Federal Government; if so, why does the Federal Government plan only for a substantial completion of the duplication by 2006. (1) (a) 87 km (b) 64 km (2) to (8) The Calder Highway is a state arterial road and responsibility for its upgrading rests with the Victorian Government. To assist Victoria with its upgrading the Federal Government provides additional funds under its Roads of National Importance Program. As part of the 2001/02 roads Budget, $25m has been allocated to commence the Carlsruhe duplication project. This level of funding, when combined with State funds, will see this project completed and opened to traffic by the end of 2002/03. The deadline to duplicate to Bendigo by 2006 was set by the Victorian Government, without any consultation with the Federal Government. Given the Calder Highway is a State road, the Victorian Government is free to commence all other necessary works to meet its set deadline. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2520) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 April 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article titled “Airport still counts cost of Olympics” by Ms Laura Tingle published in The Sydney Morning Herald on 4 April 2001. (2) What is the impact on the Government’s proposed sale plans of the multi-milliondollar claim against Sydney Airport Corporation referred to in Ms Tingle’s article. (1) and (2) Given the relative sums of money involved, the matters raised in the article are unlikely to have any impact on the sale plans for Sydney Airports Corporation Limited. Defence: Copper Napthenate (Question No. 2531) Dr Martin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) How many sandbags does the Army currently have in stock.",125,Questions On Notice
176,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,137,Total Australian 2 18 2 190 12 57 25 50 1 70 Capital Territory
177,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) How many of these sandbags are treated with the Class3 chemical copper napthenate. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the detrimental health effects associated with handling products impregnated with copper napthenate and can he advise of current occupational health and safety procedures in place for the handling of these sandbags. (4) Does the current request for tender for the supply of sandbags to the Army contain a specification for the use of copper napthenate. (5) Will he seek registration for the use of copper napthenate for rot proofing sandbags. (6) On how many occasions has the Army sold or given sandbags for use by domestic relief organisations in the last year. (7) When these sandbags are used for flood relief and other related purposes are they retrieved at the end of their usefulness and disposed of in accordance with regulations for prescribed wastes. (1) Approximately 260,000. (2) All of them. (3) I have been advised that skin and eye irritation can occur following prolonged contact with copper napthenate in its raw form. For the purpose of impregnating hessian sandbags, the chemical is first dissolved and diluted in white spirit and is therefore unlikely to present a hazard. The Class3 reference relates specifically to the flammability of the white spirit. As an added precaution, Defence has issued instructions that personal protective equipment be worn when handling sandbags treated with copper napthenate. There is no evidence to suggest that there are any additional health risks associated with the storage and handling of these items. (4) A previous request for tender, now terminated, did propose the use of copper naphthenate or an equivalent. A revised request for tender now being developed specifies untreated hessian bags. Defence has decided to discontinue specifying copper napthenate as a rot proofing agent for environmental reasons. Defence is actively investigating alternate rot proofing treatments and materials. (5) No, registration is only necessary for organisations intending to treat materiel with copper napthenate in Australia. Defence has no such intention. (6) The exact number of occasions is unknown, however it is not a common occurrence. (7) Defence has no visibility of how domestic relief organisations have managed the collection and disposal of used sandbags in the past. The change to untreated hessian sandbags will obviate this requirement. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Air Traffic Control (Question No. 2532) 22 May 2001: (1) Is Airservices Australia planning to move its function of air traffic control for Sydney Airport to the air traffic control facility in Melbourne. (2) Have he, his Department or Airservices Australia received representations expressing safety and professional concerns about the proposal: if so, (a) what are the concerns which have been expressed and (b) which professional organisation or organisation have expressed those concerns. (3) What is the operational justification for the Airservices Australia consolidation plan. (4) Does Airservices Australia believe there will be an increase in safety or service levels to the aviation industry by such a consolidation, if so, how. (5) Does Airservices Australia anticipate achieving cost savings by such a consolidation; if so, (a) what are those anticipated cost savings and (b) how have those savings been calculated. (6) Has Airservices Australia considered whether separating the terminal control unit from the associated control tower at Sydney Airport will adversely affect the airport ability to meet the demands of both the aviation industry and the community; if so, how have those considerations been reflected in the decision which has been made.",137,Total Australian 2 18 2 190 12 57 25 50 1 70 Capital Territory

179,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Transport And Regional Services, Upon Notice, On","(7) Has Airservices Australia considered whether controlling the busiest airspace in Australia from Melbourne introduces greater potential for a technical failure to jeopardise separation between aircraft over Sydney; if so, how have those considerations been reflected in the decision which has been made. (8) Has Airservices Australia considered the potential for data link and communications failures between the various facilities which will be relocated to Melbourne and those which will remain at Sydney Airport; if so, what would be the safety consequences of such a data link or communication failure. (9) Is it the case that disaster recovery capability will be severely reduced if the terminal control unit is moved from Sydney to Melbourne and in particular have there been instances where it has been necessary for the Sydney Tower to be evacuated to the TCU has been crucial in the establishment of a temporary tower, if so would that ability to establish such a temporary facility be impeded if the TCU is moved to Melbourne. (10) Is it the case that presently the control centres at Cairns, Brisbane, Sydney Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth can operate independently of each other but that they are also able to take over airspace being controlled by adjacent centres if required; if so, if Airservices Australias consolidation plans go ahead will these disaster recovery features be lost or significantly reduced and, in particular, should the Melbourne Centre need to be evacuated will it result in airspace, including that over Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth being uncontrolled or under controlled. (11) Is it the case that air traffic controllers develop local knowledge during the course of their duties such as local geography, weather patters and terrain; if so, (a) how will that local knowledge possessed by controllers at Sydney airport be replicated if those controllers are moved to Melbourne and (b) is local knowledge of tremendous importance during emergency situations when every piece of available information is needed to resolve the situation. (12) Has Airservices Australia considered additional complications confronting controllers as a result of the planned upgrade of Sydney airport and Bankstown airport. (13) What will be the cost of transferring the control unit including transfer expenses, redundancy payments and retraining costs and how does Airservices Australia anticipate that it will recover these costs. I am advised by Airservices Australia that: (1) Airservices has only undertaken an initial feasibility study into the consolidation of its TCU facilities at Cairns, Perth, Adelaide and Sydney at this time. No decision has been made on the relocation of the Sydney Terminal Control Unit. Airservices will not be consolidating Cairns facilities. (2) Yes. Concerns were expressed over future employment and to ensure that safety is not compromised in the relocation of the TCU. Representations have been received from unions, individual controllers and state governments. Professional organisations that have made representation have been Civil Air Operations Officers’ Association of Australia which is the union that represents air traffic controllers and the Community and Public Sector Union representing technical and clerical staff. (3) The basis upon which the feasibility study has been undertaken is to determine whether Airservices’ nationally integrated TAAATS system has the ability to yield further benefits to the Australian aviation industry through consolidating Airservices’ TCU facilities to allow improved service delivery and greater integration and standardisation of air navigation services. (4) Airservices advises they expect no adverse impact on safety as a result of its proposed TCU consolidation program. It is expected there will be an increase in service levels to the aviation industry through improved operations because of less fragmentation, increased standardisation and optimisation of operating procedures, more efficient transition between Enroute and TCU and the potential for reductions in air navigation costs. (5) Airservices anticipates there will be cost savings as a result of its proposed TCU consolidation program. Airservices has advised that analysis of the total expected cost savings has not yet been determined but would be achieved through reduced management overheads and infrastructure, reduced maintenance and technical support and spares holding, improved equipment utilisation, optimisation of operational procedures and consistency of service.",138,Total Australian 2 18 2 190 12 57 25 50 1 70 Capital Territory
180,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) The Sydney TCU and Tower are currently operated from totally separate (although nearby) locations. Dynamic traffic management and communication between the Tower and TCU is via communication systems provided by the TAAATS environment. The distance between the Tower and TCU controllers is not a factor in meeting the demands of the aviation industry or community or in coordinating traffic management at Sydney Airport. The same level of communications and coordination will exist between the TCU and the Sydney Tower, irrespective of the location of the TCU. Only the Tower controllers need to be physically located at the Airport. (7) The physical location of the Sydney TCU has no bearing on the technical operation or capabilities of the TAAATS air navigation system, the operation of air navigation aids at Sydney Airport, nor the aircraft separation standards and other regulations that apply to aircraft operating into and out of Sydney Airport. Operating the Sydney TCU from Melbourne will not introduce greater potential for technical failure. No decision has been made on the consolidation proposal. Any decision will be subject to the approval by CASA of a safety case, which would examine the matters raised in questions (6), (7) & (8). (8) See answer to questions (6) & (7). (9) Relocation of the TCU will not impact on disaster recovery capabilities. The coordination and communication links between the Tower and TCU necessary for an evacuation of the Tower and establishment of a temporary Tower would remain the same regardless of the location of the TCU facility. Relocation of the Sydney TCU to Melbourne would not impede the establishment of a temporary Tower facility at Sydney Airport should it be necessary. (10) The TAAATS system is such that the radar signal from one centre can be accessed and viewed from a remote location. This is the basis upon which the TCU consolidation study is contemplated. However the crucial element in managing aircraft from a remote location is the availability of appropriately trained staff. Airservices disaster recovery ability will not be compromised under the TCU consolidation proposal because appropriate measures will be put into place, as part of the consolidation plan, to ensure that this is the case. (11) Local knowledge can assist but is not essential to air traffic management within the TCU environment. Local knowledge is of much greater importance to Tower controllers. The current proposal to relocate the Sydney TCU in no way impacts on the Sydney Tower. (a) Should a decision be made to relocate the Sydney TCU, Airservices will encourage as many Sydney controllers as possible to move so that local knowledge is maintained. Local knowledge will still be available to TCU controllers through the Sydney Tower controllers. (b) Local knowledge can be important in an emergency, depending on the actual situation. This local knowledge will be available from the Tower. (12) Yes. (13) Total relocation costs or expected cost savings have not yet been defined apart from indicative costs and savings outlined in the Feasibility Study. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2533) 22 May 2001: Is his Department or Airservices Australia currently reviewing the present noise insulation boundary for homes in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if so, what parameters have been set for the review and, in particular, to what extent does the review factor in the inconvenience of the time that over flights occur. Yes, the noise insulation boundaries are regularly reviewed by my Department based on the Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI) prepared by Airservices Australia for the previously completed calendar year. The ANEI includes a weighting for aircraft movements between 7pm and 7am.

182,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Has his attention been drawn to page 6 of the 13 to 15 April 2001 edition of The Sydney Morning Herald which reports him as saying that he has signalled the Government is looking at the plight of self-funded retirees on low incomes hit by falling interest rates and that it is a group of people for which the Government would like to provide some help. (2) What help does Government propose to assist self-funded retirees who are hurting because of the Goods and Services Tax and low interest rates. (3) When will the Government announce its policy to assist this group of Australians. (1) to (3) The government announced a range of measures to assist self-funded retirees in the 2001-02 Budget. It increased the low income aged persons rebate to provide an effective tax free threshold of $20,000 for individuals and up to $32,612 for couples. It increased the Medicare levy threshold correspondingly so that older Australians do not incur a Medicare levy until they incur a tax liability. The government extended income limits for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) to $50,000 for single self-funded retirees and $80,000 for couples. At the same time, it introduced a Telephone Allowance as an additional concession to CSHC holders and has committed to negotiating with State and Territory governments on extending the range of concessions available under the CSHC. Veterans: British Nuclear Tests (Question No. 2548) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Is he aware of the plight of veterans who were exposed to British nuclear tests. (2) Is he able to say whether the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency has obtained international research regarding the possible health effects of exposure to ionising radiation and made this information available to those affected by the British nuclear tests; if not, why not. (3) Has the Government compiled a nominal roll of all Australians affected by British nuclear tests; if not, why not. (4) Has the Government appointed a scientific advisory committee to oversee any studies of the effects of nuclear tests on humans; if not, why not. (5) Has this scientific advisory committee reported back to him or the Government; if not, why not. (6) What priority has he and the Government placed on awarding proper compensation to Australians and their descendants whose health has suffered from the effects of radiation as a result of British nuclear tests. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the claims and concerns of those veterans who were exposed to British Nuclear tests. Compensation, including medical treatment, is available through the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service to veterans for any illness or injury which has resulted from their service. As I have recently announced, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs will be conducting a Mortality and Cancer Study of Australian participants of the British Nuclear Tests. (2) The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) is not within the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio and therefore this question should be referred to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Dr Michael Wooldridge MP, who has responsibility for ARPANSA. However, the Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA) which is in my Portfolio, has reviewed research into the affects of ionising radiation exposure. I have also had the University of Dundee research reviewed by an independent Australian epidemiologist. This report has been made available to organisations representing the interests of Australian participants in the British Nuclear Tests. (3) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has completed a draft nominal roll of all participants in the British Nuclear tests and this is now available for public comment. The delay in completing the nominal roll was due to the need for a regulation to be made, for the Department to gain access to the lists of participants used in an earlier study, the “Donovan Study” of the early 1980s. The lists subsequently obtained from that study had many gaps and it has been a detailed, exacting task by the Department to check primary records to fill as many of the gaps as possible. The nominal roll",140,Total Australian 2 18 2 190 12 57 25 50 1 70 Capital Territory
183,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:has to contain sufficient personal information to enable adequate data matching against the National Death Index and the Cancer Registry. The draft nominal roll includes civilian workers employed in the construction industry, public service and other supporting industries. For some of the civilian participants, basic demographic details such as date of birth and full first names are missing. Now that the draft nominal roll has been released for public comment, it is hoped that civilians with data missing will contact the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. It should be possible to include the civilians for whom full details are available, in the data matching for the study. (4) and (5) After release of the draft Nominal Roll the Government’s next priority is to establish a Consultative Forum of representatives of the participants in the Atomic Tests. Once this has been established, a Scientific Advisory Committee will be appointed, with the Consultative Forum helping to establish the membership of the Scientific Advisory Committee. I expect to finalise the Scientific Advisory Committee in the next few months. (6) Where any Australian has suffered from an illness or injury related to service during the nuclear testing program, there are a number of avenues available for compensation. These are: (i) under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Civilians who are suffering from an illness or injury related to their participation in the nuclear testing program should lodge a claim with COMcARE. Claims from service personnel are now administered by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs under the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service on behalf of the Department of Defence; or (ii) the Special Administrative Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. This scheme provides compensation to test participants who have developed multiple myeloma or leukemia, other than chronic lymphatic leukemia. Since 1995 compensation is only provided for leukemia where it had developed within the first 25 years since participation this follows a similar United Kingdom Scheme; or (iii) common law claims through the courts. Port Welfare Committees: Funding (Question No. 2551) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) What sums are available through his Department to organisations who want assistance with establishing Port Welfare Committees in each State and the Northern Territory following the Government’s 7 March 2001 announcement to establish such committees. (2) What criteria will apply for approving funding to organisations seeking to establish the committees. (3) For how long will funding be available to establish the committees and can it be extended beyond that period. (4) Will successful applicants be requested to meet performance standards established by his Department; if so, what is the nature of the performance standards. (1) I announced on 7 March 2001 that the Federal Government would provide funding to assist with the establishment of Port Welfare Committees (PWCs) in each State and the Northern Territory. Following my announcement, funds totalling $100,000 have been made available through the Department to assist with establishing the PWCs. (2) The base criterion that will apply for approving funding to organisations seeking to establish PWCs is that those organisations demonstrate that funds provided will be used by them to employ a person to assist in establishing PWCs. It is envisaged that the person employed would undertake a range of tasks in this role, including research, consultation and administrative tasks. (3) Federal funding assistance towards the establishment of PWCs will be available for two years. Total funds available are $100,000 which will be provided at the maximum rate of $50,000 per year, for two years. It is envisaged that the establishment of PWCs will be a task requiring a maximum period of two years to fully implement. Accordingly, the issue of extended funding beyond this two-year period has not been considered by the Government.",141,Total Australian 2 18 2 190 12 57 25 50 1 70 Capital Territory
184,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Organisations that are successful in obtaining Federal funding assistance towards establishing PWCs will be requested to meet performance standards in relation to the intended use of Federal funds. Since it is envisaged that Federal funds will be used to employ a person to assist in establishing PWCs, these performance standards will relate to demonstrable outcomes and deliverables, measured against reasonable timeframes. Aviation: Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (Question No. 2553) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Since the introduction of The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) how many air traffic control incidents have been found to have TAAATS human factors as causal factors in those incidents. (2) Has Airservices Australia conducted, arranged to be conducted or commissioned any studies or research into TAAATS human factors; if so, what were the findings or recommendations and when will each be implemented; if not why not. (3) Will Airservices publish or make available any studies that have been conducted into TAAATS human factors; if so, when and where; if not, why not. I am advised by Airservices that: (1) The term ‘human factors’ encompasses all considerations that affect a person at work. Any incident that by definition is a breakdown in procedure, process, and item of equipment or performance necessarily has an element of human factors as a causal factor. This factor could be a result of design, implementation, maintenance or service delivery. With that in mind, Airservices sees little value in identifying the number of incidents that are attributable to the broad term human factors. Instead, Airservices considers its involvement in the incident and the factors relating to that incident. As can be seen by the information below, the Air Traffic Services (ATS) attributed incident rate has reduced since the transition to TAAATS. Airservices has concluded that the example, the following graph represents ATS incidents for Terminal Control Area (TMA)/Tower (TWR) services at Sydney Airport (Kingsford-Smith Airport).

185,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:(2) Extensive research and evaluation of human factors issues were conducted during the design, implementation and operation of TAAATS. These include: Console ergonomics Display colour palette Lighting Procedures Human Machine Interface Post implementation reviews were undertaken to ensure any deficiencies that had not been identified or issues that had not been completely rectified, were identified and actions taken to address them. Commissioned research in relation to TAAATS human factors include: A Human factors Evaluation of TAAATS Non radar Air Traffic Control, Unitas Consulting Human factors review of The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS), Directorate of Safety and Environment Assurance The Performance Assessment Model, University of Queensland. The findings and recommendations of these studies have and continue to be evaluated by Airservices with respect to our increasing experience with TAAATS. Many of these recommendations have been implemented becoming an integral part of the system. (3) The research commissioned by Airservices in relation to TAAATS human factors could be made available on request. Shipping: Foreign Vessels (Question No. 2556) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: For each of the last ten financial years, (a) how many single and continuous voyage permits have been issued with respect to foreign vessels operating in Australian waters, (b) what has been the gross tonnage carried for each category of continuous and single voyage permit, (c) how much of that cargo has been (i) in containers and (ii) bulk carriage for each category of single and continuous voyage permit and (d) from which ports was the cargo taken and to where was it taken.

186,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Rail: Cunningham Rail Link (Question No. 2557) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Did he meet members of the Cunningham Rail Link Committee on the Gold Coast; if so, when did the meeting occur. (2) At the meeting did he give a commitment that the Cunningham Rail Link would be fully investigated as an option linking the Inland Rail line with the Port of Brisbane; if so, what action has he taken to ensure that the Cunningham Rail Link is fully investigated as an option for the Inland Railway from Brisbane to Melbourne. (1) Yes. The meeting was on 14 July 2000. (2) During the meeting I undertook to have the concerns of the Cunningham Rail Link Committee brought to the attention of Australian Transport and Energy Corridor Limited. Subsequently this matter was raised with Australian Transport and Energy Corridor Limited. Insurance: Over 50s Insurance Agency (Question No. 2563) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) Did the Government publish an advertisement in the March/April 2001 edition of the Age Pension News, encouraging pensioners to insure with the Over 50s Insurance Agency. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the Over 50s Insurance Agency policies are underwritten by World Marine General Insurance, which is a member of the HIH Insurance Group. (3) Why is the Government advertising HIH insurance six months after the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) knew that HIH was in financial trouble, and in the same month that APRA appointed an inspector to HIH. (4) Did the Government receive payment for the advertisement; if so, what sum. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Age Pension News (APN) carries advertising that is seen as relevant to older Australians. The March/April edition APN included advertising for the Over 50s Insurance Agency. (2) The Over 50s Insurance Agency was previously underwritten by HIH and subsequently has been underwritten by Allianz. (3) When the HIH situation became known, immediate action was taken by Centrelink. The March/April APN had already been printed and it was impossible to include an update. When the Over 50s Insurance Agency confirmed that business was now being underwritten by Allianz, Centrelink Customer Service Centres and Call Centres were notified immediately to ensure correct and up to date information was given to customer enquiries. (4) The Over 50s Insurance Agency paid $36,500 for advertising in the March/April edition of APN. These funds were used to offset Centrelink production costs for the publication. Roads: Black Spot Funding (Question No. 2566) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: What sum was approved for each federal electoral division in NSW under the Black Spot Program in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.",144,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For

(2) From what date can servicemen apply for the medal and what is the process through which applications can be obtained. (3) Who will be eligible to receive the medal. (4) Is there an appeals mechanism if an application for the medal is rejected. (5) Where will the medal be struck. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) The medal and ribbon design will be completed by July 2001. The medal Regulations should be completed in September 2001 at which point applications will be accepted for its award. (b) Award of the medal will commence once the Regulations have been approved and applications called for, taking into account existing applications for other medals, and Defence’s policy of processing medal applications in order of receipt. (2) Applications will not be accepted until the medal has been formally created. Once the Regulations have been approved, ex-national servicemen may make application on special application forms which will be designed for this purpose. The forms will be available over the internet and copies will be sent to major ex-service groups for distribution. (3) Eligibility for the medal will be dependent on the confirmation of an individual’s obligation to serve and that this obligation was fulfilled under the National Service Act, as it applied to the individual at the time of his service. The details of this are being determined with the establishment of the medal Regulations. (4) Yes, to the Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Honours and Awards. However, awards can only be made within the prescribed Regulations. (5) Australia. High Court of Australia: John Pfeiffer v. Rogerson (Question No. 2580) (1) Has his attention been drawn to the findings of the High Court of Australia in John Pfeifferv Rogerson (21 June 2000). (2) Does the decision have any ramifications for defamation proceedings concerning a publication throughout Australia, in particular, a necessity for parties in defamation proceedings to address the matters raised by separate State and Territory laws. (3) Has the Government taken any further steps to progress the concept of unified defamation legislation in light of that decision. (1) Yes. (2) The decision in John Pfeifferv Rogerson [2000] HCA 36 has implications for defamation proceedings as much as it has for any other proceedings. The Court held that the development of the common law to reflect the fact of federal jurisdiction and also, the nature of the Australian federation requires that the double actionability rule now be discarded; the law of the place of the wrong should be applied by courts in Australia as the law governing all questions of substance to be determined in a proceeding arising from an intranational tort; and laws that bear upon the existence, extent or enforceability of remedies, rights and obligations should be characterised as substantive and not as procedural laws. As was the position before the decision, in so far as publication throughout Australia is concerned, if a party wishes to bring a defamation action in respect of each jurisdiction in which the publication occurred, that party will still need to address the matters raised by the law in each jurisdiction in which the publication took place. (3) The issue of uniform defamation laws was considered for many years by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Unfortunately the States and Territories were unable to agree on substantive reforms and the issue was taken off the SCAG agenda. I expressed my disappointment with the lack of willingness to reach agreement on the part of States and Territories at that time.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Aircraft Movements (Question No. 2584) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: (1) How many breaches of the cap on aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport have occurred since the legislation introducing the cap was passed. (2) What were the details of these breaches. (3) What penalties have been imposed for these breaches. (1) and (2) Under the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, Airservices Australia is required to report to me on the extent of infringements (if any) of the maximum movement scheduling limit in each quarter. I have tabled reports of the hours in which the maximum movement limit was exceeded, including explanations for the events, for the quarters ending 30 June 2000 (4 hours), 30 September 2000 (17), 31 December 2000 (7) and 31 March 2001 (13). Operational factors such as unforeseen delays can cause aircraft movements to ‘bunch up’ and the aircraft movement may not occur in the hour for which it has a slot but move into the next recording hour. This could mean that the actual number of movements in the next hour may exceed 80, even though the number of allocated slots is still 80 or less. The overall number of movements at the airport will not be affected. (3) No fines have been issued under the Act to date. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Act provides that the 80 movement per hour cap is to be the planning basis for the Slot Management Scheme established pursuant to the Act. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Act does not provide for penalties for breaches of the cap as such. Instead, the penalties for which the Act provides relate to breaches of the Slot Management Scheme (ie, aircraft which operate without a slot, or aircraft which operate outside allowed time limits which apply to an allocated slot). Australian Customs Service: Peter Tomson Court Case (Question No. 2586) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: (1) Did the Australian Customs Service (ACS) conduct an unsuccessful court case against Peter Tomson, an apparel and footwear importer, in the 1990s; if so, what are the details. (2) Was the Tomson case similar to the Midford Paramount affair which occurred during the same period. (3) Were the ACS officers in the Tomson matter the same officers criticised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 325, “The Midford Paramount Case and Related Matters”. (4) Is the Minister satisfied with the way in which the ACS handled the Tomson case; if not, what action will the Minister take to review the case and reform the ACS. (5) When does the ACS expect to complete its examination of the matters raised in the Tomson case and respond to Mr Tomson’s legal representatives. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. In July 1993 a defended Australian Customs Service (Customs) prosecution was commenced against Mr Tomson with respect to the alleged undervaluation of five shipments of imported clothing. During the course of the hearing the Magistrate ruled the prosecution had established a prima facie case for all of the informations laid. In June 1995, following evidence from several defence witnesses, the Magistrate dismissed the case against Mr Tomson. (2) No. This case involved charges under the Customs Act 1901 for under valuation, while Midford Paramount involved charges under the Crimes Act 1914 for fraud. A prima facie case was estab-",147,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For

193,Mr Williams,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer tolished as noted above. Any similarity relates to the fact that both matters involved imported clothing. (3) The investigating officer in the Tomson matter was not involved in the investigation of the Midford case. Some officers who provided evidence before the Midford inquiry would have had some involvement with the Tomson case. (4) A detailed review of the matter by Counsel has been commissioned by Customs. (5) On the advice of Counsel, Customs responded to Mr Tomson’s legal representatives on 15 June 2001 seeking further and better particulars in relation to their allegations. Counsel had indicated that if such particulars were forthcoming in a timely manner he would be able to finalise his report by 30 July 2001. G & K O’Connor Meatworks (Question No. 2593) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: (1) How many meetings were held between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor meat works in Pakenham, Vic., and officers of his Department prior to a lockout being instituted in November 1998 and what was the nature of those meetings.

(9) When will he release the documents currently held by his Department on this issue. (10) What action has his Department or the Office of the Employment Advocate undertaken to investigate the alleged intimidation and coercion by thugs hired by the management of G & K O’Connor’s meat works as exposed on the Channel9 Sunday program of 8 April 2001. (11) If no action has been taken with regard to this allegation, who made the decision and on what basis was this decision made. (12) What action has been undertaken to investigate the claims by Mr Darren Wise that Mr Bruce Townsend attempted to induce him to lie to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. (13) If no action has been taken with regard to this allegation, who made the decision and on what basis was this decision made. (1) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. One meeting was held between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd and an officer of the Department prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999. At this meeting, G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd provided information on developments in an industrial dispute at the meat works of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd. (2) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. Prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999, according to the Department’s records and to the best of the Department’s knowledge, there was telephone contact between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd and officers of the Department on four occasions. The nature of the contact was that G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd informed officers of the Department of developments in an industrial dispute at the meat works of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd. (3) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. No meetings were held between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd and officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate, prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999. (4) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. No contact was made between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd and officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate, prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999. (5) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. No meetings were held between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd and the Minister prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999. One meeting was held between management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor meat works in Pakenham and staff in the then Minister’s office prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999. At this meeting, G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd provided information on developments in an industrial dispute at the meat works of G & K O’Connor. (This is the same meeting referred to in the answer to (1).) (6) The lockout at G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat works in Pakenham commenced in March 1999, not November 1998. Prior to a lockout commencing in March 1999, staff in the then Minister’s office received a telephone call and then a facsimile from representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd, requesting a meeting. The Ministers office subsequently confirmed a meeting time and date. (7) According to the Department’s records and to the best of the Department’s knowledge, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has provided management or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd with no written material, no written advice, nor any other form of substantive advice in relation to the dispute at the G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat processing plant, or associated Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Federal Court proceedings. The Department consulted management (on one occasion) and representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd as required by section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in relation to a freedom of information application by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees’ Union (AMIEU). In 1999, the Department received one letter and five facsimiles from representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd. These all comprise covering notes, and copies of Australian Industrial Relations Commission or Federal Court decisions, or documents lodged in relation to Australian Industrial Relations Commission or Federal Court proceedings. In 2000, the Department wrote to representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd on one occasion (and also forwarded the same letter via facsimile) and received one letter from representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd. This correspondence related to a freedom of information application by the AMIEU. In 2001, the Department corresponded with representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd on two occasions. The first occasion involved forwarding by facsimile a letter from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd, which advised of the Government’s having tabled certain documents in the Senate in response to a Senate Return",148,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
194,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:to Order motion. The Department subsequently forwarded by facsimile to G & K O’Connor’s legal representatives some of the documents that had been tabled in the Senate. The Office of the Employment Advocate provided management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd with information on logistical arrangements for the offering, lodgement and processing of Australian workplace agreements (AWAs), and with information about the Freedom of Association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the Act). This information was provided in three meetings between staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate and management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd. (Employers planning to make large numbers of AWAs are encouraged in the Office of the Employment Advocate’s A How-to Guide to contact the Office to expedite the processing of the AWAs.) The Office of the Employment Advocate’s correspondence with management and/or representatives of G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd comprises filing receipts, approval notices and a refusal notice for AWAs, as required by the Act; other routine correspondence concerning the filing and approval of AWAs; and a letter advising the employer of the Deputy Employment Advocate’s intention to refuse an AWA pursuant to s170VPB(4) of the Act. (8) The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business provided the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business with three briefings related to developments in the dispute at the G & K O’Connor Pty Ltd meat processing plant, as well as briefing for use in Parliament. The Department provided staff of the then Minister’s office with one briefing on developments in the dispute, together with updates, either orally or via email. The Office of the Employment Advocate provided the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or his staff with five briefings. The briefings related to proceedings brought by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees’ Union against the Employment Advocate concerning the application by the OEA of the no disadvantage test in assessing AWAs. (9) On 28 June 2001, the Government tabled in the Senate the documents on this issue that it intends to release. (10) No action has been taken by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or the Office of the Employment Advocate to investigate the allegations aired on the Channel9 Sunday program of 8 April 2001. (11) No complaint regarding the matter was made to either the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or the Office of the Employment Advocate. (12) No action has been taken by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or the Office of the Employment Advocate to investigate the claims by Mr Darren Wise that Mr Bruce Townsend attempted to induce him to lie to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. (13) No complaint regarding the matter was made to either the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or the Office of the Employment Advocate. Product Stewardship (Oil) Regulations 2000 (Question No. 2598) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: (1) Since the commencement of the Product Stewardship (Oil) Regulations 2000 how many companies have sought and been paid the subsidy specified in Regulation 4 in each of the categories listed and what amount in total has been paid under each category. (2) Are analytical laboratory tests readily available for each of the criteria set out in Schedule1 in each of the capital cities of the States. (3) Which laboratories have been approved by the relevant authorities and are they able to conduct all of the tests required by the Regulations. (4) What is the estimated cost of having a sample evaluated for the purposes of the maximum payment of 50 cents under Regulation 4. (5) What is the maximum level of polychlorinated biphenyls permitted under clause 3 of Schedule1 of the Regulations and is this level consistent with other maximum permitted levels of this chemical under other Commonwealth legislation such as food standards and other environmental standards. (6) Was the level required by the US Environment Protection Agency test evaluated for consistency with other Commonwealth and State legislation prior to the adoption of the Regulation; if so, is it consistent. (7) Is there any reason to believe that there are significant levels of dioxins in recycled oil products in Australia; if so, what would be the principal sources of such contamination. (8) Is the maximum level allowed under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Regulations 2000 consistent with the levels specified under the polychlorinated biphenyls management plan. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) As at the end of April 2001 (ie 4 months into the program): 24 recyclers were registered under the product stewardship arrangements 15 recyclers had made claims and been paid benefits total payments under each category were: Category$ 1 0 2 102 3 317,273 4 43,694 5 509,754 6 620,700 Total 1,491,523 (2) Tests are readily available in Australia for all the criteria with the exception of the Modified Ames test (clause 1), which is available in the United States. This test was included in the criteria as it is recognised as the only test capable of identifying a particular range of carcinogens that may be present in re-refined waste oil. As there are currently no operations in Australia carrying out full re-refining of waste oils, Australian laboratories haven’t yet geared up to do the test. We have had indications from some Australian and New Zealand laboratories that they would be prepared to set up to do the testing, depending on a variety of market considerations (eg if there was going to be sufficient demand). (3) Many Australian environmental laboratories can carry out testing for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (clause 2), polychlorinated biphenyls (clause 3) and dioxins (clause 4). Testing laboratories accredited to do particular tests are identified on the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) Directory, available on the NATA website. The total acid number test (clause 1) and the appearance test (clause 5) are widely available from industry and independent petroleum product testing laboratories in Australia. (4) Proponents should evaluate the market themselves. The modified Ames is by far the most expensive test at approximately $US1500/test which would drop as testing frequency increased. Note that the Regulations require testing of Category1 oils only every six months. (5) to (8) Clause3 of Schedule1 to the Regulations requires that the oil must contain less than 0.1 mg of polychlorinated biphenyls for each kilogram of oil, demonstrated by meeting the criteria mentioned in US-EPA test SW-846 8082. Under the National PCB Management Plan material containing more than 50 mg of PCB per kilogram becomes a Scheduled Waste and cannot be transported without evoking special provisions. This 50mg/kilogram limit is consistent with the level at which a waste becomes Scheduled under",150,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
195,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anthe Basel Convention and can only be transported across international borders in controlled circumstances. Under the National Plan, waste containing between 2 and 50 mg of PCBs is nonScheduled, and must be dealt with appropriately at the end of its useful life. Wastes containing less than 2mg/kg are considered ""PCB free"". Note that the standards are different between the Regulations and the PCB Management Plan as the two standards are aimed at quite different ends. The PCB Management Plan is a waste management plan, focussed on proper disposal routes of known PCB-contaminated wastes. The Regulations on the other hand prescribe high health, safety and environmental compliance levels for a product to allow it to receive government benefits, with a view to preventing PCB contaminated oils entering the environment in the first place. The Australian and New Zealand Food Authority puts PCBs in a category that requires ’no detectable residue’ (Food Standards Code Volume 2). Almost all PCBs that impact upon humans are ingested in food. In June 1999, large quantities of chickens and eggs were destroyed in Belgium when they were found to contain high levels of both dioxins and PCBs. The source of this contamination was traced to industrial oils being used as a feedstock to manufacture chicken feed. Where waste oil has a PCB content of less than 2 ppm, most State EPAs allow this oil to be burnt in designated facilities, and if the concentration is over 2ppm but less than 50 ppm it must be diluted until the PCB concentration falls to the 2 ppm level. Note that State requirements may not be uniform in this respect. Note also that in these situations the waste oil is known to be PCB contaminated and is thus treated appropriately. This situation is not analogous to situations where re-refined oil may contain PCBs (in the absence of government requirements) and which is much more likely to come into direct skin contact of mechanics for example. The Regulations require that, to qualify for the top benefit payment, re-refined oil must not contain polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (‘dioxins’), as demonstrated by meeting the criteria mentioned in EPA test SWA-846 8290. While chlorine compounds are not found in virgin base oils, they may be added during either the manufacture or use of the final virgin oil products. The presence of chlorine compounds in oil may also result in some dioxin formation during its use in motor vehicles, hence some potential presence in waste oils. The dioxins in a re-refined waste oil product may therefore be formed during the use of the original product, or through the effects of the re-refining process on chlorine compounds present in the waste oil. There have been several incidents in Australia where dioxin contamination of waste oil has lead to emissions of PCBs. The most recent was in 1999 in Victoria when the EPA discovered dioxin contaminated waste oil at 5 re-use facilities, including a pet-food manufacturer, a cement kiln and a tourist train. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2599) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Further to part (5) of the answer to question No 2305 (Hansard 4, June 2001, page 27227), (a) is Bankstown Airport not Sydney West Airport, (b) does Badgerys Creek remain the site for Sydney West Airport and (c) is the Government’s 13 December 2000 announcement to shelve Badgerys Creek factually wrong in light of his answer to question 2305. (2) Further to part (11) of the answer to question No 2305, (a) do the decisions taken by the Government to lease Sydney Airport without embedding terms in the lease constitute a major compromise of the Government’s ability to ensure that a second airport is actually built at Badgerys Creek, (b) in light of his reply that the operator of Sydney Airport will be given the first right of refusal to build and operate any such airport, will he clarify whether this right in the hands of the lessee compromises the further review of Sydney’s airport needs in 2005, (c) what statutory or contractual provisions, if any, now survive to ensure that an airport can and will be built at Badgerys Creek, (d) is a second airport for Sydney still part of its strategy for solving Sydney’s airport noise problems, (e) upon what advice has the Government based its 13 December 2000 decision to shelve Badgerys Creek, expand Sydney Airport and use Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport, (f) how will the Government fulfil its 1996 Election aviation policy in solving Sydney’s aircraft noise problems in light of (i) its decision to seek a further review of Sydney’s airport needs in 2005 and (ii) failing to fully implement the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP), in light of his answer to part (3) of question No 2307 (Hansard, 23 May 2001, page 25926) advising that the LTOP forecast of 17% movements to the north of Sydney Airport continually fail to be met, with actual aggregate movements at 27.3%. (3) Further to parts (8) and (10) of the answer to question No. 2305, has he taken advice on whether the operation of these sections including their statutory intent as demonstrated in the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services second reading speech, are compromised; if so, (a) on whose advice does he rely and (b) will he furnish copies of this advice in Parliament. (1) (a) Bankstown Airport is not Sydney West Airport. (b) The Government announced that it will retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek site and will legislate to protect the site from incompatible development in surrounding areas. The Government has made no decision on the site for a second major airport for Sydney. (c) No. (2) (a) No. (b) The lessee of Sydney Airport will have no power to prevent the Government reviewing Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. (c) The sale arrangements for Sydney Airport will not prevent the development of a second major airport for Sydney if a future Federal Government decided that such development should proceed. (d) While concluding that it would be premature to build a second major airport for Sydney, the Government decided to retain the Badgerys Creek site thereby preserving the opportunity for a future Federal Government to decide whether or not airport development on the site should proceed. (e) The Government took account of a range of material including the comprehensive and publicly available Environmental Impact Statement on the second Sydney Airport proposal for Badgerys Creek. (f) The Government has addressed the aircraft noise issue by providing for a substantially more equitable sharing of noise compared with the arrangements in place prior to March 1996 and by continuing the aircraft noise insulation program begun by the previous Government. (3) In the context of the sale of Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport the Commonwealth has sought and received confidential advice in relation to the provisions in the Airports Act 1996 dealing with the issue of Sydney West Airport and this advice will be taken into account in the detailed sale arrangements for the Airport. Defence: Salt Ash Weapons Range (Question No. 2603) Mr Horne asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Did US Air Force aircraft use the Salt Ash Weapons Range on or about 23 May 2001; if so, (a) how many aircraft and (b) for what duration. (2) Did former Minister McLachlan ban foreign aircraft from using the Salt Ash Weapons Range; if so, who gave permission for the aircraft to use the field. (1) No. (2) The Air Force is unaware of any commitment made by Minister McLachlan to ban foreign military aircraft using the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. In 1998, RAAF Williamtown base management took the initiative to decline requests to use the range from other than Williamtown based aircraft in an effort to reduce the impact of noise on the local community. The last foreign aircraft to use the range were from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, in September 1998. Since then, only aircraft based at Williamtown have used the range. Bass Electorate: Pensions and Allowances (Question No. 2607) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) How many (a) disability pensioners, (b) aged pensioners and (c) Common Youth Allowance recipients reside in the electoral division of Bass.",152,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Risk Analysis (Question No. 2612) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 2311 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 25772), will he table a copy of the risk analysis in the House; if so, when; if not, why not. (2) In light of the finding in that risk analysis, what impact, if any, will the (a) installation and operation of the Precision Runway Monitoring System, (b) proposed changes to the Slots Management Scheme 1998, (c) expansion of Sydney Airport as announced by the Government on 13 December 2000 and (d) change the use of Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport as also announced on 13 December 2000 now have on the probabilities described in his answer. (1) The Environmental Impact Statement for Sydney Airport’s Third Runway is a publicly available document. (2) The specific risk analysis data requested by the Honourable Member is not available. The Government is committed to ensuring that the highest priority is placed on aviation safety. No changes will be made to the operating arrangements at Sydney or Bankstown Airports unless all safety standards are fully complied with. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2614) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 June 2001:",154,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
198,Mr Anthony,The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the fol,155,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
199,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Further to his answer to question No. 2309 (Hansard, 24 May 2001, page 26023), are significant segments of Bankstown City already subject to Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) 25 or higher from aircraft noise emanating from that airport. (2) Is aircraft noise emanating from Bankstown Airport set to worsen from the impact of the Government’s announcement on 13 December 2000 to use Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport; if so, over what areas. (3) Is he aware that Bankstown City Council already has affectations on title and noise contour maps indicating the ANEF noise levels of existing residents. (4) Does the Government’s announcement on 13 December 2000 in respect of Bankstown Airport mean that those aircraft noise contours are to widen the affectation of aircraft noise affected residents; if so, will he describe the impact. (5) Will he afford the same insulation for those houses that are offered for persons suffering aircraft noise from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if so, when will that noise insulation announcement be made. (1), (2), (4) and (5) It is anticipated that there will be changes to the patterns of noise exposure around Bankstown Airport as a result of it being used as an overflow airport for Sydney Aiport. Any proposal for upgrading the facilities and operational aspects of Bankstown Airport will be considered against the requirements of the Airports Act 1996 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. I will be recommending to the Environment Minister that the private sector lessee should be required to do a full environmental impact statement (EIS) into the upgrading of Bankstown Airport. Any changes to noise exposure patterns around Bankstown Airport resulting from the upgrading and the question of noise insulation would be examined as part of this EIS process. (3) I am advised that Bankstown City Council does include advice about aircraft noise exposure on certificates issued under section 149 of the Environmental Planning And Assessment Act 1979. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2619) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Further to the Minister’s answer to question No. 2426 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 25808) concerning Sydney West Airport and the Minister’s responses referring to the ‘Second Sydney Airport Proposal’, for the purposes of section 6 of the Airports Act, does the ‘Second Sydney Airport Proposal’ and the term ‘Sydney West Airport’ under that Act, mean the same thing; if not, can the term ‘Sydney West Airport’ have any meaning other than the ‘Second Sydney Airport Proposal’; if so, what other meaning can it have. (2) Is the Second Sydney Airport Proposal for which the Minister conducted an environmental impact statement a proposal to locate the Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek. (3) Does the Second Sydney Airport Proposal mean an international airport at Badgerys Creek. (4) Does Sydney West Airport not mean Bankstown Airport. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. While not specifically defined as Sydney West Airport in the Airports Act 1996 the Sydney West Airport is generally interpreted to be the Second Sydney Airport. (2) Yes. The Second Sydney Airport proposal for which an EIS was conducted was a proposal to locate a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. (3) Yes. The EIS for a Second Sydney Airport included an assessment of the staged development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek. (4) Sydney West Airport does not mean Bankstown Airport. Veterans: Entitlements (Question No. 2625) Mr Price asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 2001:",155,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
200,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,156,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
201,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(1) How many surviving members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces who served in Japan between 1945 and 1952 are there. (2) What is the annual estimated cost of granting those veterans a Gold Card. (3) How many ADF personnel served at Woomera during atomic testing. (4) How many of those veterans are surviving and what is the estimated annual cost of granting them full veterans’ entitlements. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) It is estimated there are 4,300 surviving veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces (Japan) (BCOF). (2) Many of these surviving veterans have service in WWII or in a later conflict and have a Gold Card and it is estimated that about 1000 of them do not have a Gold Card. The Government has introduced a Charter of Budget Honesty, under which the Opposition can have new policy proposals formally costed by the Department of Finance and Administration. This would be the proper mechanism under which the question on the estimated cost should be submitted. (3) My Department has compiled a draft nominal roll of those who were involved in atomic testing at Maralinga, Emu Field and Monte Bello Island. The roll includes both ADF personnel and civilians. The roll has been compiled for the purpose of a health study into mortality rates and cancer incidence among this group. No atomic testing took place at Woomera, however, personnel based at Woomera may have been at other sites when atomic tests took place. The information sought in the honourable member’s question is not readily available because the Department of Defence has no nominal roll of ADF personnel who served at Woomera at this time. To collect and assemble such information solely for the purpose of answering the question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and effort that would be required. (4) Only when the roll is complete will it be possible to provide costs for full veterans’ entitlements for all those involved in atomic testing. National Estate: Cumberland Plain (Question No. 2636) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) Has the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) listed any of the former Australian Defence Industries Munitions Factory Site at St Mary’s; if so (a) which areas and (b) how many hectares are involved in each area. (2) Is the AHC land high, medium or low value Cumberland Plain. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether all the high and medium value Cumberland Plain is preserved under the State Government regional environment plan. (4) What is the total size of the high and medium value Cumberland Plain being preserved. (5) In making its assessment what were the values and factors that the AHC took into account, and did they include (a) size, (b) representativeness on a regional scale, (c) representativeness on a property (local) scale, (d) rarity (threatened species), (e) rarity (regionally rare), (f) diversity, (g) naturalness, (h) connectivity, (i) fragmentation, (j) ease of management, (k) strategic importance, (l) sustainability, (m) conservation, (n) community services, (o) total water cycle management, (p) transport, (q) waste management, (r) employment and economic development, (s) air quality, (t) heritage (u) open space and recreation, (v) soil and salinity, (w) urban form, (x) housing and land supply and (y) energy efficiency. (6) Given the 1600 hectares of land in question; what were the studies that the AHC undertook in reaching its decisions. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) listed part of the Australian Defence Industries site at St Mary’s on the Register of the National Estate on 26 October 1999; The AHC listed an area",156,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
202,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following anof Cumberland Shale Plains Woodland and an area of Shale/Gravel Transition Forest also known as Castlereagh Woodland. Cumberland Shale Plains Woodland is listed as endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; in total the listing comprises about 800 hectares of the entire site. (2) The AHC believes that its boundary encompasses most of the high and medium value Cumberland Shale Plains Woodland on the site. The AHC commissioned an additional on-ground survey specifically to identify those areas to the west of the site, outside the boundary identified under the State Government regional environment plan, which might contain Cumberland Plain Woodland. (3) The NSW Section 22 Committee, established by the NSW Ministry for Planning to oversight the rezoning of St Mary’s, accepted an average of 21% of the 57 “characteristic” species as sufficient to establish the presence of Cumberland Plain Woodland. The AHC areas additional to the NSW regional environment plan boundary contain an average of 33% of the species identified as “characteristic” of Cumberland Shale Plains. (4) The NSW regional environment plan encompasses about 320 hectares of Cumberland Plain Woodland. (5) The AHC, in making a decision to list part of the St Mary’s site, conformed to the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission Act, which focus on the aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance of the natural and cultural environments of Australia, for future generations as well as the present community (s.4). In considering any objection to inclusion of a place on the Register of the National Estate the Commission is required to give “upmost consideration to the significance, as part of the national estate, of the place”. In listing Cumberland Plains Woodland at St Mary’s, the AHC took into account its heritage value (t) as a remnant of an endangered vegetation community with greatly reduced distribution (a) within the shale plains west of Sydney (b, c, d, e). Studies by both New South Wales and the Commonwealth show that the Cumberland Plain Woodland represented at St Mary’s demonstrates between 21%-30% of species “characteristic” of the community (f). Although the vegetation communities at St Mary’s are almost entirely regrowth since the 1940s they constitute one of the largest, single areas of a robust vegetation type capable of regeneration if managed appropriately (g,h,i). AHC expressed the view that as much as possible should be conserved of a vegetation community of which there is as little as 8% extant (m). Since the remit of the AHC is to consider the presence or absence of a heritage value it did not take into account matters which are properly the province of State and or local governments (j, k, l,n,o,p,q,r,s,u,v,w,x,y). (6) In reaching its decision in regard to the listing of part of the St Mary’s site, the AHC had access to the following surveys and reports: Benson DH (1992) The natural vegetation of the Penrith 1:100 000 map sheet.

Bathurst Boer War Memorial (Question No. 2638) Mr Price asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) Did Lord Kitchener visit Australia in 1910. (2) Did Lord Kitchener refuse to unveil a war memorial in Bathurst to those who served in the Boer War unless the name of Lieutenant Handcock was removed. (3) If so, does this accord with current Government policy. (4) What action has been taken to restore Lt Handcock’s name to the memorial. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I am advised that Field Marshal Lord Kitchener visited Australia from December 1909 to February 1910 to inspect its military force and installations and advise on military reform. (2) Lord Kitchener visited Bathurst on 10 January 1910 to unveil the local Boer War Memorial and present a prize to a local rifle club. Lieutenant Handcock’s name was not on the memorial at that time; nor is there any archival evidence that Lieutenant Handcock’s name was among the names to be included on the memorial in the first place. (3) Local memorials, such as the Bathurst Boer War Memorial, are the responsibility of local communities and local government authorities. Responsibility for their ongoing maintenance rests with those authorities. (3) I am further advised that Lieutenant Handcock’s name was added to the memorial in 1964. Veterans: Gold Card (Question No. 2639) Mr Price asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) What categories of persons who served in World War II are eligible for a Gold Card. (2) What is the surviving number of persons in each category and what is the estimated per annum cost per category of granting the Gold Card to them. (3) What categories of persons who served in World War II are not eligible for a Gold Card. (4) What is the surviving number of persons in each category and what is the estimated cost per category of extending the Gold Card to them. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) A Gold Card is issued to all World War II veterans of Australia’s Defence Force (ADF) and Australia’s merchant navy who: are ex-prisoners of war; or served in the ADF between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945, who have qualifying service from this period of hostilities and who are aged 70 years and over; or receive a disability pension at or above 100% of the general rate; or received a disability pension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978. Some veterans of Commonwealth or allied World War II forces are eligible for a Gold Card, if they: have qualifying service from World War II and lived in Australia immediately prior to enlistment in the Commonwealth or allied force; or are mariners who served on a Commonwealth or allied ship and if they, or their dependants were residing in Australia for at least 12 months immediately prior to the commencement of their service on that ship. (2) Below are the numbers of veterans from the above categories currently in receipt of Gold Cards: World War II veterans and ‘other categories’, 144,888 Commonwealth and allied veterans, 268 The estimated average health care cost to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs per Gold Card holder in 2000-2001 is $8,200. (3) Persons who served in World War II who are not eligible for a Gold Card are: Ex-members of the ADF or Australia’s merchant navy who: do not have qualifying service from that conflict, that is did not serve between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945, or who did serve during this period but did not incur danger from hostile forces of the enemy during this time; are not in receipt of disability pension at 100% or more of the general rate. Commonwealth and allied veterans who are now living in Australia but were not members of the ADF. (4) The Government has introduced a Charter of Budget Honesty, under which the Opposition can have new policy proposals formally costed by the Department of Finance and Administration. This would be the proper mechanism under which the above question should be submitted. Education: Schools Funding (Question No. 2642) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: What is the range, from the lowest level of school funding to the highest level, of general recurrent funding per student in each State and Territory within (a) government school systems, (b) Catholic school systems and (c) independent schools.",157,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
203,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) The Commonwealth provides funds to the States and Territories for government schools on the basis of reported full time equivalent enrolments. Actual disaggregation of Commonwealth, or total funding from the State/Territory to individual schools is not part of the data collected by the Commonwealth. (b) Recurrent funding provided by the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments is given to each State/Territory Catholic system in bulk according to per capita rates.

(2) Has an environmental impact statement (EIS) been prepared for the use of the range by these aircraft; if so, has it been released for public perusal and discussion. (3) Can the aircraft use the range if an EIS has not been prepared. (1) Yes, but authorisation has not been given to use training weapons. (2) The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, has been consulted about the introduction of the Hawk Lead-in-Fighter into service with the RAAF. On 12 June 2001, Senator Hill directed that the Department of Defence submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). When it has been developed, the EIS will be released and public comment sought. (3) The legislative process under which this proposal is being considered, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, does provide for matters under consideration to continue pending the outcome of the formal EIS process. Child Care: Funding (Question No. 2647) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 6 June 2001:",160,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
204,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) What total sum of Commonwealth funds were made available in the last funding round of the minor capital upgrading program for child care centres. (2) How many child care centres in NSW made an application for a minor capital upgrading grant. (3) Which child care centres in NSW were successful in their application for a minor capital upgrading grant and what sum was each granted. (4) Did the application for minor capital upgrading of air conditioning, drainage and safety glass from the Fairfield City Council Child Care Centre at Bossley Park meet the eligibility criteria for funding, as outlined in the application guidelines. (5) On what grounds was the application from that child care centre for a minor capital upgrade grant rejected. (6) When will applications be called for future funding rounds of the minorcapital upgrading program. (7) Will child care centres that applied for minor capital upgrade grants in previous funding rounds be eligible to apply for grants in future funding rounds; if not, why not. (8) Will the eligibility criteria for applicants be altered in future funding rounds. (9) Will child care centres whose application met the eligibility criteria but were still unsuccessful in receiving a minor capital upgrade grant be given priority in future funding rounds; if not, why not. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) $2.4 Million (2) 301 (3) Service Name Grant Padstow Community Child Care Centre 6,376 Roslyn Hall Children’s Centre 6,435 Macquarie Park Child Care Centre 2,306 Hornsby Nursery and Preschool 1,371 Cherrybrook Nursery and Preschool 8,364 Chester Hill Community Child Care 5,544 Greenacre Community Child Care Centre 15,226 Blinky Bill Portland Child Care Centre 13,050 Cardiff Early Education & Care Centre Inc 6,773 Hassall Grove Child Care Centre 5,265 Keymer Child Care Centre 15,613 Ridge-Ee-Didge Children’s Centre 5,060 Plumpton Occasional Care Centre 2,860 Mt Druitt Church of Christ Child Care Centre 7,000 John Armitage Child Care Centre 4,565 Nan Moran Child Care Centre 19,754 Koala Corner Children’s Centre 4,360 Susanna Children’s Centre 17,303 Canberra Road Child Care Centre 7,254 Dianella St Child Care Centre 6,504 Gamumbi Child Care Centre 6,465 Ngaku Aboriginal Corporation Multipurpose Centre 16,887 Kempsey Pre-School and Nursery School 12,852 Woolgoolga Child Care Centre 8,812 Gumnut Cottage Child Care Centre 7,929 Kenny Street Long Day Care Centre 4,114 James Mitchell Care and Learning Centre 5,815 Rainbow Cottage Children’s Centre 12,863 Niagara Park Children’s Centre 4,012 Hinchinbrook Multipurpose Centre 2,237",162,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For

(5) Each project in each application was individually assessed and assigned a ranking. As funds were limited, only those projects with the highest ranking were approved to receive funding. Ranking was assigned on the demonstrated urgency of each project as it related to health, safety and/or licensing concerns and in relation to other projects. Each project for the Fairfield City Council Child Care Centre (known as the Janice Crosio Child Care Centre), Bossley Park, met the criteria, however they were not ranked highly enough in comparison to other projects to receive funding. (6) Minor capital upgrading funding rounds are currently conducted once a year. The timing of a future round has not been determined at this stage. (7) Centres which apply for funding in one round are not restricted from applying in later rounds. (8) There are no plans to alter the eligibility guidelines. (9) There is no process for providing priority to previously unsuccessful applicants. Each funding round involves a competitive assessment of applications received in that round, with priority given to those determined to have demonstrated that they have projects in need of urgent attention because of health, safety and licensing issues. Regional Flood Mitigation Program: Eligibility (Question No. 2648) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 June 2001: (1) Is the Government to extend the eligibility criteria for the Regional Flood Mitigation Program to include outer metropolitan areas. (2) Does the Minister’s Department consider the local government areas of (a) Parramatta, (b) Holroyd, (c) Fairfield and (d) Penrith outer metropolitan areas. (3) Was $40m of Commonwealth funds announced in the 2001-2002 Budget for the extension of the eligibility criteria of the Regional Flood Mitigation Program; if not, what sum has been appropriated. (4) What sum of new Commonwealth money has been allocated to NSW under the extension of the Program. (5) Will the Commonwealth funds announced in the 2001-2002 Budget be matched by the respective State and local governments under the 2:2:1 ratio; if not, what ratio will the Commonwealth, State and local governments contribute to the Program. (6) Will funding from the Program be used for works in the western Sydney suburbs of Toongabbie and Wentworthville. (1) As announced in the Federal Budget of 22 May the Regional Flood Mitigation Program has been extended providing $40 million over the next four years and includes as a new measure outer metropolitan areas.",163,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
206,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) The definition of ‘an outer metropolitan area’ has not yet been established. A number of options are being considered to gauge suitability for defining these areas. (3) No, the $40 million announced is for the expansion of the whole of the Flood Mitigation Program. (4) Notional Allocations between State and Territories have not yet been determined as the calculation will be based on previous Regional Flood Mitigation Program uptake amounts and the list of priorities put forward by the States and Territories for 2001/2002. A determination will be made shortly. (5) The funding arrangements under the new Program are the same as the former Regional Flood Mitigation Program, that is the Federal Government will fund no more than one third of the approved project cost. The remaining two thirds of the project costs are to be funded by the State and Local Governments. The Federal Government has made no stipulation as to how the States and Territories and Local Governments divide the funding of their two thirds of the project, beyond requiring that the State at least match the Federal Government funding. This provides scope for State and Territory Governments to increase their contribution. (6) The new Program extends eligibility to outer metropolitan areas. In accordance with the Program guidelines, applications are assessed and prioritised by State and Territory Governments which then make recommendations to the Federal Government. Defence: HMAS Brisbane (Question No. 2651) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 June 2001: (1) When does he expect the decommissioning of HMAS Brisbane to take place. (2) Is there an established process for the gifting of decommissioned navy vessels; if so, what is that process. (3) Are there any plans to gift HMAS Brisbane to any State or organisation. (4) Can he provide a detailed plan for the decommissioning and disposal of HMAS Brisbane. (1) It is proposed that the decommissioning of HMAS Brisbane will occur on 19 October 2001. At this stage, the decommissioning ceremony is expected to take place at Fleet Base East, Woolloomooloo. (2) Yes. From a Commonwealth perspective, it is desirable that any business plan or community submission should be negotiated at State Government level, rather than directly between the Commonwealth and the local community or organisation. In this regard, the Western Australian State Government has established a benchmark for dealing with ships of this size and nature, whereby the State protects the interests of the local community or group involved, and accepts all contiguous liabilities. (3) The Western Australian, Queensland and New South Wales Governments have expressed an interest in acquiring HMAS Brisbane, as has the Launceston Chamber of Commerce and various other associations and groups. The Australian War Memorial has also expressed keen interest in securing selected items of equipment and superstructure for public exhibit at the memorial. Gifting the vessel is one option that is currently under consideration. (4) No. Until the Disposal Plan is completed, I am unable to provide these details. However, it is expected that the Disposal Plan will be completed by August 2001. Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Veterans (Question No. 2652) (1) What is the average length of time that applicants in veterans’ affairs’ matters are required to wait for reserved judgments of appeals from the Veterans Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

208,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney General, Upon Notice, On 6 June 2001:",,166,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
209,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) From1 June 2000 to 31 May 2001 there were 136 Veterans Division Applications heard and decisions reserved by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The average time from a decision being reserved until its delivery was 68.8 days. The Tribunal’s time standard is 60 days. (2) Factors beyond the control of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affected the timeliness of delivery of some reserved decisions in veterans’ matters over the relevant period. Applications heard and reserved by the Tribunal affected by the proceedings in Repatriation Commission v Keeley [2000] FCA 532 were delayed pending final determination of those proceedings. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the Full Court of the Federal Court’s decision in Keeley was refused on 28 November 2000. There have been a number of further appeals to the Federal Court in veterans’ matters raising the issue of accrued rights and which Statement of Principles should be applied by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Those appeals have attempted to distinguish the Keeley decision and have caused a delay in determination of matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal expected to be affected by those appeals. On1 June this year I announced the appointment of 53 members to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, comprising 15 new members and 38 reappointed members. Most appointments took effect on 1 July this year for terms of between 1 and 3 years. I am confident that the quality of the members appointed will ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will continue to operate effectively, including in the Veterans’ Division, pending the establishment of the Administrative Review Tribunal. Social Security: Bilateral Agreements (Question No. 2655) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 6 June 2001: (1) Is he aware that there have been long delays in the signing of social security agreements between Australia and (a) Croatia, (b) Turkey and (c) Greece. (2) What progress has been made in finalising these agreements and what are the remaining obstacles. (3) When is it expected that these agreements will be finalised. (1) I am aware that we do not have social security agreements with Croatia, Turkey or Greece. I am also aware that delays in finalising bilateral agreements are common. For example, negotiations for the agreement signed with Germany last December were begun in 1985. (2) In relation to Croatia, progress has been delayed due to other priorities. Amendments to the text negotiated in December 1998 are now required because of recent changes to Australian social security law, and taxation and welfare reform. It is hoped that the Department will be in a position to give this further consideration next year. An agreement with Turkey is not under active consideration. Negotiations planned in 1995 were postponed by Turkey and a request to resume discussions was only received last year. Turkey has been advised that the Department will review its readiness to resume discussions next year. In the case of Greece, the honourable member will be aware that successive Governments of both political persuasions have made a number of proposals to Greece and none have been accepted. The Government’s latest offer of an agreement was also rejected. The previous Minister for Family and Community Services, the Hon. Senator Newman, wrote to Greece in February last year suggesting that officials meet to ensure that Australia’s generous offer and the Greek Government’s reservations about that offer were clearly understood. There has been no response from Greece. (3) I am not able to advise the honourable member when an agreement will be finalised with each of these countries. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Environment Strategy (Question No. 2666) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001:",166,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
210,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Does the November 1999 Sydney Airport Environment Strategy state that Sydney Airport acknowledges the need to further address aircraft impacts external to the airport and that this task will be undertaken during the preparation of Sydney Airport Master Plan. (2) Will the Sydney Airport Master Plan contain the Government’s strategy for mitigating against airport impacts at ultimate operational capacity and are noise, airport-associated road traffic congestion, air toxic emissions and health risks are covered in the plan. (3) Is critical information being withheld from the public; if so, what is that information. (4) Will he immediately table a copy of the Sydney Airport Master Plan in the House. (1) The Sydney Airport Environment Strategy recognises that noise generated by aircraft in flight, when landing, taking-off or taxiing at an airport are important environmental issues. The Strategy indicates that noise generated by aircraft will be considered as part of the Master Plan. (2) No. The Master Plan is the airport-lessee company’s strategic plan for the airport. (3) No. (4) No. There is at present no Master Plan for Sydney Airport, due to the prospective sale of the Airport. However, the company will be required to provide a draft master plan by 31 January 2003. The extended deadline also has regard to the anticipated complexity of a master planning process for Sydney Airport given the range of competing industry and community interests that will need to be balanced. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Toxic Emissions (Question No. 2668) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Further to his response to question No. 2308 (Hansard, 23 May 2001, page 25927), in light of his reply that there is no information on toxic emissions from road traffic associated with Sydney Airport, (a) can he confirm the validity or otherwise of Sydney Airport Corporation Limiteds (SACL) assertion that there is no significant health risk associated with emissions from Sydney Airports total-airport operations; (b) upon what basis does the SACL reach this conclusion and (c) will he table copies of this probative evidence in the House. (2) Are the bulk of Sydneys most densely populated areas located within a 10km radius of Sydney Airport and the central Sydney industrial area of Port Botany, both of which generate a disproportionate road traffic load and other toxic transport emissions compared to the rest of the Sydney metropolitan area. (3) Do Sydney Airport emissions contribute approximately 40% of the total toxic air emissions load in the 20 square kilometres surrounding Sydney Airport. (4) Which inner city suburbs are downwind of Sydney Airport and Port Botany during typical 24hour patterns of trapped Sydney basin air re-circulation. (5) Has air pollution generated in the eastern part of the Sydney basin been reported to be transported on a regular basis by afternoon sea breezes as far as the south west part of the basin. (1) It has not been possible to find record of the assertion that is ascribed to Sydney Airports Corporation Limited in the Honourable Member’s question. (2) (4) and (5) The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) continuously monitors air quality throughout the Sydney basin. The Honourable Member may wish to examine the EPA’s webpage at http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au to gain up to date information on the levels of air pollutants throughout the basin. (3) A 20 square kilometre area centred on the Airport covers parts of Botany Bay and small parts of the surrounding suburbs. A very substantial part of the area is covered by the Airport. Given this, it is not unlikely that a significant proportion of the air emissions in that area are associated with Sydney Airport.

211,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,168,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
212,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Further to his response to question No. 2310 (Hansard, 23 May 2001, page 25927), (a) is he able to say whether benzene and 1,3 butadiene are carcinogens and (b) do mobile sources account for the majority of total benzene and 1,3 butadiene pollution in Sydney. (2) Further to his response to part (2) of question No. 2310, did Sydney Airports Corporation Limited claim that the NSW Environment Protection Agencys toxic emissions data supported its claim of no significant health risk given in evidence to the Commission of Inquiry into the Precision Runway Monitor System for Sydney Airport. (3) Further to his response to part (6) of question No. 2310, must these significant airport capacity expansions trigger an environmental impact statement or other environmental assessment under Commonwealth law. (4) Is he able to say whether another area of higher-than-state-average incidence of lung cancer occurs other than in the south west Sydney basin area; if so, where. (5) Is he also able to say whether smokers who are also exposed long-term to toxic transport emissions are likely to be more at risk of contracting lung disease than smokers living in clean air environments. (1) The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Second Sydney Airport Proposal indicates that benzene is released to the air from evaporative emissions from petrol and from incomplete combustion of motor vehicle and aircraft fuel. It is classified as a known human carcinogen. 1,3 butadiene is found in aircraft and motor vehicle exhausts. The EIS states that there is insufficient evidence to confirm that it is a human carcinogen. (2) It has not been possible to find any reference to the NSW Environment Protection Agency’s toxic emissions data in the published transcript of the Sydney Airport Corporation Limited’s evidence to the Commission of Inquiry into the Precision Runway Monitor System for Sydney Airport. (3) Any proposal for upgrading the facilities and operational aspects of Bankstown Airport will need to be considered against the requirements of the Airports Act 1996 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. I will be recommending to the Environment Minister that the private sector lessee should be required to do a full environmental impact statement (EIS) into the upgrading of Bankstown Airport. (4) and (5) The Honourable Member may wish to approach the NSW Department of Health to ascertain detailed epidemiological data for the Sydney region. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2672) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Is the Minister able to confirm Environment Australia’s reported assertion that it is Government policy to comply with Australian Standard for Aircraft Noise AS2021. (2) Did the Third Runway environmental impact statement (EIS) assess the environmental impact (a) of removing small planes from Sydney Airport and (b) around Sydney Airport of the introduction of one or more reliever airports for Sydney Airport. (3) Did the Badgerys Creek EIS assess the environmental impact for Sydney Airport. (4) Has the Government assessed the environmental impact of expanding Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport for communities impacted by Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport. (5) Has the Government holistically assessed the total impact of all Sydney’s airports on the Sydney metropolitan area and is there a basin-wide environmental assessment of airport impacts. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The Minister is not aware of any such assertion by Environment Australia. (2) No. The Proposed Third Runway EIS primarily assessed the proposal to construct a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport.",168,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
213,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,169,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
214,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(3) No. The Second Sydney Airport EIS assessed the impacts of locating a second domestic/international airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek. (4) No. Any proposal for upgrading the facilities and operational aspects of Bankstown Airport will need to be considered against the requirements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to ascertain whether formal environmental assessment of such a proposal is required. (5) No. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Pollutants (Question No. 2673) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) Is the Minister able to enumerate the percentage change in Sydney Airport’s road traffic as a proportion of all traffic on the major roads around Sydney airport since the Third Runway EIS was completed; if so, what is that percentage. (2) Is the Minister able to say (a) which air toxics, also known as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), have been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including cancer, neurological effects, and reproductive and developmental effects, (b) whether HAPs include such chemicals as benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, and cadmium, and (c) whether HAPs are emitted from cars, trucks, buses and aircraft. (3) During the past five years, has the practice of risk assessment within Environment Australia evolved away from a focus on the potential of a single pollutant in one environmental medium for causing cancer toward integrated assessments involving suites of pollutants in several media that may cause a variety of adverse effects on humans, plants, animals or effects on ecological systems and their processes and functions. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Cumulative Exposure Project has observed associations between increased risk of lung cancer and toxic transport emissions from mobile sources, including road traffic and airports. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. Road traffic issues around Sydney are a matter for the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority. (2) (a) The Commonwealth’s Living Cities Air Toxics Program defines air toxics as: gaseous, aerosol or particulate pollutants (other than the six criteria pollutants) which are present in the air in low concentrations with characteristics such as toxicity and persistence so as to be a hazard to human, plant or animal life. The terms ‘air toxics’ and ‘hazardous air pollutants’ (HAPs) are used interchangeably. Consistent with this definition exposure to any air toxic has the potential to cause adverse health effects. (b) Yes, all the substances listed are considered air toxics. (c) Yes, a range of air toxics is emitted from cars, trucks, buses and aircraft. These mobile sources have all been associated with emissions of air toxics including benzene, 1,3-butadiene and formaldehyde. (3) The application of risk assessment is considered on a case by case basis. The consideration of all relevant media does occur in assessing the risk of a pollutant to humans and biota. Chemical mixtures are typically not assessed together unless they are closely chemically related groups of compounds, for example dioxins or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. (4) I am not aware of the findings of the US EPA’s Cumulative Exposure Project. However, the association between toxic transport emissions and an increased risk of cancer is well established. Second Sydney Airport: Health Risks (Question No. 2674) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 June 2001:",169,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
215,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(1) At any time before, during or after the assessment of the proposed Badgerys Creek airport, did Environment Australia note that the Minneapolis St Paul airport system provided the closest airport analogy. (2) What are Environment Australia’s benchmarks for safe concentrations of toxins in air for benzene, toluene, 1,3 butadiene, formaldehyde and acrolein and how does this compare with actual air levels, if such data exists. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether, following the Commission of Inquiry into the Precision Runway Monitor System, the US EPA Cumulative Exposure project for the Minneapolis St Paul metropolitan area shows that, for the toxins considered, lifetime cancer risk per 100 000 persons in and downwind of the primary airport and two of its reliever airports ranges from 13 to nearly 40 times the health risk level set by the Minnesota Department of Health, or one additional case of cancer per 100 000 people. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether the US EPA Cumulative Exposure Project study of the Seattle metropolitan area shows that the lifetime cancer risk per 100 000 persons exposed to toxic emissions in and around SeaTac airport range from 200 to 400 times EPA’s recommended safe level of carcinogens in the air. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether the August 2000 study by the City of Park Ridge Illinois titled “Preliminary Study and Analysis of Toxic Air Pollutant Emissions from O’Hare International Airport and the Resulting Health Risks created by these air toxic emissions in surrounding residential communities” found that toxic emissions exceeding a cancer risk of 1 in 100 000, assuming 70 years of exposure, encompass an area of approximately 1000 square miles around Chicago’s O’Hare airport. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. (2) There are currently no national ambient air standards for these pollutants in Australia. However, the Commonwealth’s Living Cities– Air Toxics Program has been actively promoting the case for developing a National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) for Ambient Air Toxics. At its meeting on 29 June 2001, the National Environment Protection Council decided to commence development of the Ambient Air Toxics NEPM. This NEPM will set Australian ambient air standards for priority air toxics. (3) No, the Minister is not aware of the detailed findings of this study. (4) No, the Minister is not aware of the detailed findings of this study. (5) No, the Minister is not aware of the detailed findings of this study. Australia Post: Yellow Express Post Boxes (Question No. 2677) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) What information is provided to the public by Australia Post on the location of its Yellow Express Post Boxes and where can this information be obtained. (2) How many Yellow Express Post Boxes are located within the electoral division of Lowe and where are these locations. (3) Are Yellow Express Post Boxes located in every federal electorate. (4) If a person posts a letter in (a) Sydney or (b) regional or rural Australia in a Yellow Express Post Box before 6 p.m. on a Sunday and that letter is addressed to an address within Australia, will it be delivered to the addressee the following day; if not, why not. (5) If a person posts a letter in an ordinary Red Post Box in Sydney before 6 p.m. on a Sunday, will it be delivered to another address in Sydney the following day; if not, why not. ceived from Australia Post is as follows:",170,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For

217,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question based on advice re(1) Customers can obtain information about the locations of Express Post gold street posting boxes by calling Australia Post’s Customer Call Centre (telephone 131318 all States), or by accessing its website at www.auspost.com.au and clicking on the Post Office Locater Map. Customers in New South Wales and Victoria can also obtain brochures from local postal outlets that list the locations of gold street posting boxes in their State. (2) There are four Express Post gold boxes in the electorate of Lowe. They are located at: corner Drummoyne and Rosebury Streets, Drummoyne 2047; corner Burwood Road and Comer Street, Burwood North 2134; Railway Parade (at Burwood Station), Burwood 2134; and Shop 45-47 The Boulevarde, Strathfield 2135. (3) No. Express Post gold posting boxes are provided at locations within the defined next-businessday delivery network, the details of which are printed on the back of all Express Post domestic products. (4) No. Express Post is a business-day to business-day product with dedicated processing arrangements in place Monday to Friday to meet the advertised delivery standard. An Express Post letter posted in a gold street posting box on a Sunday would not normally be delivered the following day because the special processing arrangements for Express Post items are not geared for weekend postings. The following instruction appears on the back of all Express Post domestic products – “next business day delivery is guaranteed over the following specified routes, if your envelope/satchel is posted correctly on any business day Monday to Friday”. There is also a notice on all gold street posting boxes explaining the scope of the service (ie that the next-business-day delivery guarantee applies to items posted before the clearance time shown on the box, Monday to Friday). An ordinary letter incorrectly posted in a gold street posting box on a Sunday would also be subject to delay as it would have to be extracted and directed to a separate processing stream. (5) Yes. An ordinary letter posted in a red street posting box in Sydney by 6pm on a Sunday should be delivered to another address in Sydney the following day. An Express Post letter incorrectly posted in a red street posting box on a Sunday would probably not be delivered the following day – it would be subject to delay due to its being automatically diverted to the Express Post processing stream which is not geared for weekend postings. The following instruction appears on the back of all Express Post domestic products – “Do not post in red street posting boxes”. Roads: Western Sydney Orbital (Question No. 2684) Mr Price asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) When was the agreement signed between the NSW Government and the Federal Government for the construction of the Western Sydney Orbital Road. (2) Did the agreement cover any other roads; if so, (a) which roads, (b) what is the estimated project costs and (c) what is the contribution of each government to the roads. (1) The agreement to which you refer, known as the “Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales concerning the Western Sydney Orbital”, was signed on 4 January 2001. (2) (a) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covers the Western Sydney Orbital and associated works required for its construction and ongoing operation and maintenance for the duration of the toll concession period. The MOU also states that both Governments agree to carry out a study to identify a route for the National Highway from a point on the WSO to the F3. (b) The cost of the study will be $1.8 million. (c) The study will be fully funded by the Commonwealth.

218,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Has a senior officer from 3 RAR been charged; if so, (a) when was he charged, (b) what was the charge and (c) when is a trial expected. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: A former Commanding Officer of 3 RAR has been charged. (a) Charges were preferred on 26 March 2001. (b) The officer was charged with contempt of a service tribunal and an alternative charge of prejudicial behaviour. (c) A Defence Force Magistrate’s trial commenced on 4 July 2001 and concluded on 6 July 2001. Australian Defence Force: 3RAR (Question No. 2688) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: Has the investigation into any Command responsibility associated with the 3RAR affair commenced; if so, when (a) did it commence and (b) is it expected to be completed; if not, when (a) will it commence and (b) will it be completed. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The degree to which the chain of command was aware of matters has been and remains subject to investigation. Action will be taken where evidence supports it. The degree of command responsibility for the incidents as a whole will be determined through an inquiry into the 3RAR command climate. (a) The inquiry will not commence prior to Mr Burchett presenting the findings of the Military Justice Audit. (b) It is anticipated the inquiry into the 3RAR command climate will be completed within 4 months of commencement. Telstra: Public Telephones, Fairfield (Question No. 2691) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 18 June 2001: How many Telstra public telephones were located in the local government area of Fairfield (a) in 1996 and (b) on 1 June 2001. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Telstra advises that it had 175 public payphones in the local government area of Fairfield on 1 June 2001. Whilst the actual number of public payphones in Fairfield in 1996 is not available, Telstra considers that there would have been a slight decrease in payphone numbers for reasons such as the removal of a payphone from sites where there were previously two units. This removal was made necessary by either the decrease in use of the units, or the removal of older generation magnetic stripe cardonly phones when that technology ceased to exist. As stated in its Universal Service Marketing Plan, Telstra must consult with the community prior to removing a payphone, unless it is one of multiple phones in a location. To do this Telstra must place a notice in the payphone for 3 months informing users that Telstra is considering removing the payphone and inviting comment from the community on the removal or the need to keep the payphone in its current location. Telstra will then make its decision on the future of the payphone taking into account this community consultation. Veterans: Prisoners of War (Question No. 2692) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 18 June 2001: (1) How many former prisoners of war and widows of former prisoners of war reside in the electoral division of Prospect.",172,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
219,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) How many of those prisoners of war and widows of former prisoners of war will be entitled to receive the $25 000 compensation announced in the 2001 Budget. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) There are nine former prisoners of war and an estimated eight widows of former prisoners of war residing in the electorate of Prospect. (2) Of those, six former prisoners of war and five known widows of former prisoners of war are entitled to receive the $25,000 payment. Recording Industry: Code of Practice (Question No. 2694) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 June 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in Light magazine of May 2001 titled “When Love Is Not Enough”, in which it is alleged that certain rock music bands encourage acts of violence, drug usage, sex, rape, murder and suicide. (2) Has the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) classified the music of any artist cited in the article; if so, what are those classifications. (3) Are the comments made in the article at page 3 consistent with the OFLC’s findings in respect of its review of those artists. (4) In light of the article, will he recommend the reclassification of those artists whose music is consistent with the comments made, as “Refused Classification”; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) The Classification Board (the Board) is responsible for classifying publications, films and computer games in accordance with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (the Classification Act). Under the Classification Act music lyrics in printed form may be classified as a publication and an audio-visual recording of music, such as a music video clip, may be classified as a film. However, the Board does not have power to classify an audio recording unless the recording can be considered to be a film for the purpose of the Classification Act. Audio recordings are regulated under the Record Industry Code of Practice for Labelling Product with Explicit and Potentially Offensive Lyrics (the Audio Code). The Audio Code came into effect in 1996 with the approval of all Commonwealth, State and Territory Censorship Ministers and is administered by the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA). Censorship Ministers monitor the operation and effectiveness of the Audio Code, and the level of complaint about offensive audio recordings. The article in question lists a number of artists and includes comments about the alleged content of their music. However, the article does not provide information about the specific titles of the recordings being referred to. On the information provided in the article it appears that the recordings are likely to be audio recordings, which are regulated under the Audio Code administered by ARIA, rather than audio-visual recordings which may require classification. The Board has classified 44 audio-visual videotape and CD-ROM recordings of 13 of the 23 artists listed in the article. These recordings include music video clips and films of live performances or tours. The audio-visual recordings were classified by the Board during the period 1988 to 2001 and span the classification categories from ‘G’ to ‘R’ as follows: G 6 PG 9 M 22 MA 5 R 2 X 0 RC 0",173,Taaats Environment Has Improved The Safety Of The System In Which Airservices Operates For
220,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) It is not possible to identify whether or not the audio-visual recordings classified by the Board have a similar content to the recordings referred to in the article. Nor is it possible to correlate the comments made in the article with the reasons for the classification decisions made by the Board with any accuracy. It appears likely that the audio recordings referred to in the article may have a different content than the audio-visual recordings classified by the Board. The reasons cited by the Board for the classification decisions are summarised in the following table: Coarse Language 28 Adult Concepts/Themes 10 Sexual References 5 Drug Use5 Nudity3 (4) The Board does not classify the body of work of an artist, but classifies specific works, being publications, films and computer games, that are submitted to it for the purpose of classification. The article does not provide information about specific recordings or works. There is insufficient information or evidence to suggest that reclassification of the audio-visual recordings classified by the Board is warranted. Adelaide Airport: Australian Noise Exposure Index (Question No. 2696) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 June 2001: (1) What is the process for reviewing the Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI) for Adelaide Airport and (a) at what stage of this process is the current review and (b) when is it likely to conclude. (2) What individuals or organisations are entitled to make recommendations or changing the current ratings and which organisation is responsible for submitting the final recommendations. (3) Who makes the final decision on those recommendations and what additional factors, if any are able to be considered. (4) When will the findings of the review be made public. (5) Aside from the current ANEI review is there currently any other review being conducted associated with noise measurement, monitoring or mitigation in relation to Adelaide airport or any other airport: if so, what are the details.Type in text of question here reproduced exactly as it appears on Notice Paper. An electronic version of the Notice Paper can be found at http://search.aph.gov.au/search/ParlInfo.ASP?action=browse&Path=Chamber&Start=2&cfc#top (1-4) Australian Noise Exposure Index maps are contour maps based on historical data which show the average aircraft noise exposure around airports over a given period. They are prepared in accordance with guidelines issued by Airservices Australia. My Department has commissioned consultants to prepare an Australian Noise Exposure Index covering Adelaide Airport’s operations for the year 2000. The guidelines provide for Airservices Australia to assess the technical accuracy of ANEIs, and this assessment is currently being undertaken. It is intended that the ANEI will be provided to the Adelaide Airport Environment Committee and other interested parties after it has been finalised. My decision on eligibility for insulation under the Airport Noise Insulation Program will be based on the noise exposure contours shown in the ANEI. (5) Most major airports in Australia are involved in activities associated with aircraft noise measurement, monitoring or mitigation. Defence: Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory (Question No. 2697) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 June 2001:",174,Classification Number
221,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) With respect to the operation of his Department’s Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory (AMLR), did the Combatant Protection and Nutrition Board (CPN) breach Government policy by conducting a collaborative project with the CSIRO or any other organisation during 1996-97 on bacteria by reproducing micro-organisms. (2) Was Government policy to allow biological defence work using reproducing micro-organisms not in place until August 1998. (3) Is the AMLR building a class 3 biological containment facility at Fisherman’s Bend, Melbourne, in which the CPN Board will work on infectious agents for diseases such as plague and anthrax; if so, will the same managers who may have breached Government policy in conducting research on bacteria referred to in part (1) have control over this facility. (4) Was the AMLR CPN Branch involved in the biological detection aspects of the Sydney Olympics, including participation in the design of a facility for this purpose by Drs Peter Gray and Ralph Leslie. (5) Did the UK provide the technology for this Olympic detection program and due to design faults, did the facility fail to meet UK Occupational Health and Safety Standards for biological containment, resulting in UK experts being unable to alter the facility when it was in use. (1) No. DSTO did not conduct a collaborative project with CSIRO or any other organisation in 1996/97 on reproducing micro-organisms: a. Up until 1994, DSTO had maintained only a watching brief in the field of biological defence research. In 1994, the Government authorised DSTO to commence a modest program of research into defence against biological weapons using toxins. Toxins are derived from living material but are not reproducing micro-organisms. No authority was granted for work using reproducing micro-organisms. After commencing this program, DSTO did not, at any time prior to August 1998, undertake work using reproducing micro-organisms in its research into defence against biological weapons. b. From its inception, DSTO’s work on biological defence has been overseen by the Biological Defence Advisory Committee (BDAC). This Committee is composed of representatives from the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Attorney General, and an academic proficient in molecular biology. All proposals and research results for work on biological defence research were presented to BDAC. The members of the BDAC found DSTO’s work program to comply fully with Government policy. c. In 1996, DSTO, as part of its arms control related work, purchased reference chemicals including phospholipids and fatty acids from CSIRO. These materials, derived from extracts of killed bacteria, were delivered to AMRL as inert organic chemicals. (2) Yes. Prior to 1998, Government policy proscribed the use of reproducing micro-organisms. In August 1998, Government policy was extended to allow work on reproducing micro-organisms up to Risk Level 3. This policy change was made because DSTO was not well placed to advise the Defence Organisation on defence against biological weapons or assist the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its work to limit and eliminate biological weapons. In addition, DSTO could neither obtain the benefits arising from the exchange of scientific data with our Allies in this area nor develop technologies to protect members of the ADF against the use of biological weapons. (3) DSTO is planning to build a Level3 containment laboratory at Fishermans Bend as part of the move of the Maribyrnong-based activities to Fishermans Bend under the Melbourne Facilities Rationalisation Program. Facilities designed to this level protect staff against the danger of exposure to micro-organisms such as plague and anthrax. This laboratory will be similar to several laboratories in Melbourne’s bioscience research community and teaching hospitals and will be constructed and operated in compliance with the relevant Standards and Codes-of-Practice governing laboratories of this level. The laboratory will be operated and managed by appropriately trained and experienced staff. The laboratory will allow DSTO to conduct research on developing technologies for the rapid detection of and protection against micro-organisms that could be used in biological weapons against members of the Australian Defence Force. There is no evidence that any staff in CPNB, whether they are expected to be managers of the containment laboratory or not, have ever breached Government policy.",175,Reason Number
222,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Yes. CPNB contributed to the biological defence/detection aspects of the security arrangements for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. DSTO’s contribution was highly valued and DSTO has been congratulated on its efforts in this regard. All the staff involved were volunteers and displayed the levels of scientific excellence and professionalism that have come to typify Australian Defence Science. Drs Gray and Leslie were responsible for the design of the physical facility used for this purpose. This facility met all relevant Australian standards and OH&S requirements. The prime consideration in the design and operation of the facility was that it would provide a safe work place. DSTO obtained the advice of independent biological safety experts during the design of the facility. Safety guidelines for the facility were developed and reviewed by an independent consultant for microbiological safety. Specifically: a. the scope of the work to be performed in the facility and concept of operation were discussed with CSIRO Division of Animal Health and also with an independent consultant prior to designing the facility; b. the facility complied with AS/ NZ Standard 2243.3 Part 3, Safety in Laboratories; and c. the Biological Safety Cabinets used in the facility are certified as compliant with AS/NZ Standard 2647, Biological Safety Cabinets Installation and Use.

Visas: Electronic Travel Authorities (Question No. 2702) Mr Sciacca asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: (1) How many visitors to Australia in (a) 1999-2000 and (b) 2000-2001 arrived on Electronic Travel Authorities (ETAs). (2) Is a charge applied for tourists who obtain an ETA to travel to Australia using the services of travel agents, airlines or offshore consulates. (3) Is a charge applied to travel agents or airlines who provide this service for customers. (4) When was the decision made to provide potential visitors with an internet service for obtaining ETAs, as announced by him on 28 May. (5) Was the revenue raised by the $20 service charge applicable to travellers who choose to obtain an ETA via the internet included in budget calculations for 2001-2002. (6) Given that around 4 million tourists a year currently travel to Australia on ETAs, what is the estimated revenue from this charge for 2001-2002. (7) Is the program being administered by his Department or have the services been contracted out; if so, (a) when were tenders called for the contract, (b) when was the contract awarded and (c) what is the value of the contract. (1) (a) In 1999/2000 2.719 million Electronic Travel Authorities (ETAs) were issued to intending travellers to Australia. (b) From1 July 2000 to 31 May 2001 2.748 million ETAs were issued to intending travellers to Australia. There is no Australian Government charge for the Visitor ETA (subclass 976) or the Business Short Validity ETA (subclass 977). There is an Australian Government charge of $60 for the Business Long Validity ETA (subclass 956). The majority of travel agents and airlines impose a processing fee on their clients seeking an ETA. The amount varies considerably from region to region and within regions. For example, travel agents in the London region charge between $36 and $100 Australian dollars per ETA. This is in addition to the $60 Australian Government charge for the Business Long Validity ETA. (3) No. (4) 6 May 2001. (5) No. The $20 service charge is collected by CPS Systems Pty Ltd, the contractor that administers the ETA system on behalf of the Commonwealth.

(6) See (5) above. (7) The ETA system is operated and maintained by CPS Systems Pty Ltd under contract to the Commonwealth. The trial Internet access to the ETA system is being administered by CPS Systems under this contract. (a) Tenders for the ETA system contract were called in 1995. (b) CPS Systems Pty Ltd was awarded the ETA system contract in September 1996. (c) The value of the contract is commercial-in-confidence. Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 2705) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: Has his attention been drawn to allegations of administrative failure within the operations of the Migrant Resource Centre (Southern Tasmania) Inc and the Migrant Resource Centre Tasmania Limited; if so, what are the specific details of the matters that have been alleged to him and what steps has he taken by way of a response to those concerns. My Department has drawn my attention to allegations in relation to the operations of the Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) (Southern Tasmania) Inc. Former employees of MRC (Southern Tasmania) also drew a number of concerns to my attention. A number of steps have been taken to deal with the allegations in relation to the Centre. In May this year, I asked my Department to engage MRC (Southern Tasmania) in informal dispute resolution processes as provided for in the Service Agreement and, at the same time, to consider the option of ceasing funding to the Centre if this was warranted. My Department has been engaged in ongoing discussion with the MRC Management Committee for some months. That dialogue will continue and the MRC’s performance under the Service Agreement will continue to be monitored closely. I have also been informed of concerns raised by the auditor for MRC (Southern Tasmania). These concerns are being actively pursued by my Department. MRC (Southern Tasmania) is due to provide the Department with an audited financial statement at the end of July 2001. In May 2001, my Department provided the MRC with a list of issues the audit is to cover, in order to assess the validity of the allegations. My Department will continue to monitor the performance of the MRC (Southern Tasmania) to ensure that we can confidently continue funding the organisation. The second organisation, Migrant Resource Centre Tasmania Limited, is a newly created entity delivering services contracted by my Department. The allegations relating to this organisation concern personnel practices, and more minor concerns related to financial management practices. My Department is providing support to MRC Tasmania Limited to build its capacity to manage and be accountable for public funding. Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 2706) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: (1) Has the Migrant Resource Centre (Southern Tasmania) Inc made a number of staff changes recently. (2) Has the centre replaced highly qualified staff in the area of refugee settlement with staff who have no appropriate qualifications to undertake that task. (3) Was a recent staff member appointed to administer the PICC program with no appropriate background.",177,Reason Number
224,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Have a number of staff either been dismissed or forced to leave the employment of the centre in circumstances which have given rise to claims for unfair dismissal. (5) Is his Department committed to ensuring that the Migrant Resource Centre meets minimum standards of employment as prescribed by the agreements that are entered into between his Department and the centre. (6) What is the reason for the centre declining to implement the determination made on 1 June 2001 by Commissioner Abbey for the reinstatement of Ms Maureen Adamson. (1) The Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) (Southern Tasmania) has made a number of staff changes in the past seven months. The MRC: terminated employment of a Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) worker whose project funding ceased in late 2000; dismissed an administrative officer in February 2001, who has since been reinstated; employed a number of temporary staff to cover staff shortages; and an administration officer resigned in June 2001. (2) MRC (Southern Tasmania) has not replaced highly qualified staff in the area of refugee settlement with staff who have no appropriate qualifications to undertake that task. (3) The PICC program is not funded by my Department. I am, therefore, unable to provide a response to this question. (4) There have been two instances in the past seven months in which claims of unfair dismissal against MRC (Southern Tasmania) have been heard by the Tasmanian Industrial Relations Commission. One case was initially settled outside of the Commission, but has recently been renewed by the complainant. The other case is the subject of an appeal by the MRC (see also the response to question 6 below). (5) My Department is committed to ensuring that this MRC and all core funded MRCs and Migrant Service Agencies (MSAs) meet the minimum standards of employment as prescribed by the agreements that are entered into between my Department and those agencies. The Service Agreement signed between my Department and MRC (Southern Tasmania) requires that workers are employed at a salary commensurate with the skills and qualifications required for the delivery of the work program and in line with relevant legislation. All funded agencies are expected to abide by that requirement. To assist funded organisations to meet these management responsibilities my Department provides training for Management Committees, and in this case is represented on the Management Committee of MRC (Southern Tasmania) in an ex-officio capacity. Ultimate legal responsibility for employment matters rests with the funded organisation. (6) I am advised that the Management Committee of MRC (Southern Tasmania) appealed the decision of Commissioner Abbey of the Industrial Relations Commission because the decision stipulated that the date for Mrs Adamson to return to work should be 12 June 2001. I am advised that the Management Committee believed that this was too soon for an effective reintegration plan to be put in place for her return and that the MRC needed further time to arrange that process. I am also advised that the MRC is nonetheless committed to Mrs Adamson being returned to work at the MRC and is facilitating that process as soon as practicable. Rail: Alice Springs to Darwin Railway (Question No. 2707) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) With respect to agreement/s entered into by the Commonwealth Government in relation to the financing of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, what are the final financial commitments and arrangements for those commitments for the South Australian, Northern Territory and Commonwealth Governments and the private sector. (2) Is this the final financial contribution of the Commonwealth Government to this project. (3) Is there any reference in the final financial agreement that would enable a further call on the Commonwealth for additional funding; if so what is it.",178,Reason Number
225,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Is the Commonwealth committed, or likely to be called to commit, to any other type of contribution to this project; if so, what are the details. (1) (2) and (3)The agreements entered into by the Commonwealth allow for the provision of Commonwealth funds of up to $191.4m in the form of a grant. $20.05m of this total is being provided on a standby basis. The Northern Territory Government has advised that it is providing financial support of $191.4m to the project and the Government of South Australia has advised it is providing $176.4m. The Commonwealth is not party to agreements relating to financing provided by South Australia, the Northern Territory or the private sector. The Northern Territory Government has provided an assurance that there will be no further claims for Commonwealth support for the project and a statement to this effect has been included in the final financial arrangement. (4) The Commonwealth has entered into a long-term peppercorn lease of the existing line between Tarcoola and Alice Springs to the consortium building the railway. Visas: Temporary Protection (Question No. 2708) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) How many persons, by country of citizenship, have been (a) granted and (b) refused a (TPV) since their introduction. (2) In considering requests for TPVs, has his Department gathered information on what is the expected number of people who would seek to come to Australia under existing family reunion arrangements if they were extended to TPVs; if so, what are the projections by country of citizenship for those (a) granted and (b) not yet granted TPVs. (1) Since the introduction of the TPV on 20 October 1999 to 31 May 2001, there have been 5,093 TPV grants and 843 refusals. A summary of TPV grants by nationality is at TableA below and TPV refusals by nationality at TableB below. (2) Information on the number and type of family members offshore for each TPV applicant is captured by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) at the individual case level. DIMA systems changes to be introduced later this year will enable precise aggregated information to be gathered on the potential family member sponsorship flow-on from TPV holders. Conservative estimates of an average of two family unit members offshore for each TPV holder would lead to a potential exposure of up to 10,186 family sponsorship applications flowing from existing TPV holders, provided that those TPV holders were successful in gaining permanent residence at the end of their TPV period. Each protection visa application is individually assessed on its merits and volumes of TPV decisions will depend on the rate of future unauthorised arrivals. If unauthorised arrivals arrive at a rate of 458 per month in 2001-2002, at historical nationality composition and approval rates, there would be some 4,122 TPV approvals flowing from the unauthorised arrivals in that year.

Miss Jackie Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: This Government is encouraging Australians to take advantage of their leisure time and increase their participation in sport or simply take a break. On the 24th April 2001 the Government announced its new policy for Australian sport, ‘Backing Australia’s Sporting AbilityA More Active Australia’, which included a package of $82 million over four years an increase of $32 million to significantly increase the numbers of Australians playing sport at the local club and school participation level. The Government has also set a new benchmark for industry partnerships through the ‘See Australia’ program which encourages more Australians to take a ‘home-grown’ holiday. This campaign, which is jointly funded by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments and the industry, is based on solid research into what motivates Australians in making their travel choices and serves as a reminder for Australians to take a break. Australian Defence Industries: Bushmaster Contract (Question No. 2711) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Has the production commencement date of early 2000 for the Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Bushmaster contract at ADI’s Bendigo facility been changed initially to 2001 and then further postponed to 2003. (2) Are job redundancies at the Bendigo plant likely because of the delay in commencing production. (3) What is the reason for the delay. (4) When will production of the Bushmaster armoured personnel carrier commence. (1) The Bushranger contract, signed in May 1999, required ADI to commence delivery of production vehicles in July 2000. However, the Department’s evaluation of the prototype Bushmaster vehicle, delivered in April 2000, identified a number of technical shortfalls that require rectification before the design can be finalised. Consequently, approval to commence production has not yet been granted. We expect to agree a revised production schedule by December this year. (2) The Department is not aware of the number of job redundancies, if any, intended at ADI’s Bendigo plant and the question should be addressed to the company. (3) The delay in commencing production is due to technical shortfalls in the vehicle prototype. (4) Subject to the successful conclusion of negotiations on the way ahead to rectify the vehicle shortfalls and further evaluation of another prototype, series production is expected to commence in late 2003. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2714) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Further to part (7) of the reply to question No. 2477, Hansard, 7 June 2001 page 27665, by what criteria has the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) been very successful in sharing the noise. (2) Is the aggregate movements of aircraft to the north of Sydney Airport still approximately 27.3%. (3) Is the LTOP for Sydney Airport forecast for movements to the north 17%. (4) Are there approximately 60% more movements to the north of Sydney Airport than forecast in the LTOP.",180,Afghanistan 2157 Albania 3 Algeria 6 Angola 1
228,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:(5) Further to part (10) of the reply to question No. 2477, is he aware of the minutes of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, including various resolutions requesting project scheduling for the implementation of the LTOP and requests for discrete start and end dates for the implementation of the LTOP. (6) Has Airservices Australia given him or any other person reasons why the LTOP has not been fully implemented; if so, what are those reasons. (7) Will he table a copy of those reasons in the House. (8) Will he request from Airservices Australia a date when it expects the full implementation of the LTOP to be complete; if so, when will he make this request. (9) Further to part (12) of the reply to question No. 2477, did the environmental impact statement on Sydney West Airport undertaken in 1996, consider the do nothing option of no Sydney West Airport being built. (10) In light of the leasing of Sydney Airport without the existence of Sydney West Airport, has a genuine environmental impact statement considered the foreshadowed environmental impact. (11) Is there is no satisfactory solution to the current aircraft noise problem in Sydney. (12) Further to part (15) of the reply to question No. 2477, does the Governments announcement of 13 December 2000 to use Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport mean that Sydney and Bankstown Airports are too close for their intended use; if not, why not. (1) The Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) has been very successful in reducing overflights of those areas to the north of the Airport which were the most severely affected communities under the previous Government’s operating regime. The Plan has brought about an approximate 40% reduction in the number of landings from the north compared to the arrangements in place under the previous Labor Government. By opening the east-west runway it is now possible to rotate the runways in use so that areas are given a break from aircraft noise for at least some periods on most days. Prior to March 1996 all aircraft taking off to the north had to use the main runway and travel to the Parramatta River before turning towards their destination. Under LTOP departures to the north are shared between the two parallel runways and almost all aircraft taking off from the main north-south runway turn toward the north-west before reaching the Parramatta River so that, as far as possible, areas receiving noise from aircraft arriving from the north gain respite when aircraft are taking off to the north. (2) For the year 2001, the aggregate movements of aircraft to the north of Sydney Airport up until 31 May is 29.4%. (3) and(4) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (1) of question No. 2600. (5) The Chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum writes to me following every meeting of the Forum to report on the actions and resolutions. (6) and (7) The Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) has been substantially implemented with the exception of a small number of elements. For example, the restructuring of the arrival airspace has yet to be implemented. This includes implementation of the “trident” and “power-off” approaches. A number of complexities associated with safety and operational constraints have impinged on the implementation of this part of the Plan. (8) Airservices Australia has indicated that work on the implementation of LTOP is continuing. (9) and (10) The Supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the Second Sydney Airport Proposal, which was released in 1999, addressed the “Do Nothing” option. (11) I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (7) of question No. 2477. (12) No. I refer the Honourable Member to my answer to part (16) of question No. 2477. North Korea: Australian Aid (Question No. 2717) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Further to his reply to part (2) of my question No 2545, through what multilateral channels is further humanitarian assistance to North Korea being considered.",183,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7
229,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) When will the Government’s consideration to provide further humanitarian assistance to North Korea be finalised. (1) Australia will provide humanitarian assistance to North Korea through those multilateral organisations that are operating in DPRK such as the World Food Programme and UNICEF. (2) On the 28th JuneI announced the provision of further $5 million for the purchase of Australian wheat to be distributed through the World Food Programme’s emergency food operation. Australia will also continue to provide training in high priority areas through UNICEF. Defence: Stockton Rifle Range (Question No. 2718) Mr Horne asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 June 2001: (1) Was the expected revenue from the sale of Stockton Rifle Range included in forward asset sales by his Department in the 2001 Budget. (2) What value was attributed to the Stockton Rifle Range. (3) How was the value determined. (4) Are there any conditions related to usage that will apply to a purchase. (1) The revenue from the sale of the Stockton Rifle Range has been programmed for receipt in the 2001-02 financial year. (2) The value of the Stockton Rifle Range has been ascertained from an independent valuation conducted by the Australian Valuation Office (AVO) in May 1998. The AVO placed a market value of $630,000 at that time. (3) The valuation was determined on the basis of the continued use of the property as a rifle range. (4) The usage of the property would be subject to local planning requirements administered by the Port Stephens Council. Australian Defence Force: East Timor (Question No. 2720) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) On what date did the Australian Training Support Team– East Timor (ATST-EM) commence operations. (2) How many service men and women are currently serving with ATST-ET and to whom does the Team report. (3) Do the condition of service for Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel serving with ATST-EM differ from those applying to all other ADF personnel serving in East Timor; if so, what are the details and the reason for the different treatment. (4) In what sector of East Timor does the Team operate and who is responsible for the provision of security for it. (1) 7 personnel assigned to the Australian Training Support Team– East Timor (ATST-ET) commenced the provision of training support in Aileu on 26 February 2001. (2) The Team is currently comprised of 24 personnel. The officer commanding the team reports directly to: the Defence Liaison Officer in Dili for matters concerning the delivery of the defence cooperation program; and the Commander Australian Contingent – East Timor for matters specific to security, ADF personnel and discipline. (3) The tasks being performed by the members of the ATST-EM are training support activities and are considered ‘peacetime’ in nature. It is not possible to arm members of the ATST-EM because they are not part of the United Nations Peacekeeping operation. Accordingly the ‘peacetime’ long-term",184,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7

ADF members serving with the United Nations Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) are armed and tasked with enforcing peace. Accordingly they have been approved to receive ‘warlike’ conditions of service in recognition of the warlike nature of the tasks on which they are engaged. (4) The Team is located in Sector Central. The Portuguese contingent of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force is responsible for the provision of security in Sector Central. Australian Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Storage, Maintenance and Distribution Project (Question No. 2721) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) When did the bids close for the market testing process for the Australian Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Storage, Maintenance and Distribution Project. (2) Did the Government advise the Parliament at various times that the market testing process would be completed by (a) November 1999, (b) June 2000 and (c) December 2000. (3) On what date was the market testing process actually completed and what was the cause of the delay. (4) How many (a) positions and (b) separate ordnance sites were subject to the market testing process and (c) what was the cost of maintaining the existing system in 2000-2001. (5) How many (a) positions and (b) separate ordnance sites has the successful tenderer agreed to continue to operate and what is the expected cost of the new system in 2000-2002. (6) If any ordnance sites are to be closed, what are the details. (1) 26 November 1999. (2) Yes. (3) A submission was forwarded to the Minister for Defence on 19 May 2000 and the Preferred Tenderer was announced on 28 November 2000. There was some delay in the Project due to the need to resolve operational and safety issues. Further delay was caused when project staff were diverted to negotiating an ammunition supply contract linked to the sale of ADI. (4) (a) 98 military and 203 civilian manpower positions. (b) 18 sites were included in the scope of the project. (c) The cost of maintaining the existing system in Financial Year 2000-2001 was $32 million. (5) (a) 150 positions. (b) 16 sites. (c) The contract is $22 million per annum plus one off implementation costs for Financial Year 2001/2002 of $9 million. Total costs for Financial Year 2001/2002 are estimated at $31 million. (6) One site, Somerton Victoria will be closed. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: TripleJ (Question No. 2725) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: Does the Government currently have any plans to sell ABC Radio Station JJJ; if so, what are those plans; if not what is the Government’s long term position regarding public ownership of Triple J. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Decisions relating to the sale of assets or property of the ABC are a matter for the ABC Board and Executive.

234,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsNetworking The Nation Program: New South Wales State Library (Question No. 2726) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Why has the Government, through the Networking the Nation program, made funds available to the NSW State Library to finance the installation of broadband internet access in up to 90 districts without any consultation with existing commercial internet service providers (ISPs) in those districts. (2) Is the Government concerned that Networking the Nation staff have advised at least one regional ISP not to invest in broadband technology such as duplex satellite and wireless as the State Library of NSW will be providing broadband in direct competition with the local ISP; if so, what action will be taken; if not, why not. (3) Does the Government condone the use of Networking the Nation funding to establish services which directly impact on the future viability and expansion of legitimate regional, commercial operators; if so, why; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The independent Board of the Networking the Nation (NTN) program approved $4,990,000 for the NSW State Library’s Rural Link project in the November 2000 funding round, on the basis that this would provide broadband access to 90 or so smaller rural communities across NSW considerably sooner and more economically than would be the case if left to normal commercial developments. The NTN approval was subject to the project being tendered out, the bandwidth being made available to other interested service providers, including ISPs, on a reasonable wholesale basis, and that the successful tenderer/s would not provide internet access on a retail basis to the general public, in other words they would not be in competition with commercial service providers. (2) Networking the Nation’s advice to the local ISP was that the State Library project provided another option for the ISP to obtain wholesale broadband connectivity and the ISP may wish to consult the State Library directly, to explore the opportunities for economical wholesale access to broadband through the State Library process. The ISP was further advised that the approval of the State Library project was subject to the successful tenderer/s, firstly, not being able to retail internet access beyond a very limited, clearly defined group of potential users and certainly not to the general public and, secondly, that any ‘excess’ bandwidth was to be made available on a reasonable wholesale basis to any interested other service providers, including ISPs, for them to retail to the general community. The ISP should not have gained the impression that the State Library project would directly compete with them in providing ISP or broadband services to the general public. (3) This Networking the Nation project does not adversely affect the viability and expansion of commercial providers. It does not compete in the provision of internet access to the general public. Indeed, it is expected to offer commercial providers significant benefits through provision of access, on reasonable wholesale terms, to enhanced bandwidth that they can then provide to the public on normal commercial terms. Centrelink: Compensation Payments (Question No. 2729) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) How does Centrelink calculate preclusion periods for people in receipt of lump sum compensation payments for workplace or other injuries. (2) Is he aware of the concerns of some compensation recipients that the method of calculating their preclusion periods does not take into account subsequent increases in the ‘income cut out amount’ used to determine the length of their preclusion periods. (3) Does the method of calculating preclusion periods disproportionately disadvantage clients with larger payments; if not why not.",186,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7
235,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(4) Will the Government consider amending the method of calculating compensation preclusion periods to take into account increases in the income cut out amounts occurring after the award of a lump sum compensation payment; if not, why not. (1) A preclusion period is calculated using one of the following methods: Settlements – When a matter settles by consent, 50 per cent of the gross settlement amount is taken to be in respect of economic loss. This amount is divided by the single person income cut off amount for pensions applying at the time the lump sum is received and the resultant number is the number of weeks in the preclusion period; or Judgements – When a matter is finalised after a contested hearing, the judgement is examined to determine the total amount awarded to economic loss. The economic loss component is divided by the single person income cut off amount for pensions applying at the time the lump sum is received. The resultant number is the number of weeks in the preclusion period. (2) Yes, this matter has been considered. However, it has been the view of successive Commonwealth governments that the primary responsibility for the support of people who are injured because of a compensable injury lies with the relevant State or Territory compensation scheme, and not with taxpayer funded social security programs. As such, it is the responsibility of compensation schemes to ensure that compensation recipients are adequately compensated for increases in the cost of living. It should also be noted that the divisor applying as at 30 June 2001 assumes that a person affected by a preclusion period would be able to support themselves on around $29 000 per annum. This is approximately three times the amount a person in receipt of Newstart Allowance would be entitled to. (3) No, the formula used by Centrelink to calculate the preclusion period takes into account the compensation recipient’s economic loss and so proportionally, all lump sum compensation payments are treated equally. It should also be noted that the vast majority of compensation recipients serve relatively short preclusion periods. 80 per cent of the lump sum compensation recipients who commenced a social security payment in May 2001 served a preclusion period of less than two years (50 per cent less than one year). (4) No, refer (2) above. If people receiving compensation are in financial hardship, the Social Security Act provides for some or all of a compensation payment to be disregarded. This means that preclusion periods can be reduced or negated where special circumstances exist. Australian Defence Industries: Staffing and Salaries (Question No. 2732) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: What was the total number of employees at Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Bendigo and what total amount in salaries and wages was paid to them (a) when the Government gained office in 1996 and (b) immediately prior to ADI Bendigo and ADI Australia being sold. (a) and (b) Although ADI was Commonwealth owned, the company was operated by an independent Board of Directors. Shareholder Ministers, including the Minister for Defence, were not involved in the day to day running of the company. There were no legal policy or administrative requirements for ADI to provide detailed information of this kind to the Government and it is not available in the department. This information should be sought directly from ADI.

237,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) In what amounts, on what dates, and from what sources did the Government forward funds to the City of Greater Bendigo pursuant to the promise made by the Coalition parties during the 1996 election to pay $2 million towards the cost of redeveloping the Bendigo Art Gallery. (2) Did the then Minister for the Arts, Senator Alston, state before the 1998 election that a cheque for $2 million was as good as in the post. (3) In what amounts and at what dates has the Government forwarded funds to the City of Greater Bendigo pursuant to its decision to redirect the $2 million to the further development of the Bendigo Regional Arts Centre. (4) By what date does it plan to have paid the final payment for this purpose to the City of Greater Bendigo. (1)-(4) The Government was to provide $2 million to the Bendigo Art Gallery but when it became clear that the money was not required for the Art Gallery it was directed to the Bendigo Regional Arts Centre. A Deed of Grant for the Bendigo Regional Arts Centre was executed and signed on 29 May 2001. An initial payment of $200,000 was released within 28 days of signing. Gradual payments will be made on achievement of key milestones. In accordance with the Deed of Grant and agreed milestones advised by the Council, the final grant instalment of $200,000 should be made by 30 September 2002. Illegal Immigration: Port Hedland Detention Centre (Question No. 2738) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Is he aware of the existence of an isolation cell at Port Hedland Immigration Detention Centre. (2) Is this cell used for all new asylum-seekers that have arrived by boat, who are forced to stay there until their first interview with immigration officials. (3) Is he aware that one detainee had to wait for 16 months in isolation before his first interview, and several detainees had to wait for 7 months. (4) What is the reason for these long periods of isolation before even the first interview is granted to asylum-seekers. (5) Will he abolish this practice of isolation immediately. (1) No, there is no isolation cell at Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC), or any immigration detention facility. However, there are three observation rooms at Port Hedland IRPC. These are not used for recent arrivals, but to monitor detainees who require close supervision for medical reasons or who are at risk of self-harm. (2) No, as I have just stated, isolation cells do not exist at Port Hedland IRPC, or any other immigration detention facility. However, all new unauthorised arrivals at Port Hedland IRPC are placed in accommodation that is separate from the established detention population. This is known as separation detention. At Port Hedland IRPC detainees in separation are accommodated in standard accommodation blocks which are in a separate area of the detention centre. The accommodation in these blocks is the same as in the rest of the centre i.e: small dormitory style accommodation. Detainees in separation detention are able to mix with the group with which they arrived, but not with the established detainee population in the main compound. Separation detention is maintained throughout initial entry processing. (3) All persons taken into detention are interviewed. These interviews are usually conducted within 2-14 days of arrival. I am not aware that any detainee had to wait up to 7 or 16 months for an initial interview. Detainees may continue in separation detention after their initial interview if they have not made claims, which prima facie, may engage Australia’s protection obligations. They are therefore available for removal. (4) As stated earlier, all new arrivals to Port Hedland IRPC, or any other IRPC, have an initial entry interview with my Departmental officers soon after their arrival. This usually takes place between",188,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7

239,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:2-14 days after arrival at the immigration detention facility. Detainees are in separation detention, not isolation during initial entry processing. (5) As previously stated, isolation cells do not exist. There is also no plan to abolish the current practice of separation detention. To do so would compromise the integrity of the protection visa process. Separation detention ensures that Australia’s resources are directed at those with genuine claims for protection and not those who would use the protection process in an attempt to achieve migration outcomes. Illegal Immigration: Port Hedland Detention Centre (Question No. 2739) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Have a detainee and his wife been removed from Port Hedland Immigration Detention Centre and held in custody while their two young children remain at Port Hedland. (2) Does he support such separation of family units. (3) Will he ensure that the two young children are immediately released into the care of relevant child welfare bodies until the future of their parents is determined. (1) A married couple who had been detained at Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) has been removed from the detention facility and placed in custody. The father is facing a charge of ‘threatening a Commonwealth Officer’ and is currently being held at Hakea Prison. He is also facing a prior charge of people smuggling. The mother is facing charges of ‘threatening a Commonwealth officer’ and ‘inciting’, and is currently being held at Bandyup Women’s Prison. Two of their sons, aged 15 and 17 years were also charged with ‘threatening a Commonwealth officer’ and were dealt with by the Perth Children’s Court. They were subsequently bailed to the Perth Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) pending the outcome of their parents’ matters. Two younger children, aged 6 and 10 years, remain in the care of Port Hedland IRPC. (2) As a general policy my Department tries to keep families together, however, given the seriousness of the charges against the parents it was not possible in this case. Appropriate care arrangements have been in place for the two younger children being held at Port Hedland IRPC. Australasian Correctional Management’s (ACM) child protection officer, in consultation with the Department of Family and Community Services (FACS), arranged and monitored their care with female ACM officers and a female counsellor. Arrangements included placement of the two children with appropriate adult detainees willing to take a care and custody role in relation to the children. Contact visits with their parents have been facilitated for all four children. (3) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has been liaising with FACS regarding the management of this family. All decisions have been and will continue to be made in consultation with FACS and ACM. At this point it has not been deemed necessary to place the two younger children into the care of child welfare agencies. Illegal Immigration: Port Hedland Detention Centre (Question No. 2740) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Will he investigate allegations relating to Port Hedland Immigration Detention Centre that (a) many detainees, upon visiting the medical centre to receive relief from various afflictions, are told to drink ten or twenty glasses of water instead of receiving any reasonable medical attention, (b) during the police raid on Port Hedland on 26 May, several ACM staff destroyed artwork produced by women and children detainees by painting large swastikas over their artwork, (c) an entire family was locked for 50 days in Juliet Block with 15 others, and given only a plastic bag to tie around their waists, as there was no toilet, (d) a particular ACM guard at the Centre has been continually responsible for flagrant abuses of the basic rights of detainees, including racist taunts,",189,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7
240,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:bashings and constant torments and (e) two detainees have complained three times about the abuse they receive by this guard, but no action has taken place. (2) Is he aware that many detainees from Port Hedland now being held in Hakea Prison showed physical evidence of inhumane treatment against them, including scars and bruises from bashings and handcuffs being put on so tight as to cut through the skin. (1) An established complaints mechanism exists at each centre which allows detainees to make formal and informal complaints to detention centre management, to officers of my Department as well as to independent investigative bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s Office. Please be assured that both myself and my Department take seriously all allegations of mistreatment towards immigration detainees. All allegations are fully investigated. If they are substantiated then appropriate action is taken. (a) Any person who presents themselves to medical staff with a complaint or condition is fully investigated and appropriate treatment is prescribed. Dehydration is a common condition suffered by people in the detention community at the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC). If not addressed serious health problems can occur. Maintaining high water consumption can help to prevent these conditions. Therefore, as part of an education and management program, detainees are always encouraged to maintain a high level of fluid intake. (b) I have been advised by Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) that an internal investigation into this matter has been completed. This investigation was based on allegations raised against two Detention Officers. The allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. (c) In late July 2000, Juliet Block was used to accommodate three families who were transferred from the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. The longest time spent in this accommodation block by any of these families was 33 days. Functioning toilet and ablution facilities were present in Juliet Block when it was used to accommodate detainees. Juliet Block has not been used to accommodate detainees since early February 2001, because it is being refurbished as part of an ongoing program. (d) Without specific information my Department is unable to check these allegations. Neither the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) nor ACM is aware of the allegations referred to in this part of the question. (e) As mentioned earlier allegations without adequate detail are difficult to respond to. However, I have been advised that on 1 June 2001, ACM received a complaint from a detainee alleging improper behaviour of a Detention Officer during the operation on 26 May 2001. ACM’s internal investigation into the matter, which concluded on 4 June 2001, found that the specific allegations could not be substantiated. (2) I have received advice from Hakea Prison which indicates that no detainees exhibited any evidence of being bashed, bruised or scarred as a result of treatment received prior to their arrival at Hakea Prison. I am advised that handcuffs were applied to the detainees by the Australian Federal Police in preparation for their transfer to Hakea Prison. This was carried out in accordance with standard police procedure which stipulates that handcuffs be applied in order to allow a space of one finger width between cuff and wrist. Immigration: Detainees’ Facilities, Services and Activities (Question No. 2750) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 2001: Further to the Summary of Facilities, Services and Activities Available to Detainees, dated 14 June 2001 and distributed to all Federal Members of Parliament, (a) is he able to say what Afghani cricket is and how it is played and (b) what is Aussie dingo – bazey dabelna.",190,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7

242,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) “Afghani” cricket is a game played by detainees last summer at Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and is a combination of cricket and baseball. The object of the game is to score as many runs as possible. A tennis ball is pitched as in baseball, to the person batting; the bat is approximately the same size and shape as a cricket bat. When the batter hits the ball he is to run around the outside of the field, touching at least one of several bases as he goes, if necessary the runner can wait on one of the bases until the next person bats. One person at a time is permitted on the bases; once another batter hits the ball and runs, the previous runner must run for home base. The fielders can get a runner out by throwing the tennis ball at him; the ball must make contact with the runner for him to be out. (b) Aussie dingo is, in fact, Australian slang for bingo. Bazey dabelna is the Arabic translation. Bingo is very popular in the centre and is played for soft drinks, chips and the like. Education: Student Nurses (Question No. 2752) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, 26 June 2001: (1) Are there a number of student vacancies at the various Colleges of Nursing throughout Australia; if so, (a) what is the number of those vacancies and (b) where are those vacancies located. (2) Would the abolition of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) for student nurses increase the number of enrolments of student nurses at the Australian Colleges of Nursing; if not, why not. (3) Will he consider abolishing HECS payments for student nurses. (1) Colleges of Nursing are not in receipt of Commonwealth operating grants under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and do not offer HECS liable courses. Since 1994 pre-registration nursing training has been provided by universities. Universities themselves are responsible for deciding the number of places offered in each discipline each year. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) does not have data on the number of offers made by individual universities nor the number of places universities set aside for nursing in any given year. However, through Profiles discussions, the Department is aware that some institutions are having difficulty attracting students who meet the necessary academic standards into nursing courses. (2) Previous studies on the impact of HECS have concluded that the Scheme does not appear to have had a significant effect on applications, particularly from school leavers, or on choice of discipline. However, these studies have not focussed on nursing students specifically. (3) The National Review of Nursing Education, announced in April 2001, will make recommendations on mechanisms for both attracting new recruits to nursing including those from different age groups (both male and female), and encouraging a commitment to life-long learning by those already engaged in nursing. The Review will report in early 2002. The Government will consider the recommendations from the Review, including any it may make about the impact of HECS on nursing. Sydney Aircraft Noise Insulation Program: Fort Street High School (Question No. 2768) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 27 June 2001: (1) Has he replied to correspondence sent to him on 25 February from Michael McGuirk, Chair of Fort Street High School Council, regarding insulation for Fort Street High School: if not, why not? (2) Will the Government agree to insulate Fort Street High School from aircraft noise? (1) Yes. The reply from my Office was signed on 19 March 2001. (2) No. Fort Street High School does not qualify for insulation under long standing eligibility criteria for the insulation program set by the previous Labor Government.",191,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7

244,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence: Ingleburn Army Camp (Question No. 2771) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 June 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2413 (Hansard 27 November 1997, page 11589), did the then Minister for Defence expect the Heritage Assessment of Ingleburn Army Camp to be completed by December 1997. (2) When was the Heritage Assessment completed. (3) What do the results of the Heritage Assessment show. (4) What caused the long delay in the completion of the Assessment. (5) What items of heritage significance have been lost due to neglect and vandalism during the period of delay in completing the Heritage Assessment. (6) What action will he and his Department take in implementing the results of the Heritage Assessment. (7) Will he now review the process of heritage assessment by his Department to avoid circumstances, in which (a) his Department is planning to develop one of its sites, such as Ingleburn, for commercial purposes, (b) the elimination of heritage items on the site potentially increases the commercial development value of the site and (c) as a consequence, his Department has a conflict of interest between its commercial objectives and its heritage responsibilities. (1) Yes. (2) June 2001. (3) The Heritage Assessment provides a definitive understanding of the heritage values of the site concluding with recommendations for effective heritage management during disposal planning process. The Assessment analyses the activities of the former Camp concluding that, in many areas, the social and cultural history is of more importance than the architectural values. Existing significant items of heritage include the Cumberland Plain vegetation, the Bardia entry gates and associated guardhouse, memorials, the Mont St Quentin oval and adjacent trees along Campbelltown Road. The Assessment recommends these and some other items be nominated for inclusion on the Register of the National Estate. (4) The delay in completing the Assessment resulted from the need to undertake additional complementary studies including a social values assessment, economic and re-use options assessment of existing dwellings to determine feasible and prudent alternatives. These studies continued through until 2001 and their outcomes are incorporated into the Heritage Assessment. Some of the delay was also attributable to the detailed planning of the Military Heritage Precinct in consultation with the ex-service community. (5) The former Theatre building, identified as having heritage value, was burnt down by vandals in December 1999 after additional fencing had been installed to deter unauthorised access. (6) The Assessment will guide future land use planning and management with the Department of Defence recently initiating steps to implement all of the recommendations of the Heritage Assessment. It is also proposed that large areas of Cumberland Plain Woodland will be nominated for listing on the Register of the National Estate as well as that discrete portion of the site, which now accommodates the Military Heritage Precinct. The Precinct will include items of built heritage significance and a representative selection of standard military buildings. (7) Like all landowners, Defence does have to address a range of issues regarding its surplus properties. The Department is also required to comply with legislation and Government policies protecting the heritage and environmental qualities of all of its properties. Qualified consultants undertake any necessary studies. Furthermore, Defence does not act unilaterally in relation to future land use and works closely with State and local planning authorities. Sudan: Aid (Question No. 2775) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 27 June 2001:",192,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7
245,Mr Reith,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Has his attention been drawn to the plight of the communities in Southern Sudan and an innovative program devised by and for the people of that war zone to rebuild their communities, which includes a wish to establish an AM broadcasting services to transmit in 16 main languages programs dealing with sanitation and sterilisation of drinking water, AIDS, family planning, primary health care, peace and reconciliation, education and self-reliance through income generating activities. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to the alleged manipulation of the Operation Life Line Sudan aid by the Khartoum regime. (3) Has he or his Department been approached to join with the US in providing independent aid to Southern Sudan. (4) What measures is the Government willing to take to assist with this example of an abused community developing practical strategies to solve social and economic problems. (1) AusAID and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officers have been made aware of the proposal by communities in Southern Sudan to establish an AM broadcasting service. This proposal mirrors a number of similar initiatives already underway by the international community. The National Sudan Council of Churches is being funded by Pax Christi (a group of Churches from the Netherlands in collaboration with a Dutch broadcasting organisation). To date 2000 radios have been provided in Southern Sudan through their “Radio Voice for Hope Project”. UNICEF are also proposing a similar project using satellite links to broadcast radio messages and in southern Sudan. (2) Although allegations of manipulation of OLS by all of the parties to the conflict emerge from time to time, the international community is maintaining the integrity of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). The Government of Sudan and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement are both signatories to the OLS agreements on access to beneficiary civilian populations, along with the United Nations as the third party. OLS provides aid on a purely humanitarian basis. There have been no proven allegations of manipulation by the Government of Sudan. We will continue to work to ensure the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance. (3) All Australian assistance to southern Sudan is given on humanitarian grounds. All aid has either been channelled through Australian NGOs operating in the region or United Nations agencies such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme. Australia has not been approached to join with the US in providing humanitarian aid to southern Sudan. (4) Sudan has consistently been one of the largest recipients of Australian humanitarian relief. Since March 1996, Australia has provided over $17 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan through Australian non-government organisations, international agencies and the World Food Programme. While Australia recognises the needs created by this ongoing complex emergency, there are many calls on Australia’s funds. Due to the pressing humanitarian needs in our own region as a result of the crises in East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as the continuing humanitarian impacts of the Asian economic crisis, the focus of Australian aid is necessarily on priorities in the Asia Pacific region. Australia, will however, continue to monitor the situation in Sudan and respond accordingly. Visas: Subclass 457 (Question No. 2788) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 28 June 2001: (1) What are the employer’s obligations when sponsoring off-shore temporary skilled labour on 457 visas relating to employee rights on (a) workers’ compensation policy, (b) superannuation registration, (c) long service leave and (d) wage and tax recognition. (2) Do these temporary visa holders have medical health cover; if so, what are the details; if not, what is available. (1) All Australian employers sponsoring offshore employees are required to abide by Australian laws applicable to Australian employees. Conditions of employment are set out in the relevant state or",193,Stateless 8 Sudan 1 Syria 10 Tanzania 1 Tunisia 2 Turkey 17 Uganda 1 Unknown 4 Yemen 3 Yugoslavia Fed Republic Of 7

247,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:federal legislation, state or federal award, Industry Sector award, collective agreement or Australian Workplace Agreement under which an employee is covered. Temporary residents employed under an award or an agreement are subject to the conditions of that award or agreement. (a) Overseas employees are covered by Australian state or federal workers’ compensation legislation. Compensation entitlements may vary from state to state. All persons who work under a contract of service, regardless of their taxpaying or residency status, are eligible for coverage under workers’ compensation legislation. (b) Australian sponsors are required to register all overseas employees sponsored under the 457 visa subclass in accordance with Australian superannuation laws and make the appropriate superannuation deductions and payments. (c) Long service leave entitlements set out in relevant legislation, awards or agreements are applicable to all employees covered by the legislation, award or agreement. (d) Sponsors must sign an undertaking to comply with Australian industrial laws and Australian levels of remuneration and conditions of employment, commensurate with any relevant awards and standards. All employees in Australia are subject to Australian taxation legislation. An assessment of the tax status of temporary residents is made by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) under their Residency Tests. The agencies responsible for particular legislation are responsible for investigations and detection of possible breaches and enforcement of their legislation. (2) Temporary Business (Long Stay) visa holders are not entitled to access Medicare. The business sponsor is required to accept financial responsibility for medical and hospital costs incurred in Australia by sponsored persons and their dependents. The sponsor may do this directly, or through medical insurance arrangements.
