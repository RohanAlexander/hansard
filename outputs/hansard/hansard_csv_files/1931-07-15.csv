That recommendation was accepted by the conference, and became part of the plan. The Chairman of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank was to documents take up the matter with the savings banks and the trading banks to decide how and when the reduction should be put into operation. Correspondence has been passing between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank, and conferences have taken place between the Commonwealth Bank and the associated banks, but the matter has not yet been determined, and the proposed reduction has not yet been put into operation by all the banks.

In the case of goods which are treated as stock for sale by retail, the tax is paid on the fair market value at the time of manufacture. It was estimated that the sales tax would be payable on a total sale value of about £240,000,000. A tax of 2 i per cent, on that for one year would have been £6,000,000, and it was estimated that a revenue of £5,000,000 would be obtained in the last ten months of the last financial year in which the tax was payable. taxable field proves to be about £160,000,000 on a twelve months basis.

These figures are rather significant as showing that, on the returns to the Taxation Department, more than 50 per cent, of the sales of goods handled by registered manufacturers and wholesalers, and others making returns, are goods that are exempt under the provisions of the existing law; but, in addition to these exempt goods, there are other sales which take place in the community, and do not figure in these returns at all. There is a great volume of primary products, export goods, and goods sold by manufacturers who are not registered persons. The grand total value of these is roughly estimated at over £400,000,000. Therefore, we really collect a tax on about £160,000,000 worth of taxable sales, whereas there are sales amounting to more than £600,000,000 on goods in Australia that are exempt. These figures must be kept in mind by honourable members when they are calculating the effects of the Sales Tax Acts, clusively by retail. and when advocating the enlargement of the exemption list. the estimate of £240,000,000 when the actual £160,000,000? the estimate was made last year, there were no certain data on which to work; the Commissioner of Taxation had the figures computed by the Commonwealth Statistician, and they were gathered from various sources of production. The disparity in the figures was proved to be due either to an over-estimate of the total sales, or an under-estimate of the value of the exemptions. The estimated revenue from sales tax for 1931-32 at the proposed new rate is £8,500,000. The sales of taxable and exempt goods represent, speaking generally, the total wholesale trade of the Commonwealth, together with retail sales by manufacturers of goods, other than exempt primary produce and the export trade. The operation of the sales tax is controlled very largely by means of the quotation of certifiThe actual cates of registration. All manufacturers and wholesale merchants are required to be registered. These persons are the taxpayers under the act in respect of goods sold in Australia. The tax is payable on the sale price of the goods. Accordingly, when a manufacturer obtains raw material to be fabricated into finished goods, or a wholesale merchant purchases or imports goods for resale, the act entitles him to obtain those materials without any charge for sales tax. The manufacturer or wholesaler is accordingly required by the sales tax regulations to quote his certificate when importing or purchasing the goods mentioned. That importation or purchase is not subject to sales tax. Registered persons, that is, registered manufacturers or wholesale merchants, are forbidden to quote their certificates when they are importing or purchasing goods which are not for resale, either in the condition in which they are obtained, or after having been fabricated into other goods. The scheme of quotation of certificates has been used as far as possible to place wholesale merchants, whose principal sales are by retail, upon the same basis as regards their retail sales as a person who sells exThe exclusively retail merchant is not taxed on his sales. Therefore, when he imports goods, or purchases them locally, the importation or purchase is subject to tax. The retailer, being the importer, taxable field amounts to pays the tax at the Customs, while the-",17,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

66,Mr Theodore,"A t the time whenvendor to the retailer is the taxpayer who, probably, passes on the tax to the retailer. The whole scheme of quotation and non-quotation of registration is described in detail in the sales tax regulayear as an amendment to the Sales Tax tions. It may be added that this method of regulating the operation of the sales tax was introduced by the Canadian legislature, and was copied into the Commonwealth sales tux acts. At first the requirements regarding the vision will be one in which the amount of quotation of certificates gave rise to some litttle inconvenience to traders, but it is thought that the arrangements made by the department to meet commercial difficulties are now working smoothly. Considerable trouble was experienced, and discontent manifested, by traders regarding the necessity for them to pay sales tax on sales of stocks on hand on the 1st August, 1930. Honourable members of this House have been bombarded with correspondence and telegrams asking that such goods be exempted, because they were manufactured before the 1st August, the tax to be payable only on goods which were acquired after that date. This claim is based on the fact that retailers were not taxed on sales of stock which they had on hand on the 1st August, 1930. The claim could not be conceded without reducing the yield of the t:ix by approximately one-half. Thebasic principle of the law is to tax goods imported into Australia, on and after the 1st August, 1930, and goods sold in Australia on and after the 1st August, 1930, irrespective of the date when they were produced or acquired. The same objection is being raised now that the rate of sales tax has been increased to 6 per cent. The traders concerned claim that the higher rate should not apply to their stocks on hand on the 11th July, 1931. It is not possible to allow this claim without incurring such a heavy loss of revenue' that it would be necessary to increase the rate of tax very greatly above 6 per cent. The Government proposes to incorporate in the Sales Tax Assessment Act a provision analagous to that expressed in section 152 of the Customs Act to permit of any alteration in the rate of sales tax being adjusted as between a vendor and purchaser as may be required, so that the vendor may recover Mr Theodore, from the purchaser any increase in tax, or the purchaser may obtain relief on account of any reduction in the rate. Act. amendment was moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and was, after consideration, rejected. Associated with this prosales tax payable by a vendor in respect of any goods shall be shown as a separate item on the invoice for the goods. That proposal was also included in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition last year, and experience has shown that it would be well to give it a trial. mandatory ? a doubt as to the validity of the proposal. The matter has been gone into fully by the Crown Law authorities, and the Commissioner has advised that the requirement is not likely to be challenged, or if challenged, not likely to be disallowed. It is, therefore, proposed to incorporate the provision in these measures. The proposal does not give complete satisfaction. There are a great many objections to it, particularly on the part of the retail traders. Only last week a deputation representing the Retailers Association waited upon me in Sydney to protest against the alteration. The provision will require a taxpayer, who now must pay sales tax at the rate of 6 per cent., to invoice the amount of the tax separately to the purchaser. Many traders have complained of the absence from the law of such provision, and have pointed out that the effect upon prices has been very undesirable in many instances, while in others it has led to cut throat competition through the absorption of the tax Jby those financially strong traders who have been able to carry the burden of the tax, to the serious financial embarrassment of their weaker competitors. The matter of charging the tax as a separate item on the invoice was brought up for discussion at the recent Premiers Conference in Melbourne, and the Prime Minister, in response.to a request of the",18,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

We have since arranged to amend the act in the direction required. to that effect last year. amendment was considered and rejected, but experience has since proved the wisdom of reconsidering the matter. Of course the matter is still open to discussion, and no doubt some will be against it, and some in favour of it, when we deal with it in committee. that the amount of tax shall be entered on the invoice? present proposal it will be. The committee, however, will determine whether or not that proposal is retained. Those who favour the alteration appear to groups. Pirst, there are the manufacturers and wholesalers, who aim at being entirely relieved of _ the burden of thetax; secondly, there are the vendors, whose practice-perhap s necessarily owing to the exigencies of their business, or the manner in which their businesses' are conducted-is to fix their prices without any reference to sales tax, and who find themselves unable to collect the tax from purchasers when it is added to the agreed prices; and thirdly, purchasers who have reason to believe that where sales tax is undisclosed, more ' than the statutory percentage is added. It was ostensibly to prevent victimization of the last mentioned class that the Queensland Government, by proclamation under the Profiteering Prevention Act 1920, made it compulsory for every manufacturer and wholesaler selling goods to which the act applies, and which are subject to federal sales tax, to show the sales tax as a separate item at the foot of each invoice, such separate item to be included in the total amount of such invoice. When the proposal was mooted last year, representative retailers very strongly opposed it, on the ground that, although the whole of the tax would inevitably be passed on to the retailers, it would not be possible for them to pass on a large proportion of the tax to the public, because the prices of a large provernment in settling the details of this portion of the goods sold by them were below a price at which it was practicable to add the statutory percentage of the sales tax. This was one of the points I moved an amendment stressed by the deputation which waited unon me in Sydney last week. It was pointed out that many proprietary lines, such as bars of chocolate, &c, were sold at a penny each, and that it would be impracticable to add a ^fraction of a. penny to the price to cover sales tax. The situation could be met only by the manufacturers altering the wholesale price, . by reducing the amount of chocolate, or altering its quality. That objection applies to a great many articles handled by large and small retailers, articles of small value sold at from i d . to 6d. In many instances the price of these articles is fixed by the manufacturer. They are proprietarylines, on which a fixed price may be chargeable, and the public who have bebe divisible into three main cou.12 accustomed to paying that price would refuse to pay a higher price. That is one of the practical difficulties which we encountered in making this change. whom we consulted are in favour of it . I do not wish to overlook any difficulties in the way of administering this tax. power to sue for the tax as well as for the price of goods? is being incorporated in the bill, and is associated with the proposal to mention the sales tax on the invoice. Another objection raised by the retailers is that in very many instances they were able to obtain goods from the manufacturers only on condition that they sold at prices fixed by the manufacturer-in many cases before the inception of the sales tax. A still further objection is that large quantities of materials, wrapping papers, string and the like, had to be purchased although they were not. re-sold to the public. In all these matters I have informed the representatives of the Retail Traders' Association, whom I met on Monday, that any agreement that they could come to with the manufacturers and the wholesalers as to what practice should be adopted, would be a guide to the Go-",19,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

If there could be agreement among the principal retail associations of Australia, and the organizations of manufacturers and wholesalers, we could accept that settlement as being satisfactory to everybody concerned. I do not know whether it is possible to obtain such an agreement. quarters it is suggested that a compromise should be arrived at, making it optional to the wholesaler and manufacturer to state on the invoice the amount chargeable as sales tax. I should like an intelligent discussion to take place on this subject when the bill is in committee, so that the Government may have some guide as to what practice to adopt. This is not a question of embodying in this legislation a party principle or any set government policy. We are to some extent groping in the dark, and we shall be guided by the best advice obtainable on this subject. This morning I received from the chairman of the Wholesale Softgoods Association, a telegram, which is typical of the communications that we have received from a number of wholesalers and manufacturers. It readsAmendment of sales tax immediately hy coma department of that Government, and are pulsory clause adding sales tax separately all not for re-sale or distribution by any person, invoices recommended unanimously by all soft goods wholesalers as being best method, and if adopted now will end all controversy. This method already working satisfactorily two States. Any other method will increase depression in our trade and bring about further closing down and unemployment. Retailers are anticipating trouble. That will not arise when method fully explained. The Wholesale Softgoods Association is apparently quite optimistic about the smooth working of the new principle, and if its belief is correct we need not anticipate much trouble in this direction. I come now to the exemptions from the sales tax. The exemptions which were announced in the budget speech w ill be incorporated in the schedule of exemptions in the relevant Sales Tax Assessment Acts by means of bills to amend those acts in this and other respects. I shall refer to these exemptions so that in the general discussion some attention may be given to them. The Government has, of course, received many requests for exemptions, from honourable members, from various associations and industries, and. fro m other quarters. Consideration Mr Theodore. w ill be given to those representations, but I warn honourable members that, in some instances, it is not possible to grant exemptions which they think should merit the sympathetic consideration of the Government, because, if we granted all the exemptions asked for, we would not I know that in some obtain the revenue that we expect to collect by means of a levy of 6 per cent, on all taxable sales. The additional exemptions mentioned in the budget speech are as follow:Australian timber used in mines in similar manner to imported Oregon, used for mines; value not shown. Chaff bags, imported; valued at £205,637. Charcoal, coke, firewood, for all purposes; value not shown. Kerosene for all purposes; valued at £900,000. Crude oil and fuel oils for use in the production of power. Crude tar, when purchased for use as a fuel by a registered manufacturer, or applied by a manufacturer thereof as a fuel used in the manufacture of goods for sale. Fauna for public zoos. Goods imported into and goods purchased in Australia by a government of the Commonwealth or a State, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the goods are for the official use of organization, association or other' body, which is not completely controlled, or the expenditure of which is not completely borne by that government. Estimated sales to State departments, £13,200,000; tax, £792,000. I might explain that the goods referred to in this item are, specifically, goods to be used by a State or a department of a State, and are not goods purchased on , government account for use of semi governmental institutions, such as fire brigades, ambulance associations and other bodies of that kind. ties? exemptions in respect of municipalities. The exemptions under this item are strictly limited, because if that were not so, we should take out of this taxable field an enormous quantity of saleablegoods that are in use by charitable institutions, such as hospitals, and would, therefore, make a tremendous inroad upon our revenue. Other exemptions areMetal, gravel and sand for road-making, produced or purchased by a local governing body ; value, £93,000; tax, £5,580.",20,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

Stud livestock imported into Australia; value, £37,727; tax, £2,263. Works of art for free and continuous public exhibition. In addition to the commodities mentioned in the budget the Government decided some time ago to exempt bibles, and also imports from Norfolk Island to the valuev of about £13,000 a year. The total sale value of the articles I have mentioned is £14,438,778, on which the tax would amount to £886,326, but the actual amount exempted is a great deal more, because regarding many of the items we have no statistical information. We ask Parliament to validate also, the exemptions tentatively allowed by regulation to certain goods to which exemption is already allowed under the Customs Act. They includeArticles imported by, or purchased in bond for the official use of, the Governor General or a State Governor, and declared as being for such use. Articles imported for official use by representatives of governments of countries and consuls representing other than British countries, provided that the consuls are citizens of the country they represent, and are not engaged in any other trade or profession. Articles and personal effects owned and imported by members of the consular or diplomatic services, or trade commissioners and their staffs, who are nationals of the countries they represent, and who are not, and will not be, engaged in any other business, occupation, or profession during their residence in Autralia, provided such goods are imported within six months of the arrival of the officials concerned or within such further time as the Minister for Trade and Customs may allow. Australian products exported and then reimported subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.

Goods, second hand, owned by residents in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea sent to Che Commonwealth for repair and immediate return to such territories. road-making Trophies won abroad as prescribed by customs by-laws. We propose to add Australian wines to the list of exemptions. In the original scheme of sales taxation we exempted certain goods which were subject to special duties of customs or excise. For instance, beer was exempted, because it pays an excise revenue duty; wine also pays excise, and because of that impost may reasonably be excluded from the operation of the sales tax. This exemption means surrendering about £75,000 worth of revenue. and jams? member and others, have made representations to me in -favour of the exemption of canned f r u it s and jams, but if we extend the list to include goods of that kind heavy inroads upon the sales tax revenue w ill occur. cheap j a m than cheap wine. that I should be called upon to engage in a controversy on that subject. The consideration which has weighed with the Government is that wine is already subject to a special impost by way of excise duty; canned fruit s and jams are not, and if we placed them upon the list of exemptions, we would take out of the taxable field an enormous volume of goods. Canned fruits, for instance, represent a value of about £1,500,000. the Government would exempt basic foodstuffs; to-day the great majority of people are living on bread and jam, which are basic foodstuffs. has been given to the representations of the honourable member and other honourable members. It is extremely difficult for a Treasurer to determine what commodities should be taxable, and what should be exempt. I have endeavoured to adhere to the basic principles which I have defined. Those principles were the basis of the original legislation, and we are extending the application of them now.

Moreover, this procedure does not seem so necessary for the protection of the revenue in connection with a sales tax, as it is in respect of a customs tariff. As a matter of fact, the trading community has known for many weeks that the sales tax would be increased, but there is not that opportunity to evade the tax that is presented by the removal of large quantities' of goods from bond prior to the operation of an increased duty. Honourable members and the public would have welcomed some indication from the Treasurer of the cost which this tax imposes upon the community, not only directly, but also in connection with administration. What is the collection of the tax costing? How many more officers Lave had to be employed, and can any estimate be made of the additional work and burden imposed upon the trading community by the necessity for complying with the requirements of the act. in respect of millions of transactions? I should think that the sales tax would be a particularly expensive one to collect as compared with, other taxes. answered a question to the effect that the actual cost per cent, of the collection of sales tax is less than that for collecting income tax. that. It certainly is a surprise to me. I had hoped that, the Government would examine the possibilities of getting at least some of the additional revenue that is needed by reducing customs duties, instead of by increasing the sales tax. We must all recognize that the effect of increasing the sales tax will inevitably be to increase prices, put up the cost of living and, so long as wages are determined in accordance with the cost of living, put up wages without any benefit to the wage-earner. It is time that a caref ul inquiry was made into the possibility of increasing revenue by decreasing customs duty, without injuring any person I have already in Australia. The Treasurer intimated that the Government is now prepared to adopt thp proposal that I made last year, requiring the sales tax to be shown on the invoice, and entitling the purchaser to recover it from the person to whom he sells. 1 think that that is a very wise step. 3 am aware, as the Treasurer says, thai there are differences of opinion in relation to it, as there are also differences of interest. I know one very important branch of trade and commerce in this community in which the 2-J per cent, sales tax has reached 6 per cent, in practice by the time the ultimate purchaser has paid for the goods. That is because the sales tax is hidden away in the price. I hope that the Government will adhere to its announced intention to require the sales tax to be shown on the invoice. Trade is already proceeding on those lines in the case of some branches of commerce, and it can proceed perfectly well on similar lines in all branches. I had hoped that there would be some indication that the Government Was prepared to give consideration to the position of retailer-manufacturers in so far as stock in 'their retail warehouses on the 1st. of August of last year is concerned. This is a fair statement of the position. You have two competitive retail establishments alongside each other, selling similar goods. One man is noi a manufacturer. On the 1st of August last he had his warehouse f u l l of goods, which he has been selling ever since, without their being subjected to the sales tax, because they are sold only in a retail way. The other man is also a retailer, I was unaware of with a similar store and the same type of .goods, but in addition he is a manufacturer, and because of that he has to pay sales tax on his goods. T-hat does not appear to be fair. I quite agree that the retailer-manufacturer should not be exempt in relation to all of the stock in his warehouse as well as that in his shop.",23,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

97,Mr Latham,"but as between the two competitors it is very unfair that one lot of goods should be entirely exempt from sales tax, which is charged on the other lot of goods because the seller is a manufacturer as well as' a retailer. crops up in the case where a retailer had his shelves fully stocked when the tax came into operation, and his competitor had his shelves practically empty at the time. a new tax is introduced, it is quite impossible to ohtain absolute justice. One can only aim at practical justice in these matters, and I suggest that the case that I have put is of such a character that it would be proper to make special provision for it. I desire to direct attention to another case, that of a tailor who makes a suit to order and delivers it to a customer. Under the present law the transaction is subject to sales tax, though the customer buys the suit at a retail price. Speaking generally, this legislation charges sales tax only upon wholesale prices, but the tailor making to order in the way I have described is at a severe disadvantage as compared with the large manufacturing house which sells ready-made clothes. The additional charge is a serious matter to suburban and country tailors, in particular. Section 20 of the principal act provides for exemptions of goodssold exclusively by retail by a person (not being a person who manufactures articles for human wear), whose principal business consists of the manufacture of goods to the order of individual customers. Por some reason, which for the moment I am unable to recall, tailors and others who make to order clothing for human wear have been excepted from the general exemption, while all other persons who make goods to the order of individual customers are exempted from the tax. As the imposition is pressing hardly on some of these craftsmen, I take this opportunity of suggesting that the Government should give consideration to the matter. Some consideration might also be given to photographers, who are charged on the full retail price. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Progress reported. BILL 1931. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): [3.54] I move That it'is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for invalid and old-age pensions. The purpose of the bill is to provide a sum of £10,000,000 from the Consolidated Revenue fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. Similar appropriations are made from time to time, and transfers are made under the authority of the appropriation act to the trust account from which pensions are paid. From the inception of the payment of invalid and old-age pensions in 1909 to the 30th June last, the amount expended for this purpose is £120,798,000. The amount now asked for, together with the balance of appropriation at 30th June, will suffice approximately for the requirements of the present financial year. The bill has no bearing on the rates of pension payable, nor on the provisions of the Financial Emergency Bill now before Parliament, being merely an appropriation of revenue to cover payments of pensions at authorized rates. The amount of the old appropriation is almost exhausted, and it is conjectural whether there is sufficient authority, under the present appropriation, to meet the requirements of the next pension pay-day. This is the normal motion to make provision for funds for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, substantially for the whole of the coming year. I do not think that any member of the committee has any objection to raise to the bill. If this were a proposal to provide the Government with Supply for the whole of the coming year there",24,Sales Tax Bill No 1 1931

There should not be any insuperable obstacle to making provision for the identification of the bonds which are not converted. I can quite understand the desirability of obtaining an original record of the securities in respect of which dissent is notified; but that is provided for in the bill. Why is it necessary to oblige dissenting holders to accept in place of their bonds securities committee (Consideration of which would not be so easily marketable a3 the bonds ? There is, we all know, ground for suspecting that a good deal of evasion of Commonwealth taxation occurs in con* nexion with bearer bonds, for they are transferable from hand to hand; but is it desirable that securities shall be deprived of this attribute of easy negotiation? Because the bonds possess this quality they are slightly more valuable on the market than inscribed stock. I take it that it is not proposed that no bonds shall he issued in the future. I am prepared to approve of a provision which will interfere with the negotiability of the bonds, even though I suspect that bonds are used for the purpose of evading taxation. I should like the Treasurer to advance some reasons why dissenting to convert their holdings permanently into inscribed stock. If the difficulty is chiefly one of identification, it should be possible to overcome it. As I have said, because of their easy negotiability, bonds are worth slightly more on the market than inscribed stock. Surely provision could be made to identify bonds that are not converted.

' to provide Parliament with facilities to deal with unconverted stock if that course shares in mining companies or business should become necessary. I think honourable members will agree that holders of bonds who do not convert should be required to bear their fair share of the general sacrifice; but unless there is some way of identifying the bonds it will not be possible to impose any sacrifice in respect of them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has suggested that there may be some other way of accomplishing the object of the amendment, such as stamping the bonds in some way. ing them. tered they would become, for all practical purposes, inscribed stock, for they would bear the name of the real owner and a record would be kept of their ownership. If a considerable proportion of the bearer ten bearer bonds of £100 each, use two of bonds are not converted, Parliament will be called upon to consider what action should be taken to insure that the proper proportion of sacrifice shall be required from the owners of them. I hope that something tangible will be done to prevent the indiscriminate exchange of bonds and coupons. present an owner of bearer bonds can get a boy to take the coupons to a bank and collect the interest due in respect of them. A great deal of more or less unfair dealing is indulged in by means of the bonds. Some time ago I brought under the notice of the Government, the case of a recently deceased money lender who was strongly suspected of having had. practically all his money in the form of bearer bonds. We all know that it is essential to the successful conduct of a money-lending business that the proprietor shall be able, at any time, to put his hand on a considerable amount of ready cash. After this man died, I was requested by a distant relative of his to have a copy of his will made. The pni son who asked me to do this was astounded at the small amount of money in the estate. I asked the Government of the day to look into the matter, but 1 was told that there were very many difficulties in following it up. Provision should be made to prevent the transfer of bearer bonds, except by endorsement. They should be treated, to a large extent, like enterprises. We all know very well how banking companies deal with deposits. There must be a legal order for the transfer of amounts from one account to another. The transfer of bearer bonds should be permissible only by a properlywitnessed endorsement. I trust thai the Government will make a permanent, and not a temporary, arrangement of this kind. If it does so it will eliminate many unfair and unjust business transactions by means of bearer bonds. If this amendment is agreed to, I am afraid that difficulties may be created in connection with the acceptance of securities in payment of estate duties. At present the executor of a deceased estate may take, say, a £1,000 bearer bond to the Commonwealth Bank, exchange it for the bonds to pay the estate duties, and return the other eight bonds to the estate. If all the unconverted bearer bonds iu an estate must be exchanged for inscribed stock, it will be very difficult to do that kind of thing. only to those who do not convert. convert will still have the right under clause 24 to apply unconverted securities to the payment of probate duties. When new stock is issued, the subscriber may still exercise the old option of either ^ transferring inscribed stock to bonds or putting bonds into inscribed stock. A person who has inscribed stock for a larger amount than he may be required to pay in estate duties, and who takes new inscribed stock, is not even to be given new securities, according to the clause proposed in another place. these difficulties by converting. the conversion compulsory at the outset? prevent a person who has inscribed stock from splitting up his holdings.",26,Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill

If inscribed stock can be split up in the same way as bonds, as the Treasurer has assured us, the taxpayer should be adequately protected in that matter. I was glad to hear the Treasurer say that he proposes to protect the revenue against those who hold considerable amounts in bonds and pay no income tax with respect to them. There is something radically wrong, if the Commonwealth is losing, on this account, interest conversion. I know persons who allowed in regard to £15,000,000. This shows that our system of incometaxation penalizes the honest man, and allows the dishonest person to escape. ""When the bill was previously before the committee, I remarked that some steps should be taken to register the names of the holders of bonds, and to make it compulsory for changes of ownership to be notified to the department. That would prevent this escape from taxation. I point out that proposed new sub-clause 6 provides that inscribed stock for which existing securities are exchanged shall not These investors will now find, not only be deemed to be new securities within the meaning of the act. securities under the act, because the bolders will not have converted.

Perhaps nine-tenths of the internal loans,, which amount to £556,000,000, will be converted. The fact of bondholders not dissenting within 21 days to conversion will automatically make a large number of bondholders convert through ignorance of the position. Why apply this amendment to only one-tenth of the bondholders ? contribution to the national revenue from the non-converters, we may have to do it by taxation, and that makes it necessary to-know who do not convert. Treasurer is trying to cope with what is undoubtedly .a scandalous position, in that a great number of the present bondholders pass their interest coupons over the counter, and pay no tax upon them. that is so; we do not know to what extent these persons escape taxation. penalize certain bondholders. I would rather the conversion were made compulsory. For necessary reasons, some bondholders will be forced to dissent from their bonds to be converted to the new loan in December last; but they have obligations falling due in January and February next, and it will be necessary for them to realize on some of their bonds in order to discharge existing contracts. Dragooning action such as is now proposed decreases the value of government securities. The Treasurer must know that inscribed stock is quoted on the Stock Exchange at nearly 2s. 6d. in the'£l less than bonds. This proposal, in my opinion, will do much harm to those who have paid the full face value of their bonds, and have not speculated in them. that their holdings have decreased in value, but also that they are called upon to submit to all sorts of inconvenience. should like to have some assurance from the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) that the Commonwealth does not propose to repeat what happened in New South Wales by breaking what has always been regarded as the confidential seal upon the register of inscribed stock.

There should be no doubt as to the confidential character of the register of inscribed stock. In view of what has occurred in New South Wales, there may be a suspicion of some sinister design on the part of the Government. just come from the Senate, the sinister idea must have originated there. inscribed stock than that which will form the subject of dissent by holders. It would be desirable for the Government to make a statement on the matter. In the absence of such a statement suspicions would arise which could, at this stage, be readily dispelled. There is another point which relates only to the manner of drafting. As the provision now reads, Commonwealth inscribed stock of the description mentioned shall not, except as prescribed, be exchanged for bonds or any other form of security. Of course it is intended that this provision shall refer only to Commonwealth Government bonds or Commonwealth securities. There are other bonds and other securities besides Commonwealth bonds and securities. I am sure that it is not. intended to produce any other result than to prevent the holder of inscribed stock from applying in the ordinary way to have it transferred into Commonwealth 'bonds or securities.

I suppose the Treasurer knows that the probate officers inquire into these matters now. done for special purposes, but the Government does not intend to disclose the names of persons holding bonds, nor their addresses, nor how much they hold. It may be necessary, however, when considering what action should be taken in regard to unconverted bonds, to possess certain information relating to the holders of such bonds. It may be necessary to prepare a classification showing the number of holders, the number holding less than a certain average amount of stock, and the number in each State. This may be required for general information purposes, but it is certainly not intended to make a parade of the names of persons holding this stock. It would be a most undesirable thing to disclose names in that way. A person's business is his own business, and if he has invested money in Government stock, if he has laid out his accumulated savings in this way, his name ought not to be published abroad as that of an undesirable citizen. He is entitled to privacy in regard to his business, just as is any other private person. I recognize that the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) will more clearly express the Government's intention, and I am prepared to accept it. There has been a great deal of talk about the privacy to which bondholders are entitled in respect of their .business transactions. In one breath we are told that these persons performed a patriotic act when they lent their money to the Government, while in the next we are assured that it would be a most undesirable thing to reveal their names. The bondholders should be glad to let the public know how their patriotism. There is always much talk about the sanctity of business secrets, but no such consideration is extended to the workers when they are dragged into Regarding the objection the Arbitration Court to give details of their income and manner of living. Even the girls are made to tell how much they pay for their underclothing.

The Government does not desire to discriminate unfairly between government savings banks and the private savings banks of Hobart and Launceston. It must be remembered that the ordinary government savings banks, such as those in Victoria and South Australia, hold securities which represent loans made to their governments at special concessional rates of interest. They are not comparable with the transactions between the private savings banks in Tasmania and the Tasmanian Government. It is true that they hold State and Commonwealth Government securities, but they took up those securities on the same terms as were offered to the public; the price was the same, the rate of interest was the same, and so was the date of maturity. There is no reason why these Tasmanian institutions should not be subject to the same interest reductions and maturity I movedates as apply to private bondholders, but there is a very definite reason why the government savings banks should obtain certain concessions.

143,Mr Theodore (Dalley,"Treasurer )depending on the exigencies of the situation, and the needs of the Commonwealth Treasury. I should have no very strong objection to the Senate's amendment if I thought that the matter would end here, but I know that once we grant these concessions, we shall receive applications for similar concessions in respect of scores of other institutions and bondholders. We must stand firmly for our conversion scheme as it now is, or it will break down. Arguments have been put up in favour of concessions to friendly societies and superannuation funds, as well as to small bondholders whose whole income is derived from interest on small parcels of Government securities. In order to make the conversion scheme a success we must ask these persons and institutions to convert their holdings, accept the 22$ per cent, cut in interest, and abide by the conditions relating to maturity dates. The only departure from that principle is in regard to very small holdings by an individual not exceeding £1,000. We give such persons the right to consolidate their holdings at the two or three earlier maturity dates. I urge honourable members not to press for the acceptance of this amendment. My objection does not arise from any failure to recognize that these Tasmanian savings banks are institutions of thrift doing the same work as the government savings banks, but from the fact that the securities they hold are of an entirely different nature from those held by the government savings banks. this clause was previously before the committee, I moved an amendment identical with that now made by the Senate, and the Treasurer refused to accept it, giving the same reasons as he has now advanced. According to the wording of the clause, the banks for savings in Tasmania will not receive the concession which is being given to the State savings banks, of their new securities maturing at the original date of existing securities. Surely this provision applies to all securities of a savings bank. securities. savings banks are to have a concession in regard to Commonwealth securities in addition to those which, as the Treasurer has mentioned, are given by State Governments for domestic purposes. monwealth bonds, the Commonwealth Treasurer would have to approve. one class of security held by the government savings banks is identical with that held by the banks for savings in Tasmania. If this concession is to be given to State savings banks in regard to their investment in Commonwealth loans, I contend that a similar concession should be given to the Tasmanian savings banks, which, the Treasurer himself has admitted, are conducted on similar lines to government savings banks, and do precisely the same class of work. If this ( clause is to apply to securities given by State Governments for the specific purpose of financing their activities, and not to investments in Commonwealth securities, that should be made clear. I ask the committee to support the Senate's amendment. port the remarks of the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell). I ask the Treasurer to allow the Senate's amendment to stand, and if he is not prepared to do that, to make some provision in the clause so as to relieve the banks for savings in Tasmania, which are likely to be placed in an awkward position as a result of this legislation. These two banks operate in exactly the same way as the Commonwealth and State savings banks. They have from time to time been of wonderf ul assistance to the Government of Tasmania. As banking institutions, they require at times certain liquid assets, and they so arrange their investments with the Government of Tasmania as to enable them to meet their liabilities. Time after time, these banks, when their loans are about to fall due for redemption, have stated how much ""they would alllow to remain on loan and how much would have to be paid off to enable them to meet their own commitments. If ' we included the Tasmanian savings banks in this provision, surely it would be a sufficient safeguard to stipulate that there must be agreement between the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Treasurer of Tasmania.

[5.3] -The Solicitor-General, in explanation of this amendment, saysThe reason for putting section 20 in thi# bill is that the freedom of new securities from increased income tax is an important condition of the conversion. But, because of the complicated provisions of the income tax law, and the graduated nature of the tax, this freedom from increased taxation is very difficult to express in wordsThe clause, as it stands, deals with a taxpayer's assessment for (say) the year, 1938; it looks at the interest on bonds which form* part of his income, and compares the amount of tax which would be payable in respect of that interest at the 1938 rate with the amount which would be payable in respect of that interest at the 1930 rate. And it reduces his taxation by the difference between the two amounts. But then the question arises, what is the exact amount of tax payable in respect of the interestT The act imposes taxation, not in respect of ' particular items of his income, but in respect of all his assessable income in two classes, income from property and income from personal exertion. He is not taxed on the whole of his income, but on his taxable income-that is, his income, less the deductions; and the problem is to apportion the deductions to the different items of income. It is not a matter of simple proportion, because some deductions are properly referable to a particular item of income; for instance, the depreciation of plant is referable to the earnings of the plant, and no portion of it ought to be referred, say, to bond interest. To take a simple illustration. Suppose, in 1938 the rate . applicable to the taxpayer's property income were 15 per cent., and the rate applicable to the same income in 1930 would be 10 per cent. Suppose also that his total property income were £1,000, derived wholly from interest on new securities. Suppose also that lie is entitled to deductions, from that property income, of £200 (for inturance, gifts to charities, & c ) . Now he is entitled to a rebate of 5 per cent, of the amount payable in respect of that interest. But he is not taxed on £1,000 interest, but only on £800; so that the rebate is not 5 per cent, of £1,000, but 5 per cent, of £800. If the taxpayer has different sources of income, the question of apportionment of the deductions comes in; and that question is so complicated that it is impossible to lay down a definite formula which will be just in all cases. Far the most satisfactory method is on the facts of each individual case. ThiB is what was done in section 23(2)6.

The Senate is seeking by this amendment to secure to itself the right to dominate the executive of government. The Executive derives its authority from the majority in this chamber, and in pursuance of that authority the Government made regulations relating to work on the waterfront. The Senate repeatedly disallowed those regulations. Some time ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) intimated that interesting developments might be expected from that conflict; is this amendment the first of them? I have never known such a restriction to be inserted in any other bill , and its acceptance by the Treasurer indicates very clearly the complaisant attitude of the Government.

Its action was a deliberate attempt to in vade and violate the rights of this Parliament, and the Senate, by its attitude very ably defended those rights. Honourable members would be recreant to their duty if they refused to avail themselves of the opportunity to register their protest against the action of the Government. The significance of the evil of government by regulation has been stressed by no less an authority than the Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Hewart, who has gone out of his way on various occasions to warn the people of the civilized world of the menace to government that resides in the prevailing practice of attempting to govern any country by a system of regulation for which Parliament is not responsible. back 300 years to the Stuart days and the Stuart ways.

The history of the last few months has demonstrated that the only way to do so is to ensure that in any future act passed by this Parliament the potentialities for evil that rest in Ministers of this Government, and which may easily reside in Ministers of any other government, are effectively circumscribed. It has been proved that regulations can be made in defiance of the legislature. It rests with the commpnsense and wisdom of this Parliament to see that that is preventeJ in the future. I say in all sincerity, there must be a return to government by Parliament. There must be a getting away from the system of government by cabinet, and, in particular, from goyernment by caucus. The amendment that has been inserted in this measure by tut Senate, and which, I am pleased to see, has been accepted by the Government with great goodwill, gives us the assurance that, temporarily at least, we have been brought back to government by Parliament.

It is provided that if the majority of the wheat-growers of Australia indicate by a ballot that they desire a compulsory wheat pool to be set up, steps shall be taken to give effect to their decision. Ballots have been taken on other occasions in various wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth, and in New South Wales, but on no occasion has the majority required by the statute voted in favour of the establishment of a wheat pool. The Government feels that, if a majority of the wheat growers desire control of their own business they should be enabled to do so. A ballot is being taken in New South Wales at present on this question. It is provided in the act that voting shall be compulsory, and that a simple majority shall determine the issue. wheat-growers in New South Wales may compel all others to submit to a compulsory wheat pool. them may prevent the others from establishing such a pool. surely not inequitable that .the majority of the wheat-growers who vote in this ballot shall determine the course to be taken. If farmers'are not sufficiently inments for local consumption, seed and terested to record their vote they should be quite prepared to agree to whatever the majority decides. South Wales is compulsory. the Opposition has agreed to the provision of the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill that bondholders who do not dissent shall be deemed to have consented to the conversion of their stock. BeforeI explain, briefly, the most important clauses of the bill, I may mention that there are approximately about 66,000 wheat-growers in the GommouI spoke wealth, and the great majority of them are members of voluntary pools. During the 1930-31 season, there was a record production of wheat, amounting to 212,628,700 bushels from an area of 18,312,420 acres. Of the total quantity produced, 15,030,000 bushels are estimated to have been used for seed, 31,000,000 bushels for local human consumption, and 4,800,000 bushels for stock feeding, &c, leaving an estimated exportable surplus of nearly 162,000,000 bushels. [Quorum formed.] The total quantity of wheat and flour manufactured from the wheat that has been exported from the beginning of the season to date is. approximately 115,000,000 bushels. Flour, in these figures, is expressed in terms of wheat. Of the wheat of the 1930-31 crop which has not yet been exported47,000,000 bushelsa percentage has already been sold, and is ready for shipto take complete ment. figures has normal allowance been made for local consumption ? is anticipated that the carry-over into next season will be, at the most, from 14,500,000 to 15,000,000 bushels. During the eleven months ended the 31st May. 1931, the quantity of wheat and flour exported from Australia was 125,041,639 bushels, valued at £16,304,867. Owing to seasonal conditions, it is most difficult to estimate what next season's crop will yield; but it is probable that 13,500,000. or at the most, 14,000,000 acres, will be sown to wheat and 150,000,000 bushels will be harvested. Deducting requirestock feed, amounting to, roughly. 15,000,000 bushels, it is estimated that there will be a surplus of about 150,000,000 bushels available for export in the coming season. These figures cover the position up to a fortnight ago, and are based on the most reliable data to hand.

185,Mr Parker Moloney,"Yes. JiI do not overlook the obviously' unfavorable factors which are operating with regard to the wheat position throughout the world. There is a big carry-over in the United States, of America and Canada, and the Russian wheat situation is difficult to sum up, because of the varynot be necessary to make that statement, ing reports regarding it ; but it would seem that the influence of Russian wheat on the world's market will be more formidable next year than, say, this year. Other factors, too, must be considered. News from Canada indicates that a greatly reduced crop will be garnered there as the result of a serious drought. It is unfortunate that the primary producers in any dominion should be placed at such a disadvantage, but a circumstance which is operating against Canada will help Australia. Italy has taken steps, by proclamation, to ensure that the millers shall use at least 95 per cent, of local wheat. That is unfortunate, so far as Australia is concerned, because Italy will not need to import wheat. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, however, it is considered that the price of wheat in the coming harvest will be greater than this year. It is proposed under the bill to create an Australian wheat board, composed of one government representative, and one representative from each of the State boards. In that respect the measure does not differ from that which I introduced last year. All the members of the board, except the one government representative, will be elected by the growers themselves. I emphasize that fact in contradiction of statements made to-day by those responsible for certain widespread propaganda, particularly in New South Wales, where, as I have said, a ballot of the farmers is being held. Such misrepresentation is always indulged in when the wheat-growers attempt to bind themselves together for their own preservation. It is stated, in circulars that are being distributed, that under this measure the wheat-growers are to be handed over to the Government. will be. honourable member does not believe that, but he is prepared to use that kind of misrepresentation. There will be only one government representative on the board. If five States enter the scheme, there will be five representatives of the growers and only one representative of the Government, who will have the voting power of one to five. It should but in order to meet the propaganda that is being resorted to, I ought to mention the -fact. representative have the right to veto? With the qualification that the Government will have one representative on the Commonwealth board, it will be entirely controlled by the wheat-growers themselves. There will be in no sense a government pool, and, therefore, the proposal conforms to that submitted by me last year. The federal board, of course, will have control over export and the interstate movements of wheat. It will be able to prevent the dumping of wheat from one State, which may be outside the pool, into another State that is in the organization, for the purpose of embarrassing the latter State. The State boardswill also have important functions to discharge. Acting in .unison with thefederal board, they will be able to fix the prices of wheat for local consumption.. This power would have been possible if the 1930 Wheat Marketing Bill had been agreed to. If the State boards had been able to fix the price for local consumption at 4s. a bushel, their action would not in any way have affected the price of bread. There is now in operation in New South Wales a Flour Acquisition Act, under which the price of wheat is fixed at approximately 4s. a bushel. When we compare that price of 4s. for New South Wales and Queensland with the price of Is. 9d., prevailing in Victoria and South Australia, it becomes evident that the price of wheat makes no material difference to the price of' bread, because bread sells at much the same price in all States. So much for the argument of those who say that we must not fix the price of wheat for home consumption because that would result in putting up the price of bread. That contention is not borne out by facts.",37,Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Accepted The Opinion Of Their Legal Ad Second Reading

189,Mr Parker Moloney,"No.this bill to fix the price of wheat. will not be the function of the federal board, but of the State boards, acting conjointly with the federal board. The State boards will be composed of representatives of the wheat-growers, with one government nominee, and such boards can be depended upon to fix a reasonable price for wheat, one which will not result in any material increase in the price of b»ead to consumers. Although there will be a government nominee on the State boards, the representatives of the wheat growers will be in control. The composition of the boards is set out in the bill and the schedule. If the Wheat Marketing Bill had been passed last year, it would have been possible to fix the price of that portion of last year's crop which was consumed in Australia at 4s. a bushel, which would have given the growers an oxtra 4$d. a bushel on all wheat produced. It is estimated that; taking into account the smaller quantity of wheat which will be produced this year, a local price of 4s. a bushel would give an extra 6d. a bushel to the growers for all the wheat grown. the overseas' price remains the same as mow. Honourable members will agree that that would constitute a very welcome addition to the wheat-growers' returns. worked out on the basis of 100,000,000 bushels for export, and 50,000,000 bushels for local consumption. local price would return an additional £3,600,000, which represents practically 6d. a bushel on the -whole crop. price will not be obtained for all the wheat consumed locally, hut only for that used in making .bread. has been taken into consideration. the growth of the crop will the price for home consumption be fixed? will be under the control of the State boards. come into this scheme? Australia and Victoria have already intimated that they are in agreement with the principles embodied in this bill, and will pass the necessary legislation. New South Wales is taking a ballot of wheat growers, and Queensland has a wheatpooling scheme already in operation. While we have not yet received a definite intimation from Western Australia, I am hopeful that that State will also agree to come in. majority of the wheat-growers in Western Australia are in favour of the scheme. my information also. Clause3 of the bill provides that the board shall have control over such products of wheat as are prescribed by regulation. To make the bill effective, and to protect the growers, it is necessary to have power to control the export of flour, and the interstate trade in flour. It will also, in certain circumstances, have control over the movements of bran and pollard. The board will be able to supply wheat to millers at world parity prices for their export flour trade, and to impose such conditions as will compel the millers to export the flour, and not place it on the local market. This latter provision will apply to States not in the pool. They will not be allowed to dump wheat from their State into another State which is a member of the pool, and the same restriction It is will apply to flour. That power will be exercised by the federal"" board. The increased State is to be controlled by the federal board as to its trade in wheat and flour? to prevent dumping. export ? able members must recognize that if a majority of the States oome into this scheme, it would be unfair to allow those States which remain outside to dump their wheat or flour into the States belonging to the pool, and prejudice the success of the whole scheme. Under this bill power is not given to this Parliament, or to the State Parliaments, to set up control boards. Such action will be taken only if the majority of wheat-growers declare",38,Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Accepted The Opinion Of Their Legal Ad Second Reading

It is left to the wheat-growers themselves, and this bill is to give statutory power to enforce what they decide is best for the industry. Power is to be given under the bill to the board to issue licences. A State which is not in the pool will have to apply for a licence before it can export wheat or flour to places beyond Australia, or to States which are members of the pool. The board itself will have power to issue licences in respect of wheat within the control of the States, but outside that the Minister, acting on the advice of the board, will issue licences. legislation to provide for an efficient been granted by legislation in respect of the Dried Fruits Export Control Board. so, and I have heard nothing but praise for what that board has done. If this power did not exist it would be impossible to exercise any control over the industry at all. As a matter of fact, individuals have endeavoured to break down the principle of control in respect of dried fruits, but, fortunately, we have been able to follow them up and punish them. Under clause 17 the federal board will be empowered to sell all wheat except that required for local consumption in the producing States, to control export, and to make agreements between the Federal and State wheat boards. Under clause 20 power is taken for the board to obtain any information necessary for the compilation of such statistics as the board may require. The schedule to the bill is in the form of an agreement between the Commonwealth and those States which desire to come into the pool. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. essential difference betwen this bill and its predecessor is that this measure makes no provision for a guarantee. The unfortunate state of our finances has made it impossible to secure the co-operation of the banks for the giving of a guarantee for this season's wheat. That fact seems to have been fully realized by the wheat-growers themselves, because at a recent conference held at Bathurst, which was largely attended, the primary point out in what way this bill differs producers unanimously carried a resolufrom the original Wheat Marketing Bill? tion endorsing the principle of a Commonwealth compulsory pool, and urging the Commonwealth Government to proceed with this measure even without the guarantee. In other words, the wheat growers want to have the power to institute an efficient system of marketing under the control of their own organization. This bill provides for that. The primary producers of New South Wales have, by means of the ballot, expressed themselves in favour of the pooling system. Since then resolutions have been passed by various bodies of wheat-growers in other States, urging the passage of power has scheme of marketing in order to stabilize the wheat industry, and to place it on a proper footing. This bill, if given effect,, will afford the sellers of wheat an opportunity to become as well organized as arethe buyers of wheat. There is no weakness in the organization of those who buy wheat, and as they have formed themselves into a solid phalanx in their own interests, surely the men who producewheat should have the right to organizefor their own protection. This bill, although it provides no guarantee, will confer many advantages upou the primary producers. The power which it will give to fix the price for home consumption will enable the farmers to obtain an additional 6d. a bushel on next season's crop. Through their own organization .they will be able to speak with one voice in regard to chartering, insurance, and everything else affecting the sale of their wheat. They will be able to avail themselves of the rural credits system inaugurated by the Commonwealth Bank, which institution, in the past, has advanced to voluntary pools 80 per cent, of the value of the crop. As voluntary advances, surely it is not too much to expect that even greater facilities will be given by the Rural Credits Branch of the Commonwealth Bank to a properly organized compulsory pool. These advantages will, to some extent, compensate the wheat-growers for the absence of a guarantee.",39,Wheat Marketin Gbill No 2 Accepted The Opinion Of Their Legal Ad Second Reading

Before long the people w ill realize what a fool's paradise they have been livin g in for some years. I have pointed out dozens of times that the bulk of the wealth of Australia comes :from the soil. The wool-grower, the wheat-grower, and the miner, produce the '.real wealth of Australia; yet ever since 1920 we have been building up the costs of primary production. Although our -exportable products have been selling at ""higher prices than ever before, Australia's :financial position to-day is almost tragic. All honourable members on this side of the -chamber approve of the rehabilitation plan evolved in the Melbourne conference, but we are justified in drawing attention to the fact that it is seriously in -complete; because of a marked omission from it , at least one section of the comm u n it y w ill not contribute anything to the general sacrifice. It should be apparent to everybody that the primary -industries are not so many sponges that -can be squeezed and squeezed and never become dry. A petition presented to Parliament eighteen months ago by the honourable member for Riveriha( Mr IKillen) called attention to the fact that the stranglehold of high costs was undermining the great basic industries. Through this policy Australia's economic position to-day is almost desperate, and what hope can the future hold unless we rectify the faults in our economic system? Does any honourable member believe that merely by building up secondary industries we shall restore the country to its old time prosperity? Under existing conditions the secondary industries are a drag on all others. I do not say that we should not endeavour to develop secondary production. Even the man on the land knows that all his sons and daughters w ill not remain with him, but w ill want to enter other occupations, and there is no reason why we should not build up secondary production on a sound [8.17] I basis. A little time ago I quoted the wages paid on the railways of the United States of America. Of course America has a f a r greater volume of trade than has The amendment was Australia; nevertheless it is a striking fact that the railways there can pay to ordinary workers an average daily wage of 35s., whereas the highest fixed wage paid in Australia is 130s. a week. member get those figures? H i g h Commissioner in the United States of America, sent me f u l l particulars of the wages paid there. The awards of the Arbitration Court, governmental interference in industry, and the cultivation of antagonism between employers and employees are preventing us from getting from our workers the same service as is given by the workers in America. That is the principal reason why our secondary industries have been such a failure, and are incapable of exporting economically. vice from the Australian Avorkman than is given by any other Avorkmani n the world. but for the influence of persons like the honourable member, Avho all his life has done nothing but t r y to arouse antagonism between employer and employee, thus destroying that sense of obligation of mutual service that should exist between them.

Another cause of Australia's present deplorable condition is excessive borrowing, but I resent the charge made repeatedly that the borrowing has been principally by the Commonwealth. In 1920 the public debt of the Commonwealth was £352,000,000; in 1930, it was £372,900,000, an increase of £20,900,000. The public debt of the States in 1920, was £425,900,000, and in 1930, it had risen to £301,700,000. Those facts should be impressed upon the public mind. Because we have borrowed too much we have a heavy annual interest bill to meet. am one of those who believe that when we borrow, either from our own people or overseas, we should honorably pay in ful l the interest and principal; but apparently, there is a group in this Parliament that believes that we should even now continue borrowing, and subsequently repudiate our debts. The honourable member for Gippsland last night referred to the need for sacrifice by all sections of the community. He contrasted the price level of 119 for prifreight Western Australian farmers have mary products as compared with 193 for manufactures. I have other figures which confirm the contention that the sacrifice required under the rehabilitation plan will not be spread equally over all sections of the community. On a basis of 100 for 1911, the prices levels in 1910 were-Wheat, 106; flour, 104; bread, 96; and wages, 83. The producer then was getting the advantage. But in 1929, the index figures wereWheat, 154; flour, 164; bread, 194; and wages, 206; whilst in January last, the figures were-Wheat, 71; flour, 84; bread, 143; and wages, 214. show the continuously increasing sacrifice that is being asked of the producer.

I warn the Government that it i'a making a tragic error in unduly interfering with industry. These heavy tariff imposts and 'other loads that are being placed on the primary producers of Australia represent one of the greatest mistakes ever made by politicians. No plan can succeed unless the producer is relieved of his burdens. deplore that the Government finds it necessary to make a reduction in defence expenditure to the extent of £811,590. I realize that it is a difficult matter to defend defence. That department is one to which the Government naturally looks when it seeks to effect economies in times of peace. That is the kind of folly that characterizes the man who, because he is not very financial, tears up his insurance policy. The Government is making the defence of Australia dangerously inadequate. I realize that a considerable portion of that £S11,590 represents reductions in pay throughout the Service. If the Government really wishes to make a saving in the Defence Department, let it consider the formation of an ordnance corps that will take over all the clerical work of the department. would enable the services to operate efficiently, even on the reduced scale, and make Public Service, as they are at present. It appears that, under present conditions, the strength of the services depends on the size of the Public Service. It was a mistake to have made the Public Service a portion of the Defence Force, because, in the event of war, the clerical employees could not take the field with the army. In making these cuts in"" our defence expenditure, we take it for granted that the British Navy can at all times defend us. It must be evident that, even though we might put up a good defence, we could not repulse any nation that regarded Australia covetously, our defence is so inadequate. We have only two cruisers and an aeroplane carrier left. The one torpedo boat we had is now being laid up, and replaced by a smaller one that is called being reconditioned, on the assumption eminent American who sponsored it, and we that it w ill cost less to maintain. That leads me to the point that the war Government intends to send a Minister have given practical proof of our earnestness to Geneva next February, to a disarma-in this regard. ment conference. I base that statement on a reply which the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) gave to a question asked by me. We have sent a number of Ministers overseas, on various' missions. In many cases the money was well spent, as those concerned' .profited by having their vision broadened and their educaI tion improved. But a great deal of the expenditure was a waste of the taxpayers' money. Some Ministers toured about Europe, including It a l y and Ireland, and incurred substantial expenditure that might better have been distributed in Australia. The Government now contemplates spending additional money to send an expert from among the Ministry to voice to the representatives of the nations of the world Australia's ideas on disarmament. I have here a copy of the speech that was delivered by the Attorney General( Mr Brennan) at the Eleventh Assembly of the League of Nations, re-' garding disarmament. The honourable member statedAustralia tells the world, as a gesture of peace, that she is not prepared for war. Australia has, however, a policy of defence and That a spirit for defence. The policy is entirely consistent with the objects of the League And this is what we depend upon, accordthem independent of the ing to the Attorney-GeneralThe spirit is foundedon moral considerations of equity and good conscience.

We all abhor war, and hope never to see another, but one must face possibilities. Certainly a defence ""founded on moral considerations of equity and; good conscience"" would not carry us far.

I wish to refer to one other matter confacture of metals at the Munitions has been manufacturing sheet, brass and selling it to the trading comselling agency for its entire output to The trading community enterprise has to meet. Consequently, its Dear Sir -Referring to the interview byAnderson, Warburton, and the writer, bring under your notice a very unsatisfactory position which merchants who distribute sheets, and whose signatures are was received that they would require specification of their requirements before for the various sizes, gauges, and finish, is operative. This firm also experienced. considerable delay in the execution of an order, which was placed with them some time ago. The signatories to this letter are all taxpayers, who strongly protest against the monopoly which is being given to one firm for the distribution of the output of the Maribyrnong works, and strongly urge that all merchant distributors to the trade should be placed on an equal footing. These firms perform a service to the community by supplying from stock, which they require to carry, materials to manufacturers who, in many cases require to be supplied on credit terms. The quantities of these orders vary considerably from single sheets to larger quantities. In the conduct of our trade we have demand for wider sheets than those which can be supplied from Maribyrnong, the l i m it of which we are informed, is two feet, as per copy of letter attached. It seems to us to be unjustifiable from a protectionist standpoint that these wider sheets, which arc used for special work, should be dutiable at the same rates when they cannot be produced locally. We claim that these goods should be admitted free of duty. We would take this opportunity of referring to the reply given to your inquiry No. 4 "" that the employees were working f u l l time on the manufacture of these sheets for departmental and commercial purposes "". We are not in a position to know how many men are employed in this special industry, but the demand throughout Australia at the present time, both commercially and for departmental requirements, is very low, and f u l l time employment in this one special industry is exceptional. Could you obtain from the Minister the prices a t which these sheets are being sold? The letter is signed by Currie and Richards Proprietary Danks and Son Proprietary Briscoe and Company Limited, Thomas Warburton Proprietary Limited, and George ""White and Company. I should mention that the members of the last-named firm are not related to me in any ""way, and have no connection with the firm with which I am associated. Seeing that the Government desires to reduce expenditure, I suggest that it should discontinue paying an unnecessary selling commission to the firm which at present holds the agency for the sheet brass'manufactured at Maribyrnong. There is no reason why it should pay 2^ per cent, on this output, for it is in a position to sell for spot cash at the place of manufacture. ment intends to adhere to the policy of appointing selling agencies, I suggest that it should follow it through all its departments, and appoint a distributor for the .output of the Small Arms Factory, the Mr White. Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and other enterprises. But I urge the Minister to review the action which the Government has taken in connection with the Munitions iSupply Branch, and make it possible for any firm to buy the output from Maribyrnong without paying the commission. I wish now to make some comment upon the sales tax proposals of the Government. When this form of taxation was first introduced last year it was strongly opposed by most of the member* 'of the Opposition, and the supporters of the Government, and even Ministers, admitted that they, were not happy about it. In my opinion, this is the most irritating tax that has been inflicted on the comtmercial world. It is also the most crudely applied piece of legislation on our statute-book. When the original sales'tax measures were brought down, I expressed my opinions upon them with some force. In the course of my speech I read a telegram from the Hardware Association of Victoria in which it was stated that if the Government would examine the balance sheets of the various firms engaged in the hardware trade, it would see that practically all of them' were trading at a loss, and that the imposition of the sales tax of 2£ per cent, would add to their Limited, John liabilities. The statements in that letter Limited, apply with even greater force to-day. What were then to some extent matters of conjecture are now demonstrated facts. If the Treasurer would even now examine the balance-sheets of the firms engaged in 'the hardware business, he would find that many of them are operating at a dead loss, and are only able to carry on with the aid of their reserve funds. Of course, many firms unfortunate enough not to have had reserves have gone out of existence in the last twelve months, and bankruptcies and unemployment will now further increase. In spite of these facts it is proposed to increase the sales tax from 2£ per cent. t» 6 per cent., an increase of 140 per cent. Honourable members opposite set up indigIf the Governnant protests whenever it is suggested that wages must be reduced by even a small percentage. They rarely miss an opportunity to make some reference to the fact that the Arbitration Court recently reduced wages 10 per cent. But what of the proposed increase of 140 per cent, in the sales tax on the commercial community, and the proposal to increase the primage duty from 4 per cent, to 10 per cent., an increase of 150 per cent? The trading community is well aware that these are extremely difficult times, but surely the Treasurer must realize the futility of reducing wages on the one hand, and of increasing the cost of living on the other. monwealth and State Ministers was not unanimously in favour of the proposal to increase sales taxation and primage duty. A minority reported in opposition to this suggestion. ber is aware that the report of the econofair that our merchants should be called mists and experts recommended that this taxation should be increased, and the consuch a record for squandermania. ference made that report the basis of its decisions. Mr ""WHITE -That may be true, but two under-treasurers, at least, were strongly opposed to any increase in sales taxation and primage duty and signed a minority report to that effect. We all know that a point may be, reached when taxation increases become ineffective. The Government increased the rates of income tax last year, but did not receive the sum from this source that it expected, and the sales tax was well below the estimate. . It is very likely that the further cash slips, in order to prevent profiteerincrease in sales taxation will fail to achieve the desired end. The commercial community is quite prepared to do its part to rehabilitate the finances of the Commonwealth. I am thankful that the Government has agreed to simplify the sales taxation machinery to some extent. Certain proposals made with this object by the Opposition last year met with rather scant consideration. taxation legislation.displays a sorry lack of business senseI say that with due respect to the sales tax expert who was brought here from Canada, and to the officers of the Taxation Department. The original Sales Tax Bill provided that business houses must submit returns of all sales within seven days, although every one is aware that the usual business custom is to allow 30 days' margin. The Government was not willing last year to extend the time for the furnishing of the returns beyond 21 days. This meant that business houses had to pay their sales taxation before they were paid for the goods they sold. In this connection I direct the attention of the Treasurer to the following telegram from the president of the Victorian Hardware Association, which -reached me to-day:Chamber of Commerce, Victorian Hardware Association, and all merchants I have seen, entirely agree that extension should be for The conference of Comone month; present time much too short, and causes great inconvenience. Although many city merchants are carrying country storekeepers, they are obliged to pay sales taxation on goods in respect of which the country storekeepers are given at least a month's credit, and frequently more. It is not upon to finance a government which has the honourable member referring? In the circumstances, I trust that the Treasurer will accept the suggestion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the time for the furnishing of sales tax returns be extended to 30 days. I hope it will be. Another amendment put forward by the Opposition last year was that it should be compulsory to state the "" plusage"" at the foot of invoices and ing, and make it easy for the Government to police the sales tax. While the position remained obscure there was a good deal of evasion, because a dealer who bought from one firm and sold to another, and had. no registered office, might not have his books examined to see if he had paid the sales tax at all. As the Treasurer has also pointed out, some Our sales firms offer an incentive to buy by saying that their prices include the sales tax. If the amount of the tax is plainly stated on invoices and cash slips, and no longer hidden, the Government and the public can plainly see what sales tax is being paid, while there is simplification in accounting and collection by the Government. I am pleased to see that an amendment is now proposed which I moved last year, that any increase in the sales tax may be claimed from a client in the same way as an increase in a customs duty.",45,Budget 1931 32

I agree that this course might well have been followed six months sooner, for in that case we should I have received telegrams on now be nearer a complete recovery from our present difficulties. I am sure that none of us hac derived any pleasure from th<* cutting down of invalid, old-age and war pensions, and the reduction of the wages and salaries of public servants, but the action taken will prove to be in the interests of all sections. If nothing had been done, I believe that before many months had elapsed the reductions, instead of amounting to 20 per cent., would have reached 50 per cent., because the money required to meet the expenditure biased person must realize that, owing to the necessity for a reduction of the cost of production and the cost of living, the Government took the only possible course open to it. When these costs have been reduced, the workers and the pensioners will be as well, if not better, off than before, and many of the 300,000 or 400,000 men who are now looking for work will find employment. made by the Arbitration Court did not increase employment. quired, and I believe that the Government has done what is right. It is generally recognized that the position of Australia is most serious. A year ago, many misguided persons, including prominent political leaders, ventured the opinion that the depression was the result of a deep laid scheme on the but everybody now realizes that it was caused by the drop in the prices of our principal primary products, and the extravagant borrowing and spending policy of both governments and private individuals.

[Quorum formed.] Mr producing at a loss, and this cannot go Lang, the Premier of New South ""Wales, declared a year ago that there was no reai depression, but that the whole cause of the trouble was that the capitalists were trying to cut down wages. ' He appealed to the people, and promised them that if they returned him to power his government would borrow more money, and there would be no further trouble. ""We now have the spectacle of New South Wales, potentially the richest State in Australia, suffering more from unemployment and other distress than any other part of the Commonwealth. Mr Lang has been totally unable to bring about the prosperity that he promised the people of that State. I do not know whether he has gone mad, or whether he is playing into the hands of the communists by trying to bring about a state of affairs which will make New South Wales a fertile field for communist propaganda. I feel quite sure that one or other of those explanations of his conduct is the correct one. He is certainly going the . right way to-ruin New South Wales and Australia, and I am glad that this Government is pursuing a different policy, as demonstrated by this budget, and the hills it ^has introduced to give effect to the resolutions of the Premiers Conference. Besides these measures, however, other . steps are necessary to the complete rehabilitation of Australia. The tariff should be reduced by at least 22-J per cent, to bring it into line with the reducI t is impossible to have co-operation tion in wages, salaries and interest. Until that is done costs of living and production cannot come down sufficiently. We should, if possible, get back to the 1914 tariff, and certainly the tariff should not be higher than it was in 1922. Even that was, in my opinion, too high. The present tariff is penalizing the primary producers, who are the mainstay of.the country, as every one acknowledges. They produce 96 per cent, of Australia's exports, and represent 73 per cent, of the wealth of Australia. We all know the serious position in which they are now. After two years of drought, the wheat-growers and wool-growers, who produce most of Australia's wealth; are. confronted with a drop of approximately 55 per cent, in the price' of their products. They are now on. There can be no return to prosperity until something is done to enable the primary producers to carry on at a profit. The present tariff constitutes a serious handicap, and ought to be reduced. We have tried a high tariff for years, and it has resulted in more and more unemployment, and has made it increasingly difficult for the primary producers to make ends meet. Surely it is time that we reversed our policy, and reduced duties. It is also necessary to achieve a greater measure of co-operation between capital and labour, and it is impossible to do this until we abolish arbitration courts. We have tried compulsory arbitration here and in New Zealand. No other country will have anything to do with it. Most people admit that it has been a failure both here and in the sister dominion, where, instead of bringing about industrial peace and prosperity, it has had the opposite effect. It has had the effect of ranging the employers and employees' against each other in two opposing camps, making enemies of them. We should adopt the system followed in America and other progressive countries, and settle industrial disputes by conciliation at round-table conferences between the parties directly concerned. We have had more strikes and bitterness in Australia since the setting up of arbitration courts than ever we had before, and the sooner they are abolished the better. between capital and labour under a system of compulsion, and, until the parties in industry co-operate, we can never have peace in industry. industry under the old system.

There was a series of great strikes immediately following the war, but with the introduction of the conciliation system all difand his friends have got the basic wage ferences were reconciled, and industrial peace has reigned ever since. At that time they adopted in America the system of payment by results, and we shall have to do the same here. We cannot go on paying wages on a cost of living basis. We must have value for the wages paid. Much of the trouble in which Australia finds itself to-day is due to the fact that governments borrowed enormous sums of money, and spent it on works which can never pay anything like interest on their cost, because the labour employed was not paid according to results. America, and in other countries, the system of payment by results has proved a great boon, not only to industry and the country at large, but to the workers themselves. 11,000,000 persons out of work in the United States of America. ber's information is incorrect. I do not think there are more than 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 unemployed in the United States of America. It is inevitable that there should be some unemployment there, because America's customers overseas have not been able to go on buying from her owing to the world depression. The unemployment has not been caused by the system under which the United States of America has been working. Since the introduction of the system of payment by results in America, industry has enjoyed a period of great prosperity, and thrifty workers have invested money, many of them in the very industries that employ them, and the workers actually own 25 bunks. I am aware that honourable members opposite are always against this system, although I do not know why. It is, of course, a system which is of no use to loafers or .lazy workers, but it is certainly in the interest of industrious workers. That has been proved in Canada, the United States of America, and other countries in which it is in operation. It is time something was done to restrain those persons who are going about the country preaching class bitterness, industrial strife, and hatred of capitalists and employers. down to £3 a week; what more do they want \ reduce wages, but we wish men to earn the wages that they receive. A great deal of industrial trouble is due to misunderstanding. The great majority of workers are decent, well-meaning men, who want to give their employers a fair deal, and the majority of the employers wish to do the proper thing by their employees. If both sides were to send reasonable men as their representatives In to a conference to discuss such differences as arise from time to time, they would soon come to some satisfactory working arrangement. If a spirit of charitableness and sweet reasonableness were to prevail at such meetings, all difficulties could be easily overcome, and an era of yet there are peace and prosperity would be ushered in. This can never come about, however, while we have a system of compulsory arbitration, and while persons are going about stirring up bitterness and strife where there should be co-operation and friendliness. I have no desire to preach, but I feel very strongly that until this spirit of class hatred, which is so sedulously preached and so eagerly imbibed, is replaced by one of charitableness and toleration, no laws which this or any other Parliament may pass can do much to settle those differences between labour and capital which are continually disturbing industrial relation* to the serious loss of the whole community.

When I asked for that information the Prime Minister( Mr cost involved in preparing the information Scullin) claimed that the cost of obtaining it would be £300. That is a most inaccurate statement, and deserves a much stronger term than "".inaccurate"". Does the Prime Minister suggest that the departmental method of bookkeeping is so inefficient that it would cost £300 to ascertain from the dockets or the files the cost of motor hire, and of the use of government motor cars by Ministers? That is the kind of thing that the Prime Minister of this country has tried to put over me. When I asked to be allowed to examine the files so as to obtain for myself the information that I had asked for, the answer that I received was that I had not the ability to extract it from the files. not prepared to let the honourable member loose among official documents. more care of the files than would the honourable member, if they were placed in his charge, and if the question of honour is involved, let me say that I should be more likely to preserve silence in respect of the information contained in those files than would the Attorney-General himself. I have a suspicion that the honourable gentleman is one of the Ministers who have abused their privileges in connection with the use of motor cars, particularly in Melbourne, if the rumours that I have heard are accurate. The Government refused my request to be allowed to examine the files. I , therefore, take this opportunity to protest against its action in refusing to make available information that directly affects the members of the Ministry. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) recently asked twelve questions on one day. He asked thirteen questions on the next day, and another eleven questions within the next four days, making a total of 36 -questions.

Another rumour is that two Ministers, in particular, . repeatedly use government motor cars to attend race meetings in Melbourne on Saturday afternoons, and that the motor, cars, with drivers in charge, remain at the racecourse until the meeting is over. If that is correct, let me tell the Ministers concerned that the taxpayers of this country will not stand for that sort of thing. the Government to prevent me from obtaining information have roused my suspicions, because where there is smoke there is fire. a Minister who lives within 70 miles of motor car to travel to and from his home, although a frequent train service is at his disposal.

When the Prime plaint that arbitration imposes an unnecessary load on the employers. honourable member for Riverina is likely to be disappointed of his aspiration that one day Australia will revert to payment by results. That system will never be acceptable to Australians. The honourable member referred to the wages paid in the United States of America. I admit that at times high wages have been paid in that country for piece-work, but every student of the subject knows that the faster a few men work for high money the more unemployment they cause. To-day there are in Australia at least 100,000 men whose jobs are gone for ever. The honourable member for Riverina suggests as a remedy payment by results. Ordinarily the man who does well at that system is young and strong, and for a few years only he may earn twice the award rate; but during that time he consignsi his mates to certain unemployment. I quote an actual instance of that. In the Melbourne railway yards, under the old day-labour system, 300 men were employed in cleaning 190 cars. When the department introduced speeding-up, the number of men was reduced by 50 per cent, in six months. I may be told that the work was then done more cheaply. placed were thrown on the scrap heap, without jobs, and became a charge on the community. I believe that the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) is sincere in the views that he expressed this evening, but the persistency with which some draw comparisons between the United States of America and Australia is amusing to me. According to the latest statistics the United States of America now has 11,000,000 unemployed. Between the years 1918 and 1926 production increased in the manufacturing industries of the United States of America by 29 per cent., and at the end of that period 2,000,000 fewer were employed in industry. It is obvious that, in these days of smashed awards, rural employers obtain labour at any old price. I repeat what I have said previously, that if I were Victorian Government expended £12,000 dictator in Australia. I should proclaim a working week of 24 hours, and so give Mr Keane. a good proportion .of our unemployed a chance for obtaining a job. [Quorum formed.] Our great burden in this counMinister was in Great Britain the Acting The Prime Minister( Mr Fenton) had a very rough time from this party because of the unemployment, but I give him credit for making £500,000 available for its relief. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then, and to-day the position is twenty times worse. Yet the present budget promises no relief of the problem. Our loan expenditure has been reduced from £43,000,000 to £14,000,000, and a further £14,000,000 has been saved in other directions, so that £43,000,000 less will be spent in the next financial year. There is no loan money from the Old Country, and none in Australia. Although 300,000 men are out of work, the Estimates presented to honourable members will not provide a job for one man. I stress what I have urged before, that we should leave in abeyance the payment of our overseas interest, as is suggested to the European nations under the Hoover plan. For some extraordinary reason my suggestion has fallen on deaf ears. It is estimated that, as a result of the Hoover plan, Australia would benefit to the extent of £4,028,000. In an excellent speech the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) reached a The 100 men who were discertain point, but failed to continue and say something that we wanted him to say. The honourable gentleman admitted that the budget is good, as far as it goes. Apparently he intended to convey the opinion that it lacked any provision for the absorption of unemployed. I am sorry that he did not develop what was in his mind. I believe, as must every other honourable member, that while private enterprise is the employing medium, government expenditure is necessary, at a stage like the present, to provide' the credit for the necessary work to be done. Eveni f the Government had made available in the Estimates £50,000 for the relief of unemployment, in the search .for gold, some good would have been done. Honourable members may be amused at that suggestion, but I remind them that the on a similar scheme, with the result that 15,000 men engaged in the search for gold, the majority of whom earn at least enough to live on. The important thing is to absorb as many as possible of our unemployed in useful work in the country districts. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones) expressed the desirability of encouraging people to grow tobacco. I believe that amall plots of land should be given to the people. could be erected, made of timber split by unemployed, and these men given a chance to make good. This budget, unfortunately, makes no reference to any such constructive scheme, and contains not one ray of hope for the future.

Consequently, I frequently called for quorums. This made me unpopular. I think some of my colleagues of that time would have liked to boil me in oil. member referred, in the speech which he dejivered a few minutes ago, to the use of motor cars by Ministers. It would be a good thing, in my opinion, if every Minister had a motor car for his own use. I should not object to the use of motor cars during week-ends if it resulted in benefit to the health of Ministers and enabled them to perforin their parliamentary duties more effectively. A Minister's time is more valuable that that of a private member. It is desirable that we should save the time of Ministers as much as possible. It would be an excellent thing from the point of view of the country if, when honourable members took the oath of fealty, they also pledged themselves to devote the whole of their time to their parliamentary duties. connection the example of the former Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, who appointed a man in his place in his private business, was highly commendable. I should like to see every honourable -member under an obligation to attend daily some committee associated with the work of one or other of our public departments. The law-maker should undoubtedly be the most important person in the community. If bad laws are made the people inevitably suffer. I have often thought that it would be a good idea if the emoluments of Ministers were the same as those of private members. This would eliminate a great deal of grasping and greed by the ""gold diggers "", to use an Americanism. Every possible convenience should be made available to Ministers in order to conserve their time for important business. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) has suggested that there should be a reduction of 22£ per cent, in our customs duties. I can hardly believe that he would have made such a suggestion had he carefully studied the tariffs of has had on the industrial life of the comthe world. In-passing, may I express my Dr. Moloney. regret that the publication of Kelly's Tariffs of the World has ceased? This was a most valuable work. The two most scientific tariffs in the world are, in my opinion, those of Japan and America. member is hardly accurate in that stateThe honourable ment. The American tariff is the highest. I recollect, from my examination of various tariffs some time ago, that Japan imposes a duty of 355 per cent, on tobacco. One of the main objects of the Labour party is the elimination of poverty. It was that objective which caused me to join this party. In a country which produces so much food as Australia, it is deplorable that there should be any hungry people. We should bend all our energies to the elimination of poverty. I have done this. My constituents have always understood that this was my objective. At any time during my long parliamentary experience it has been possible for my constituents to secure my resignaI n this tion. At one time 255 signatures would have been sufficient to cause my resignation. The late David Syme wrote in his splendid book, Representative Government in England, that the constituents of any member of Parliament should have the power to remove him from his position, just as the King has power to dismiss immediately his advisers. [Quorum formed.] I am glad that for 42 years I have retained the confidence of my constituents. The only free-reall y free-trad e colony in which I ever lived was Hong Kong. I spent five years in the West End of London-no t the slums of the East End -and the misery and wretchedness which I saw there caused me to declare a vendetta against poverty. Neither protection nor free trade removes poverty. Protection establishes industries. We all know that this is the age of machinery. In my opinion, poverty will never be eliminated until the Government is able to obtain control of all machinery. In order to show the effect that machinery munity, I make the following quotation",56,Pabkhill I F The Was More Than £200 In One Year

272,Dr. Maloney,"The honorablef r o m page 58 of Hattersley's This Age of Plenty:It is stated, for instance, that the introduction of the use of oil' fuel on the Cunard liners at once reduced the number of stokers required from 951 to 263. Or again, we are told that in 1913 Messrs. Horrocks, Crewdson& Co. Ltd. produced 34,000 ' miles of cotton cloth with 330,000 spindles and 6,500 employees. To obtain this output in 1700, 172,000 employees would have been required. The same is true of every modern industrial country. The late Judge Higinbotham,' of Victoria, performed a great service to mankind, and, incidentally, erected his own monument, when he caused the words ""master"" and "" m a n "" to be removed from the statutes of Victoria, and had inserted in their stead the words "" employer "" and "" employee."" Another interesting quotation from the same book reads as follows:The United States could to-day supply each person with the same amount of commodities as he consumed in 1913, and lay off 2,000,000 people from work. The age of machinery has caused many problems in industry. honourable members have at some time or another machines, which are able to remove a ton of earth at a time. One such machine can do the work of a very great number of men. can do as much work in one day as 500 men could do in one day 100 years ago. The governments of the world must secure the control of all machinery. When that time comes the golden age promised by Christ, 2,000 years ago, w ill come. We shall not then have men and women trying to keep body and soul together on a mere pittance of 5s. 3d. a day. I have asked university professors, librarians, and many thoroughly wellinformed general readers, if they could tell me of a single country which is able to produce only sufficient food for its inhabitants which has 10 per cent., 20 per cent., or 25 per cent, of its population on the verge of starvation. I have never been able to get an affirmative reply. Yeti n Australia to-day 25 per cent, of our workers are in dire need. If it were not for the good-heartedness of the public and the State governments in providing money, there would be absolute starvation and revolution. £1,200 per month is being spent in No r t h Melbourne and West Melbourne, and more in East Melbourne. God did not create rich and poor, or aristocrats and democrats, but male and female, and it is the duty of the Government, in my opinion, to do its utmost to provide food and clothing for human beings who have been created in God's own image. In one of the motions that I have placed on the notice-paper, it is proposed that, owing to the protection given to inventorSj^ on every newly invented labour-saving machine registered by the Patents Department, the Government should collect 50 per cent, of the profits arising from its use, and devote the proceeds to the reduction of the national debt. This would be the thin edge to ensure the Commonwealth ultimately owning all machinery. Has God or any of the wise prophets declared that the world should be controlled by' capitalism? I am not opposed to real capital. I want to see more good houses, roads and other conveniences provided for the people; I suppose all but I do not wish countries to be controlled by a few men. Seven indiseen the great excavating viduals in the United States of America, and five' in Europe, would be able to reduce many countries to the position in which Australia finds itself to-day.

I admire Henry Ford, because he believes in raising humanity, and not in lowering their wages. him to come to Australia as a dictator, and re-organize the affairs of this country. Any person who reads Fifty-fifty Points About Capital, by Sir Chiozza Money, whose name is held in high esteem in England, will agree that, while there can be no reasonable objection to capital per se, the present capitalistic system is crushing the world. I hope that when the members of this Parliament face the electors, the platform of all parties will include a proposal for the introduction of the initiative, referendum and recall. When Ohio, whose population is only a few hundred thousand above that of Australia, first applied the principle of the referendum, its people answered 45 separate questions, fifteen of which related to matters of great importance to that State, and 25 of the proposals were agreed to on the vote of the people. We should give the people of Australia a similar opportunity to vote on national issues. I am sure that they would be prepared to vote for the elimination of six governments, and, possibly, six parliaments. I thought that the honorThey would not approve of having seven chief justices, or six State agents-general I in London. What is the use of Australia supporting a high commissioner in London? Is it to procure invitations for those who desire to be presented at Court, where ladies some years back had to wear a long train which was very embarrassing to them? If Australia House were sold, it would realize more than was paid for it. I do not believe that it could be shown that we have received any benefit from the expenditure upon it. For a martinet, commend me to a high naval officer, and next to him as a dictator, par excellence, comes a high military officer. What do such persons know about politics? I am proud, however, of the fact that Australia has a GovernorThe proprietors General who is a man of brains, knows Australia, and is well versed in our laws.

The times are too serious for the Government to follow the old roads with all their ruts and obstructions. Politicians and bankers crucified humanity when 1 they introduced the accursed gold standard. When the gold standard was reverted to, one-third of the population of China, India, Japan, and the Straits Settlements was, condemned to suffering and want. It is evident now that the nations are becoming tired of the gold standard, and are coming to the conclusion that in bimetallism lies the only hope of curing the troubles which afflict the world to-day.

277,I Would Be Willing To Allow Dr. Maloney,"There is one Crown£40,000,000 to £400,000,000. No country in the world, with the exception of the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia, makes the sovereign the currency unit. Every other country has based its currency on silver. This applies to the mark of Germany; the peseta of Spain; the franc of France and Switzerland, and the lira of Italy. In China and India they tried to make the value of the coin represent the actual value of the silver it contained, and that is why one never knew the value of one's money until one read the price of silver in the paper. If the Government adopted my suggestion for minting silver, immediate employment would be found for the miners at Broken Hill, 46 per cent, of whom are now out of work. Ultimately the Government should increase the price of silver to 2s. an ounce, and stabilize it at that figure. At Is. an ounce, silver would yield a profit of 450 per cent, when coined. I thank the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) for telling me to-day that he is a bimetallist. I accept his assurance gratefully. I have no doubt that eventually the majority of nations will adopt this policy, but until that comes about, I desire our Treasury to take the opportunity of making a profit of 450 per cent, by coining silver. We should then be able to pay the farmers 4's. a bushel for their wheat, and God knows they answered worthily the appeal made to them to grow more wheat. agree to the monetization of silver. of a commonwealth of free nations, and we should insist on applying the system in this country. If we coined our silver into money we could buy all the wool produced in this country at Is. 6d. a lb., sell it in London at 9d. a lb., and still make a profit of 5d. a lb. We would be able to buy the wheat at 4s. a bushel, sell it in England at 2s. a bushel, and make' a in England would be worth 31 per cent, more owing to the exchange rate than if left in Australia. YetI cannot persuade this Parliament or this Government to take the matter up. Honourable members who are young enough will live to remember that, by the means I have suggested, Australia had an opportunity of providing work for its unemployed miners at Broken Hill and elsewhere, and at the same time of curing the depression from which we are suffering. I am grateful to honourable members for giving me their attention, and I should be still more thankfulto them if they could advance any sound argument against the monetization of silver. The only objection which can be urged is that silver money is bulky. But what does it matter if it does take up twenty times the room of gold ? I do not know exactly what the dimensions of this chamber are, but I believe that it is large enough to hold all the silver that was ever mined. This Parliament as a whole, and not merely the Government, should make a declaration that no human being should go in want in Australia, and to that end we should issue our currency, based on the value of the £4,000,000,000 of private and public wealth in Australia.

AlthoughI consider that too many embargoes and high tariffs are now in operation, I do not wish the timber industry in Australia to be detroyed, particularly by the similar slavelabour competition of this country in which the honourable member for Freinantle and the honourable member for Flinders appear to have a friendly interest. am glad that the importation of Russian timber has been referred to by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr when the Russian five-year plan is in Hawker). the paragraph press that a good deal of friendliness exists between Russia and the members of the Labour party in Australia, although it is not so pronounced as it was a few years ago. Some of the gentlemen concerned are proud to be termed internationalists; but, in my opinion, an internationalist is one who places his own country last. Yesterday, when I asked the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) whether a certain man who had once been sentenced to imprisonment in Australia, and was later deported because he was a member of an unlawful association has been readmitted to the Commonwealth, I was informed that the person concerned had been admitted and that he is a director of a Russian company importing timber into Australia. In these circumstances it is strange that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) is perplexed know who is importing Russian timber into Australia. The Minister for Home Affairs should know that under the Immigration Restriction Act a person once deported is prohibited from re-entering the Commonwealth. This person has, I understand, been now representing Russian Oil Products Limited. to visit New Zealand ana may return to Australia whenever he desires. This man allegedly came to Australia on a business visit. He could have completed [135] his business in a month or two, but he has been here for seven months, and, as the result of his handiwork, or that of some one like him, communistic violence occurred recently in Sydney. It seems as if the Premier of New South Wales, assisted by his chief of staff, Mr Garden, is paving the way for communism, while the Federal Government is assisting by making it easy for British renegades, such as this gentleman, to come to Australia. I protest against this man's re-admission to this country. I want to know from the Minister the reason for permitting a man who was imprisoned and deported from Australia in 1918 to re-enter this country at a time like this, It would appear from operation, and the Soviet is attempting published in the thereby to bring about the economic ruin of the world; an economic war more serious than a war of arms. We know that Russia is dumping into Great Britain a larger quantity of wheat than we export. That country is dumping timber, butter, and even manufactured goods, such as biscuits, soap and woodwork. Russia has now started to dump timber into Australia. Influence has been brought to bear somewhere to allow this man to re-enter Australia. After he was deported he visited Russia, and it is alleged that he was responsible for taking mechanics from America to Russia to assist in giving effect to its five year plan. There is, adjacent to our own parliamentary library, an explanatory map of Russia and an abundance of Soviet literature brought here by the man I mention, which honourable members have been seen reading in the House.

I do not know whether Russia produces under slave conditions or not. ""We can only go on what we read and hear, and some of the statements of persons who come here with a specific mission misrepresent the conditions of that country.
