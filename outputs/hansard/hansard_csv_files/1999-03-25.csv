21,Mr Cadman,"I thank you, Mr Deputy time and time again is certainly not the waything about this whole question of private and taxpayer actually contributes very significant public health, because of the way the terms amounts towards those funds. So in what private and public are being used. The memsense are they private? There is obviously a ber for Mitchell talked about socialised public component. The public component is medicine. I do not know that there are many the contribution which the taxpayer makes countries in the world nowadays talking about towards the sustenance of those funds-the socialised medicine, but I assume he is refer$1.5 billion which was recently added by the ring to the British system. The model of minister in order to prop up the private funds. funding whereby the government actually One of the issues that has been raised by pays doctors a certain salary for so many the opposition is: if these funds are intended patients-which is the British system-is not to help people pay for hospital treatment, why one that is generally used by most Western not boost the hospital system directly with countries. If that is what he meant by socialthese funds rather than doing it indirectly by ised medicine-namely, that GPs dealing with paying through the health funds and then people and also doctors in hospitals and getting the health funds to sponsor private specialists are alJ paid a fixed salary-that hospitals and other services? That is the system is now pretty rarely seen around the question. world. If that is what is meant by socialised medicine, it has never been the position in The minister, in trying to deal with this Australia, with the exception, of course, of question, has said over and over again, 'This some areas in our public hospital system. is an ideological issue; the Labor Party simply has an ideological commitment to public When we are talking about the funding of hospitals.' But that is not the issue. The issue hospitals, that is one of four possible categowould apply even if we were to say that there ries of ways in which to fund hospitals and were a number of hospitals that were privately health services. The one that is most interestowned. This question would still arise. ing from the point of view .of Australia, and One of the questions that has not been the one that we have generally pursued, is the thought about in the health debate, which was Medicare system, which does not pay doctors thought about for a while during the time of a salary but pays them on the basis of a fee. Minister Graham Richardson, was the matter It does alJow people to choose doctors and it of making private hospital beds accessible to· does allow doctors to have a number of public patients and, indeed, to people who are patients-provided, of course, that they do not being subsidised by the taxpayer. So rather go overboard and completely overservice and than having this roundabout system, the overcharge. That is a matter which is critical minister might care to think about a more in certain respects with a system such as the direct way of supporting the private hospital Medicare system, and a matter which the system, if he wants to support it, by allowing minister has failed to address seriously since more public patients to be able to go into the he became the minister. I give him credit for private hospital system, rather than having some of the initiatives that he has carried out, this indirect and highly expensive approach of but on the issue of overservicing and overboosting the private health insurance funds, charging he has not done very much at all, which are then supposed to support the and I think he ought to look at that. private hospitals. Why does it have to be done The Australian system also has a third in that way? The minister has not answered category. The third category is where doctors these questions. are paid, especially in private hospitals, There is also a fourth category of fundingthrough this business of the private health where the individuals pay directly for their insurance funds. Even the word 'private' in fees. One of the problems in the private relation to these health insurance funds is health insurance area-and, as the minister interesting-especially now. We call them knows, probably the major reason why so private health insurance funds but, especially many people have not joined private health with the government's latest initiative, the insurance funds-is that people know that, even when they join a private health insurcould be kept down and the coverage for ance fund and pay all of that money for people could be more comprehensive. The private health insurance, they go into a private minister has finally decided to have a go at hospital and find, at the end of the process, this after having been minister for all this that many of their fees are not covered.

When are we going to of the fees for their procedures, operations see comprehensive coverage? When are we and the specialists who use those private going to be able to say to the private health hospitals. funds, 'What have you done? Why don't you Many people have effectively said, 'I'm get into serious discussions with the private going to end up paying anyway.' Some hospitals and the specialists about the costs of individuals have refused to take out private health care?' health insurance, not because they will not go This is the core of the whole funding issue. into a private hospital but because they have Funding for the provision of health services worked out that, in the event that they do go is not merely a private matter; it is a matter into a private hospital, it is probably in their of concern to the whole of the community. As financial interest to pay the hospital directly. such, it is something which the whole of the If they have private insurance, they will end community should have an input into. It is up having to pay both the private insurance something which the whole of the community and the additional fees. should be discussing. It is something which Why is this happening? It is happening needs to be solved by the participation of the because the minister has done nothing to community. That means sacrifices. If we are control the charges imposed by private hospigoing to continue to have a good health care tals and private health institutions. The system in this country, then, given that the minister has done nothing on that point. In overall costs of health care, especially the other words, a private hospital can virtually technical costs, are growing substantially, we charge whatever they like. If people have to have to ask ourselves how we are going to go to that private hospital, even if they have fund that health care system and how we as got private health insurance, they then have a community are going to be able to afford it. to pay that gap, that difference. Those who are most involved in the system What about addressing this very serious have a responsibility. Our health care profesproblem, Minister? This is a key problem in sionals, generally speaking, work hard, are health funding. The minister prefers to boost very dedicated, perform excellently and in the the health insurance funds, to give them majority of cases are not rewarded with very support, so that they can make money out of high salaries. This is especially true of nurses the process. At the same time, it does very and non-doctor professionals. But there are little in relation to the issue of the costs some areas which are now beyond a joke, imposed by private hospitals for procedures where greed is the principle rather than and, indeed, it does little in relation to the responsible service to the community. This is costs for the procedures imposed by the particularly the case with specialist technical specialists working in private hospitals. services, such as pathology services, screening I must correct the member for Mitchell: the services, X-ray services and the like, where suggestion that there ought to be a package the costs are blowing out substantially.

If we could the situation is and what the government's save in the areas of pathology services, X-ray achievements have been in those areas of cost services and specialist services, just think containment over the last three years. what We could do for our public hospitals, This bill deals with two areas.

When her youth allowance was cut, of the youth allowance, showed callous disregard to the aspirations of Australia's she could no longer meet her loan repayments for the car and was ultimately in breach of youth and the well-being of their loved ones. Far from making things simpler, the new rental agreements. system caused confusion and frustration for There were many, many stories like these those who were affected. The introduction and but all with a common theme: motivated administration of the new system by the young adults trying to establish themselves in government and Centrelink were a disgrace. mainstream society finding accommodation, Rarely have we seen in this country the entering financial arrangements and doing all implementation of a public policy which has they could to get ajob but requiring financial been so badly handled.

The government pulled the rug right frustration that was perpetrated on our youth out from underneath them. Once again, the and their families it may well have been as government have welshed on their end of humorous. their much touted mutual obligation bargain.

The real game is about slashing wages, slashing benefits and, through that insignificance if the pretender to the throne, process, creating in the end far greater dethe shadow successor Prime Minister, gets his pendency. He admitted in his secret paper way. At the heart of his insidious plan is a that, between 1990 and 1998, the number of proposal to introduce widespread cut-price people on allowances for longer than six wages for the unemployed. I suspect that the months had risen from 357,000 to 546,000; minister has not thought this particular propothat is an increase of 200 per cent. sal through fully. The scale of the escalation of welfare Let me pose this question: what incentive dependency is also borne out by the latest is there for a young unemployed person to long-term unemployment figures.

The figures also show What incentive is there for them to work if that this group is becoming less skilled by the they are not clearly better off? Then again, month. Young adults in Australia, especially perhaps the minister has thought it through those affected by this bill, are therefore being because a sparkle of reasoning can be found sold short. on page 13 of his secret plan. It states: On average, under this government the Discounting wages would also likely require unemployed spend seven weeks longer on complementary action on the social security benefits. As that goes right to the heart of the entitlements for this group if adequate work incentives were to be provided ... government's credibility with getting people off welfare and into work, let me say it again: What is that code for? We know what it is with the government having completed its code for. We know what those opposite are first term in office, the unemployed are up to. This is the classic conservative apspending an average of seven weeks longer on proach to welfare reform: lower wages and benefits.

It being 6 p.m.,4472 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 Thursday, 25 March 1999 South Coast Labour Council: IIIawarra regional representative, I support this concept. That is why I have always regarded takeover bids from Sydney of the Illawarra with some concern. A difficulty we always have in the Illawarra is that we are so close to Sydney. Groups in Sydney wishing to gain more support or to expand their empire often cast their eyes south in takeover bids. Last year I went through quite a bitter preselection battle when Sydney elements tried to replace me with one of their stooges. Last night another attempted takeover of Illawarra was repelled. The New South Wales Labor Council has been attempting to take over the South Coast Labour Council despite strenuous denials that the Sydney Labor Council was involved. Nine delegates were sent down from Sydney to vote to replace the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council, Paul Matters. These people had absolutely no association with the Illawarra and replaced some Illawarra delegates. They were so familiar with the region that two of them got lost and had to use their mobile phones to find out directions to the venue. Paul Matters has upset some vested interests and these interests were determined to get rid of him. They wanted someone more compliant. The long-term plan was to make the South Coast Labour Council so ineffective and weak that it would eventually be taken over by Sydney. They put up a stooge in someone who had not been to a labour council meeting for something like four years. It was interesting that this person was a union official from the CPSU whose members have been under attack as no other members have been over the last few months. Instead of looking after their interests, this person has been trying to get the votes to secure his own future. In the oldest trick in the book, when the pro-Sydney group last night realised they did not have the votes, they staged a walkout and started screaming about stacking, rorts and so forth. But the good news is that this attempted takeover bid was repelled. As well as Paul Matters remaining, so do Fay Campbell, Sandra Herbert Lowe, Mark Armstrong and Marlene McAlear, all local people. These people will deliver a vibrant South Coast Labour Council doing the good work it has been doing for many years. Most importantly, it will be in South Coast people's hands. It will not be a weak apology for Sydney. It will not be used as a ploy to get rid of the South Coast Labour Council, our local trade union body, and have it replaced with Sydney. For once all these people in Sydney might realise that in the Illawarra we will not accept their stooges.

The thousand workers on the site have gone on strike and have now entered the fourth week of their strike. The Koreans, I can tell you, are just amazed that a major investment in Australia, so important to Australia itself, could be in jeopardy. If the problem is not resolved in the very near future, the Koreans are going to mothball that development at this stage. I can tell you that already we have lost the stage 2 redevelopment of the site and we may have lost the next 10 years of Asian investment in this country. It is nothing more than a battle between the CFMEU and the AWU. It is a tragic strike because the workers and their families have been so badly affected; the Townsville community has been badly affected; the project and its investors have been badly affected; and Australia's credibility and reputation have been so badly affected. The solution to this, I guess, is secret ballots being incorporated in all awards. I know that the men want to go back to work but, as a result of union thuggery, intimidation and the calls in the middle of the night they are afraid to break the picket line. The other thing is that the industrial relations court in Queensland must be able to enforce its decisions. Currently, it has ordered the men back to work but they have just simply thumbed their noses at the court and there does not seem to be any will whatsoever to make sure that the wish of the umpire is respected. There does not seem to be any penalty and that is very sad for our industrial relations system. Currently, matters such as the supply of sulfuric acid to the Western Mining phosphate hill project are in jeopardy. The output of the new George Fisher zinc mine in Mount Isa is in jeopardy and the gas pipeline and base load power station are in jeopardy. We must not allow this to continue. We must get the men back to work. We must look after their families and we must stop this union thuggery that has been going on in Townsville. New South Wales Farmers Federation South Wales Farmers Federation. I am one of those members on the Labor side who never objects to people getting together in associations to try to improve the lot of individuals, whether it be the National Farmers Federation or trade unions or whatever. I think they have a legitimate role to play. I am not raising the issue that the National Farmers Federation may be biased. I think it is unfortunate that they purport to be apolitical when we all know they have a leaning. I think that is fair enough and if they would only come out, as it were, it would lead to a lot more transparency and openness. I do think that the reputation not only of the state body but, through knock-on effects, of the national body, has been damaged by some outrageous as in the New South Wales state election. You may recall the tragic fire at Crookwell. The New South Wales Farmers Federation have put out print, radio and TV advertisements suggesting that those farmers who had been through that tragedy were not permitted to clear firebreaks. I just wanted to say that that is totally untrue and misleading. Section 12A and B of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act clearly states that activities carried out under the Rural Fires Act 1997 and the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989 are exempt from the native vegetation legislation, so they did not even have to apply under that. But just in case there was some misunderstanding by the four farmers who appeared on the TV ad, there has been absolutely no application lodged by any of those four farmers either for clearing bushfire breaks or any other clearing.

Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road, Mains Road, McCullough Street and Padstow Road in the Sunnybank, Macgregor and Upper Mount Gravatt areas, also Beenleigh Road and Beaudesert Road between Granard Road and Ipswich Road at Moorooka. These are areas where trucks that have come from outside the area are rat-running. These are not local trucks, these are not trucks delivering goods into the local area, or working within local businesses, or owned by local people; in the main these are trucks that have traveIled from many far away places, some from within Queensland, some from interstate, but they are basically rat-running. These are an old, traditional routes that have been made redundant because a lot of money has been spent by the state and federal governments on· the Southern Brisbane Bypass. It is south of my area and it is an effective four-lane highway. Yes, it is a toll road, but it is nevertheless, for those local truck drivers in the know, a very effective route to get from Ipswich Road, the route out to the Warrego Highway and the New England Highway, to the port of Brisbane and to North Queensland. The Southern Brisbane Bypass is not being utilised as well as it should, in part because the Queensland state government continues to refuse to take down signs directing trucks away from the toll road and onto suburban roads in my electorate. As weIl, the toll needs to be looked at. I wiIl continue having discussions with the new federal minister for transport, as I did with the transport minister in the previous federal government, because some of these roads were designated by Labor in about 1991-92 as part of the national road freight corridor. I am working to get that gazettal taken away to make sure that there is no impediment to stop those trucks from being moved onto the Southern Brisbane Bypass instead of through streets in my electorate. I was stunned by the response of the counciIlors of the Brisbane City Council in my electorate.

(Time expired) Hatzolah community medical emergency service which operates in my electorate with but one aim and charter: to save lives. Statistics show that when a person is suddenly faced with a medical lifethreatening situation, the speed and accuracy of treatment within the first few minutes is crucial to survival. Therefore, it is imperative to have access to immediate professional first aid at the scene of trauma. In Melbourne, the Metropolitan Ambulance Service is the first call to make in such a situation. In my electorate, Hatzolah is the next call. Hatzolah, an emergency first aid service, operates at the moment within two areas of my electorate, Caulfield and St Kilda, and has an average three-minute response time. A team of highly trained-by the Metropolitan Ambulance Service-first aid specialists is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with sophisticated and advanced medical emergency equipment. On arrival, the Hatzolah team will immediately commence emergency treatment until the ambulance arrives. The Hatzolah team, 19 currently in Caulfield and St Kilda, are highly trained to treat most medical emergencies. They have the highest level of accreditations from the Ambulance Officers Training Centre. All cars are equipped with approximately $20,000 worth of the latest lifesaving devices including defibrillators, oxygen resuscitators and other medical aids. Hatzolah has an audited response time of two minutes. In 1996, its first year of operation, it attended 180 calls; in its second year, 1997, it attended 310 calls; and in its third year, 1998, it attended 414 calls. It is important to note that all its cars, equipment and training have been acquired as a result of self-funding from donations, and to date these have been in the order of $600,000 plus. No funds have been provided by local council, state or federal governments. It is imperative to add that this service is totally free. No membership fees or charges exist and, as stated previously, the paramount aim is the act of saving a life. The origin of Hatzolah was in the local Jewish community, but over the past few years many others within the Melbourne Ports community have also freely availed themselves of this excellent service-as all locals are free to do. The origin of Hatzolah, its funding and expansion can be directly attributed to four young men: Mark Ernst, Ruvi Herzog, Yumi Friedman and Eli Benedikt. In conclusion, let me pay special tribute to my dear friends Moish and Vicki Gordon, whose family's philanthropy has supported Hatzolah over the years. As the federal member for Melbourne Ports, I express the gratitude of all people in the electorate and our pride in this service that goes about its job quietly, efficiently and professionally.

Many of these energetic and enthusiastic young people have had their jobs put at risk because of the ridiculous action of Labor and the Democrats in blocking the government's youth wages bill in the Senate a few weeks ago. Last week I attended two meetings of our local chambers of commerce at Logan Village and Beaudesert. These rural communities battled for years under the former Labor government. I strongly support our local chambers, who do a great job, and I attend as many meetings as possible so I am kept up to date on how small business people are thinking. These business owners, employers-most of them parents-are shaking their heads over Labor's decision to abolish youth wages. They find it absolutely incredible that, at a time when youth unemployment is a major concern, Labor is putting at risk the jobs of over 400,000 young Australians. It seems that Labor really is not interested in helping young Australians. Not only did it create the problem, but now it will not help fix it. Perhaps Labor believes in some twisted way that, if our youth unemployment gets worse, some political benefit will be provided to Labor at the next election. This is not a difficult conclusion to draw-there can be no other logical reason for Labor's position, unless we look at the trade union movement's position. It is not surprising, they are exactly the same: Labor is bound hand and foot to the union movement. There cannot be any other reason for playing with the lives of our young Australians who are just trying to get a start in their working life. Last week, when I was talking to our local business people, parents and young people about this important issue, what was Kim Beazley doing? He was unveiling his so-called vision to try to poly-fill the widening cracks in his leadership, but he refused to keep the current youth wages system as an important issue. His vision was about looking after Labor's noisy interest groups and paying some token amount for finding and keeping a job-implying that some sort of bonus was the only way to motivate people into finding a job, implying that long-term unemployed people are lazy and are motivated only by the almighty dollar. I can tell the Labor Party leader that the best incentive for people to get and keep a job is the feeling of self-worth, motivation and security they get as a result. It is an insult to suggest that waving a few hundred dollars would be a solution. High school retention rates have increased under the Howard government, and we all know that a solid education is a very important prerequisite in finding lasting jobs. But that does not suit everyone. I have raised eight adult children-some have gone on to university, some left school at years 10 and 12 and went on to apprenticeships, some commenced work as soon as they left school and others have gone on to further study at TAFE. We must recognise that there is not one prescriptive measure to ensure success for all young people, because everyone is unique and has different abilities. Labor's elitist view of the world fails to recognise this simple truth. A lot of traditional Labor voters I have spoken to are angry that today's Labor looks down at anyone who does not have a university degree. I am proud to be part of a government that is providing young people with more apprenticeships. (Time expired) the time for members' statements has concluded.",137,Representatives Main Committee

In accordance with sessional order 275A,Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4477 Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Vaile: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (9.59 a.m.)-by leave-The amendments that we are considering today were introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at quite he notice in the previous debate on the primary industries legislation. I would just put on the public record the question of why these amendments were shanghaied into the legislation at the last minute. Is this the responsibility of the minister's office, or is the responsibility of the department? We would be very interested to know exactly why, when a piece of legislation has been on the books for a long time, at the eleventh hour the minister suddenly comes into the chamber and puts to us a plethora of amendments to the legislation. I just make the point that we are not going to challenge the amendments that have been made. They are functional amendments dealing with amounts in the legislation, typographical errors and changes to names as industry bodies have restructured. They are sensible amendments, but I am interested in the justification for introducing these amendments provided to the coalition in the speaking points which the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry kindly made available to me. I have to say that it is pretty flimsy. I could not make a lot of sense of some of it. Firstly, it said that amalgamating a levies and charges bill from 40 to two has enabled industry to make comparisons and seek greater consistency in the legislation. I suppose that would be a normal thing to happen if you amalgamated 50 bills into five, so I am just wondering why it took so long for the government to generate these amendments. The second reason given was that industry is dynamic and changing and that this gives us an opportunity to make amendments in a timely manner. If that is not gobbledegook, I do not know what is. But given the fact that this legislation needs to go through at this time, I should state this: given the situation the government found itself in on this legislation, dropping it on the opposition at the last moment, we did get from the minister's office a high degree of cooperation in dealing with this and in presenting it at the last debate we had. I express my appreciation to the minister for that cooperation. That does not absolve the government from the larger responsibility of seeing that, when legislation is before the parliament over a long period of time, amendments are given to the opposition in sufficient time for us to debate them. I will not go into the amendments. I understand the minister wants them to go through fairly quickly, and we will cooperate in that regard. We will not be opposing any of the amendments that he has put to this committee. 4478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 reply-I thank the opposition for their consideration in getting this package of bills through. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Bill 1998, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Bill 1998, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998, the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill 1998 and the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill 1998 are important bills. When I introduced this package of bills to parliament, I noted that it would make the law more accessible to those involved in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The singular achievement of the PILA legislation is the amalgamation of 40 primary industry levy and charge acts into two main bills. This will reduce the call on the time of parliament and the public sector for the often involved process of making changes to levies and charges by reducing the number of imposition acts that will have to be amended to effect changes in the future. The other important aspect of the PILA legislation is that it provides a framework for future levies and charges to be imposed by regulation. This will enable the government to better service industry by simplifying the processes and reducing the long lead times surrounding changes to levies and charges and by being more flexible and responsive to industry requests for such changes as well as for new or additional levies. The streamlining of the administration of levies and charges legislation will also introduce new efficiencies in the public sector. It is important to note that the government intends that the regulation introducing new levies will be required to be accompanied by a report setting out the extent to which the proposed levy or charge complies with the government's general principles for neW primary industry levies and charges when tabled in the parliament and will be subject to disallowance by parliament. In addition, the Office of Regulation Review examines new levies through its regulation impact process and a regulation impact statement is required for each new levy or charge. Industry is supportive of the PILA legislation because it will streamline the process of amending levy rates and introducing new levies. Many sectors have taken the opportunity to request minor amendments to the legislation while it is before the parliament. Essentially, these amendments have involved minor tidying up and reflecting changes within industry sectors which have occurred since their legislation was last before parliament. There have been some substantive changes, however. At the request of industry, the national residue survey cattle transaction levy has been changed so that the grass-fed and lot-fed components can be separately and clearly identified. The maximum levy rates for the dried fruit industry and the levy and charge rates for the honey industries have been increased at the request of those industries. I must stress that these changes do not affect the current amount of levy or charge presently paid by those industries and that, if and when the industries do seek to change their operative rates at some stage in the future, they will have to ensure that the government's levy principles and the regulation impact statement requirements are met. I would point out, though, that the government has been pleased to show that it is responsive to industry requests by moving these amendments. In addition, the government has introduced some minor technical amendments to correct deficiencies and improve the legislation. In conclusion, the government's initiative in introducing the PILA legislation represents a major step forward in the administration of primary industries levies and charges.

[Clause 70f Schedule 25 (wheat)-regulations] The purpose of these amendments is to reflect changes in industry, respond to the industry requests to increase the maximum charge rate on the export of honey and introduce minor technical amendments to improve the legislation. Amendments to the schedules covering coarse grains, grain legumes, oilseeds, pasture seed and wheat are intended to introduce consistency across the grains industries in relation to the definitions of growers' organisations and the annual levy liability threshold. The maximum levy rate for leviable coarse grains and wheat will be reduced from five per cent to three per cent to maintain consistency with the maximum rates for grain legumes and oilseeds and to take account of industry changes. In the case of wheat, this change reflects the cessation from 1 July 1999 of the Wheat Industry Fund component of the wheat levy, which was two per cent of the maximum five per cent levy rate. For coarse grains the change corrects an anomaly which arose when coarse grains were changed to an ad valorem rate and the maximum levy rate was set at the same level as for wheat rather than at the more relevant figure of three per cent, which applied to other research only levies. The Dried Fruits Research and Development Council and the Australian Dried Fruits Association Inc., the peak industry body, have requested that the maximum levy rates for dried vine fruits be increased from $10 to $15 per tonne and from $30 to $50 per tonne for dried tree fruits, and that the definition of dried vine fruits be extended to include new grape varieties and existing table grape varieties which are increasingly being dried, processed and marketed. The operative levy rate is currently set at the same level as the maximum levy rate. Therefore, there would be no scope to meet industry's request for an increase in the operative levy rate in the absence of this amendment. The Australian Honey Bee Industry Council, supported by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, has requested that the maximum levy rates for the research component of the sale of honey and on honey used in the production of other goods be increased. Again, the operative levy rate is currently set at the same level as the maximum levy rate, and there is no scope for an increase in the operative levy rate in the absence of this amendment. The industry has also requested that the operative levy rates applying to the research component be amended to reflect the fact that these .have been set at 0.75c per kilogram by regulation since 1998. The industry has requested that the operative levy rate applying to the marketing component of the sale of honey and on honey used in the production of other goods be amended to reflect the fact that these have been set at zero by regulation since 1995. Increasing the maximum rates for dried fruit and honey at this time will allow operative rates to be increased without the need for further amendment to this legislation in the foreseeable future. However, any operative rate increase will be through regulatory change and thus subject Thursday, 25 March 1999 . MAIN COMMITTEE 4483 to scrutiny by parliament. The increases in the maximum levy rates do not have any direct financial implications for Commonwealth funding at this time. In line with the aim of the PILA legislation to improve the efficiency of the administration of levies and charges, the process for making changes to the levy on pasture seeds will be simplified by amending clause 5 of schedule 21 so that only nominated species, rather than cultivars, should be included in the list of leviable seeds. All cultivars of a species are subject to the same rate of pasture seed levy. This change, which has been requested by the relevant growers organisation, the Grains Council of Australia, will remove the need for keeping the cultivar list up to date, wpich is a time consuming task for the industry. Other minor policy changes include amending the definition of who pays the levy on laying chickens to reflect the fact that the owner of the hatchery is responsible for the payment of the levy and repealing a redundant definition of meat chickens and amending references to the Australian Chicken Meat Federation to reflect the fact that this organisation is an incorporated body.

These amendments are largely unrelated to each other. They are also essentially technical in nature. In this area, as in very many areas of communications, things which appear technical in nature may well have more substantive measures underneath them. The opposition's view is that, whilst we are very happy for these measures to go through the House and through this Main Committee in a non-controversial way, we are in the process of consulting with the industry to satisfy ourselves and ensure that none of these proposed technical measures cause any difficulty. To give one illustration, the bill proposes to allow the ACA to control emissions to and from domestic and foreign space objects and there is a technical argument as to what the definition of a space object may be. It is almost certainly the case that none of these issues will raise great controversial or contentious matters but, to ensure that they do not, in the other place this matter will be referred to the relevant Senate committee for inquiry. I would be most surprised if that inquiry was not resolved on the papers without the need for any form of public hearing or the like. For the purposes of the debate here, we are happy to support the measures. They are technical in nature. Other than the one item I have referred to, we have not, at this stage, discovered any hidden bombs, so to speak, but we are reserving our rights to do so if consultation with the industry or evidence to the Senate select committee requires us to move any amendments, technical or otherwise. I have indicated this personally to the minister for the arts, who handles these matters in the House. I have also indicated the same to the office of the minister for communications to ensure the focus of the Senate committee's activities will be technical in nature rather than having people think there is some hidden agenda here. We support the measures in that context. this particular legislation and all of the miscellaneous matters that are contained within this particular tranche of bills.

224,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.21 A.m.),"I thank the member for Perth for the support for4488 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 aimed at improving the provision of radio communication services and telecommunication services in Australia today. The amendments, by and large, are quite unrelated but, taken as a package, they will provide for much more efficient management of the radiocommunications spectrum. With increasing use of the spectrum these days, moving right up into the super high frequencies above 50 gigahertz, it is very important.that we are able to efficiently manage that spectrum. It is interesting, however, that, as time goes by, the spectrum that was originally used for the first ever radio transmissions in the world is now by and large quite unused. I am referring, of course, to the frequencies 15 kilohertz through to about 500 kilohertz. By and large, this is used only by a few airport non-directional beacons. There will be some very specific benefits for the industry, for operators and consumers alike. The amendments are a sensible response, and the opposition has acknowledged that, to the practical concerns that have been raised by the industry. They have been raised also by consumers and government. Government is a very significant user of the radiocommunication spectrum in all sorts of ways. There are more and more interesting ways of using that radiocommunications spectrum these days-not only using the normal voice as was the case for so many years. There will also be benefits from the competitive nature of these amendments and they will be able to improve the government's opportunity to deliver innovative services to all Australians at the lowest possible price. That is very important as well. Something else that will come out of this tranche of amendments is the benefit to industry from the greater certainty that will apply. Often because the particular act has been in existence for so many years, it goes out of date very easily and you can easily lose sight of the fact that what is in the act is no longer relevant in these modem times. The changes here, as I have looked over them, are practical changes which will bring back certainty and direct guidance to the users of the radio frequency spectrum, so that there can be an efficient regime for the management of that spectrum. Turning more specifically to some of the provisions that are in this tranche of bills, the first one in relation to space objects is most interesting. Obviously, it is good to see Australia continuing to be up-front there with modem times. I think that we have all seen the mobile phone technology, for example. The iridium satellite system that is up there has 66 low orbiting satellites, from memory, providing that mobile phone technology worldwide. It is very important that the spectrum be protected for the benefit of the users of that technology here in Australia. There are many other satellites, of course, some of which we know about, some of which we do not particularly know about and some we will never know about, that also need to be protected. With deep space objects the signals coming back from so far away are so minute in amplitude that it is very easy to cause interference to those signals. With the tracking stations that we have here in Australia monitoring those deep space objects, we need to make sure that we can protect them and that they are not interfered with. So this is a good move by the government to protect that investment in the future of our country and in the technology that is encompassing us at the moment. The second provision which is interesting is this matter of reflectors. A number of reflectors are in use today. They are passive devices and they redirect the radiocommunications signals, particularly in the microwave band. That redirection could cause interference to other services. Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4489 This amendment will enable those passive devices to now be incorporated in the protection regime. Previously only active transmitting and receiving devices were protected, but now the passive devices will also be able to be protected. They are a very low cost investment in providing radiocommunications. They are the sort of thing where you put a metal sheet on the top of a very tall building to reflect a signal coming from one direction down to a receiver that would normally not be line of sight. The third provision I am interested in is the delegation of the power to issue certificates of proficiency. The reason I am interested in this is that I do hold three of those certificates of proficiency. Victor Kilo Four Tango Oscar. I am able to broadcast on many bands and my certificate of proficiency was issued originally by the PMG, but now these certificates are issued by the ABA. This will allow these certificates to be issued by the examining body. Things have moved on from many years ago. In my case, the modem equivalents of the AOCP, BOCP and In relation to licence renewal, this has been a loophole in the act. Some people have not renewed their licences and then continued to operate. They choose to pay for their licences only from the time that they then renew their licences. These people have been able to get a period of up to six months or so in which to operate without paying any fees at all. In that sense, this is a very sensible and practical amendment which will enable the government to collect its licence fees in a timely fashion. There are a number of other matters contained in this particular tranche of legislation. They are sensible matters and I would commend them to the Main Committee. a.m.)-in reply-I wish to thank the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, and the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, for their contributions, both very worthwhile and constructive, during this debate on the Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. SadlyI missed the contribution of the member for Perth because I was in the chamber itself on House duty, but, as I understand it from private conversations, it was essentially that the legislation has a qualified pass. Is this the Labor Party hedging their bets again in that they cannot see any obvious faults, failing or misdemeanours in this legislation but, nonetheless, they reserve judgment until a Senate committee can examine it in fine detail? Far be it for me to deprive Her Majesty's loyal opposition from fulfilling its full responsibilities to properly scrutinise government legislation and hold the executive accountable, but I think it is fairly self-evident that this legislation, being of a technical housekeeping nature, exactly fixes any uncertainties or ambiguities even, dare I say, loopholes in the legislation. If the opposition's concern is that there has been insufficient consultation and there needs to be an extended further period which they will provide by way of reference to the Senate committee, I am quick to assure the opposition that many months consultation has taken place with industry in the preparation of the amendments that now form part of the Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1999.

I can assure the member for Perth, who himself is a very thorough and, indeed, exacting individual in his approach to work, that we have crossed all the t's and dotted all of the i's. Allow me to summarise, Madam Deputy Speaker, the le,gislation before the chamber. The government is very proud to establish, in a way our predecessors never did, a pro-competitive telecommunications regulatory framework which encourages new entrants, promotes diversity of services and providers, allows for vigorous but fair competition and protects the interests of consumers. How stark is the contrast with the previous Labor governments? They were slow to reform; it was almost impossible to protect the interests of consumers in relation to the partial entry of new competitors. Look, let us not be distracted. They are gone, they are buried and they are not coming back for the foreseeable future. Consistent with this policy of the government, the government supports the introduction, where practical and technically feasible, of new and innovative services and efficient usage of associated radio spectrum frequencies. As many members know, I would hope, the regulatory framework for spectrum management is set out in the Radiocommunications Act of 1992 and associated legislation. The major principles underlying the Radiocommunications Act of 1992 include technological neutrality and indeed, in general, neutrality on the uses to which the spectrum is put. The bill before the chamber contains various minor amendments that have been requested over several years by the Australian Communications Authority, and the ACA's predecessors, in consultation with the telecommunications industry and consumers. They are, as is obvious, largely unrelated but designed to clarify some possible ambiguities, to finetune aspects of some parts of the act, to increase flexibility, to address some potential loopholes, and to reduce some red tape. The amendments make the existing act clearer and work better. In short, they reflect the good housekeeping nature and efforts of this government. I commend the bill to the chamber.

This bill represents an important moment in the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia. The bill encompasses the first component of a package of reforms designed to provide a new and appropriate framework for the regulation and management of complementary medicines. The bill that I am presenting today includes the legislative component of complementary medicine reforms. While cutting a lot of regulatory red tape for industry, this bill will ensure that through a system of responsible regulation, the Australian public can be confident that the medicines they consume and the medical devices that they use are safe and of a high quality. In summary, the bill makes amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in three key respects. Firstly, it amends key definitions in the act.to provide greater clarity and certainty in relation to the application of the legislation. Secondly, it includes amendments which acknowledge the shift of focus from pre-market clearance to post-market vigilance for low-risk listable goods. Thirdly, the bill includes a new part in the act that establishes a statutory body-the existing Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee. The reforms provide a unique opportunity to achieve a cooperative approach to health care and provide assurances to the Australian public that the medicines they consume are safe and of a high quality. I commend the bill to the Committee and present an explanatory memorandum. supportive of the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, and I largely endorse the comments made by the minister.

230,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.38 A.m.),"As the government is aware, the opposition is4492 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 around the question of reform in respect to complementary medicines, this being the legislative component. The opposition has no problem with what has been proposed in the legislation. However, I want to go beyond that slightly and elaborate on some comments that the minister made. This industry is a very important industry in relation to the overall health care of Australians. Over 60 per cent of Australians are estimated to use complementary health care products at least once a year. The Australian complementary health care industry has an estimated turnover annually of over $1 billion and approximately 17,000 complementary health care products are on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. There are an estimated 6,000 complementary medical practitioners in Australia. As you can see from all that-and these are well-known statistics that have been quoted by a number of speakers on this industry in the past and no doubt will be into the future as it grows-it is an industry that does have a very important role to play with respect to health care in this country. A recent newsletter from the Complementary Healthcare Council of Australia, in talking about things that have to be done in the future, states: The second task is to amend the Therapeutic Goods Regulations to provide the detail on how the new proposals will be implemented. More than one set of changes to the regulations will be needed as different parts of the package are negotiated and agreed. Drafting instructions have been provided to CHC for consideration of the first round of changes. Another round will be necessary when the Advertising Code review is completed. The third and much larger task is to review the various Codes, Guidelines, Policy documents, Orders, etc. that make up the administrative and procedural instructions for regulation of our products. TGA have advised that the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code is to have the highest priority. Consultants are commencing work on this review immediately with a view to having it completed early in the second half of the year. What we are seeing here is a situation which, as far as this legislation goes, is fine. But such issues as the membership of the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee are not stipulated in the act; they go to the regulations. There have been undertakings given by the government to a range of groups and organisation in the industry, around the question of what that representation will be. I am confident the government will honour those sorts of commitments. Certainly that is something that needs to happen in the future, because for the CMEC to continue working well it needs to be broadly representative, along the lines of the way it has commenced operation. The opposition supports this legislation but will watch with interest as the other developments in reforms in this area occur. This industry is crucial to the overall provision of health care in Australia. As far as this bill goes, we are supportive of what the government has done, but we will be watching with interest any developments that occur in the future. I commend the bill to the House. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) 00.42 a.m.)-It is estimated that over half of all Australians use complementary medicines at least once a year. Complementary medicines include vitamins, minerals, and herbal, naturopathic and/or homoeopathic preparations with therapeutic properties-things like echinacea and even Berocca. The acceptance and use of complementary medicines is rapidly growing in Australia. It is estimated that there are approximately 17,000 complementary health care products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and approximately 6,000 complementary medicine Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4493 practitioners in Australia. Only through maintaining and promoting consumer confidence can growth occur in complementary medicines. The Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 contains reforms to promote confidence in the complementary medicine market. The credibility of the industry in the consumer's eyes is vital to maintain the high level of consumer confidence in complementary medicines. I believe the government and the industry have found a balance between improving market access and consumer confidence. Above all, the industry and the government are cooperating to ensure public health and safety. This bill makes a number of legislative and regulatory amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, including reforms for the complementary medicines industry. These reforms relate to market access and the regulatory environment and allowing for greater participation of experts in the industry in the regulation of complementary health care products. Measures in this bill are a result of consultations undertaken by a working party chaired by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Aged Care, Senator the Hon. Grant Tambling. The working party was composed of government, industry and consumer representatives. Over 30 peak body organisations were consulted and the key stakeholders have endorsed all of the amendments to the legislation. I will outline the key components of the bill. Firstly, there are amendments to definitions. The bill amends key definitions in the Therapeutic Goods Act so that it improves the interpretation between foods, complementary medicines and prescription medicines. It also allows for a more streamlined and efficient process of the listing of substances. It amends the Therapeutic Goods Act to emphasise post-market vigilance instead of pre-market clearance for listable items. That is helping business and cutting red tape by enabling sponsors of relatively low risk products to market such products without undue delay. It does this by providing a more streamlined and efficient process for the listing of substances on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Once the Therapeutics Goods Administration is satisfied that a substance is low risk, it may be eligible for listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. At present this requires changes to the regulation. This is cumbersome and time consuming for businesses. The amendments in this bill propose the use of a gazetting type of mechanism instead of the present regulatory change. Let me emphasise that this amendment does not mean that there will be marketing of less safe products and products whose therapeutic claims cannot be backed up. The bill reinforces the existing requirement that all sponsors must hold evidence to substantiate therapeutic claims made in the marketplace. The bill also establishes two non-statutory committees-the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee, which currently provides advice on complementary medicines to the Therapeutic Goods Administration on an administrative basis, and the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee, which is currently a committee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council-as statutory bodies. The establishment of the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee is an acknowledgment of the growing complementary medicine industry. There is a need for the government to have access to expertise in complementary medicines. By establishing the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee as a statutory body, it creates an opportunity for more expert, timely and relevant input into the evaluation of medicines. The scheduling of substances by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee has public health and commercial implications. The bill details the functions, government representation and decision making criteria of the committee. 4494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 The bill also describes offences and penalties relating to the publication of certain advertisements in mainstream print media. This amendment proposes to add a new part to the Therapeutic Goods Act that describes the offences and penalties where there is an advertisement in the mainstream media without pre-clearance. This bill ensures that the public can be confident that complementary medicines are safe, effective and high quality. This is an important bill. It is perhaps a reflection on the non-controversial nature of the bill that speeches on it have, by and large, been brief and without any acrimony. What the bill does is add to the priority areas for the government in health which include things like medical research-we have just had an excellent report from Dr Wills which recommends strategies for the government on ways to improve medical research and improve what we are doing there. Also, in the area of rural health the government has had a number of innovations relating to things like the selection of medical students, relating to exposure of medical students through the John Flynn scholarships while they are undergraduates, and also relating to keeping doctors in country areas when they are already there. This bill deals with an important area. It has been achieved with a lot of consultation and everyone is happy with it. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Legislation Amendment Bi1l1999. In my electorate of Gilmore, especially in the Kiama region, there are a number of alternative practitioners and general practitioners who suggest to patients the use of complementary medicines. Of course complementary medicines are an important part of Australia's health system. Complementary medicines are used by over 60 per cent of the Australian population and are used for a wide variety of purposes. Today complementary medicines are widely available from health foods stores, pharmacies and practitioners, of which there are many in my electorate. This legislation recognises both the widespread use and the demand by Australians for access to complementary medicines. The complementary medicines industry has been frustrated for a long time with the amount of red tape and hoops that manufacturers and suppliers have been put through. This bill is the first step in getting rid of some of those problems. One good example of improving the system is by streamlining the application process. The Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee is now going to be recognised in legislation and this will give the committee the status it deserves as an expert advisory committee. This committee will comprise some of the best and brightest practitioners and scientists in Australia who understand all about complementary medicines. This committee will also ensure that the health of the consumers will be maintained and that people who take complementary medicines can continue to have confidence in the products that they buy . . Another problem that the complementary medicine industry had was with its advertising controls. The reform package which is before us today includes a review of the advertising code. This will certainly assist the people in my electorate who have been demanding for some time that they are recognised for the advertising that they do. Whilst they may not be asking for PBS usage at this stage, that is one of the areas that they would like us to look at and I believe that this is one step forward in gaining that recognition for the alternative medicine practitioners. Industry, government and consumers are all working together to try to get this balance right.

Reform of complementary medicine regulation has involved considerable negotiation and hard work on the part of many groups and many individuals. I would like to particularly pay tribute to the Complementary Health Care Council and the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia for their commitment and contribution to this ongoing reform process. You may be interested to learn that since this reform process commenced back in December much has been achieved: the commencement of the review of the therapeutic goods advertising code; the appointment of a director of the Office of Complementary Medicines; a review of the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee; preliminary work on the establishment of the Complementary Health Care Consultative Committee; discussions initiated with industry on post-market vigilance; extensive work on the redevelopment of the electronic lodgement facility; development of new arrangements to enhance the listing of complementary medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; and the preparation of targeted information, including website development, to help explain what these reforms mean and how they will enhance the health choices of Australians. These reforms have been a long time in coming. With your help I believe that we are striking the right balance between the needs of industry and the interests of consumers.

The bill will amend the relevant evidentiary provisions in the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, and its effect will be to strengthen controls on the illegal import, export and possession of products that contain, or purport to contain, endangered animals or plants as component ingredients.

232,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (10.54 A.m.),"This legislation, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation4496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 species which are threatened with extinction or that may face extinction if such international trade is not controlled. It is often thought that the reason many animals are under threat of extinction is the loss of their natural habitat, as with the giant panda in China. However, the hunting and poaching of endangered animal species for use in the preparation of traditional Chinese or Asian medicines is a significant contributing factor in declining numbers. The tiger and the rhinoceros are well known to be used in traditional preparations in oriental countries like China, Japan and Korea, and they have recently found markets in the developed world. In eastern and southern Africa, the predominant medicine is traditional remedies, and the quantities of endangered animals and plant species required in making these medicines are increasing with the growing demand. It is easily understood that such demand on wild plant and rare animal populations leads to depletion and possible extinction. It is only in relatively recent times that the world community has realised the extent of the problem. The vast majority of medicinal animals and plants are collected from the wilderness areas. These species, which demand our protection, include the tiger, the rhinoceros, the musk deer and certain types of orchid. This legislation was made under the convention, which is the primary international instrument for the protection of such rare species and was ratified by Australia on 29 July 1976. The parties to the convention met in Harare, Zimbabwe in June 1997 for their 10th conference and acknowledged that the controlled use of wild species in traditional preparations was likely to threaten not only the survival of those precious species but also the continuation of important traditional indigenous medicinal practices. The parties at the conference decided on four points of consensus: firstly, to eliminate iIIegal use of endangered species as medicinal substances; secondly, to ensure that national laws control the use of these species; thirdly, to encourage the promotion of substitutes for threatened medicinal wildlife; and, fourthly, to consider artificial propagation and captive breeding programs. This legislation gives effect to Australia's obligations under the convention and is the legislative base for conservation types of controls on the export and import of wildlife and wildlife products. It could be said that the wide aim of this bill is to ensure that all trade in wildlife species is pursued in a sustainable way that is not contrary to the survival of the species or the ecosystems in which they occur. The parties to the convention were aware that all nations had to participate in the protection of the world's wildlife and that each nation had a vested interest in the survival of all animals. The decline in the number of tigers is telling. There were over 100,000 tigers at the beginning of this century, yet today it is estimated that fewer than 5,000 tigers remain in their natural state. The rhinoceros has seen a similar alarming decline, from 70,000 in the late 1960s to less than 12,000 today. In Australia, we are seeing a growth in the demand for traditional Eastern medicines as an alternative to Western medicine and many of those traditional preparations either contain or claim to contain endangered species as part of their constituents. And this is even so despite the fact that alternatives to the use of endangered species are now available. Between 1996 and 1998; there were over 3,000 seizures of traditional medicine product imports containing or derived from threatened species. Of these, over 500 were animal species, including several significant species on the highly endangered list such as tigers, bears and Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4497 rhinoceroses. These seizures reveal a huge problem in the illegal international trade in traditional medicines which contain derivatives of endangered animals, hence the urgent need for this important legislation. I was rather amazed to learn of the extent of the recourse to traditional medicine by Australians today. It would appear that the diverse communities from many other countries and who now call Australia home utilise traditional preparations as an important part of their health care regimes. In 1996, it was estimated that there were over 4,500 traditional medical practitioners in the eastern states of Australia alone who gave 2.8 million traditional medicine consultations each year. This represents an astonishing turnover of $85 million. And this trend is increasing. The practice of traditional medicine is seen more and more as a viable alternative to Western medicine. In 1993, a study estimated that Australians spent $621 million on alternative medicines in the years 1992 to 1993. I was alarmed to learn of the great variety of threatened species which have been used in traditional medicinal preparations that have been imported into Australia. In the years from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1998, the seizures of traditional medicine-; which contained endangered species included 182 seizures of tiger, 149 of deer, 25 of bl' r, four of rhinoceros, 61 of leopard, six of cobra, 31 of other snakes, 35 of turtle, 13 of tortol-e, six of antelope, four of elephant, four of reptiles, three of wolf, one of seal, one of mork.ey, one of baboon and one of macaque. There are also items which contain threatened species of plants. These include one seizure of hard coral, 2,590 seizures of ginseng root and three of other plants. Lion paws, zebra skins, elephant tail bracelets and monkey skulls were also seized by customs agents in 1998. There are even developing export markets for certain Australian animals. There are certain Australian animals like pipefish, leafy sea dragons and seahorses which, while they are not listed under the convention, are nonetheless covered by these regulations because of the significant threat to their survival. The internal organs of crocodiles bred in farms in Northern Australia arc prized for their medicinal properties and in an Australian Associated Press report of 11 November 1998, journalist Gil Beitkreutz heralded that crocodile penises may become· e Viagra of the East. I want to make it clear to those who work in the traditional medical sector that the government recognises that there is a vast and genuine demand for such products in Australia and it respects the rights of choice of all Australians in regard to their health and their well-being. The government also respects the vast wealth of knowledge and expertise offered by practitioners of traditional medicine and the significant contributions the sector has made to health in Australia and, indeed, throughout the world. However, it is internationally recognised that, as well as habitat loss, the greatest threat to the rapidly declining numbers of certain species is the demand for their use as constituents in traditional medicines. The hunting and poaching, especially of the tiger and rhinoceros, will continue while this demand remains. This legislation will work to eliminate such demand from Australian markets. There are now many effective alternatives to the use of these endangered animals in the preparation of alternative medicines. These alternatives have been recognised by the traditional medicine sector, so this will also lessen the demand. The promotion of these alternatives among the traditional medicine community is also being supported by our government. 4498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 It should also be noted that this legislation will catch those imports which may be imitations of an endangered species yet claim to include an authentic threatened species. This legislation removes the need to prove that the medicine includes endangered plants or animals, a requirement which in the past has meant that no-one has been prosecuted in the 16 years since the legislation was introduced originally. The government considers that even products which contain imitations of endangered species only serve to encourage market demand for those endangered species and that, in turn, encourages the illegal poaching and further threatens their survival. This government is determined to provide for the protection of the whole of the Australian environment and the world environment, especially those aspects that are a matter of national environmental significance, to promote ecologically sustainable development and to assist in the cooperative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities. This bill will be of profound interest to the wildlife protection community in Australia. I point out that the convention has proved to be a useful tool in the protection of wildlife and Australia is on the record as having a positive commitment to its implementation. I commend this bill to the House. Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] before us today strengthens the current legal provisions that implement obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 1973, otherwise known as the CITES convention. The convention seeks to ban international trade in en""dangered species. Australia embraced the convention and other measures regarding the export and import of wildlife and trade in wildlife products in the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 that was introduced by the Fraser government. The amending bill before the House seeks to strengthen the current protection of endangered wildlife by extending the prohibition on products that contain an endangered species by making it a criminal offence to claim that a product contains material from endangered species. Under this bill it will be illeEal to import, export or possess a product that claims to contain material from an endangered species. Why is this important? One-quarter of the world's population embrace traditional Chinese medicines. Beyond that, there are traditional medicines that come with long histories from parts of the world such as South Africa, India and China, and even our own bush medicine traditions of the indigenous Australians. The demand for traditional medicine is rising dramatically as Western industrialised countries, such as our own, have begun incorporating the alternative medicines into our lifestyles and as populations of communities which have historically relied on traditional medicines have steadily grown. The World Wide Fund for Nature has reported that the World Health Organisation estimates that up to 80 per cent of the world's population still rely on medicinal plants and animals for their primary health care needs. The WWF reports also that the herbal medicine business in the European Union alone accounts for $US4 billion of trade each year. In Australia the alternative health industry is now a billion dollar a year industry which 57 per cent of Australians have drawn upon in the past 12 months. I suppose I would include myself in that with the thankfully odourless garlic tablets that keep the lurgies that you get from Canberra at bay-at least I hope they do.",157,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.04 A.m.),"The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports andThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4499 In 1996, there was thought to be 4,500 traditional medicine practitioners in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland alone and 2.8 million traditional medicine consultations each year. We are not talking about a small area of activity; we are certainly not talking about a small area of interest. This is something that affects a vast number of Australians. In particular, traditional Chinese medicine has become very popular in this part of the world and in Western cultures. It is also estimated that imports of Chinese herbal medicine have increased 100 per cent annually since 1993. As I mentioned earlier, the growing healthy lifestyle emphasis, the interest in non-pharmaceutical health promotion products and dietary supplements contribute to there being approximately 1,500 Chinese medicine practitioners in Australia alone. Why the growth, Madam Deputy Speaker, in traditional medicines? There are a number of reasons for it. One is that we are interested in trying to put as few pharmaceuticals into our bodies as we can. The long histories that have supported the use of traditional medicines give us something to think about when we look at some of the pharmaceutical products that we tend to consider for our health needs. It is a fact that the list of threatened endangered flora and fauna is growing ever longer. Some aspects of traditional medicine are partly to blame for increasing the threat of extinction of endangered species, purely because of their popularity. Traditional medicine is not the only moti vation for poachers to kill endangered species but, sadly, it can be a significant contributing factor in many nations. How big is the problem of illegal trade in endangered species? From 1996 through to 1998, there were 3,000 seizures of traditional medicine products in Australia which contained or claimed to contain products derived from endangered species. While the vast majority were plant species such as ginseng, cactus, orchids and I think it is cycads-but someone can correct me if I am wrong there-more than 500 were animal species including some of the world's most endangered or threatened animals such as tigers, bears, rhinoceroses, leopards and turtles, as my colleague the member for Hughes, Mrs Vale, mentioned earlier. However, there have been no prosecutions under the wildlife protection act that involved illegally imported traditional medicine products containing material from endangered species. Why we have had that vast number of seizures but no prosecutions is the reason that we are discussing this bill today. The major impediment to a successful prosecution is that current forensic technology is unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that traditional medicines contain material from endangered species as claimed on their packaging. DNA testing cannot identify a specific species once material from that species has been combined, co-mingled, heated and treated at high temperatures to produce the product. It is interesting to think of the US President and the use of DNA technology with some of the recent events surrounding his situation. We have that level of expertise yet when it comes to seeing what is actually combined to produce a so-called traditional medical product, we are not able to identify the component parts. Other jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, where legislation has been introduced that reflects the evidentiary provisions of the bill we are discussing today, have recorded greater success with prosecutions and that is why we are hoping to go that way ourselves. How will this legislation help? Growth in traditional medicines and species survival are on a collision course. The greater the popularity of traditional medicines that draw from 4500 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 endangered species, the greater the threat to those endangered species. Nobody wants to see these species wiped out, certainly not traditional medical practitioners or their patients. I would like to compliment the traditional medical practitioners who have worked very coopeqtively with the government to produce this bill, recognising that they have a shared interest and responsibility in what we are discussing today. However, species will be lost unless we can reduce the demand for products from endangered species. Reducing demand for these products is a worldwide responsibility, and the changes outlined in this bill will ensure that Australia will continue to meet its responsibilities under the CITES convention. Similar legislation is being implemented in other countries that are also parties to the CITES convention. It acknowledges that merely representing a product as being sourced from an endangered species adds to the demand for poaching that species, and therefore the vulnerability of that species. In addition to this legislation the federal government will be conducting an education campaign to complement the new arrangements. Again, I would like to acknowledge the help of those working in this industry who have contributed to that campaign and who will be helping with its implementation. The government is currently preparing a comprehensive booklet which outlines the CITES convention framework and our own legislation. This booklet will be distributed widely amongst the traditional medicine community. It is not as if we, as a nation, are only looking to others elsewhere to play a role in the traditional medicine field in protecting endangered flora and fauna. I would like to acknowledge the fact that a number of our indigenous communities here have in recent times revised some of their hunting practices and their use of our natural flora to help prevent the extinction of various species. Those species are under threat through no fault of the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people are playing an important role domestically by making sure that what we are talking about today is not an area that we think others only have responsibility for; it is an area that we are also addressing on our home soil. I will have much pleasure in representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage at the second symposium on traditional medicines and endangered species at RMIT in Melbourne on the weekend. who are at the symposium where this bill we are debating today will be of great interest to everybody. At the first symposium held in Sydney in August 1997, a number of speakers addressed the issue of alternatives to endangered species and the need for better communication between traditional medicine practitioners and patients, and those concerned with protecting endangered species. This symposium brings together those interests and that is why it is something that I am more than happy to support. This legislation and other efforts by the government seek to address these issues. We are playing our role as well. Alternatives to endangered species are being canvassed consistently. For example, cultivating alternative sources of the same species is part of the harvesting strategy that many of those involved in the traditional medicine industry are looking at. Also, finding completely different species that have those quintessential characteristics, some of which my colleague the member for Hughes discussed, is also part of the solution. Those different species, not under threat in many cases, are believed to be able to provide the same health benefits. We ought to encourage the investigation and identification of those alternatives.",160,Representatives Main Committee

235,Mr Bills On,"It is very kind of you to say that. I hope that is the reaction of the crowdThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4501 As an example, the Chinese government is currently encouraging the cultivation of medicinal plants as a harvesting exercise and already there are 33,000 hectares under production. Even developing countries are playing an important role. Also, substitutes that have been identified include buffalo hom for the rhinoceros horn, and pig bone instead of tiger bone. The government looks forward to working with traditional medicine practitioners and patients to find alternatives to endangered species that are in medicines, or said to be in medicines, and to find innovative ways to take the pressure off our endangered species. This is a good day for everybody. This is a win-win proposition. It is good for those concerned about endangered species, it recognises the importance of traditional medicines and alternative medicines, and it embraces the work all of us are doing to try and make sure we have the benefits of those long-established, traditional medicine strategies, as well as looking after endangered flora and fauna. I commend the bill to the committee. Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] amends the principal act to strengthen its ability to control the illegal export, import and possession of materials containing certain endangered species among their ingredients. The need for this has come about because of the difficulties that have been entailed in trying to use the provisions of the original act with regard to, especially, traditional East Asian medicines. This debate is timely, in that the previous piece of legislation before the Main Committee-to do with amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act-acknowledges that traditional medical practices, no matter what their origin, are beginning to be something that people are turning to. A briefing paper prepared by the research departments of the House of Commons, entitled 'Endangered Species: CITES, tigers and ivory', research paper 97/45 dated 4 April 1997 from the House of Commons Library, says in part: Over one fifth of the World's population (over one billion people) depend on TCM in varying degrees for their health care, and the development of both western and traditional medicine is required in law by the People's Republic of China. Indeed, the WHOthe World Health Organisationencourages up to 80% of the world's population to rely on traditional medicines. TCM is gaining credibility in the West; the number ofTCM clinics in the UK have trebled to quadrupled in the last three years. I think that if we studied the situation here in Australia we would see a similar picture emerging. Certainly we must not dismiss either those that wish to practise traditional medicine or those that wish to partake of such medicines. Nevertheless, amending legislation is required because it is important that we undertake our international obligations to ensure that endangered species are protected from whatever threat and pressure is placed on them. The way in which the public perceives the impact of traditional medicine on endangered species may have been clouded by a number of notorious examples, one of which was outlined in the National Geographic of January 1996. This example, the use of Asiatic black bears in Chinese medicine, is something that was picked up by the popular media in Australia. The black bear was having its bile milked so as to provide a dried bile which was believed under traditional practices to alleviate liver diseases, and there was a very large market in such places as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The process was carried out by way of the use of bear farms. It is interesting that throughout this debate there is some question about whether we should be allowing the use of endangered species under controlled circumstances. That gets",162,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (11.15 A.m.),"The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and4502 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 back to the point that is often made in debates of this nature-that we should be looking at the sustainable use of any species. The other aspect we have to be aware of is the question of appropriate labelling that arises with traditional medicines. This piece of legislation simply says that, if material purports to contain something originating from an endangered species, that is enough to ,ban its import, export or possession. I think that is fair enough, because difficulties have arisen in trying to do the appropriate testing which would allow this piece of legislation to be used in the courts. In a similar debate in 1995 on an amendment to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 people raised the use of DNA testing-especially, I think, in the case of the importation of endangered birds-,which would enable a proper tagging process to enable recognition of what the particular species was. But, as has been stated in this debate, one of the real problems in the preparation of the types of medicine this amendment will cover is that that type of DNA testing is not possible because of heat treatment and other treatments. The way in which practitioners of traditional medicine, especially in East Asia, are trying to ensure that their practices can be acceptable to the wider international community is by looking at how they can substitute other species, for instance water buffalo horn instead of rhinoceros hom. Other, similar suggestions have been made. This indicates that traditional medical practitioners wish to do the right thing. I think they should be given every assistance to enable them to do that. It is interesting that in Asian countries there is a debate similar to the one in Australia about the relative way in which Western medicine and traditional medicine can be used together. I think there is ample evidence that there is a symbiotic relationship between the use of the two styles of medicine. For instance, in a recent discussion that I was able to have with officials from the department of health of the Republic of China-Taiwan-they indicated that one of the difficulties they had in being able to put traditional medicines on their list of available drugs was that they could only list the already prepared medicines, because at least there they could have some guarantee of consistency in what was contained within the preparation. In the more traditional method, where somebody attends a traditional medical practitioner and has something specifically put together for them, those drugs cannot be put on their list because they cannot guarantee the content of the preparation. It is interesting that even in those Asian countries people are trying to come to grips with ways of ensuring the availability of traditional medicine at the same time as ensuring that there is some form of standard. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned traditional practices of our indigenous people. That is of interest to me, because at the moment I am a supplementary member to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for the conduct of their inquiry into indigenous health. member who unfairly interjects had some say in making sure that that inquiry was instigated. Throughout the course of that inquiry one of the things that has impressed the committee is that where Aboriginal communities are able to encourage their members to continue their traditional practices there is a fair degree of evidence that it has produced a very positive health outcome.",163,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Slipper,"A very important inquiry, that one.",164,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Jenkins,"It is a very important inquiry, and I acknowledge that the honourableThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4503 I accept what the honourable member for Dunkley said, that in getting the balance by allowing our indigenous people to carry out their practices we are able to educate them on any concerns there might be about the way it may be done in a sustainable manner. Given that indigenous culture and indigenous practice have supported indigenous people in being able to carry out their lifestyles in a sustainable way, I do not think that is a great problem, but it would be a great problem if others saw the wisdom in some of those traditional practices and introduced them to the wider public. This is a fairly straightforward and simple amendment that is being made, but it is important because it builds on the actions that successive Australian governments have taken under their international obligations about endangered species. It ensures that we are able to look at the way in which we do that and ensures that it can be policed and that the spirit of the law is able to be ensured through action reports in other places. In conclusion, I wish to highlight one element which has been highlighted earlier in debate not only in this place but also in the other place. There is some concern that these provisions relate only to those species that are actually listed. Some of the examples that appear to be developing in an Australian context actually involve some species that are not listed, and I think that perhaps there is some need for us to look domestically beyond just our international obligations-to look at other things. For instance, an example is cited in an article originating out of the Courier-Mail of August last year, which talks about members of the pipefish family, which includes seahorses, caught as a by-product of trawling by prawn trawlers, that are in some way used for medicinal purposes. One of the concerns is that, whilst some of those species are not listed species, they have some pressures upon them, and if they were to further develop as a popular medical relief they would very quickly become endangered. With that very minor criticism, I indicate my full support for what the government is intending to do with regard to our obligations about endangered species. I also look forward to developing debate about the way in which we can ensure that traditional medicines, from whatever origin, can be accommodated in the way in which we make them available as an alternative for people who believe that there is some remedy from those types of medicines. (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] on behalf of an electorate where people care deeply about environmental and conservation issues and which is home to a large number of activists in these increasingly important areas. I think that Australians everywhere would be delighted with this legislation. Under the wildlife protection act, Australia currently bans the importation, and in some cases possession, of products containing endangered species. Despite the fact that there are products in this country containing such contraband, no prosecutions have been possible because the law puts the onus on the prosecutors to comprehensively prove the existence of substances from protected species. It is an expensive and inefficient process to forensically scrutinise these products, and detection has so far proven to be difficult. This amendment means that a claim on a label is proof enough-that is, if a claim is made, the law holds that claim to be true. This is an important change to procedure; one that seeks to further protect several animal species whose very survival has been placed at risk by the greed of mankind. Importantly, it is also about affording some protection to the many herbalists, alternative medicine and exotic food importers which operate in my electorategood, decent, small businesses.",164,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (11.28 A.m.),"I rise in support of the Wildlife Protection4504 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Floraof the importance of this legislation, I would like to refer to one particular animal, an animal we have all known and loved from childhood: the tiger. Often depicted as a cuddly toy, a cartoon, a nursery rhyme character or even a mascot of a football team, the tiger becomes, in a child's mind, an object of affection. In reality, they are not the warm and fuzzy beasts as portrayed to children. They are powerful, majestic felines at the very top of the food chain. It is believed that tigers evolved over one million years ago in what we know today as southern China. Their search for territory and prey took them to eastern Russia, to Indonesia, to the subcontinent, to Turkey and around the Caspian Sea. It has been estimated that at the tum of this century there were over 100,000 of these magnificent beasts. Today, estimates put the earth's tiger population at 7,500 at best, but probably closer to 5,000. Caspian Sea tigers were extinct by the 1950s and the tiger populations of Bali and Java have also gone. In south China there are as few as 20 to 30 tigers in the wild, and those in Chinese zoos are the descendants of the same six tigers. Not surprisingly, the rate of reproduction there is limited. Given the illusive and secretive nature of the tiger, it is nearly impossible to gauge accurately the numbers that survive. India has the largest population of tigers, probably somewhere between 3,000 and 4,500. The tiger has struggled for survival as human settlement has expanded. Forests and jungles have disappeared, rivers have been dammed, industry has grown. The difficulties in providing and maintaining suitable reserves, sanctuaries for the tigers, have often proven disastrous for these animals. While it is illegal to hunt tigers, that has not stopped poachers from doing so. Unlike the. American buffalo which was hunted for food by America's indigenous tribes, the tiger is killed so its parts can be used in traditional Chinese medicines. While this has always been the case, with the standards of living rising in Asia and the emigration of many from that part of the world to Western countries, the use of these medicines has risen markedly. By way of illustration, we can compare the expenditure of Australians on these treatments with our expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We spend approximately $3 billion on the PBS and a staggering $1 billion on alternatives. This is not to suggest 'that Australia is a huge haven for products containing illegally hunted animals, but merely to suggest that sales of alternative medicines have experienced enormous growth. In Hong Kong, China, Japan and South Korea, where there are long-held beliefs about the powers and supposed powers of these products, sales are astronomical. In large markets such as the United States and Great Britain, sales are also sizeable. Huge volumes of tiger products, in the form of wine, powders and pills, are imported and sold in Japan, the US and the UK, despite the protections offered by legislative bans against importation and sale. In countries where the law has changed in a similar fashion to what we are proposing here today, such as in the USA and in Europe, successful prosecutions have increased. In the USA, the World Wildlife Fund has noticed an increased public awareness of threats to tigers and a reduction of market availability of tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine. They attribute this to the outreach and education campaign that was targeted at San Francisco. The Bay area is home to many Asian immigrants and the users of traditional Chinese medicines. Last year the World Wildlife Fund worked with the American College of Chinese Medicine on a pilot program to implement steps for reducing demand for tiger based products. Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4505 In February, at the end of the lunar year, these organisations held an award ceremony in San Francisco's Chinatown to honour key players in the Year of the Tiger conservation efforts. Likewise, I am happy that this government is making the local industry more aware of the dangers. Through involvement in symposiums in various cities, we are also educating the industry about the role it can play in conservation of threatened species. I note that there is such a symposium happening this weekend in Melbourne at RMIT. I wish the government's representative, the member for Dunkley, all the best at that symposium. I trust that he will be well received and the symposium itself will make landmark breakthroughs in its education campaign in Australian society. I believe that an education campaign can be an effective measure, given that it is the very claim on the label that is ensuring rapid sale, and the demand is driving poachers to even greater feats of ruthlessness. It should be a matter of great sadness and human disgrace that the greater the threat to the survival of the species, the greater the demand for its body parts. By the estimate of the Zoological Society of London, Japan imported 1,900 kilograms of tiger bones from Taiwan. That is equivalent to between 400 and 500 tigers in one year, perhaps nearly 10 per cent of the world's tiger population. Japan is by no means the largest market for tiger products. That dubious honour belongs to Hong Kong, which accounts for around 50 per cent of the market. The poor tiger suffers the indignity of its bones being ground down for inclusion in various potions and powders supposedly to benefit the sufferers of rheumatism or paralysis. Its whiskers are plucked to cure toothache; its tail is used for the treatment of skin disease; its brain proffered as a cure to laziness and pimples, and its eyeballs for epilepsy. The dead tiger, it seems, is looked upon as a veritable cure-all. Tiger claws are claimed to help with insomnia; its teeth to fight fever; its fat to treat leprosy; its nose leather to soothe bites; its bile to help children with meningitis; its dung to treat haemorrhoids, boils and alcoholism; and its penis to help our virility. Now that Viagra has come along and been approved for sale in many countries, perhaps the demand for endangered species like the tiger, the seahorse and the rhinoceros will ease somewhat. The rhinoceros is also as sad a case as the tiger. Only 14,000 now survive because of a huge illegal trade in rhino horns. Their declining numbers are the result of large-scale destruction of habitat, especially by deforestation, ruthless hunting and the rise of illegal trade in rhinoceros products. The black rhinoceros has suffered most. There are now about 3,000 black rhinos in Africa, compared with 65,000 to 100,000 that roamed that continent just 30 years ago. In conclusion, I recently saw a film which best depicts the often ruthless relationship between mankind and our endangered species. 'Tell me what the drums are saying,' says one of the characters in the movie. The reply comes, 'They always say the same: white hunterblack heart.' Dr WASHER (Moore) (11.38 a.m.)-I lend my wholehearted support to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]. In doing so I would like to congratulate the Howard government, in particular Senator Robert Hill, on the formation of major legislation due to be debated in the House, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]. This will make quite a substantive change to the way in which the Commonwealth has the power to protect our environment and, along 4506 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 with the amendment we are discussing here today, will ensure Australia meets its responsibility and maintains its reputation as a world leader in environmental conservation. In the three years this government have been in power, their leadership on environmental policy has been impressive, in particular the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust, the largest environmental rescue package ever to be undertaken in tqis country. It is now making a tangible difference around Australia with projects covering the broad spectrum of environmental restoration and conservation. As my electorate is bordered by the Indian Ocean, the government's oceans policy has generated a lot of keen interest and, once again, demonstrates Australia's leadership in marine and coastal protection. The policy will put our nation in a strong position when dealing with the raft of issues confronting the long-term future of our oceans. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] seeks to tighten Australia's stance on buying and selling medical products that contain endangered animals and plants in their ingredients. The amendments will see tough penalties enforced on the retailers or exporters who use these products. This amendment bill also makes it a criminal offence to import, export or possess a product that is 'represented' to contain material from an endangered species. This is to prevent producers of traditional medicine who cannot afford the endangered product-or it is unattainable-from still listing it as an ingredient for marketing purposes or just as a plain con. This amendment enables Australia to further meet its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 1973. Australia has been an active participant in the application of this convention. The amendment also brings us up to speed with the United States and the European Union, both of whom have implemented similar laws. I believe all Australians support the protection of endangered animals and plants both here and abroad. As we witnessed the extinction of hundreds of species over the last century, it is no longer a question of whether or not we should protect what is remaining, but how we protect it. Species like the black rhinoceros, as we have heard, have all but disappeared, with 95 per cent of its population being hunted between 1970 and 1993 for Chinese medicine.""As with the tiger, Chinese medicine has proved to be a greater threat than the loss of habitat. Although animals make up only a small part of alternative medicine and Chinese medicine, this is an industry that is indeed growing. In fact, Chinese medicine is used by one-quarter of the world's population. In China, it is an industry worth more than $2 billion each year and Chinese medicine requires about 1.6 million tonnes of ingredients each year. As a trend for many Australians seeking alternatives to Western medicine grows, it is an industry that will no doubt flourish in this country as well. As we all know, Chinese medicine has been practised for thousands of years, and I want to make it clear that, even though I have practised Western medicine for 26 years, I am in no way denigrating this alternative by supporting the bill. In fact, Western medicine has adopted many treatments from Chinese medicine. For example, the drug ephedrine, which was used in the treatment of asthma, is extracted from a plant that Chinese medicine practitioners have been using for centuries. Western doctors have now hailed an ingredient extracted from daisies for over 1,500 years in Chinese medicine as a treatment for malaria. I am pleased to see that practitioners in Chinese medicine in Australia have supported the measures outlined in this bill, and they are keen to produce alternatives for their patients. The· President of the New South Wales Association of Chinese Medicine, Yifan Yang, agrees that Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4507 there are alternatives to treatments that traditionally used endangered animals as ingredientS. It was encouraging to see that for back pain he prescribed physiotherapy rather than tiger extract and buffalo hom, and panadol rather than rhino hom to control fever. Perhaps the Chinese medicine industry could also substitute the traditional aphrodisiac, deer hom, with a modem aphrodisiac, Viagra, as mentioned formerly. The former has to be farmed to prevent extinction because of this treatment, while the latter is readily available, endangers no animal, and is probably a lot cheaper. The problem we face globally, however, is that many practitioners of Chinese medicine outside Australia do not believe that substitutes for traditional ingredients work. They also believe that farm species are not as effective as those animals and plants found in the wild. This is a belief that is also' supported by their patients, and products with ingredients from the wild attract a far higher price tag than those which have been farmed. Ingredients which have been cultivated rather than collected from the wild only make up 20 per cent of the Chinese medicine market. Of course, a fundamental problem we have in changing the ways of traditional practitioners in China, Korea and Japan is that many acknowledge some species are in danger of becoming extinct, but believe saving the lives of humans is more important. This bill is indeed a step in the right direction, but I hope Australia and other like-minded countries continue a dialogue with China, Korea and Japan against the use of endangered species in Chinese medicine. I understand there are cultural sensitivities and genuine reasons against using farmed ingredients, in particular some plants and animals which simply do not grow or reproduce in captivity. However, there is a need for a more effective deterrent when it comes to saving the last of these species. . We should also be careful that the alternatives do not create further harm. Who could forget the heart-wrenching stories of bear farming in China where thousands of bears are kept in tiny cages with a permanent tube inserted into their gall bladders which constantly collects bile used in Chinese medicine. Furthermore, some of the species that have been put up as alternatives to endangered species have themselves become endangered for the same reasons. For us to be successful, we need to focus on education and not confrontation. We need to appeal to the Chinese medicine industry to consider the long-term viability of their practices. If they understand that, when these species become extinct they will no longer have that ingredient to use, hopefully they will begin to seek alternatives. News on this front is not all doom and gloom. The trade monitoring program arm of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which is known as TRAFFIC, has met with representatives from the Chinese medicine profession in Asia and has had ongoing dialogue since 1995. In 1997 China signed a formal resolution drawn up by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which recognises that the use of endangered species in Chinese medicines threatens their survival. It is now up to countries such as China to make a concerted effort with both the practitioners in .their countries as well as the consumers to put an end to the medical products that contain endangered species. I congratulate TRAFFIC's approach to this issue which appears to be making a difference, albeit slowly. It is a particularly emotional subject for many people, and justifiably so, but this often leads to protests and confrontation that in particular cultures do more harm than good. Basically, since the opium wars, China has not much cared for being told what to do by the Western world. This is not a black and white issue. The World Wide Fund for Nature obviously recognises this and deals with this issue appropriately. 4508 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 I welcome the move to legislate that ingredients listed on the labels of Chinese medicine will be proof enough for successful prosecution if the product contains endangered plants or animals. Previously we had to rely, as you heard before, on DNA testing of the ingredients to establish proof and this can be inconclusive and costly. Perhaps it will also make producers of Chinese medicine who pretend to have endangered species in their ingredients think twice before they list them on the label, as this alone will""lead to prosecution. Prosecution of offences outlined in this bill will be extremely important. There is no point in legislating against endangered species in Chinese medicine if we cannot police it. If you will excuse the pun, Australia does not want to be seen as a toothless tiger. A similar move to use the ingredients listed on the pack was made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration some 10 years go and I understand this has made a marked improvement on the number of successful prosecutions. I commend this bill to the Main Committee and hope that it is part of a continuing push to see that those plants and animals on the verge of extinction are no longer hunted or collected from the wild for any purpose. reply-In concluding the debate on this Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] in the Main Committee, I would like to thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate. It is a significant piece of legislation and a very important one. There was one issue evidently raised in the debate today that I would like to respond to on behalf of the government. That was that the amendment only covers CITES listed animals and that this is of concern for some non-CITES listed animals, for example, pipefish and seahorses. The response is that, if a species is not listed under CITES, generally speaking that is because it is not currently under threat or potential threat from trade. It would not be appropriate to extend the effect of this amendment to individual non-CITES listed species as there is a recognised process under CITES for adding new species to those appendices as the need arises. The government is currently considering whether to nominate seahorses for CITES listing. For Australian native animals which are not CITES listed, Australia has some of the strictest protective controls in the world. As a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, Australia has obligations to control trade in species that are in danger of extinction. Australia's implementing legislation is the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. It is internationally recognised that one of the greatest threats to the rapidly declining numbers of endangered species, particularly the tiger and rhinoceros, is poaching for traditional medicines. Therefore, the conservation of endangered species depends largely on the strength of trade laws and the capacity to enforce those laws within and among trading nations. At the most recent conference of member countries to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora held in 1997, parties resolved to ensure that, in accordance with resolution 9.6 passed at the previous conference in 1995, their national legislation effectively controls trade in traditional medicines purporting to contain endangered species as well as those actually containing them. Resolution 9.6 stipulates that goods that are represented to be a part of or to contain endangered species, for example by their labelling or packaging, should be treated as containing those species. As the legislation currently stands, for a prosecution to be successful it must be proven conclusively that a product actually",165,Representatives Main Committee

This is not workable as current technologies cannot identify beyond reasonable doubt individual species within a mixture.

It also shows yet again that the government is taking firm action to protect endangered species. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. matters referred to it, I propose the question: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Victorian Parliament: Leader of the Opposition political events in my home state of Victoria. As members would be aware, John Brumby, who was the leader of the Victorian Parliamentary Labor Party, resigned just a few days ago and was replaced by the then shadow Treasurer, Steve Bracks. This was after a period of considerable media speculation about Mr Brumby' s future which resulted in a situation where Mr Brumby decided that under the circumstances it was best to fall on his sword. I do not want to go through the details of this issue but I have a couple of things to say on that point. I think John Brumby deserves to be congratulated for the way he handled himself over this matter. Members would know it is a very difficult time in the career of any politician, particularly a leader, when they are faced with these sorts of situations. It is something that we may all have to face some time. I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate John Brumby on what he has done over the last five or six years in terms of endeavouring to take the fight up to Jeff Kennett and the Liberal Party in the Victorian government. It is a thankless task being an opposition leader. Particularly, I would have to say that, in the current political situation in Australia, probably the most thankless task is that of the opposition leader in Victoria. That is for several reasons. The reason that is often quoted is the Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett's political mastery of the whole situation. At least that is the way the media portrays it. Part of what any opposition leader in Victoria currently has to deal with is the nature of the media's almost Oscar style adulation of the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. It was not always so, but it certainly has been that way for some years now. That does make it difficult for an opposition to get points across about problems and issues in the operation of a government. One other issue that I think ought to be focused on is the actual operation of the Victorian parliament. For example, members may not be aware that question time in the Victorian parliament, as I understand it, normally goes for something like 30 to 40 minutes.",170,Representatives Main Committee

The member for Griffith, Mr Rudd, interjects, calling it 'gracious' -in a sarcastic fashion, I take it-and I think that is quite correct. The circumstances are that scrutiny from an opposition within the context of the Victorian lower house is not something that is widely available or freely allowed to be utilised. The situation in the upper house in the Victorian parliament is different from that in our Senate. In the Senate, depending on which side of the chamber you are on, people either praise it or deride the issue being considered. However, in the Senate there is no party with a majority and so the government of the day has to deal with the Senate on the issues that it wishes to proceed with. In the Victorian upper house there are 44 members of which there are 10 from the Labor Party and 34 from the coalition. Therefore, controlling the debate and using the upper house as a house of review in Victoria is not an operative situation. In fact, the Labor Party has only ever had control of the Victorian upper house for a period of several months at the time of the 1985 state election when a member's position was being questioned in the courts. For that very short period of time, Labor had a majority. Other than at that time the Labor Party has not had an opportunity to effectively utilise the upper house, .even when it was in government for the 10 years from 1982 to 1992. This situation exists despite the fact that at the last election Labor, on a two-party preferred basis, got around 47 per cent of the vote. It was nowhere near half, in the context of democracy in this country, but certainly it was a lot better than 10 out of 44 seats in the upper house would suggest. All of those institutional and operational issues come to mind when you see a government of the nature of Jeff Kennett's running roughshod over the concerns of ordinary Victorians. All of those issues are things which ought to be taken into account by the media and by commentators in Victoria when they look to ensure that there is a proper analysis of what the Kennett government does. If we face an election later this year, that analysis has to occur. (Time expired) Monks, Mr Tom National Youth Round Table Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (11.57 a.m.)-In the adjournment debate today I wish to remark upon an individual deserving of attention. At a time when it seems all we read and hear about our young people are the problems facing Australia's youth and their apparent inability to deal with the challenges society presents, it was an inspiration to me to learn about the achievements of a young constituent of mine, Tom Monks, a 24-year-old from the beach suburb of Cottesloe. . With Tom, good news makes good reading. He is a double amputee, both legs from below the knees. He migrated to Australia from Thailand when he was just four years old, and he has a passion to help the young people of Australia. In conversation with Tom he quickly points out that to him his disability does not make him unique in any way. In fact, he never mentions it. He is a master in the art of positive thinking, he is the original optimist, and he endeavours to live life to the full through his studies and his work, particularly his work with young",171,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Griffin,"It is not a long time and it is not a situation where a lot of questions canThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4511 people, and his self-run business in the field of youth training. He runs a business at the age of 24. It would probably embarrass Tom to hear this, but his energy and his enthusiasm would put many people in the shade. It was refreshing to see Tom make the front page of many newspapers for his achievements in helping people, rather than hear the negative stories that often seem to have a lock on many page 1 splashes. Tom feels it is his duty to help many young people in Western Australia, many of whom I might add have had opportunities and advantages that he has not. Tom currently studies economics and education at Murdoch University and was a delegate to the National Youth Round Table in March that was held here in Canberra. He was selected for the round table due to his communication skills and his role as an advocate and mentor for other people in similar situations. As the committee will know, the National Youth Round Table was an initiative of the federal government. It was made up of a wide range of young people aged between 15 and 24, including those who have overcome barriers such as disabilities, homelessness and unemployment. It included indigenous Australians and representatives from both rural and metropolitan areas. Topics including education, health, employment, Aboriginal reconciliation and the preamble were all discussed at the round table. At that conference the representatives were split up into working groups of about seven to 11 people who then tackled a particular issue. Tom was part of the group concerned with educational issues. This is a field of particular interest to Tom as it straddles two of his interest areas-youth training and teaching. Tom and his group came up with ideas on aspects of education such as educational programs in the juvenile prison system, the youth allowance and up-front university fees. Tom tells me that he is now keeping in contact with his working group, made up of young Australians from all over the country, to act on the proposals made at the round table. I certainly look forward to working closely with· Tom to achieve these aims, which represent a path forward for the youth of Australia. By the time he attends the next round table, which is scheduled to take place in Canberra in September, he will have made significant headway with his group on these education issues. For Tom, the round table provided a unique opportunity for communicating his valued and considered opinions, which were heard by the appropriate senior government ministers. In fact, an article which appeared on 24 March in the local newspaper in my electorate of Curtin, the News Chronicle, attests to Tom's dogged desire to get his views on the future of Australia's youth across to the legislators. Apparently, when the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs was fielding questions from the participants, he made special note of Tom's persistence and zeal by commenting jocularly, when asked a question by Tom, 'Not you again?' Tom certainly took that as a mark of respect and a recognition of his contribution. But the clearest impression that Tom conveys is one that he does not even mention in words. It is clear that, whatever Tom's circumstances were, he would be the same remarkable individual that he is. Like Tom, I feel it is vital that today's youth are able to communicate directly with the federal government about issues of concern to them, including employment, education, health, drugs and youth suicide. Tom told me when he came to see me in the electorate that the round table was a great experience for all concerned. I further that by saying that the work of people 4512 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 like Tom is great for all the youth of Australia, and I commend further the federal government and the minister for education for the vision of creating opportunities for youth to speak out on issues of concern to them at the National Youth Round Table. Centrelink problems experienced not just in my electorate of Griffith but in electorates right across the nation. These relate to one of the more distressing experiences that you can have as a federal member of parliament: dealing with the concerns and the complaints and the anxieties of individual citizens who have not been able to properly access their payments through Centrelink. This problem is not peculiar to the suburbs of Brisbane. It is one which, based on the reflections of my colleagues, is experienced right across the country. When we talk about the clients and customers of Centrelink, we are talking about people who are in severe, substantial financial difficulty. Therefore, our responsibility as members to represent their interests is particularly acute, over and above most of the other things which the community expects of us, because the very ability of these people to survive week to week rests on their ability to receive payments and, if there is an interruption or difficulty in receiving those payments, our ability as members of parliament to discharge our responsibilities by intervening on their behalf as their court of last recourse. I fear that what we are seeing across the country, in terms of the functions of Centrelink, is part and parcel of a broader scheme of withdrawal of government services. If we look specifically at the funding which has been directed to Centrelink, it is clear that in the period of this government we have seen, in effect, comparing like with like, a 10 per cent reduction in the funding allocated to Centrelink. We have seen a 21 per cent reduction in the funding to national office, a 13 per cent reduction of funding to area offices and a 12 per cent reduction of funding to the coalface, the people responsible for delivering Centrelink services to their clients and customers, people in need of income support. In terms of staff numbers, some 2,100 staff have been taken out of Centrelink nationally already, 2,700 are being removed in the course of 1998-99 and a further 2,300 are to be removed over the following two to three years. The problem, based on these facts alone, will only be exacerbated. What of the impact on staff? Staff who are responsible for Centrelink offices across the country are dealing with customers in considerable distress. The level of customer aggression being faced by Centrelink staff has gone up manyfold. The most recent report on this matter indicates that there has been a 160 per cent increase in the last quarter in the number of incidents of customer aggression reported, up from 302 incidents in the previous quarter to 792 incidents in the most recently reported quarter. It follows that, when individual clients of Centrelink cannot obtain the payments they need to feed the kids, they are going to become angry, aggressive and stroppy. I have complete sympathy for the staff of Centrelink offices who are required, with diminishing resources, to handle the human tragedy which confronts them across the desk, across the counter, each day. I look at my own constituency of Griffith: we are serviced by three Centrelink offices-one at Wynnum-Manly, one at Mount Gravatt and another at Stones Comer. In those offices alone we have seen a reduction of 13 staff at Stones Comer, 17 at Mount Gravatt and five scheduled to go from the Centrelink office at Wynnum. In passing, I note that the Centrelink office at Stones Comer has, however, been able to manage to secure funding of $480,000 to refurbish",172,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (12.02 P.m.),"I rise in the adjournment debate today to talk aboutThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4513 its office. You do not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that for $480,000 you could actually be employing an additional 10 Centrelink staff on the average of about $50,000 per professional employee. Yet the priorities seem to have been taken in the completely wrong direction as far as that office is concerned. So much for the staff. But the critical point which distresses me is the increasing number of calls to my electorate office by people in genuine distress, people who have committed no error but who cannot obtain payments or, worse, who have become victims of the overpayment scandal which this government has presided over in recent months. In January Centrelink nationally confessed to the fact that there had been 37,000 overpayments by accident. I had in my office yesterday a student who was in tears because she has to repay suddenly $600 which she had inadvertently been overpaid. I have also had a case of another constituent who has come to me because it has been quoted to her that there has been a 'fat fingering processing error' in one of the offices, resulting in a huge overpayment. (Time expired) Beninca, Mr Jonathan from my electorate. It is a story of individual tragedy, yet it is also a story of a village community and how they have responded to that tragedy. During the early hours of Saturday, 16 January this year one of my young constituents from Bundeena, Jonathan Beninca, who was aged 19 and had completed his HSC only last year, was involved in a horrendous accident with a train near Cronulla railway station. The little township of Bundeena is a village community across the Port Hacking River and it is generally accessed by its young people by ferry. Jonathan was returning home from a Saturday night with his friends. No-one is quite sure exactly how the accident happened but it was obviously on the railway line where he was found. He sustained severe injuries as a result of a train running over him. He lost his right arm, from six inches below his shoulder, his left leg had been removed just below the knee and he lost two fingers of his left hand. Jono's recovery to date has been remarkable, to the point that he has been transferred from St George Hospital to Prince Henry's, where he has commenced rehabilitation and is preparing for the fitting of his artificial limbs. On Friday, 12 February, his parents, Debbie Beninca and Bernie Attwood, and his little sisters, Jenna and Maddison, were delighted to be able to welcome Jonathan home to Bundeena for the weekend, as were his many friends and family. It is hoped that he will continue to spend weekends at Bundeena for the period of his rehabilitation, which is expected to take six to eight weeks. Bernie and Debbie have been at Jonathan's side throughout the ordeal of the last two months. They, like Jono, have accepted what has happened and are totally focused on dealing with the many challenges that Jono now faces in his life. Debbie and Bernie and Jono wish to thank all their relatives and friends and the community of Bundeena who have rallied around them to help them through this trauma. Jono's vibrant approach to life, and his determination to overcome the obstacles that his disabilities have presented to him, will ensure his success in life. But he cannot be expected to do it on his own. He has the support of this wonderful village community. In close consultation with the family, a few people have got together to start organising some fundraising activities to cover many of Jono's costs. It was felt that it would be appropriate to coordinate these activities under the broad umbrella of the combined Bundeena-Maianbar sporting clubs-that includes the soccer, touch football, rugby league, fishos, golf, tennis and",174,Representatives Main Committee

So far, the committees from the various clubs have been approached and are all willing to help in Jono's cause. It is proposed that a trust fund be established for the purpose of administering what funds are raised. Bernie and Debbie have asked that the trust be administered by those outside the family. Paul Rumble, Ian Layland and Lindsay Moss, who are neighbours, have agreed to be the trustees, and Terry Willett of Willett and Associates, accountants from Cronulla, has agreed to audit the trust. A bank account has been opened at the post office and those who wish to make a direct donation have been able to do so by contacting Ian, the postmaster at Bundeena. The Cronulla legal firm of Baker, Ryrie, Rickards, Tidmarsh have agreed to act on Jono's behalf to explore what, if any, legal remedies are available to him. At this stage, it is planned to hold a benefit night at the Bundeena RSL this coming Saturday, 27 March. The RSL have kindly provided the venue and will assist in putting on a concert. Three local bands have indicated that they would perform free of charge. So far, the Cronulla Sharks, the Canberra Raiders and the Melbourne Storm have indicated their support by promising a large range of items, such as signed jumpers, for auction on the night. A second function some months down the track will be also organised with a more family oriented theme. Apparently the Bundeena Bowling Club will be able to give its support. There has also been support from Michael Riddell, the Director of the St Francis Community at Bundeena. He has offered to provide whatever help they can. Michael has made a great donation to our cause, a Luke Perry personally signed shirt. Luke, as you will be aware, is one of the main stars in the currently run Beverly Hills 90210 series. The Bundeena-Maianbar art community has responded warmly to Jonathan's plight. George Gittoes, Gary Shead, Bob Marchant, Jiawei Shen, Judith Englert-Shead, Lan Wang, Liz Borghero, Michael Weekes, Jenny Jarvis, Belinda Allen, Chris Lawrie and Vo Waters have committed to donating works of art with a view to raising funds for Jono.

Immunisation Services member for Hughes, Mrs Vale, for her contribution. I am aware of the case which she refers to. Paul Rumble is a very close friend of mine and I spoke to him about this particular case. I commend her on what she has said this morning. WhatI want to talk about today is the question of the maternity allowance. As of 1 January 1998, the maternity allowance has had two components: the first component of $750 is paid at birth; the second component of $200 is due to be paid to the mother when the infant reaches the age of 18 months provided immunisation has taken place. This raises an issue because we need to be able to guarantee that all mothers will be able to access benefits if they have had their infants immunised, and there is no guarantee of that. In the Alice Springs region there are 85 providers of immunisation services. These services provide data on immunisation to NT Health on prescribed forms. The data collected is sent from Darwin to Canberra electronically. The Darwin based national health register is used by Centrelink in paying the second component of maternity allowance. A breakdown in communicating the immunisation information within the NT, or in communicating the information",175,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (12.12 P.m.),"I commend the previous speaker, theThursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 4515 to Canberra in the correct manner, means that it is possible that mothers who have had their children immunised may not be able to receive the second component of their maternity allowance when it becomes payable on 1 July 1999. A situation could arise where mothers who know they have had their children immunised will be denied maternity allowance because their records do not appear on a screen at their Centrelink office. In Aboriginal communities there are likely to be linguistic problems where Aboriginal names have been misspelt and/or other relatives have been recorded as the mother, for example, foster parents such as a sister or parents of the birth mother. There could also be a breakdown in information reaching collection points from providers before being communicated to Darwin. The size and nature of the NT makes this possible. The problem is more severe than in other states. Information from Darwin also may not reach Canberra. The end result is that an incomplete or unmatchable set of data is being processed and cannot be put on the national register for access by Centrelink. According to Centrelink, mothers with incomplete immunisation records can, through their Medicare office, obtain an immunisation history form which they need to take to the immunisation provider to complete as proof that immunisation has taken place. If a technical problem has resulted in immunisation information for Northern Territory mothers not appearing on the national register, mothers that have done the right thing by having their children immunised should not have to run around their community filling in more forms. That, of course, assumes they have got the capacity to do so. The government is responsible for ensuring that accurate, recordable records are kept. Therefore, if data has not been collected appropriately by the Northern Territory or federal government, we need to fund programs to provide data catch-up. This needs to be done as soon as possible, as payment of the second component of maternity allowance is due from 1 July 1999. This may not seem a big issue in the national scheme but it is a very important issue for parents in Central Australia. I know this will be an issue for people who live in remote Australia generally, because they do not have the same access to communication tools as people who live in Sydney or Canberra, to medical staff or to record keeping. A lot of people in remote communities, in particular, who may well have had their children immunised are handicapped by the fact that they might well be illiterate. The whole process of dealing with forms, of going from one point to another to get approval or proof of immunisation, is very difficult. This is an issue which the government ought to look at urgently, so that people in my electorate-and I know other electorates-will not be disadvantaged because their records have not been kept up to date by the appropriate authorities. It demonstrates the necessity for us to examine the process by which the government provides the resources to organisations like Centrelink and other organisations which have the administrative responsibility and should have the capacity to ensure that these records are kept up to date, and there is a severe question as to whether they have been. This should be seen as a priority by the government lest it come back to bite them, because I will make sure it does if it is not done. (Time expired) Queensland Burnett Food Alliance visionary primary producers and processors in my electorate. At a time when we are most likely to see negative stories about rural industry in the metropolitan media, and even",176,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.16 P.m.),"I would like to pay tribute to some innovative and4516 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 25 March 1999 sometimes in provincial and rural media, highly focused people and groups give the lie to that negative image. The people I particularly want to talk about today are proving that ingenuity is alive and well in the bush and in our provincial cities and I am sure that is something from which all Australians will take comfort. The group I want to talk about are an innovative group of producers and processors who formed a groundbreaking alliance known as the Queensland Burnett Food Alliance. The alliance has been formed to improve market access for Queensland and in particular Burnett region exports through quite interesting strategies. Its CEO is Phil Cheesman, who will mentor the organisation until it has its own administration, while the Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers Coop-also a very focused group, which Mr Cheesman also leads-will offer secretarial services. The alliance, which is very much the vision of QDPI's Brett Tucker, includes the following: the highly professional tomato and zucchini producers, Steinhardt Family Farms; food processors, Farmfresh Fine Foods; avocado producers, Simpson Farms; Australia's largest producer of tomatoes for fresh local consumption, SP Exports; producers of honeydew, rockmelon and watermelons, the South Pacific Melon Group; chilli producers and processors, Austchilli; producers of beef from Australia's finest grazing lands, North Burnett Callide Beef; specialists in scallops, spanner crabs and other seafood, Mandarin Trawlers; premium pork producers, Monto Pork Enterprises; producers of delicious mangoes, Koala Exports; vegetable producers and packing group, Central Pack House Fresh; leading citrus producers, Gayndah Packers Coop or Gaypak, as it is sometimes known; producers of aloe vera products for health, cosmetic and therapeutic applications, Australian Aloe Company; and the outstanding brewed drinks manufacturer, Cliff Fleming's Bundaberg Brewed Drinks. Seventy per cent of the group's products are processed or are non-perishable and that figure could be even higher if we can master some long-life technologies. The alliance hopes to deliver a coordinated approach to allow Burnett producers to penetrate food chains and to respond effectively to the needs of international retail conglomerates, especially those in Asia. Of course we know that, when we are dealing with Asia, the sorts of things that are important are consistency of quality, continuity of supply and appropriate volumes. While the Burnett area can supply, on a year-round basis, tomatoes and avocadoes, there are other products it cannot. So it will be important that similar alliances grow up in the Granite Belt, the Bowen-Burdekin area, the Riverina and Leeton. These groups interacting together can provide the volume, continuity and quality that will be required to penetrate the Asian market. The alliance places responsibility on people within the region to maintain their business relationships and operations and allows for regional communities to be more independent and responsible for their own direction. However, what it does do is provide overseas buyers with one point of reference. It is a criticism of Australia by Asian buyers that they have to deal with too many small entities and these alliances and groups of alliances are the answer to that problem. The initiative is made to order for the Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia strategy. Despite the downturn that has occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, exports of Australian food over the last 12 months to all destinations have risen in the order of 10 per cent. In the 1997-98 year, total food exports were over $18 billion and nearly 60 per cent of that was earned in Asia. At present we contribute about six per cent of the imported food into Asia, so there is plenty of scope for expansion. Thursday, 25 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4517 Finally, I would like to make a plea that we look very seriously at superior methods of packaging. If we are going to provide this quality in some volume to Asia, the sorts of grants that are available currently through state governments of $50,000 for special packaging plants are not sufficient. I make a plea here today for packaging in the order of $500,000 to $1 million. I commend that view to the federal government and I support this very important Burnett Food Alliance.
