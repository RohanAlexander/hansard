22,Motion (By Sir Joseph Cook) Agreed,"Standing Orders suspended, -and resolution adopted Eesolution. of Ways .and Means, covering resolution of Supply,-adopted. . OrderedThat Sir Joseph Cook and Mr Wise do pre-"" pare and bring in a Bill to carry 'out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented, and (on motion by Sir Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.20] I move' That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill proposes the grant of a month's supply, with one exception, viz., that it provides for three pay days instead of two, as in the case of an ordinary month. We are doing this moire as,a precaution than anything else. These three pay days bring us up to the 4th August, and as we do not quite know when we shall get through the Tariff and consequential legislation next month, I have thought it well to add this extra day's pay to the month's Supply. ' I hope it will be quite clear that all the'rest of the Bill refers to one month, and that only wages for three pay days are included in the proposal ibefore us. There are one or two reasons why I ask for a month's Supply at the moment. This is one of those occasions when we have to get Supply, before the end of the year. not get Supply until the time comes for paying the wages well on to the middle of the succeeding, month. In this case, however, it is the end of the year, when all votes are cut off automatically j until we get Supply, therefore, we cannot legitimately spend sixpence in the new year. This Bill, it will be seen, differs from ordinary Supply Bills in that we have to come to the House -and get authority before the year's end, so that services and payments may continue in an orderly and regular manner.' There is another reason why I am limiting it to -one month's Supply. I think that before the Government ask for three months' Supply, which will be requested before the Budget is introduced, the House and the country may fairly ask ine -for a review of the general financial situation. ; ,man is not suggesting that the next request for Supply will be for three months in addition to the six weeks now asked for! now in a position to make such, a financial review with any usefulness or accuracy. The year is not yet closed; revenue is still being received in large amounts, as is always the case in the last .month. Of that , however, I shall have something to 1 say in a moment. 'To attempt a general review of the various operations now would be purely guesswork; I should be working in the dark, and, in all probability, I should quite innocently mislead the House in some respects. And there is a' further consideration. A general financial debate now would be rather unfortunate, as an interruption to the consideration of the Tariff, which is dragging just a little. I hope we shall be able to dispose Of this -Bill to-day, and bring our consideration of the Tariff to a conclusion quite early. It would, therefore, be better to take the course I propose this morning: It would not be fair to ask honourable members to vote three months' Supply without knowing what .the financial situation of the country is. It is a carry-on vote, with only one or two exceptions, which I proceed to give. Honourable members will see-that there is an unusual amount for a month for the Postmaster-General's Department, and I should explain that included in that amount is an item for oversea mails, Ordinarily we need which has only now been brought to final account in London. This is really a remanet of the war period. It will be remembered that when the war broke out our mail services were smashed up, and we had to get our letters carried as best we could, largely in boats subsidized by the Imperial Government. During that period there was an extraordinary increase in the correspondence conducted between here and London, amounting, I think, to from about 128 per cent, to as high as 525 per cent. largely to the f act that we had an; army in Europe? would be the reason. We had to get the mails away with as much regularity as possible, and the item is due to the adjustment of the poundage rates wbicb.",21,Country Mail Services Taxatio N Commission Cockatoo Island Dockyard Resumption Of Work Control Naval Board Pacifi C Islands Mail Contract Cos T Of Government Federal And State ANZAC Tweed Industry Whea T Pool

36,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [11.36],"the Tariff:may he resumed on Tuesday, and as many honourable members wish to take this opportunity of bringing before Ministers grievances-which they were precluded from discussing' yesterday, I shall occupy as little time as possible. J, propose to deal with the position at Cockatoo Dockyard. The men formerly employed there have been out of work for many weeks, and I am assured that so'desperate is their plight that public subscriptions are being taken up in Sydney to relieve the distress amongst them. Those men' were employees of the Commonwealth Government. Work at the dockyards ceased at the instigation of the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith), I understand, and certain reasons .for that action were alleged. A Royal Commission was appointed, which, after taking evidence for some weeks, recommended that, in view of the distress existing and the necessity for finding employment, work should be recommenced at once on the Mombah and Adelaide. That investigation was considered urgent, and the Commission were.asked to report as quickly as possible. They did so, but up to the present moment no attempt has been made to recommence operations at the island. This is a serious matter, and requires consideration by the Treasurer. I am informed that there is some trouble about the transfer of the dockyard from the Navy Department to the Board recently appointed to control shipbuilding. But that is no reason why work on those -two ships should not be recommenced. The work is waiting, the men are unemployed, and the Commission have reported that the construction may proceed pending the transfer of the administration to the new authority. Commission reported that work on the Mombah and the Adelaide should be proceeded with as quickly as possible, but nothing has been done. sion recommended was that before work was recommenced transference to the Shipbuilding Board should take place. It is not a simple matter to transfer the control of a big enterprise like -the Cockatoo"" Dock. building Board was appointed in May. Surely the arrangements for transfer could iave been advanced sufficiently far by now to allow of work on those two ships being recommenced-.' There has been too much delay in connection with this matter, and it is unfortunate that we should be facedwith the present condition of affairs. If effect had been'given to the report made by the Public Accounts Committee in .1915-severa l -Governments have' been in power since, and I am not blaming any particular Government-w e would not be in the present unfortunate position. The Committee submitted recommendations in regard to administration, stores, accounts, and other matters. I shall quote but one finding, which, if it had been given effect to, would have obviated the subsequent losses of stores and defalcationsRegarding the dockyard as a commercial undertaking, it should be carried on under a proper business system. The effect of introducing recognised commercial methods would be to stimulate all concerned to maintain thc highest possible degree of efficiency and economy. Your Committee are of opinion, therefore, that details, showing the financial position of the dock3, should be prepared, and presented to Parliament not later than 30th September of each year, or as soon after that date as the Parliament may be sitting. given to that report there would have been no need for the present Royal Commission. commendation continuedThat such statement of accounts should at least show(a) the capital account of the dockyard, including land, buildings, plant, and machinery; (6) the amount of money advanced by the Treasury, the amount returned, the amount still owing, and the interest » charges; (c) the cash balance unexpended in London; (d) the value of finished output, and sales of scrap material; (e) the value of the work that is in course of construction^ (/) an account of all stores; (g) the expenditure for salaries, wages, material, &c.; (A) the amount written off for depreciation at the rate of 7 j per cent, on . buildings, 10 per cent, on plant and machinery, and i pei cput. on the value of the docks.",23,Joseph Cook Read A First Time Second Beading

A f t e r working for some time his trouble came on again, and he-found that he could not continue working. applied to the Repatriation Department to restore his pension, as he found that he was unable to work. It shows how honourable the man was. He did not wish to malinger on the Commonwealth. has correctly stated the facts. member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) has brought this case under the notice of the Department and it has been reconsidered, but the decision is that, because of a preexisting disease, the man cannot get a pension. He and his family may starve so far as the Commonwealthare concerned. manly enough to give up the pension and go to work. numi/rous cases of a similar character. Surely we do not propose to allow the officials of the Repatriation Department in New South Wales and the departmental medical officer to decide these matters when we know that these.men were passed as fit to serve abroad, that many of them went into the. fighting line, and that their condition is no better to-day than it was when they returned and were granted pensions. Yet, upon the report of a doctor just appointed, their pensions have been stopped. This is a.burning question. I have brought it up many times, and I shall continue to do so, because, after the promises I made to the men who went away and fought for us, T h a t was a pony I am in honour bound to do everything I possibly can for them. I went on the I quite agree w i th platform and did all I could in my little' I say -that no way to secure recruits, and in doing so I made promises which I am going to stand by as long as I am in this House. I hope the Government will not permit the Re-"" patriation Department to exercise unhampered control in respect to men who are entitled to every consideration at our hands. The Honorary Minister( Mr. Rodgers) is a painstaking man, and no one could work harder than he does; but we must take care that he watches every move made by those under him . He must rise to the occasion and take hold of He 'the reins himself, and say "" So and so must be clone."" does not do that. rests upon the Government. It is only fair that these men, who went abroad at our request, .should be kept in reasonable comfort, when they are unfit to provide for themselves. I agree with the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that the Government must accept the responsibility of providing for those incapacitated sol1 diers whom they accepted for service abroad, and who are now unable to provide for themselves, unless it can be shown that upon their enlistment certain vital facts were suppressed by them. If a man made absolutely false statements upon enlistment, of course acertain amount of responsibility must rest upon h i m ; but the Government must not endeavour to get away from their responsibilities and the promises they made in this regard.",26,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Ceived I Am Notosatisfied With The Latest

One has only to look at the statistics to realize that abnormal borrow-: ing is going on, both by State and Federal Governments, and that we are likely to be involved in heavy obligations.

Mandates have been issued to Australia regarding the Pacific Territories. Possibly the Treasurer can inform honourable members of the huge sum which our new responsibilities will involve. The Government should make clear their intentions concerning Papua. They should announce the proposed form of administration, and furnish an estimate of the cost of controlling the Pacific territories under the mandate. The cost of the Public Service is rapidly increasing. It is urgently necessary to call a halt. The Economies Commission has furnished reports. There have been inquiries into soldiers' home construction, and into the Cockatoo Island Dockyard.

Why, then, should the Minister take so much notice of the noisy minority in which men like the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) are so prominent? Why is progress at Canberra so slow ? The laying of the foundations of a few cottages, and the cutting of a few trenches, is not compliance with the instruction of Parliament, which voted £150,000 for expenditure-on Canberra during this financial year, and intended that the money should be spent. If all or the greater part of that sum has not been spent by the 30th of tlie present month, it will be evidence of incapacity or insincerity on the part of the Government.

133,Mr Austin Chapman,"If thethe slogan will be, "" Canberra or the country."" country."" case, after the election, there would be one to pass, and could not be as easily less opponent of the Capital proposal. It must be remembered that there are at Canberra about 1,000,000 bricks ready for use, and, perhaps, £50,000 worth of well-seasoned timber. bricks, made on the spot. These bricks are so good that the Government is being asked to give some of them for the facing of soldiers' memorials. We know that the Treasurer, as an advocate of the Capital proposal, and has done his best for it, but the present inaction must cease. Business men and others are asking me when will land be available within the Territory, so that they may erect shops and take up farms there. I do not^lame the Minister within whose Department the administration of the Federal Capital matters lies, but he must be held officially responsible, because nothing is being done. No dou'bt his officers are kept always busy, and this being so, some matters may be allowed to slip, but Canberra affairs cannot be put aside any longer. All over Australia persons are asking why we are allowing public works which have cost £1,000,000 to'Stand idle when the expenditure of another £1,000,000 would produce a splendid return on the whole outlay.' must be spent on Canberra, say within ten years, to make the city proposal effective? orable member, as chairman of the Public Works Committee, should be in a better position than I am in to answer, that question. bable expenditure would be about £8,000,000. Treasurer would not agree with that estimate. If we established some authority like the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, or the 'Sydney Harbor Trust, and allowed it to borrow a couple of million pounds for the 'building of Canberra, a good return would be obtained from the expenditure. I ask the. Minister to have land ordinances passed to enable the Federal Territory to be used. A Land Bill would take some time amended as ordinances. As the land must all be leased, there should, be no difficulty in framing these ordinances, especially with the experience of the States to work on. If sufficient driving force were applied, Canberra would so develop that in years to come a city like Melbourne would be a mere circumstance to it. Had the Government of Victoria owned the land surrounding Ballarat, and the unearned increment, instead of going, to speculators, been available for the improvement of the city, what a fine, self-supporting place it would be. . now. under the circumstances, that I speak of, it would be a still finer city. The land at Canberra is owned by the Commonwealth, and at the present time it is being let in broad acres for sheep grazing, notwithstanding that there are many ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force who . are anxious to take it up for closer settlement purposes. The Prime Minister has definitely promised that these works would be proceeded with this year. He has pledged his word that the Convention which is to revise our Federal Constitution shall meet there next year. What could be more fitting than that the Convention which is to frame the new Constitution t under which our people will live should meet there in an atmosphere free from the taint of party politics, and from the domination of the .press, to which some honourable members here are subjected? true, and it is the honourable member's conscience .pricking him which tells him in charge of this particular Department no consideration for the men who are unemployed there?

177,Mr Austi N Chapman,"I ask. Then we ought to obtain some definite information from the Government in regard to the activities of the Taxation Commission. that body is simply a waste of money. I understand that it has already cost £20,000 or £30,000. SIB JOSEPH COOK -It has not cost that. results are its labours likely to give to the Treasurer? half the sum mentioned by the honourable member. merely stating the cost of the Commission as alleged by the newspapers. Unfortunately, I do read them. I do not think that they are liars all the time, but I affirm that the Government would get from the heads of the Taxation and Treasury Departments better advice upon the subject of taxation than they are ever likely to receive from any Commission. It is absurd that business men should be required to make taxation returns in order that they may be robbed by two Departments. Taxation Department. If the Treasurers of the States and the Commonwealth met at a round table conference with their officials and discussed this matter, they ought to be able to settle it in an hour. The existing duplication of functions seems to be criminal. An almost similar condition of affairs obtains in respect to the Electoral Departments. I am aware that in two States of the Commonwealth, namely, South Australia and Tasmania, one electoral' roll is used for both State and Eederal elections. Why cannot that practice be followed in New South Wales? own State. once make the position clear to the people, and they will soon insist upon the disappearance of that jealousy.

I hope, however, that the Governmenb will take notice of what has been said in regard to invalid and old-age pensions, ..'and will give an Opportunity for the discussion of the proposal I have on the notice-paper. These' invalids and old The expenditure upon people, as the facts disclose, are not getting enough to keep body and soul together, and, surely, this country is rich ' enough to ""do the decent t h in g "" by them. I shall defer until another opportunity any further .remarks in regard to Canberra, but I do urge that some steps should be taken, at the earliest possible moment, towards the construction of the railway from Yass to Jervis Bay, which would not only be keeping the compact made with New South Wales, but also afford employment, and prove profitable to tke Commonwealth. There is no new principle involved in the Bill now before us, nor does it propose further public expenditure, beyond the provision of funds to pay our publio servants. Under the circumstances I shall not attempt to deal with the financial position, though this will have to be thoroughly examined, with an effort to ascertain whether we can meet the responsibilities with which we shall be faced for Let us have only one some years to come. There is, however, one matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), or, in his absence, the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith), and that is the dismissal of men from Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. It might be thought that because Cockatoo Island is not in my electorate it is injudicious on my part to make any particular reference to the position there at the present moment. Garden Island is, however, in the electorate of East Sydney, and I think I am only voicing the opinion of the majority of people in Sydney and the State generally, when I say that the recent discharge of employees was most unwarranted. It„ would seem that the Government are endeavouring to cut down expenditure,, and thus put themselves in a position to show a surplus at the end of the financial year; but I do not think that such a policy would be applauded even by those bodies, outside who are protesting against "" extravagance.""

It would, appear that owing to some misunderstanding, the members of the Naval Board intend to hang on as long as possible to their jobs. position. the only conclusion to. which one can come. It. is not only the discharged men we have to consider, but also the effect on' the business community of thewithdrawal from circulation of their wages, representing f r om £ 5 to £ 6 per week, or,, in other words, from £35,000 to £40,000-a month. I was told on Saturday that the Government do not intend to. re-employ these menuntil' after the3.0th June, the end of the financial year; and this idea, is supported by the actions of the Government. I hope, however, that these discharged men will be re-employed at the earliest possible moment. There is another matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer, namely, the mail service between Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and the New Hebrides, on which a large number of people on the islands are entirely dependent. The present contract, under which £12,000 per annum is paid to Burns, Philp and Company, for a mail every two months, expireson the 31st July next. The boat now used is not large enough for work of this kind, ""and, moreover, prior to the war, there was a sailing every fortnight. The people on these islands depend for their clothing and other' supplies on the mainland, and, therefore, there is the advantage of reciprocal trade. I do not wish to refer to the Condominium question, but it will sooner or later have to be settled, because the present dual control may prove inimical to Australia. leave -cargo on the wharf at Sydney, and the passengers who travel by her have to sleep on the tables of the saloon and on the floor. I have receivedcommunications from shippers in Sydney, and from people on the islands, in regard to the accommodation provided, but I am not permitted to use names, because, in the. case of the shippers, they might be more persecuted than they are at present. My object in mentioning the matter is to urge on the Government, the necessity of seeing that these disadvantages are remedied when the next contract is signed. These islands would make splendid health resorts for the people of Australia, for there are no better sanatoria in the worldNapoleon once said, that the. British are a nation of '-' shopkeepers,""-and it is : in t h a t ; That is not the spirit' that. I call attention to the urgency for a proper mail service in order that there may be trade between the British"" shopkeepers ""of the. islands-and the "" shopkeepers"" of the ""mainland. The islanders are unfortunate in having nobody to ventilate their grievances except myself. I am the only member of this Parliament representing the Pacific Islands, b u t the: people there know that they have a live representative; and they will use me as much as they. can. te t r y to get from the Gfeovernment an undertaking that the company, who receive £12,000 per annum fora steamer service to the islands, shall give, a better service than is being given at present: I suggest to the Government that there should , be a separate service between the mainland and Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, and another service for the New Hebrides.. I may -remind the Scottish members of this Committee that there is a large number of Scotchmen in the New Hebrides. The Presbyterian missionaries there have interviewed me on this'subject; they do not desire to make a political question of it , but they are anxious that the Government shall know, the way in which the contract is being carried out. Burns, Philp, and Company have had the contract for a long time. I have suggested to other companies that they should r u n services' to the islands, but they will not entertain the suggestion unless I get from Burns, Philp, and Company an assurance that they will not resent these other'companies attempting to make a contract with the Government. They all appear to be in a the interests of Combine. Burns, Philp, and Company The mail boat has to have wonderful influence w i th certain members of the Government; I do not suggest that Ministers derive any pecuniary benefits from the company, but Burns, Philp, and Company are given advantages which, I am sure, other companies cannot get. They are well known to certain members of the Ministry. That is why I am not satisfied with merely Writing to the Department.

186,Mr West,".On appearances t h a t . isGeneral. Honourable members would be surprised if I were to give tbem instances of tbe treatment meted out to tbe people on the islands. I give them my assurance that I am speaking the truth, for the actions of the company are so bad as to require no exaggeration. freights and passenger fares are too high, and yet people cannot get accommodation on the boats. Goods intended for the islands are left on the Sydney wharf, and when the boat reaches Norfolk and Lord, Howe Islands it is already loaded with goods for some distant port in the New Hebrides, and will not take any further cargo. Prior to the war a boat called at the islands every fortnight; to-day the population of the islands is greater than it was then. Lord Howe Island is 445 miles from the mainland, Norfolk Island 950 miles, and New Hebrides still further distant. Yet a large number of men from all those islands served at the war, and many of them died on the other side of the world, The Gommonwealth will have to take greater interest in the islands than it has done in the past, because if we continue the present policy of paying no regard to them, all sorts of races will settle there, and they will be occupied by a piebald population of Chinese,' Japanese, and other nationalities that do not mingle with white people. Australia ought to have a mandate over the New Hebrides, and the Presbyterian Church has asked the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to approach the French Government with a view to .ending the Condominium and placing the islands under the control of a race that will protect the natives, as the British have done in all their colonizathem in the same plight. tion schemes. Of course, mistakes have been made by our people, and men have done wicked acts, but on the whole we have proved ourselves worthy colonizers and fit to have charge of coloured peoples. An improved mail service would cost the Commonwealth nothing. IfI were on the Treasury bench I would have one of the Commonwealth steamers put into that trade, and it would not only develop a profitable traffic, but would be of great benefit to Australia. Even if the service yielded no profit, the very fact of the islands trade being brought to the mainland would be of great indirect advantage, perhaps of greater advantage than the mere addition of a little profit to the revenue. The present mail contract will expire on 31st July, and I hope before a Mr West. new one is entered into, the matter will receive in the Department that attention that it deserves. I could have written to the Department/on the subject, but I feel that no interest would be taken in the letter. For that reason I prefer to place Both the my views on record in Hansard, copies of which I shall send to the islands in the hope that they will stimulate some of my Scotch friends there to rouse the Government to a sense of their duty.. If they improve this service as I have suggested, the people will endorse their action. I desire to' support the remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) in regard to soldiers' grievances. In SydneyI have been christened "" The Soldiers' Champion"" ; in fact, if men can get no redress at the Department, the officers send them to my home. I shall mention one case to illustrate the grievances that are brought under my notice. A man who served for either four or four and ahalf years at the Front lost half of one shoulder, and has one useless arm.. He called at my house, and, as I always do with soldiers, I sat him in the best chair in the best room. A t his request, I remoAed his coat, because he was unable to 7 do so, and when I saw the extent of his injuries I could not understand why he was allowed only a half pension. His papers contained a statement that his injuries represented the after-effects of the war. What is the good of half a man? He has a wife and four children, and one-half of him is useless. of labour, and that man applied to me for a job, I could not engage him; how could I send half a man -to do a plumbing job at a customer's house? Nor would I be allowed to enter on my pay-sheet that the small amount that' man could .earn was the wage of half a man. The pension at present allowed him is ridiculous. The departmental officers give me their confidence to a great extent, and I know that financial stringency is the principal reason for the treatment of soldiers in this way. If the medical omcers and others had been told that the Government had no money, and that, therefore, they were to do their best to deceive the soldiers out of their pensions, they could not do their job more zealously than they are doing",38,Chapman Th E That I T Is True Has The Minister Who Is

188,Mr West,"If I were an employeri t to-day. I and several honourable members on this side went on to the publio platforms during the war, and asked for recruits to come forward in the country's hour of need. We appealed to the sympathy and patriotism of men, and underi took that we would take care of them and their dependants, so that they would never want. properly governed, nobody would want. Now we are doing as the barons and landlords of old did after the wars. Many a penny or threepence I have given to the Crimean veterans, and I vowed then that if ever I had the opportunity I would take care that no man who had served his country as a soldier should be obliged to beg in the streets. To-day we are not treating our soldiers very much better than the Crimean veterans were treated. That is the opinion of people in all classes of society. agreed that these meu performed their duty f a it h f u l l y , and have a right to be well cared for now. Those who remained in Australia, and whose wealth was protected by the efforts of the men who went to the war, are under an obligation to ameliorate as f a r as they can the condition of soldiers who have returned in any way incapacitated. We shall be deserving of the greatest censure if we do' not look after the interests of the men who have suffered for their country. It is to be hoped that it will not be neoessary for me to make another appeal like this. If the Government will not move in the matter, I hope that some other Government w ill be found to take their place, who 'will not be unwilling to give effect to the desire of the people of this country that our returned soldiers should be treated well. do not propose to-day to refer at length to the financial position. I am satisfied with the statement made on the subject by the Deputy Leader of the party to which I belong. There are one or two matters to which I specially desire to direct attention. One was mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) this morning. He referred to the case of a returned soldier residing in a township on the border between his electorate aud my own. This man has been treated very harshly. I refer to"" his case because it is typical of a number of cases which have been dealt with by the Department concerned in a most unsympathetic way. The man to-whom I refer has a wife and family, and, according to the Returned Soldiers and Sailors League of his district, he is a very fine type of man,'who likes to be independent. When he returned to Australia from the war he was granted a pension. Thinking that he was in a fit condition to take up work And if the country were he voluntarily surrendered his .pension, and went to work at his occupation as a miner. His branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors League has assured me that he made desperate attempts to continue to work, but found that it was i m possible to do so. He then applied to have his pension restored to him, and the Department has consistently refused his application, on the ground that the trouble from which he is suffering was present, if not active,-before he went to the war. Eveni f it is a fact that the seeds of his The whole community is present trouble were in the man's system before he went to the war, his unhealthy condition must have been aggravated by war experience. pension in the first place? question that he was given the pension because he had done his job, and we had promised that he would be treated in a proper way when we passed the legislation intended to benefit returned soldiers.

T h is reasonable treatment for people who There is another matter to which I forcibly dealt with by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) before the adjournment for lunch.. I urge that it is quite time that this Parliament honoured its obligations in regard to the building of the Federal Capital. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has said, the money spent there is not' lying idle, because the Federal Capital Territory is improved thereby as an asset. There is some return from the Territory, because much of it is leased to graziers, but in no sense can it be said that it is returning anything like what it should.. Canberra is at present in the condition of a property less than half improved. No man in possession of a property would leave it unimproved, or if he had the money to improve it would not improve it up to a paying stage. Canberra as it stands is a bad business proposition, and it is a very grave' reflection on us that we should alios*' that magnificent Capital site-for it is a magnificent site-to remain in its present state. tening, Sir Robert? shortly to have a word in reply. member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) ever, seen the place ? whatever to do with it. giving an opinion on a business proposition Avithout inspecting it. Would any man buy a property without inspecting it or knowing something about it? No one would ibe expected to spend money on a proposition he knew nothing about; and those who know nothing about a project ought to take the advice of those who do. There are many honourable members who know Canberra, and they see value in it as a business proposition. It is a reflection, not only upon our business capacity, but also, upon our honour, that the agreement concerning the Capital should be unfulfilled, and that the magnificent area we have there should ba lying in an unfinished state of development. . Sir [3.2] I can assure the honorable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) of my anxiety to help him in regard to Canberra. He has laid down a proposition-""Canberr a or. the country.'-' I will join with him in utilizing every effort that lies in my power to secure a dissolution, for the purpose of submitting to the. country the question of any further expenditure on Canberra at the present time. I hold that it is criminal at the present juncture to squander money there. The honourable member says that it is very desirable to spend money there t at this juncture. I call it wasting or squandering it. If the honourable member is in earnest in his slogan, ""Canberra or the country,"" I am with him all the time in contending that, at this crucial state of our affairs in regard to our finances, the people should have an opportunity ""of saying whether or not money should be wasted at Canberra. The honourable member complains, perhaps with justice, of the conditions applying to the payment of old-age pensions, and urges the necessity for further expenditure on postal services. If he is prepared to join with me in stopping all further expenditure at Canberra and in getting the money whioh he thinks ought to be* spent there applied to satisfy the wants of the old-age pensioners and of the Postal Department, again I am with him. orable member ever at Canberra? Canberra are not in dispute at the present juncture. They may be more than equal to those of Dalgety, they may be of a very high order indeed, but the question at issue now is whether the country has the right to squander money at Canberra at a time when the people are crushed with taxation. When we are suffering direct taxation to the extent of over £20,000,000 and indirect taxation to the extent of over £30,000,000, when enters prise is stifled, and when the burdens of taxation are overwhelming, Australia cannot afford to waste any money in this direction. If we could afford ;the expenditure, if taxation were normal, and if we were relieved to some extent of the vast and unproductive burden of debt of over £400,000,000, I would join with the honourable member in carrying out the lishment of the'Federal Capital at Canberra.

No-one repudiates the selection of Canberra as the Capital site, but we dare not forget that upwards of £2,000,000 has been practically sunk there, for which'there is little to show, and that while the country is paying 6 per Cent, interest on its loan moneys, the return for the money spent at Canberra is only 1J per cont. The position really is, that the more money we expend there the greater will be the loss sustained, and this expenditure is sought at a time when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, with his tongue in his cheek, is demanding economy. Mr 'AUSTIN say I have my tongue in my cheek? Sir ROBERTBEST advises wasting money at Canberra a t the present time cannot be sincere in urging economy. When the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was Treasurer, the Secretary to the Treasury, on his instructions, made inquiries from the Postal Department, the Public Works Department, and a l l the other Commonwealth Departments concerned, as to what was likely to be the cost of transferring the Seat of Government to Canberra. We were told as the result of that careful investigation that the cost would be over £3,000,000 at the present time. people. the result of that honest investigation made on behalf of the then Treasurer that we could not go to Canberra to conduct our business under a cost of £3,000,000.

Sir ROBE RT BEST I intend to protest against such squandering of money. such expenditure. the fanatical proposition which has been circulated through the press and otherwise, that it is proposed to erect a hostel and conference hall at Canberra. I understand that a conference hall is to be erected to provide a meeting place for the proposed Convention; bub I submit, with very much humility, that in the various capitals' there are halls and proper hotel accommodation which are in every way suitable for the purpose. I know that after the proceedings of the Convention have terminated that the hall can be converted into a picture theatre, as mentioned by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett)..

It is declared, by the same engineer that the supply, from the Cotter River is one of the purest in the whole Commonwealth. member says that there is no dispute as to the merits he is right; but as he has never been ;there, he only knows that by intuition. We must remember that up to 30th June, 1920, £1,738,000 had been ex/ pended, and of that amount £740,000 had been spent on the resumption of land. The estimates of receipts for the current"" year are about £35,000, which includes rates collected for municipal purposes. I think that will be regarded as a very satisfactory return, particularly when we take into consideration the fact that the value of the lands is being continually added to * by improvements^. The .honourable member for Kooyong. forgets that we have* the Crown lands of the Federal Territory free of cost. What is going to be the rent roll of the city area when 15,000 people are settled there? I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the rents that will be paid will go more than a long way towards defraying the interest on public buildings required for Government offices. I ask the honourable member to estimate the rent-roll in a city accommodating 15,000 people. Today we are paying £25,000 a year for the offices we are occupying in Melbourne, and which will not be required when the Seat of Government is transferred. What capital is required to produce that amount of interest? It will provide more than the cost of the public offices required in Canberrai n the beginning. The honourable member says that the money spent has been wasted; but I ask him to visit the Federal Territory ""and see how the money . is being spent. been wasted on a sewerage system. Metropolitan Board of Works said so. that opinion. trary from omcers whose ability cannot be questioned have been made. The sewerage project has been already before the Public Works Committee, whose members hold different opinions from those of the honourable member. When he sees the -full report upon the sewerage system, he will probably be impressed with the fact that there has been no waste. The honourable member for Kooyong When the honourable wants to know how the money generally has been spent. The sum of £255,000 has been expended on water supply. The reservoir is already completed, and the most modern pumping"" plant in the Commonwealth has been provided. The water is now laid right to the city boundaries, and practically only awaits reticulation throughout ' the area. The powerhouse is one of the most modern and best-equipped in Australia The output of the brickworks is unsurpassed for quality in any part of the Commonwealth. Roads have been made; and I assure honourable members 0 that there has been no serious waste upon them, or on any other of the works undertaken in the Federal Capital. For confirmation, I look confidently to honourable members who have visited the Territory .and made investigations in an impartial spirit. The honourable member for Kooyong is right in saying that while capital is lying idle it is a loss. If he had £1,000,000 lying idle, would he not try, by the expenditure of; more money, to make it reproductive? If the honourable member were to analyze the sources of expenditure indicated by the honourable. member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), tb which reference has been made, he would gain a clearer and fairer estimate of the whole situation. Does he think, for example, that the public servants who take up their residence at Canberra will be housed rent free""? Does he not realize that they will be required to pay rent for the nouses they occupy? The honourable member overlooks that, in regard to the expenditure estimated by the honourable member for Balaclava to be has made at Canberra, almost every penny in the Territory will be productive of revenue one way or another. Of course, the public buildings, including Parliament House, will be a charge upon revenue in that they will be availed of for Reports to the conthe transaction of public business: But it should be' taken for granted that the inhabitants of the Federal Capital will pay rental for their residences.

Twenty cottages are being erected upon the civic centre) known as the Ainslie centre; and a progressive, report, dated 22nd June, indicates that twelve of the twenty cottages are practically up to the roof-plates. Three have the roof timbers upon them, as well as other advanced work. Excavations and foundations have been made in respect of the whole of the remainder in that group. In the power-house group, of ten. cottages, three are now approaching completion. Foundations have been laid for three others. At the brickworks'* group, comprising another seven cottages, foundations and excavations have been completed in the case of six, and brickwork is proceeding. In every instance,the undertaking is advancing steadily. The brickworks have been started again, and there is being consumed a weekly total of 35,000 to 40,000 bricks in the cottages, to which £10,000 has been allotted. The joinery works and pipemaking plant are in operation also. The honourable member for. Kooyong said he would raise no objection if the money at Canberra were being spent on roads and permanent improvements. I wish to say that £12,760 is being spent upon roads. The railway line has been completed from the power-house to the civic centre. In addition; £2,700 is being spent on tree planting within the city area. £10,000 is to be laid out upon extensions of water supply, drainage, electric supply, and so on. There are at least 220 men at this moment engaged upon works at Canberra, and they will continue to be busy there for the next three or four months at least. One other matter on which I desire to touch has reference to the hostel and the matter of a picture palace. . The honourable member for Kooyong has created out of his vivid imagination a magnificent picture palace for Canberra. luxuries may be found in fashionable city suburbs; but, in a working centre, such as Canberra will be, there will be no such fantastic schemes as he has in mind. consideration is not for the authorizaThe tion of some'barn-like building for a ; picture palace; but the intention was Three to have a structure so reared that it would constitute portion of the tern-' porary Parliament HouseI t must be remembered that, to erect the permanent Parliamentary Building in the Federal City will take time, since it will be a structure in every way worthy of the site. The present idea is to get to Canberra at the earliest possible, date, and, therefore, the Government are perfectly justified in contemplating some of thebuildings to be erected of a temporary character. Honourable members will see that the Government have endeavoured to fulfil the constitutional obligation with due regard to economies. I have listened with interest to the statement made by the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) as to the. work which is being done at. the Federal .Capital -Over twenty years have elapsed since the agreement was made that the Federal Capital should be established in New South Wales, and Parliament, as a-body of honourable men, was expected to carry out that agreement without delay. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) has said that we should wait for the return of normal taxation before we attempt to build the Capital. He might as well have said that we should wipe out the compact altogether. I am sure he will agree with me that it is time we ceased to be parasites on the State of Victoria by occupying this splenA further amount of did building without paying the State Government any rent for it. We have not even attempted to improve the Parliamentary Reserve at the northern end of this building. I have sought to have it beautified and set apart as a children's playground, but it still remains a waste space, the like of which is not to be found in any other city. I thank the honourable man) for the strenuous fighthe has put up in support of the building of the Federal Capital, and my experience of him convinces . me that he Those will stand by his guns! The Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook) once said there was a way by which the Federal Capital could be built without costing the country a penny. I agree with that view.

236,Member For Eden,"Monaro( Mr Chapus by the people of the little island of Guernseyi n building their market in the early part of last century. A t that time it was difficult to borrow money in London, and it was decided to ' issue 5,000 £ 1 market scrip notes for the payment, of the brickmakers, bricklayers, stonemasons, carpenters, and others employed in building the market. The market was no sooner buil t than every stall in it was let, and by means of the revenue so derived, together with whatever moneys could be set: apart -by the municipal, council, the notes were quickly paid off. Every year as many notes as could be redeemed in this way were burnt, and in ten years the people had for all time a revenue-producing asset for which they had actually paid nothing. The same thing could be done in connection with 'the building of Canberra. It is idle to talk of'the Federal Capital costing £10,000,000. If that sum had been expended by the State Government in building premises in Melbourne while the city was yet in its infancy, what would be the present rental value-of such buildings? Considerably over £250,000 has been wasted in building unnecessary division walls in Collins-street alone. If this city had been built under a Board of Control, such as we hope to have supervising the building of the Federal Capital, those division walls would have been done away with, with the result that thousands of pounds would have been saved in respect of labour, and much valuable land would not have been wasted. Our taxation, we are told, is equal to £12 per head of the population, whereas before the war it was only £ 4 per head of the population. But has the wealth of the country contributed to the cost of the war in anything like the proportion of the population of Australia who offered Rodgers) for the splendid work he did their lives to the cause. Over 70 per cent, while Acting Ministerf o r Repatriation. of the men of military age volunteered While recognising the difficulties associafor active service, oyer 40 per cent, were ted with the control of that Department, accepted, and over"" 33 p6r cent, actually I can only say, after many years' experiwent to the Front.

Western Australia is doing good work. lived in Londonf o r four and a half years, and when I desired to secure an appointment as medical officer on an emigrant ship bound for Western Australia it was to the Agent-General for Queensland that I had to apply. Then, again, we have seven State Governors and a Governor General. If the people had a right to vote on the question, all such offices would be abolished. We also have seven second Chambers of Parliament. They are unnecessary. Likewise, we have seven Chief Justices, seven different systems of income tax-tw o varying systems operating in each State-and seven different land Taxation Departments. I s it not idiotic ? If the -people had the power of the referendum, the initiative and the recall, they would decide these matters and so save the Government many a long and weary debate in Parliament.

238,Dr. Maloney,"I recognise that. Iweek and upwards, whereas under Senator -Millen's scheme they received only £2 2s. per week, less the amount of any pension that was paid to them. As the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr There is no excuse for the admission of ""West) has said, when we were asking men to enlist we promised them that their wives and families would be well looked after should anything happen to them, but those promises have not been kept. Senator Millen, speaking in another place some time ago, said an allowance would be made in respect of only four children in every family, and when the late iSenator Guthrie asked what would be the position of a man who had eight children, he was told by Senator Millen that that would be the man's own responsibility. That was not in keeping with the promise that I , and hundreds of others, had made from the recruiting platform. The men also were not fairly treated in the matter of life assurance. Every American soldier who went to the Front, whether he liked it or not, was insured for £1,000 at a cost of £ 8 6s. 8d. Here a policy for £1,000 would have cost a soldier £152 7s. 8d. There is only one other matter to which I shall refer. I hope that before the questhree millionaires, something like fiftytion of the continuance, or otherwise, of the Wheat Pool is definitely decided we shall be allowed to take a vote upon it. My desire is that the Wheat Pool shall be continued. When the scheme was first introduced I was very hopeful with regard to it , and am glad to say that -my hopes have been fully realized. I once asked an old school mate of mine who has a thorough knowledge of the growing and marketing of wheat, what would have happened if , during the war, there had been no Wheat Pool. His reply was that the big grain merchants of Australia would have exported as much as they could get away and would have bought as much as was required for local consumption, and that as to the rest, the farmers might have been able to obtain Is. per bushel for it. It was the pooling of the wheat that saved the farmers, aud I shall eertainly vote for the continuance of the Pool. were examining the immigrants to this quhar myself on the subject. country, and that those suffering from tubercular complaints would not be al; Admiral.

The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert. Best) has' spoken of the taxation of this country, but we, as a people, really do not know what taxation is. No city elsewhere of the size of Melbourne is so lightly-taxed, our rate being 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d.. in the £1. European and American municipalities have to pay for the upkeep of police, for which our citizens pay nothing. The Age of the 5th July, 1919, writing pf Theodore Roosevelt, said that he once advocated a law under which earnings over £10,000 would be paid back to"" the revenue of the community from which they were taken, and said .that this legislation may not have been feasible, but the principle was a good one.. As we »have twentysix semi-millionaires, and twice, that number of quarter-millionaires, the rich of this country might well contribute/ if not 30 per cent, pf their wealth, which was the life offer of those who fought for Australia, at least 20 per. cent., and thus wipe off the war debt which now is a curse to Australia. 1 the debate, can the Acting Prime Minister say when men will be re-employed at Cockatoo Island? ting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.3] The Navy Board and the newBoard, of Control have been sitting all day, and it is hoped that they will finish before they rise.
