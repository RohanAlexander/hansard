Adelaide, the commander and bis subordinates have authority to give that assistance, or have they first to obtain the sanction of the Government? people of Australia do not entertain the belief that the personnel of the Australian navy ie not prepared to respond to any call for assistance when the lives of British subjocts are in danger. As to the-latter portion of the question, I am unable to say what would happen in problematical circumstances. The commander of HMAS. Adelaide has authority, without first securing the approval of the Commonwealth Government, to use' the personnel of his ship to safeguard lives that may be in actual 'danger. .The authority applies only when there is immediate and urgent danger. the royal mail steamer TaJiiti, after the deplorable collision that occurred last night, was allowed to proceed on her voyage to San Francisco without any statement being taken from the captain aud officers as to the cause of the collision? honourable member deplores the dreadful accident that occurred yesterday afternoon in Sydney.

AM PRY 'S VISIT . address delivered to this Parliament lust evening by the Dominions Secretary -wit h whose welcome I am sure we all wish apparently, the press and the public were excluded from this building, is it the desire of the Prime Minister and the Government that the elaborate and able statement of Conservative policy made by tbe Dominions Secretary shall be the subject of criticism, by honourable members here or elsewhere, or,is it expected that the speech of fhe distinguished visitor shall pass without comment, as if accepted by every member of this House? orable members understand the position to be that it was felt desirable that an opportunity should be given for the Secretary of State for the Dominions to address the members of this Parliament, and for honourable members to ask him any questions they might desire upon matters of general imperial interest. It was notassumed that every honourable member would agree with everything that was said, or that in the absence of debate it might be considered that the Opposition or the Government acquiesced in every statement that Mr Amery had made. The desire was merely to have made available to honourable members as much information as ixissible. Many of the matters referred to last evening will be debated in this House, and upon the public platform, and varying and opposite views will be expressed upon them; but .in such discussions some of the statements made last evening oould uot be repeated, as they were confidential, and it would be undesirable ro give publicity to them. The discretion of honourable members individually as to what reference they make to Mr Amery's speech is, I am sure, to be relied on. sire tc know what kind of censorship will be exercised in regard to it. Is the report to be printed and distributed among honourable members for their further information ? the report -has been made, and it will be carefully revised, consideration being given to the advisability of making it public, either in a censored or uncensored fonm Of course, Mr Amery himself must have an opportunity of to associate ourselves-whe n seeing the report before any decision is made regarding its publication. official reporters were employed hist evening, I ask you, Mr Speaker, for what purpose was the report taken, if not to benefit honourable members. Groom) -Tb e gathering last night was not a sitting of the House, and as SpeakerI have no control over the publication of its proceedings. Mr Amery's speech was reported so that it could be published; should that be thought advisable, and with my permission, the Hansard staff was employed. A similar procedure was followed when the Empire Parliamentary Delegation visited Australia last year. During the visit several meetings of the Association were held. In some cases the reports of the speeches were treated as absolutely confidential, and were not circulated, whilst others were circulated after revision. Mi-.

When members of the Nationalists and Country Party assembled to-day, they joined forces at the suggestion of their leaders, and were addressed at length by the Prime Minister. Mr Bruce made it clear that he was of the opinion that it should not be continued as a Government activity in view of the heavy financial losses .that aro occurring on the running of the ships under the stringent conditions prescribed by the Australian Navigation Act. He favoured selling the Line. This view, he stated, was shared by other members of tbe Cabinet.

I urge the Prime Minister to so that the people of Australia may knowprecisely what the intention of the Government is. the newspapers from time to time which Its express only the opinions of the writers as to the future action of the Government, and obviously a reply to every such statement reported is not to be expected. I suggest that it is unlikely that during the next three or four, or at most eight days, the Commonwealth Line of Steamers will be detrimentally affected by the reports referred to.

The reply I received from the Prime Minister was an evasive one owing either to the acoustic properties of the building, or my inability to make my question clear. I desired the Prime Minister to say whether it was a fact that the Cabinet had decided to delay all shipping matters until the return of Sir George Pearce who, most of us know, is a friend of the shipping companies. ment that the Prime Minister has promised to make on the matter on which he will speak, be brought before the House in such a form as will give opportunity for discussion and decision by the House on the fate of the Line, and the final disposal of the ships? men need have no anxiety ou that score.

The gross expenditure upon the Federal Capital Territory up to the 31st October last, including inter alia, the cost of administration, of the acquisition of land, and of the construction of the Queanbeyan to Canberra Tailway line, was, approximately, £8.732.150.

105,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"TreaThe present Land. Tax Assessment Bill, therefore, differs very markedly from most other tax assessment measures, in being mainly concerned with concessions to taxpayers and the removal of anomalies. these are-first, the abolition of the existwithout alteration for a period of three ing provisions of the law that retrospective re-assessment on departmental valuations may be made for a period of two years; secondly, the replacement of the power of the department to make a variation in valuations each year by a requirement to adhere to valuations for a period of three years; thirdly, the extension of the powers of the Hardship Board to grant relief in respect of land used for primary production when the working of any land has resulted in a loss in the year for which the tax is levied; fourthly, the exemption from taxation of lands owned and used by sports clubs except racecourses; fifthly, relief to company shareholders and elimination of unprofitable administrative work by an alteration of the provisions of the act to render it unnecessary for the department to include any interest of a shareholder in the unimproved value of the lands of the company if it, does not amount to £100, or when tlie aggregate of interests of £100 or over is less than £500; and, finally, the creation of a valuation board or boards for the reviewing of departmental valuations objected to by taxpayers. In regard to the abolition of retrospective reaverage that it is not economical to deal assessments on departmental valuations, it may be stated that when the department was first established there was good reason for this provision, because it was impossible for the department to make valuations of all taxable lands so as to include them in the original assessments in those early years. But the Land Tax branch of the department has now existed for seventeen years, during which time much valuable information regarding land values has been collected. The collection of data is constantly proceeding as land sales take place. The liability to retrospective re-assessment of land has always left land-owners in a. state of uncertainty their liability to taxation, and has seriously interfered with the adjustment of sales and transfers of land. It is considered that the time has arrived for Dr. Earle J'age. the abolition of retrospective re-assessments of this kind, and the bill gives effect to this view. In connection with what may be called triennial revaluation of land, the bill also provides that, The principal of generally, land values shall be maintained years for purposes of taxation. There are certain necessary limitations to this arrangement, and they are expressed in clause .14 of the bill. Attempted avoidance of tax will be a reason for variation of an assessment at any time. A substantial alteration is proposed in the provisions of the act relating to the inclusion in the personal assessments of company shareholders of their interest in the unimproved value of the lands of companies of which tbey are shareholders. At present the law requires that the unimproved value of lands owned by companies shall be treated as the joint possession of the shareholders in the proportion of their respective interests in the paidup capital of each company. This provision requires the department to ascertain the unimproved value represented by one share and then to calculate the interest of each shareholder in the land. The interest so calculated is then to be aggregated with the other lands of which the taxpayer is the owner or in which he may have a joint or beneficial interest so as to ascertain his total taxable value and the rate of tax payable by him. In practice the department has found on the with any share interest in a company which represents an unimproved value of less than £100 and therefore, in order to save money, the commissioner instructed his officers to omit from an assessment any such interest. This arrangement has been found to be advantageous to the work of the department by materially assisting in keeping down the staff requirements. Tliere has not been any loss to the Commonwealth by the arrangement, but, on the other hand, there has been a financial gain by way of reduction in expenditure of an amount greater than any possible revenue from the omitted source. partment been doing that ? or seven years. The Government considers that a further step in this direction",23,Second Reading
106,Regarding Mr Scullin,Ho w long has the de,24,Second Reading
107,Dr. Earle Page,"Po r the last sixis now possible, and that is to exclude from shareholders' personal assessments any aggregation of interest which is less than £500, and for the purpose of that aggregation to treat as non-existent any interest which is less than £100. This means that only those interests which amount to £100 and over w ill be aggregated, and if that aggregation is less than £500 it will not be included in the shareholder's assessment. If a shareholder has an interest in one company only and his interest in the company's land is less than £500, it w ill not be included in his assessment. This advance is regarded by the Government as the nearest approach it may make at present to giving effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Taxation 1920-1922, that the basis of land tax should be altered so as to tax the equitable or beneficial owner only, treating for that purpose a company as being the sole beneficial owner of its lands. It is necessary to explain what is meant by the taxation of the equitable or beneficial owner only. The land tax is levied at a graduated rate on an aggregation of the unimproved values of interests held in land either as a primary owner or as an equitable or beneficial owner. Each person assessed is entitled to a deduction of the general exemption of £5,000 from the aggregate unimproved value in the assessment. The primary owner is first assessed and the tax assessed is paid in f u l l by that owner. The equitable or beneficial owner is assessed as a secondary taxpayer on all his interests in land. H is assessment w ill contain the f u l l unimproved value of any land owned by him in his own right, together with the unimproved value of any equitable or beneficial interest owned by him in any other land. Equitable or beneficial interests in land may be in any of the following forms:(a) its a beneficiary in a trust estate which owns land; (?>) as a member of a partnership which owns land; (c) ns a shareholder of a company which owns land; (d) as a purchaser of land from another person when as purchaser he has taken possession of the land but has not paid 15 per cent, of the purchase money; (e) as a lessee of land when the lease was entered into after 17th November, 1910, which was the date of the commencement of tlie Land Tax Assessment Act 1910. , (/) as a mortgagee in possession of land in certain circumstances. Every secondary taxpayer is entitled under the act to a deduction in his assessment of the lesser of two amounts, either the . part of the primary tax which is attributable to the unimproved value of his beneficial interest in the land of the primary taxpayer, or the part of his own tax which is attributable to that value. The effect of this provision is that the Treasury retains tax on the unimproved value of the equitable or beneficial interest at the higher of the two rates assessed on it-the liigher of the primary owner's rate or the secondary owner's rate. The royal commission recommended that this system should be abolished and should be replaced by a tax at a graduated rate upon the aggregate of the unimproved values of all lands owned by an equitable or beneficial owner, and for that purpose, it was recommended that a company should be treated as the sole beneficial owner of its land. A slight examination of the effect of this recommendation showed that it would be possible for any land-owner to split up his interests in land and transfer the separated parts to different companies and so entirely escape all land tax.' It was oibvious that the recommendation could not be accepted, without altering tins graduated rate of tax to a higher fiat rate to be paid by large or small owners alike. The recommendation was not carried into effect. . MrE .

110,Dr. Earlepage,"I shall dealagainst which the taxpayer may have objected on tlie ground that the valuation is excessive. A board will consist of a chairman appointed for a period not exceeding seven years, as may be found convenient, with two assisting members. It is proposed to commence with one board for the whole of the Commonwealth, because the past experience of the department has shown that in the vast majority of cases the department and the taxpayer come to agreement respecting the valuations to be used in the disputed assessments. It is not improbable, however, that, the existence of a board may cause some taxpayers to havo their cases dealt with by that body. If the work of reference sliould increase to such proportions as to necessitate the establishment of an additional board, or additional boards, that course may be taken under the terms of the provisions of the bill. The personnel of the board other than the chairman will consist of one member representing the Commissioner of Taxation and the other representing land-owners of the class concerned in the particular reference to the board. For example, if the board is dealing with the valuation of pastoral lands, the land-owners' representative will be a person competent to deal with the valuation of such lands. If the valuation relates to agricultural or dairying or mining lands, the member of the board representing the owner will be a person competent to deal with the valuation of such lands. ' The representative of the Commissioner of Taxation will vary with the particular States owing to the variation in the* physical features and climatic conditions of the various States. up by force of the weight of Land Tax quired. The chairman will be the only permanent appointee. The bill contains provision for proposes to exempt them from Land Tax. the termination of the services of any member of the board. Special provisions relate to the chairman, who may be suspended from ofiice by the Governor-Gen. eral for misbehaviour or incapacity, but the suspension may be removed upon presentation of an address to the Governor General by the Senate and the House of Representatives praying for the restoration of the chairman to office. A member of the board other than the chairman may be removed from office fo"" misbehaviour or incapacity. Ho has no appeal from this decision nor is it desirable that he should be allowed to appeal. The chairman or other member of the board is deemed to have vacated office if («) he engage?., during his term of office, without the consent of the Governor General, in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; (h) he becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or applies to take the benefit of any Commonwealth Act or State Act for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtors or compounds with his creditors or assigns his salary for their benefit; or (c) without the consent of the Governor General he absents himself from duty for fourteen consecutive days or for twenty-eight days in any twelve months. The Valuation Board will deal with land values only. In cases which are referred to it, its decision on questions of fact dealt with by it will be final, unless the decision is associated, with some question of law which the court may subsequently decide in such a way as to react upon the value determined by the board. In such a case the court will have power to vary the valuation arrived at by the board. The bill will exempt all lands owned by or in trust, for any club or body of persons and used primarily and principally for the purpose of games and athletic exercises among individuals an.l not used for the pecuniary profit of the members ot* the club or body. Racecourses are not covered by this exemption. It is considered proper that Land Tax should not be charged on sports grounds. Instead of these being broken on them, it is the tendency of modern city planning to increase their numbers aud areas. The desirableness of this is apparent, and therefore the Government The present tax collected from these associations is extremely small, but it imposes substantial burdens on the members of the clubs and associations concerned, and these it is desired to remove.

111,Mr Foster,To serve when re,26,Second Reading
112,Dr. Earle Page,"That is so.tion. when that use has resulted in a loss during the year of assessment. At present the act conveys the impression that that was the intention of Parliament when the law was made, but actually it applies only to those cases of hardship in whicli it is not possible, owing to the financial position of the land-owner, for him to pay the tax. In addition, provision is made for substitute members of the Eelief Board being appointed by the Treasurer as occasion requires, owing to the altered conditions arising from the transfer of the Seat of Government from Melbourne to Canberra, and the necessity for the Commissioner of Taxation to be absent frequently from Melbourne on visits to the various States of the Commonwealth. This will permit of the board meeting more frequently than is possible at present. Provision is further made that applications for relief from tax of £500 and over sliall be referred for preliminary investigation and discussion with the taxpayer to the individual members of the Income Tax Board of Eeview in similar manner to reference to that board now made in the case of applications for relief from income tax. of £500 and over. That relieves the strain on the Eelief Board, and will enable taxpayers to attend personally before a member of the Income Tax Board of Beview, and discuss their applications, so that tbey may advance all arguments in support of their claims for relief. These references to the members of the Income Tax Board of Eeview, in the case of applications for relief from income tax, have been of great assistance to both taxpayers and the Belief Board, and it is considered that equal benefit will result from the proposal to refer applications for relief from land tax to the members of .the same board. The remaining provisions of the bill obviated, ancl therefore it is proposed are:(«) Amendments designed to improve the methods by which may,, subject to certain necessary limitathe work arising under the act tions, exercise the powers and functions may be more expeditiously of the commissioner, and that the providealt with by the substitution sions of the act may apply when the of the position of second comsecond commissioner is dealing with a missioner for that of assistant case in the same manner as they ap^ly commissioner, and by setting when the commissioner is dealing with out in the law the powers and tlie case. The commissioner will have the functions which may be exsame power to review and alter any ercised by the second commissioner. (h) The enactment of an improved working definition of ""parcel of land."" (c) The alteration of tbe hour at which liability to tax accrues from ""noon on SOth June"" to ""midnight on 30th June."" (d) An improved method for the collection of the tax by an alteration in the provisions relating to the due date of payment of the tax. (e) Some machinery alterations relating to production of returns and information, to payment by defaulters of fees for registration of land tax as a charge on land and for removal of the charge, and to penalties for minor breaches of the law. In connection with the expression of the powers of the second commissioner, recently a tendency has been shown by some taxpayers to raise technical objections against the validity of some of the actions and decisions of the assistant commissioner, on the ground that the terms of the law require those actions and decisions to be made personally by the commissioner. There are some provisions of the law in respect of which that argument apparently holds, and therefove the commissioner personally has applied those provisions. The frequent absences of the commissioner from his head ofiice in Melbourne, in fulfilment of the very desirable policy of visiting each State capital so that taxpayers may have personal access to him, has tended to delay the work of the department in connection with those cases which must be dealt with personally by the commissioner. It is very desirable that this delay should be that there should be a definite statement in the law that the second commissioner action, decision, or determination as at present, thus enabling dissatisfied taxpayers to appeal finally to the commisit. sioner before carrying their cases to the board of review or the courts. Associated with this amendment is a provision for the preservation of allexisting and accruing rights or rights arising from serthe next succeeding financial year. At vice under the Public Service Act of tbe Commonwealth of the second commissioner. The existing provision for the commissioner and the assistant commissioner in this respect is being repealed, and a new provision applying to tbe commissioner and the second commissioner is included in the bill. Honourable members will find the information in clauses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the bill. cost that is involved? "" second commissioner"" is simply a change of name, and does not involve the payment of additional salary. The inclusion in the act of a more effective and workable definition of ""parcel of land"" than that which is contained in the present act is the second machinery alteration in the bill. The definition which is set out in clause 9 of the bill is that upon which the department has been working for the past seventeen years, and in regard to all lands except Crown leaseholds. The definition was applied by the department to Crown leaseholds when the original valuations of those lands were made; but the royal commission on the valuation of Crown leaseholds of 1924 discovered that in connection with those lands the law requires that each separate lease should be valued as if it were the only land held will be issued iu batches as they are preby the lessee. This requirement of the law has resulted in very great alterations in the values of Crown leaseholds. It is not proposed that the new definition of "" parcel"" shall be applied now to the valuation of Crown leasehold lands, as the work of revision of those valuations, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission, has been completed in many instances, and is being pressed on as rapidly as possible in the other cases. Furthermore, the tax on those lands is no longer in operation. The departmental definition now included in . the bill has worked most satiscovery of outstanding taxes. Experience factorily in the past. It is desirable, however, to give legislative authority to The bill alters tbe act so as to provide that ownership at midnight on the 30th June shall determine liability for tax in present the liability arises at noon on the 30th June. This is a very unsatisfactory provision, both for taxpayers and for the department. It has led to much unnecessary work to determine whether in fact a change of ownershi-o had taken place before or after noon on that date, and it is much better that midnight should be substituted for noon. The bill alters the present provisions of the law relating to the due date of payment of the tax. At present it is necessary for the Governor General to proclaim, each year, a due date of payment of the tax. Thirty days' notice of this must be published in the Gazette, and. a further 30 days after the proclaimed date is allowed for payment of tax without penalty. The period of 60 days allowed for payment of tax without penalty is being adhered to, but the necessity for the Governor General to proclaim a due date is being abolished. It it proposed that, in future, the due date for payment shall be 30 days after the service by post of the notice of assessment. This accords with the practice under all the other taxation acts where annual due dates of payment are involved. It is not intended to call upon land-owners for payment of tax at any earlier -date than at present. The issue of notices will be commenced, as formerly, in the month of March, and the notices pared. This will ease the work of the receiving branches of the department by causing the final dates of payment to be well distributed over a period of about two months, instead of being concentrated, as at present, into one day. The bill will also provide for power to impose a penalty for late payment of tax assessed on amended assessments. This power does not exist at present, and the department has been forced to lose time and money through the necessity to institute legal proceedings for the re-",26,Second Reading

There is no power at present to penadifference, because the amount of inlize such a taxpayer for his original deformation available in the department fault, unless legal proceedings are taken is now fairly considerable.

Frequently first two years, but in the third year the these defaulters are not discovered until loss should disappear. after the expiration of that time limit, and the department has no chance of readjourned. covering from them any part of the unnecessary expenditure to which it was put through the default. The amendment will remedy this defect in the law. The bill contains similar penalty provisions to those contained in the Income (vide page 912) on motion by Mr Tax Assessment Act for what might be MARKcalled minor breaches of the law, such .as failure to lodge returns, to supply information, to attend and give evidence With other members of the Opposition when called upon, and the omission of 1 am always pleased to see amendments taxable land from returns.

Another important objection I have to the measure is that it fails to remove a big obstacle in the way of State members becoming candidates for the Commonwealth Parliament. Clause2 of the bill is ambiguous, and in my opinion will result in thousands of persons engaged in the sugar and pastoral industries being prevented from exercising the franchise. declarations ? factory. They are often told that they are not eligible, and they give up their claim in disgust. nomadic workers have no fixed place of abode. In accordance with the present law the lionorable member for Kennedy( Mr G\ Francis) was automatically declared to be the representative of that electorate, through the unfortunate death of the late Honourable Charles McDonald, the day before the polling took place. I cast no personal reflection upon the honourable member for Kennedy, but the fact remains that he was not elected by the people. When the motion for the appointment of the Joint Select Committee was before the HouseI urged the necessity for widening the scope of the inquiry to permit the committee to consider how best to rectify the anomaly. Although certain additional powers were given to it, after I had made my suggestion, the Government did nothing along the lines I had indicated. On that occasion I suggested that the committee be asked to report on the advisability of holding a new election in the case of a candidate dying between the declaration of nominations and polling day. ment's inaction is most reprehensible. It had plenty of time to take steps to remedy the trouble, but it. failed in its duty. Many of rhe electors in the Labour stronghold of Kennedy feel the anomalous position very keenly. had such a good representative. electors had an opportunity of voting, they would return a member of another political party. Section 107 of the Electoral Act .1902-1911 readsIf after the nominations have been deical parties, he had his finger on the clared and before polling day any candiate dies pulse of public opinion, and I believe if and the candidates remaining are not greater in number than the candidates required to be elected, they shall forthwith be declared to be elected and the writ returned That provision was also embodied in section 83 of the 1918-1922 Act. Protests from electors in Kennedy caused me, soon after the last election, to ask the Prime Minister the following questionWill the Prime Minister give early consideration to tlie advisability of amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act in order to make it mandatory that in constituencies where only two candidates are nominated, and one dies between the date of nomination and polling, day, fresh nominations shall be invited? To this the Prime Minister repliedMany of these The efficient working of the Electoral Act is always receiving the consideration of the Government, and no matter affecting in any way its efficiency is overlooked. I do not think, however, tliat the suggestion of the honourable member requires immediate consideration. That answer did not meet my wishes. if a candidate died the day before the election ? declared null and void, and the electors given an opportunity at a later date of deciding who their representative should be. I did not suggest in my question h> the Prime Minister that the matter was one for immediate consideration. I indicated that it should be considered by the joint committee then about to be appointed. During the 1925 election, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) made a bold statement on this subject. He was reported in the Brisbane Courier of 17th November, 1925, to have saidThere was one thing about the elections The Governwhich he would alter if he had tlie power. He did not like the Kennedy scat in Queensland reverting as a walk-over to Mr Francis through the unexpected death of Mr Charles MciJonald. "" Of course it is law,"" he said, "" but it ought not to be. It strikes at the root of democracy by depriving people of the right of choice. It happens just now to tlie advantage of the Nationalists, but another time it might operate the other way with vital consequences. I think the Kennedy election should be declared null and another election held."" For six years Mr Hughes was the Nationalist Prime Minister of Australia.

I prefer the electors to have an opportunity to decide as to who* their representative should be."" Senate Labour candidates in the Kennedy electorate polled 2,311 votes more than the Nationalists. Three unknown Senate Labour candidates polled a majority of 2,311 votes in the Kennedy electorate over well-known and trusted Nationalist candidates. iii the honourable member's electorate did. other big majorities obtained by tbe not poll a majority of votes. 1,100 votes, but I had the honour of winsenting the political views of the Kenning the seat by 1,67S votes. The sitting member for the House of Representatives invariably' polls more votes than the Senate candidate of the same party. Putting aside the personal popularity of the that Kennedy is a Labour stronghold, and would have returned a Labour candidate if a new election had been ordered. may not Capricornia be considered a Nationalist stronghold ? the seat continuously for sixteen years. In the last federal election campaign the electors were stampeded by the misrepresentation indulged in by the Ministerial party, and the threat to deport those who fomented industrial trouble. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) said in a statement subsequent to the election Labour party because of his large personal following. Tbat was an admission larger vote than did the unknown Senate candidates. Senate in any division does not necessarily mean a majority vote for the same party in the House of Representatives. Senate candidates never poll as heavily as do the candidates for the House of Representatives. The honourable member obtained a bigger majority in the Oxley electorate than did his party's Senate candidates. The Labour Senate candidates obtained a majority of votes in 19 out of 23 subdivisions in the Kennedy electorate, and there is little doubt that a correspondingly larger majority in his electorate just as I did in At the last election, the Capricornia. In Charters Towers Labour polled 1,946 votes, and the Nationalists 1,638, leaving a majority of 306 for Labour. At Hughenden Labour polled 655 votes, and the Nationalists 423, a majority of 232 for Labour. At Longreach Labour polled 1,252, and the Nationalists 780 votes, showing a majority of 472 for Labour. I could quote Labour Senate candidates, and yet a Nationalist sits in this House misreprenedy electorate. election figures? within the Kennedy division are represented by Labour members. Throughout its history the electorate of Kennedy has been represented by a Labour member.

The polling in the electorate from the beginning of Federation had always given a Labour majority. obtained a majority of 11,633. In 1914 his opponents considered him so strong that' they allowed him a walk-over; they did not nominate any man to oppose him. In 1917, when Labour did not stand well in the country, he obtained a majority of 6,270. In 1919 his majority was 5,080; and in 1922, he had a ma jority of 5,567, although he had been a sick man, and had not been able to take any part in the campaign. It is absolutely the poll at the last federal election he would have won the seat by an overwhelming majority. fact, the electorate was looked upon as such a strong Labour seat, that the Nationalists carted it round and offered it to a number of people before they offered it to tbe honourable member for Kennedy. in the present electoral act, which permits a member to come into this House and talk about mandates from the people, and about the views of the people outside, although not sent here by the votes of the people themselves. The electoral law is wrong, unjust and undemocratic, and should be amended. I am going to move, when a suitable opportunity occurs, that it be amended, and I hope honourable members on the other side of the House will support the view of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr writer of political articles during election Hughes), who said that if be had the power he' would declare the Kennedy election null, and would give the people an opportunity of voting for their representative. I intend to move a new clause to be inserted after clause 13. It reads as follows:Section 107 is repealed. amended by inserting a new paragraph after the second* paragraph in the section as follows :"" An election shall be deemed to have wholly failed if , after the nominations have been declared, and before polling day, any candidate dies."" Sir. Forde. All the figures That is only a fair thing, and would give the electors an opportunity of saying who is to represent them. No one should support the practice of allowing a member to come into this House when the people have not had an oppertunity of voting for him. At the last election for the Kennedy electorate, Senate Labour candidates of the opposing party, and if the electors had had a chance, they would have sent a Labour representative to this House. In regard to clause 25, I am sorry that the Government intends to amend section 164 of the principal act by proposing to relieve journalists of the obligation to sign leading articles or reports of political meetings. No journalist should object to signing any article he writes. must come into this House and express As a matter of their views openly. Therefore, journalists who express their views in leading articles should have to sign them. ference between the two cases. Members of Parliament. speak under privilege. taken out in respect to any article, it is not the writer, but the newspaper, that has to answer tbe charge. The members of the Labour party know that 98 per cent, of the newspapers of Australia are opposed to it. If a journalist has not to sign leading articles he will often put unscrupulous and unfair things into them; things, perhaps, which he would be ashamed to write over his own name. I submit that every man filling the position of leader campaigns should sign them, and should not be ashamed to put his name to anything he might write. Another question is the eligibility of State members of Parliament to contest seats for the House of Eepresentatives. I think that the Government might see its way clear to amend the existing electoral law in that respect. Section 108 is cake is dough! opposition I may have. I think there will be a possibility of the honourable member's cake being dough, to use",31,Second Beading

A member of the Sydney City Council is not compelled to resign bis seat in order to contest an election for a federal seat, nor is a member of the Melbourne or of the Brisbane City Council compelled to resign bis seat. Why then should a member of the State Parliament have to resign before he is eligible to nominate for a federal seat? Electoral Act of 1902-1911, section 96 readsNo person who is, at tlie date of nomination, or who was, at any time within fourteen days prior to the date of nomination, a member of the Parliament of a State, shall be capable of being nominated as a senator, or as a member of the House of Representatives. Subsequently the Parliament of Tasmania and the Parliament of Queensland introduced legislation providing that a State member who resigned his seat in order to contest a seat for the Federal Parliament, and did not w in the seat, could resume representation of the State constituency without an election. Those amending bills were put through the State Pariliaments of Tasmania Queensland, and the present Premier of. Tasmania availed himself of that act to contest a federal seat. He was defeated, and resumed his seat in the State Parliament. altered. that, and to how you got around those provisions. Parliament passed tbe measure to which I have referred. I was hopeful that I would be able to avail myself of that act when I stood for the federal seat whicli I now represent. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) was then Premier of Queensland. The act was not put through specially for me, but because it was considered f a i r that a member of tbe State House should be able to get back his State seat if he failed torate, when between nomination day and to be elected for the Federal Parliament. Shortly after Queensland passed that act, the Federal Parliament brought the matter up again, and passed an Electoral Act, section 70 of which reads as f o l lows :No person who(a) is at the date of nomination a member of the Parliament of a State; or (6) was at any time within fourteen days prior to the date of nomination a member of the Parliament of a State; or (c) has resigned from the Parliament of a State and has the right, under the law of the State, if not elected to the Parliament of the Commonwealth to be re-elected to the Parliament of the State without the holding of a poll, In the Commonwealth shall be capable of being nominated as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. This was introduced about 1922, in order to defeat the acts put through the Tasmanian and Queensland Parliaments. It is very unfair of honourable members to place by legislation a barrier around themselves in an effort to keep from' this Parliament experienced members of State Parliaments, who should be desirable representatives of the people in the federal sphere. The electors should have the widest choice of candidates. Not every member of a State Parliament is prepared to resign his seat to contest a federal constituency. I myself took that risk and was successful, but there are and few State members who can afford to risk losing the salary that they receive as such. ' That anomaly in tbe Commonwealth electoral law not only prevents 90 per cent, of members of State Parliaments from becoming candidates at all been federal elections, but also deprives the electors of a choice of representatives I am leading up to from men whose experience would be in valuable in the Commonwealth ParliaI n 1922, the Queensland ment. Fully 99 per cent, of the electors believe that at federal elections a member of a State Parliament should be in the same position as an alderman of a city council, who is not required to resign his seat when becoming a candidate for a federal constituency. In the committee stage, I hope to move amendments necessary to wipe out ..that anomaly in the Commonwealth Electoral law, and also to provide for a new election in an elecpolling day, one of the candidates dies, as happened in the case of the late Hon.

There arc situated close to the mainland of my constituency many islands, the inhabitants of which receive a mail once every three weeks, thereby being deprived of a vote. Previous speakers have urged the Government to provide greater facilities, to enable every elector throughout Australia to record bis vote, and in this direction I shall in the committee stage ask the Government to give favourable consideration to the amendment that I shall then move. 1 was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr contest federal constituencies. I am enCharlton) express satisfaction with the effort that was being made under this bill to extend the opportunities for voting, and I believe that he also indicated that, it would be to the advantage of this country tp have uniform electoral laws. With that suggestion I am entirely in accord for several reasons, but before I deal with them. I should like to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Porde). "" I regret that he should have seen fit to confine his speech practically to the Kennedy seat. as well as that side, genuinely regretted the death Charles McDonald, who prior to thp last election represented that electorate. At that time, under tbe electoral law it was incumbent on the returning oflicer to declare Mr G. Francis to be the duly elected member for Kennedy, and I suggest that his constituents have cause to congratulate themselves on'the representation that they are receiving in this Parliament to-day. The honourable member for Capricornia, to support his argument that the honourable member for Kennedy did not represent the majority of his constituents, quoted at some length Senate election figures, which really, have no practical bearing on the subject. Taking the Senate figures as a basis, one might say that the honourable member for Capricornia himself ""is not representing the majority of the electors in his own constituency. majority. Dr. Nott. ence figures for the electorate of Capricornia were 21,525 for the Nationalist candidate, and 20,267 for the Labour candidate. The honourable member seems to have a mania for dealing with figures. M.r.

The honourable member for Capricornia contended that members of State Parliaments should not be compelled to resign their seats in order to tirely opposed to that contention for the reason that it would give State members an undue advantage over candidates other than sitting federal members. The honourable member compared the position of a State member with that of an alderman of a city council, but I would inform him that an alderman is seldom paid for his services. is paid £400 a year. nected with various city councils are reThis side of the House, ceiving payment for services alleged to be rendered, but if State members were perof the Hon. mitted to retain their seats while contesting a federal election, other candidates would be at a disadvantage because they would not enjoy free railway passes and other privileges.

For that reason I do not agree with the contention put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Capricornia. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowden), who took a prominent part in preparing the recommendations that have been embodied in that bill, refer in eulogistic terms to the returning officers, and I believe that every honourable member is in agreement with him.

I see no reason why journalists should be compelled to subscribe their names to political articles. There is nothing in the tone of the press to-day compared with that of years ago to indicate that the signing of articles has been of great value. Despite the fact that 98 per cent, of the newspapers are opposed to the political views of the Labour party, one must realize that at least fair reports are published by them. I hope that when the measure is put into operation, we shall have cleaner elections, and that the members elected will truly reflect the opinions of the various constituencies. I was surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) and the subsequent speakers allude to the bill as a machinery measure. No more important matter could come before the House than legislation dealing with the .electoral system. We have seen in various countries how vitally important it is that the electoral administration should be pure, if the whole foundations of democracy are not to be undermined. Again and again political confidence men have so abused the trust which has been reposed in them that they have been able tp hang on to ofiice against the wish of a majority of the people and to the detriment of the country. honourable members have expressed the view that everything possible should be done to maintain the purity of our electoral rolls, I trust that when ""the bill reaches the committee stage they will show by their votes that they mean what they have said. I was a member of the select committee that was appointed to inquire into our electoral law and procedure, and had the honour of being its chairman until a temporary absence from Australia, compelled me to resign that position. I took no hand in the framing of the report, but I assisted to bring out the evidence upon which it was framed. During my chairmanship the committee examined witnesses in Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. What most impressed me and every other member of the committee was that the men charged with the administration of our electoral law are of a fine type. I do not think one could reasonably expect to find in the Public Service men who are more qualified to carry out their work. They possess tbe confidence of all sections of the people. for the work which they do. a larger salary than they are receiving. But the salaries of public servants generally are determined according to certain principles, and I should not attempt to interfere with the present practice. In New South Wales the committee had the advantage of hearing the views of the Chief Electoral Officer for the State, Mr Harkness. He is recognized as one of the ablest men in the State Public Service. It appeared to me that he set out to justify his own system. At the same time he admitted that although, in his opinion,, a roll collected by the police was the truest immediately on compilation, it soon became not as pure as the Commonwealth roll. It must be obvious that a roll which is collected by electoral officers, whose sole duty it is to keep it up-to-date, must be more nearly perfect than one which is collected invariably not more than once a year. In some of tbe Commonwealth electorates the number of corrections each year represents 70 per cent, of the total enrolments, whilst in the majority of electorates it is I am pleased'that so many over 50 per cent. Therefore, a roll which is collected only once a year must be obsolete before it is printed. A roll can be kept fresh only by continuous collection. When the existing system was= initiated in 1911, the electors of Australia were not educated up to its requirements to the extent that they areto-day. It was found very difficult to induce the people to notify changes of address, or to follow' their movements. A great deal of credit fbr the correctnessof the rolls is due to the administration,.",35,Second Beading

WhilstI was chairman of the committee a number of instances of apparent duplication of voting and enrolment were brought to our notice. In Sydney and Melbourne we availed ourselves of the opportunity to inspect the (Sard index system at the chief electoral no warning of our intention. The allegations in regard to duplicate enrolment had been made in perfect good faith, but in every case We found that the administration had not blundered. An cxsergeant of Queensland police, who was living in Sydney, stated in evidence thathis daughter had been enrolled for a certain metropolitan electorate there, had visited Queensland for twelve months, and on her return, just prior to an election, had applied for and been granted enrolment for another electorate. We immediately inspected the card index system, and ascertained that the oflicer who had to deal with her second claim learnt from the card ""index that she was already enrolled for another electorate. He immediately advised the returning officer for the electorate concerned, and her naru°. was removed from the roll for the electorate she had left, and placed upon the new roll. * Prior to the introduction of compulsory voting, it was practically impossible to prevent a certain amount of dead wood from collecting on each roH. Under compulsory Voting,, the' duty was imposed upon electoral officers to try to trace every individual whose name Avas on the roll and who bad not voted. It was found that those who were not entitled to' be enrolled represented only aboUt5 per cent, of the total. That speaks volumes for jthe work which' was done by electoral officers prior to the purity of the rolls. Confusion often introduction of compulsory voting.

The officials had was pleased to hear the honourable menu ber for Parramatta ( Mr Bowden), who succeeded me as chairman of the committee, say he was perfectly satisfied that under the existing system the number of cases of duplicate voting is so small as to be unworthy of consideration. The committee took evidence from a number of divisional returning officers, each of whom submitted figures showing the number of duplications that had occurred at the previous election. They did not exceed three in any electorate, and in the majority of cases there were only one or two. We were perfectly satisfied that the charge of duplication could not be sustained even in those cases. One witness said his brother appeared to have voted, but he knew it was impossible for him to have done so, because he was in Long Bay gaol at the time. That was very strong circumstantial evidence; but we were inclined to believe that the witness himself had voted in his brother's name. It is impossible to be so certain of the absence of personation. It can be detected only when the vote is being recorded. If one man personates another, there is little chance of catching him after he has left the booth. It is only fair, however, to assume that personation to any extent must be accompanied by duplication; and. as there is no duplication we may dismiss from our minds the suggestion of personation. We have to thank our electoral officers for tbe arises because the names of persons who have left a district are seen upon the roll printed the names that appear upon it Those who cannot be removed until the succeeding roll is printed. The names of those who have ieft a district do not appear upon the official roll that is in? the possession of the divisional returning officer. the roll'.at a post office and finds his name there, he is misled if the name is not on the official roll.",36,Second Beading

174,Mr Hughesi,"When a man inspectsdividual cases of names having been wrongfully removed; but I am satisfied that the precautions taken by tbe divisional returning officers before they remove names from tlie rolls are so thorough that instances of injustice are few. The committee learned of many instances in which electors erroneously believed that they had suffered an injustice in this way. A clergyman gave evidence that, upon returning to his home after relieving in another parish for six months, he found that his name had been removed from the roll. He was confident that he had done nothing to cause that. Inquiries showed that after he had been away from his own parish for a month, he had been warned that he would be liable to prosecution if he did not transfer his name to the division in which he was temporarily residing, and he accordingly signed the transfer, which he had subsequently forgotten. Other complaints of that kind were made to the committee, but in almost every instance the electoral officers were found to be in the right. I was glad to hear that vindication, because prior to that inquiry I had no idea how efficient the Commonwealth electoral system is. We have heard a diversity of opinions regarding the necessity for the signed article provision, but the evidence received by the committee shows that it is so absolutely futile that I would be prepared to eliminate it entirely. During an election campaign, we see at the bottom of leading articles in the principal daily newspapers, "" Written by consultation to express the views of this journal."" Witnesses admitted that the editorial staff of a big daily newspaper meets each afternoon to discuss the policy to be enunciated in the journal next day, and one leader-writer is deputed to write in accordance with the aecision of the conference. I . doubt if there is one newspaper in the Commonwealth that has not infringed that signed-article provision since the last federal election. Some editors, who indignantly denied that they had broken the law, admitted that they had published unsigned paragraphs relating to the Eden-Monaro by-election. According to the strict meaning of the act, such paragraphs should have been signed. AnotherI have heard of inanomaly brought under our notice was that if a by-election were taking place in Western Australia, no unsigned report of, or comment on, the proceedings of this Parliament, could be published between the dates of the issue and return of the writ, although such parliamentary items might not have the remotest connection witli the by-election. The overwhelming majority of journalistic witnesses favoured the abolition of the signed article provision. To each was put the question, ""Did that provision restrain you from writing in stronger terms than you did,"" and the only one who admitted that he would have written more .bitterly had he not been under that restraint, was Mr Boote, editor of the Worker. have written more bitterly. honourable member. I read several of the articles signed by him, and I think they were as vitriolic as they possibly could be. I am honestly of the opinion that that section had not the slightest restrictive effect. To cover an inadvertent breach of the law some journals published a drag-net statement to the effect that "" for any unsigned paragraph published in this issue so and so will be responsible."" This signed article provision merely causes a great deal of Unnecessary trouble without being in the least effective. On the other hand, we heard of journalists having been intimidated because of articles they had signed. We know that journalists are required , after to write in accordance with the policy of their paper, and they quarrel with their That is .a true statement. bread and butter if they do not write as they are directed. Why should we victimize men by having them marked for vindictive reprisals because they have simply done what their employers obliged them to do? marked ? opponents. The only purpose of retaining this section is to victimize and frighten journalists.

Labour party to victimize the press? cised not over the press but over the individual writer. Repeatedly men have been intimidated because of having signed articles which may or may not have expressed their own political views. One provision which I am glad to find in the bill is that providing for a minimum fine of 10s. for breach of the compulsory voting section. The present act allows the magistrate to exercise his discretion in fixing a penalty, and some magistrates reduced the section to an absurdity by imposing fines that were ridiculously small. Another fact which came under our notice was the abuse of the immunity given to conscientious objectors. Some State electoral officers expressed the view that if any man stated that he had conscientious objections to voting that would be a valid excuse for his default. I do not agree with that. Most of us have conscientious objections to the payment of certain taxes, but we have to pay them. We respect certain religious sects, even if we do not agree with them. Some people have accepted responsibilities in accordance with their religious faith, and I would be the last to urge that those who have taken solemn vows should either break them or pay a fine. But men who neglect to vote and merely plead a conscientious objection are in a different category. I should be very sorry to see an injustice done in cases of that sort. They are on a completely different basis from the man who fails to vote, and then tries to get out of it by saying that he has conscientious objections. that. electoral officers the right to say what is, a privilege which must be very carefully or what is not, a reasonable excuse. The watched if it is not to be abused. honourable member for Darling( Mr do not go so far as to say that it should be BJakeley), when he was speaking, took wiped out altogether. exception to the last redistribution, and once, and a hardship was thereby inflicted said it was unfairly carried .out.

In some instances the bill now redistribution. There was no redistribefore us goes too far in regard to bution before the last election, and 1 doubt if honourable members can point, to a single Nationalist seat that has been lost in Australia as the result of tliat. election. There may be cases of injustice, but to say that because a party did not get auy advantage by redistribution, that redistribution must have been wrongly carried out is, to my mind, the height of absurdity. Butler say in South Australia that the gerrymandering would make the State safe for the Nationalist party for tbe next twenty years? acquainted with conditions in South Australia as is the honourable member, but I know that gerrymandering in the last New South Wales State election allowed seats to be won by men who would otherwise have lost them. Everyone who has the interest of democracy at heart ought to take steps to see that this sort of thing is stopped. We have seen instances of the transfer of electors just prior to an election, which has caused a particular party to win a seat which would not otherwise have gone to them. Further. I think that the redistribution margin at present is too great. The margin of one-fifth either way is too great, as far as New South Wales is concerned, to allow of proper representation. At present the margin allows for a difference of approximately 18,000. I hope the Minister will accept an amendment reducing the present margin of one-fifth to one-tenth, which would allow a margin of about 9,000. Another amendment I intend to move is in connection with witnessess for postal votes. It is the intention of this bill to allow any elector to witness a claim for a postal vote, but only certain authorized witnesses are with the honourable member for MaribyrI That was done",38,Second Beading

In regard to the card system, T should be sorry to see "" How to Vote"" cards prohibited. We want to see that it is made easy for the elector to give an intelligent vote. The question has been raised as to why the Government did not accept all the recommendations of the committee. absurd to raise such an objection, for if all the recommendations were necessarily accepted, it would be tantamount to leaving legislation in the hands of a committee. There is another recommendation of a. committee which will come before the House next week, but I know that honourable members opposite would not like that recommendation to be given effect to in its entirety. I rise, in the first place, to pay a tribute to the divisional returning officers,, and to others controlling the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth, for the very able manner in whicli they have discharged their duties to democracy. I trust their services will be recognized by the Government, and tliat it will' accept the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton),, designed to ensure that these officers are adequately recompensed for the overtime the work during the period of an election. not casual employees taken on for polling day. They have definite work to do all the year round. They are compelled' at election, time to do many hours of tiring and nerve-wr.acking work, being engaged frequently until, midnight and after. It is the duty of tile Government to see that they are properly recompensed for that work. After all, the life of a democracy, its security and.safety, depend'in the last resort, on the faith of the people. That' faith can only be secured' when the people are guaranteed that' the electoral machinery,, and their interests as electors, are properly-safeguarded.

I do not agree with the remarks'of the honourable' member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning), regarding the possibility of journalists being victimized if they are compelled to sign newspaper articles during election campaigns. The argument that this provision was enacted by a Labour government, and that tbe Labour party now want it to be continued in order that journalists might be victimized, is, in its very essence, stupid. It is not tenable It is on any ground whatever. What power of victimization does Labour possess over the powerful city press of to-day? How can Labour victimize journalists writing for capitalistic newspapers? Labour organizations have no "" pull "" over them,, and have absolutely no control over what they write or do. The journalists are simply doing the job for which they are paid. Every one knows the reason why we want these articles to be signed. Somebody in this House talked the other day about the traditions behind the press. Many of these newspapers,, however, attempt to trade on the reputation built up for them by men who have been dead for years. They want to trade on tbe prestige and dignity which they do not actually possess. When the public realize that it is only one person who is responsible for a leading, article, they will not be so much impressed. People are too apt to look upon a leading article as something beyond question. When leading' articles have to be signed-, they lose two-thirds of their value. . That is why honorableThese men are members on the other side do not wish them to be signed. They wish the article to be able to misrepresent"" the political partyto which they, are opposed. Tbe fact that tlie newspapers themselves went to the trouble to give evidence before the committee, wherever it sat,, opposing, the signing of articles, is sufficient indication that they,, at anyrate, saw that it was not in their interest, nor in the inr terest of the propaganda which they desired'to-spread!
