Defence Act was introduced in order to permit members of the Citizen Eorces, on their return to the Australian Military Forces in Australia, to retain the higher rank which they gained on active service. The position of a member of the Permanent Eorces is entirely different. The functions of the Permanent Forces are to form an instructional unit and to provide higher staffs for the Citizen Army. In order to fit them for such duty it is essential that in the first place members of the Permanent Forces should have a thorough sound elementary grounding. Then they must keep themselves up to date in improved methods of training and in the great developments in military equipment and improved armament that are continually taking place, and examinations are essential to ensure the constant study necessary for this purpose. Unless such examinations are insisted upon, the Military Board feels assured that the standard of efficiency in the ranks of the Permanent Forces will immediately deteriorate. It would not only fall below what is necessary for the peace training of the Militia Forces, but it would gravely militate against successf u l mobilization and the proper conduct of military operations in national emergency. In view of the foregoing it is not proposed to take any action to amend the Defence Act in the direction suggested by the honourable member. Defence, upon notice1.

59,Mr A. Green,"On the 30th April,£2.55] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill is a proposal for the establishment of an important new financial institution, which it is intended shall operate for the maintenance of the stability and security of Australia's monecial relations of industry, commerce, tary aud credit system. I am aware that this proposal has been received with somewhat mixed feelings, and that in certain quarters there appears to be misapprehension regarding it, but that misapprehension, I think, is not well founded. During my speech I shall endeavour to answer the criticism that has been published in the newspapers or otherwise expressed, and to justify the provisions of the measure. At the outset I may say that there was no sinister motive for the introduction of this measure; there is no sinister purpose behind the proposal to set up a central reserve bank. We are merely following a course that has been adopted in many other countries. The extension of central reserve banking is a notable feature of the financial developments in many countries in the world during the last ten years. To-day practically every important country in the world has a central reserve bank, the three outstanding exceptions being Australia, Canada and the Argentine. It is a rather remarkable commentary upon what can happen in the absence of central reserve banks that in those three countries there have been serious financial disturbances in the last couple of years, and that at the present time they are probably the worse sufferers from financial stress. States of America? the present time. It is true that last year financial crisis of 1907. the United States of America had a most disturbing experience because of over speculation on the stock exchange, but it was the federal reserve system which then came to the rescue of the monetary and credit system of that country, and probably saved it from a worse calamity. Some critics of this proposal question whether the present time is opportune for the introduction of this measure and the inauguration of a new system for the control and organization of credit in Australia. It is my opinion that tliere never was a more opportune rime for this action. It would not be opportune if the setting up of the central reserve bank would create confusion or disturb in any way the finanand exchange in Australia; but there are no sound grounds for believing that such confusion or difficulty will arise. There is a generally held opinion among economists, bankers, and financiers generally, that our existing banking aud financial system has proved defective, and that that has been partly responsible for the difficulties which Australia has encountered in the last year or two. The lack of means for the mobilization of our credit resources has been a serious defect in our monetary system within recent months. I have said that central reserve banking has been resorted to in many countries. That system is equally beneficial whether the established banking system be based ou a large or on a small number of banks. For example, in the United States of America the federal reserve system is in operation on a very large scale, and the number of banks in that country exceeds 25,000. A central reserve bank also operates effectively in the Union of South Africa, where there are only three banlcs; the successful operation of the reserve bank system does not depend on the number of separate banking institutions, nor on the magnitude of their operations. A central bank can aid greatly in tiding a country over a period of financial stringency and credit difficulties by concentrating the reserves of all the banks operating in the country, and enabling the best use to be made of them. The federal reserve system of the United States of America was established after the As the result of the great panic of that year much weakness was seen to exist in the financial fabric of that country, because of the tremendous disturbance caused and the absence of any authority which could prevent the calamitous movements that were taking place.",17,Defence Administration

61,Mr Gullett,What about the United,18,Central Reserve Bank Bil L Second Reading
62,Mr Theodore,"I am speaking ofTo prevent a repetition of that experience, the federal reserve system of hanking was inaugurated, and it has well -justified its existence. There are some who, while approving of a central reserve hank for Australia, think that we ought to allow the Commonwealth Bank gradually to become such a bank. They consider that there is no need to set up such an institution as the bill outlines. In answer to them, I can only point out that the Commonwealth Bank was established by its founders, and was carried on for a number of years, with an objective quite different from that desired in the establishment of a central reserve bank. The Commonwealth Bank was intended to be a trading institution, and to operate freely in competition with the private trading banks. In the course of its development 90 branches bave been opened in different parts of the Commonwealth, and it has carried its business far and wide in active competition with the private trading banks. It was only later in its career that an attempt was made to enable it to assume central banking functions. Originally it had not even control of the note issue. Subsequently it was given that control, and an attempt was made to enable it to develop into a central reserve bank; but it has not succeeded in fulfilling the funcseparate banking institutions. If those tions of such an institution, and cannot be regarded as a central reserve bank. The principal obstacle in the way of such development was the attitude towards the Commonwealth Bank of the private trading banks. They declined to deposit any considerable portion of their reserves with it, because they realized that such reserves might be used to further its active competition with them. One cannot blame the managers and controllers of the private banking institutions for that attitude. They realized that in the Commonwealth Bank they had a competitor of tremendous power; and it was unreasonable to expect them to strengthen that competitor by handing over to it large proportions of their reserves. A great many commentators on the Australian banking system have pointed out that the Commonwealth Bank cannot function properly as a central reserve bank while it is in active competition with the private banks. The present Government, recognizing this, has brought down the measure we are now discussing. We do not desire to destroy the Commonwealth Bank, and I do not think that there are many persons in the community who would like to see that bank abolished, or to see"" it retire entirely from the field of competition. We must, however, recognize the rights of the private trading banks, and if we want a central reserve bank in Australia it must be an institution separate from the Commonwealth Bank. This bill proposes to set up such an institution. time to bring forward the proposal? criticism directed against this proposal is based on the belief that this is not an opportune time at which to embark on an undertaking of this kind. I have yet, however, to hear any convincing argument in favour of that view. I cannot see any reason why the present time should be inopportune, and I know many reasons why it should be regarded as suitable. The existing system is deficient. The community is not getting the best results from the aggregate financial reserves it possesses, because those reserves are distributed among, and controlled by, a number of reserves were mobilized, concentrated, and used to the best advantage, the community as a whole would benefit. The present general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, Mr A. C. Davidson, has given much thought to this subject, and has written a brochure on it which has been largely circulated. In that publication he states that the Commonwealth Bank is incapable, as at present constituted, of ever becoming a central reserve bank, and he puts forward as an alternative the proposal that it should go out of the trading business altogether. He continuesFailing such a development it will become necessary to create in Australia an entirely new central reserve bank such as a recent commission has recommended in India. We recognize the force of that advice, and are now proposing to follow it. Before central reserve banks were set up in many countries that now enjoy them, searching inquiries into the whole subject were carried out. In some cases",18,Central Reserve Bank Bil L Second Reading
63,Mr Gkegory,I s this not rather a bad,19,Central Reserve Bank Bil L Second Reading
64,Mr Theodore,"Some of thespecial inquiries were made by royal commissions, such as that which dealt with the matter in India. We have had the advantage of their reports, and the principles laid down in them have been incorporated in this bill.' One authoritative critic in Australia has suggested that this measure be deferred until a royal commission had inquired into the subject. That might be a reasonable course if no inquiries of such a nature had been made elsewhere; but Australia is happily able to draw upon the experience gained in such matters in many other countries. There is no need of a further inquiry to inform ourselves of the principles which should be pursued or the constitution which should be laid down. Such information is already in our hands. One of the primary functions of this central reserve bank is that it should control the note issue, and be the sole note isdemands made upon it, are unusually suing authority. That should include the holding of reserves of gold and short dated securities. The bank should hold reserves of other banks, both for the benefit of the other banks, and for the protection of the public. would the establishment of a central reserve bank have on the currency? had the effect of stabilizing currency, which, to be a safe instrument in the financial system, must be capable of being effectively controlled. But it cannot be so controlled unless there is an efficient body, such as a central reserve bank, to control it. Here, as elsewhere, the central reserve bank will be able to utilize its resources to keep the currency stable, and the commodity price levels regular, and in conformity with the necessities and demands of the day. Credit will be expanded or contracted as may be necessary to meet particular circumstances. It is advanced by those who advocate the central banking reserve system that private banks are not able to make full use of their reserves without a central reserve hank. The Australian practice is for the trading banks to keep a reserve of from 16 per cent, to 18 per cent, against their liabilities. This is considered necessary for the safety of their business, and, in the aggregate, these reserves amount to a wry large sum. Under a central reserve banking system, a considerable proportion of those reserves could be utilized without impairing in any degree the safety and security of a bank's investments or the safety and security of its depositors. The private banks necessarily have to allow a far larger margin of reserve to meet unusual demands from their depositors than would be needed if there were a central reserve bank on which they could makedemands from time to time. In Great Britain all the banking companies lodge a proportion of their reserves with thf Bank of England. There is no compulsion, and no statutory minimum amount, that a bank must deposit with the Bank of England, but through many decades, if not centuries, the practice has grown of the banking companies lodging a considerable proportion of their reserves with that institution. If a British bank finds that the heavy, and that its funds are diminishing, it takes its bills to the Bank of England to get them re-discounted. In Australia we have nothing that exactly corresponds with the London Bill Market. Possibly our distance from our markets and from the principal financial centres of the world has made it difficult to effect transactions in commercial paper of the kind effected in the bill markets of other countries. But under a central reserve banking system there is hope that the bill market practice may grow in Australia. This would make for greater facility in private credit. The Australian banks have heretofore transacted short-dated loan business with financial operators and with traders by means of overdrafts. Should a central .reserve bank be established, as proposed in this bill, the private trading banks could still follow this practice, or they could get their paper discounted with the central reserve bank, or get a direct advance and by means of negotiable commercial bills establish a more convenient method of meeting the temporary credit requirements of their customers. re-discounting as against the overdraft system ? that any tangible value can be precisely stated.

68,Mr Theodore,"I do not know the overdraft system. With an overdraft there must be a definite term, a definite .rate of interest, and a definite period of repayment, and the transaction is confined to two parties. Under the bill discounting system, bills are accepted as negotiable security, and readily bought and sold ou the bill market. It may or may not be of great advantage to us to have this method of dealing freely with commercial paper. It is proposed in the bill that the tradreserve banking system is founded on the ing banks shall deposit 10 per cent, of their demand liabilities and 5 per cent, of their timeliabilities with the central reserve bank; in other words they will deposit 10 per cent, of the amount of their current accounts and 5 per cent, of deposits with it. Therefore at the outset the central reserve bank would have a minimum reserve of approximately £20,000,000, of which between £16,000,000 and £1S,000,000 would represent deposits made by the trading banks and the balance would be made up of amounts to the credit of current accounts with the various Governments doing business with the batiks. The Commonwealth Bank would be included witb the trading banks; the Savings Banks would not be so included. The Commonwealth Bank will be under exactly the same obligation as the other trading banks to keep a proportion of its reserves with the central bank. There has been an almost inexplicable misunderstanding by the Victorian banks of the purpose of the proposed reserve bank. In a criticism of this proposal which has been issued by the Victorian banks, it is stated that if they had to deposit 10 per cent, of their demand liabilities and a certain proportion of their time liabilities with the central bank, they would be seriously handicapped at a period like the present, when they needed to retain command of all their resources. Those banks show clearly that they have quite misunderstood the function which the proposed central reserve bank is intended to fill. At present the banks must keep certain reserves, and surely it does not matter where they keep them-whethe r in their own vaults, or in the care of a central reserve bank. have to keep some reserves themselves? would lodge perhaps half their reserves with the central reserve bank and retain the balance for their daily transaction and for till money. If honourable members consider that the proportion required to be lodged with the central reserve bank is too high, I hope that they will say so; it may be practicable to provide for some smaller proportion to be lodged. That is a mere matter of detail; but the central principle that the trading banks must keep a proportion of their reserves with it. kept, by the central bank iu other countries? States of America the proportion varies iu accordance with the geographical location of the trading banks in relation to the head offices of the various reserve banks.

If a proportion of those reserves were mobilized in the vaults of a central reserve bank they could be used'as a basis for making advances to one or morebanks to meet unexpected demands on their resources, whereas at present, practically the whole of the reserves are lying idle in the vaults of the separate private banks. The central reserve bank must hold 2""> per cent, reserve against its liabilities; but the reserve against deposits is increased to 50 per cent, on the amount of the deposits in excess of £20,000,000.",20,Central Reserve Bank Bil L Second Reading

76,Mr Theodore,"The aggregateThat means that of the aggregate deposits made by the other banks, the central reserve bank must keep at least 25 per cent, in reserve, of which at least half must be in gold; the balance may be invested in British Government securities or first-class trading bills negotiable on the overseas markets. That is a slight departure from the practice that has prevailed in Australia hitherto, but is adopted by most of the continental reserve banks, which keep a proportion of their reserves in England or other foreign countries with which they are doing business. mum duration of those negotiable bills? 120 days. The practice in other countries in regard to the holding of reserves against tbe liabilities of the central reserve banks varies greatly. In some instances there is a rigid reserve of up to 50 per cent -, and in other cases there is no statutory reserve. France has no legal minimum in respect of the central bank or the note issue. There is a disposition on the part of economists who have studied the monetary problem to believe that too great a reserve in gold is an onerous restriction that often works disadvantageously. In the March review issued by Lloyd's Bank, Professor Gustav Cassel, a leading authority on monetary problems, dealing with what he terms gold economy, saysTlio gold-economizing policy tliat I have advocated ever since 1020 contains two factors. Nobody can reasonably cavil at this Firstly, the use of gold coins as a circulating transfer of capital from the Commonmedium should be abandoned. The introduction of the now British currency not redeemable in gold coins, and India's abandonment of the idea of putting gold coins into circulathe Commonwealth Bank? tion, are the chief features that mark the success of this policy. The second measure for securing economy in the use of gold consists iu a reduction of the central banks' requirements of gold reserves. conference in 1922 recommended the co-operation of tlie central banks for this purpose and take over certain other functions and a cerlr.in concentration of gold reserves in some '/ending financial centres. That comment throws an interesting light on modern thought in regard to the value and utility of gold reserves. We are providing in this bill that the central bank shall keep 50 per cent, of its statutory reserves in gold; the balance may be invested in securities that will earn interest in the markets in which they are likely to be of the greatest use. The central reserve banks of Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany have special sanction to hold a portion of their reserves abroad in markets where they are doing their principal exchange business. The bill provides for the transfer of £2,000,000 from the Commonwealth Bank to become the initial capital of the new central reserve bank. In setting up a central bank we are fortunate in having that capital to call upon, for it obviates the need to ask the public or the existing banks to subscribe capital, as has been done in connection with many other central reserve banks established 'in recent years, or for the Commonwealth Parliament to appropriate money for the purpose. This transferred £2,000,000 will provide all the capital that will be necessary for the functioning of the new institution, and will be added to from time to time out of the profits of the bank as its business progresses. a loan from the Commonwealth Bank to the central reserve bank? absolute transfer of part of the existing capital of the Commonwealth Bank, and it is justified, because a considerable proportion of the profits of the Commonwealth Bank have been made out of the control of the note issue and the lending of money to other institutions, which are the functions of a central reserve bank. wealth Bank to the ncAV institution. with reduced functions but still with The Genoa almost unimpaired capacity to make profits.

In that way it will build up its own capital. Although it must charge for its services, profit-making w ill not be a primary or even important function of the bank.

We are providing for a board of directors, which will consist of a governor, two deputy governors, the Secretary to the Treasury, and five other directors representative of the commercial, banking, and other interests of Australia; eight members in all. It has been suggested that the governor of the bank should not be the chairman of the board of directors; but there is a good reason for having the governor the principal executive and the principal controlling officer of the bank. If we have a chairman of directors, some one separate aud distinct from the governor of the bank, we may get a clash of authority, especially if both persons are of a dominating character and have a high status in the commercial and financial world. I have studied the constitutions of a number of reserve banks throughout the world, and I find that almost invariably the chief executive position corresponds witb that of the governor of the bank. He may be appointed for a limited period, but yet devote the whole of his time to the business of the bank. We are following the practice that seems to be the most advantageous. is there such a large number of directors ? give the right honourable member detailed information on the subject when we are discussing the bill iu committee. A number of central reserve banks on the Continent have a sufficient number of directors to give separate representation to different interests, such as commercial, manufacturing, and banking interests, and in many cases special representation is given to labour, not in a political sense, President of the Republic, on the recombut as a factor in the life of the community. The Labour representative is not a political nominee. He represents the wage-earning community as distinct from the commercial and manufacturing interests. In that sense it is desirable to give representation to Labour. ary producer? vided for in the sense that he is to have representation on the board. selection ? for the appointment of a representative by the Governor General. What practice the Government will follow in making recommendations to the Governor-GeneralI am not able to say at present; naturally those details have not yet come under consideration. I presume that the practice will be followed in respect to representative bodies that they will be asked to submit nominations. make the appointments. Governor General makes the appointments. The bill provides that the directors shall be appointed for three years, but it may be necessary to alter that provision, and to appoint the directors for a term of five years, so as to arrange for annual retirements in rotation. The appointment of the governor by the Governor General has been criticized. I have examined the constitutions of a number of central reserve banks throughout the world, and I find that almost invariably the principal executive officer is either the governor, or as he is called in some cases, the president of the bank, and that officer is usually appointed by the Government. In the United States of America the governor of the bank, the vice-governor, and all the directors are appointed by the President of the United States, the governor being appointed with the approval of the Senate. In the case of the National Bank of Belgium the appointments are made by the Crown, and suspensions and removals of officers are also made by the Crown. The Governor and the two Deputy Governors of the Bank of Erance are appointed by the mendation of the Finance Minister. The Governor of the Bank of Japan is appointed by the Government, upon imperial nomination, and the Vice-Governor with imperial approval. I take that to mean that the Governor is appointed by the Government upon imperial selection and nomination, and that, in the case of the Vice-Governor, the directors select a person who has the approval of the Government. In the case of the South African Reserve Bank, the Governor and Deputy Governor are appointed by the Governor General.

132,Mr Theodore,"Unde r the bill theleading central reserve banks of the world, the process is similar to that which we are laying down, that the Government takes the responsibility for the appointment. The only exceptions occur where either authorities or individuals find the whole or a proportion of the capital of the hank. Where the whole of the capital, or the principal part of it, the matter, the bill can be amended in is found from government funds, the Government exercises the prerogative of selecting the principal governing officer. The capital of some central reserve banks is derived partly from government funds, partly from private banks, and partly from subscriptions by the public. In those cases there is a different mode of selecting directors and governors. some cases direct representation is given to subscribers, and in other cases the directors are elected by the shareholders, and select the governor of the bank. I have been asked to give reasons for the proposal to have two deputy governors. The only reason is that the central reserve bank will have two main functions to fulfil, and it may be advisable to have in control of each of those functions a man who is a specialist in them. One of the main functions of the central reserve bank will be to control the fiduciary issue, the currency, and gold reserves of the country, and it will he necessary to have a specialist at the head of that department. This officer will have heavy responsibilities. The other main functions of the bank will be to make advances, control issues to the market, and raise and manage governmental loans. The man who is charged with responsibility for the proper discharge of those functions will require a different kind of knowledge, and such work may properly be left to one who is expert in such matters. No political principle is involved in the proposal to have two deputy governors. be able to outvote the governor, and reduce him to a figure-head ? fact that they h.ive a seat on the board will not enable them to do that. There will be, iu all, eight directors. Provision is made for an executive committee of directors, to act in the interval between the meetings of the directors. As that committee will be appointed by the board of directors, it is not likely, nor would it be desirable, that they will appoint the governor and two deputy governors. There is a greater likelihood of the appointment of the governor and two ordinary directors, who will be accessible and available. If there is any doubt upon committee to provide that the executive committee shall not consist of three permanent officers of the bank. in any other country? serve Bank of New York has five deputy governors, and the Bank of France two In deputy governors, while in a number of other reserve banks there is more than one. The practice varies throughout the system of reserve banks. the Bank of England? deputy governor of the Bank of England; but there is a controller, whose authority is almost identical with that of a deputy governor. Sir Ernest Harvey was Controller of the Bank of England until last year, when he was appointed Deputy Governor of that bank. There are in that institutionhighly authoritative executive officers who are not designated deputy governors. a dangerous provision to allow the board of directors to appoint an executive committee? May it not exclude entirely some important section? directors is not to appoint the executive committee, who does the honourable member suggest ought to make the appointment? should be no executive committee. that the board shall meet at least once a month; but there must be some authority with power to give decisions from day to day, if necessary, or at any rate more frequently than once-a month. That is the reason for the provision which has been made in connection with the executive committee.

The next point raised by the Chamber of Commerce is(ti) In the bill under consideration the provision for both administrative and executive control, and the appointment of directors and governors appears to lie unsound and unbusinesslike. I have already replied to that contention in dealing with other aspects of the bill. The next point refers to the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank, and is set out in the message as follows:(c) That the banking proposals of the Government as regards tlie alteration in the constitution and administration of the Commonwealtli Bank should, at the same time, be placed before the public. That is rather an important point, which is the basis of some other criticism also. It has been suggested that a bill defining the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank after the central reserve bank has been established should be introduced and considered side by side with the present measure. The reason why that has not been done is that it would be a waste of parliamentary time to embark upon the consideration of such a comprehensive measure until we know the fate of the central reserve banking bill. I wish to assure honourable members, however, that the amending Commonwealth Bank bill will contain only such provisions for the alteration of the existing law as will be the consequential amendment of the law.

The bill has been widely reviewed in Australia and abroad. I was pleased to read that most of the overseas criticism was of a favorable nature. In most quarters it was admitted that a central reserve bank would be advantageous to Australia in the present state of our trade and national development. There is much detail involved in this proposal, and the discussion of it can be appropriately reserved until the bill is in the committee stage. I shall welcome any constructive criticism which honourable members have to offer, and any suggestions which will lead to the improvement of the bill and the setting up of a sound central banking organization in Australia will be received with pleasure by the Government and acted upon. adjourned. WINE EXPOET BOUNTY BILL . Debate resumed from 30th April (vide That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, which was brought forward by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs yesterday, is for the purpose of extending the period during which bounty is to be paid on fortified sweet wines exported from this country. It is proposed to extend this period for a further four and a half years, and to increase the rate of bounty as from the 12th March, from Is. a gallon to Is. 9d. a gallon. Concurrently with this increase in bounty there is to be an increase of 5s. per gallon in the excise duty on fortifying spirit used in wine. That increase of 5s., stated in terms of taxation upon the wine itself, is equivalent to Is. Id. per gallon of wine consumed in Australia. Formerly there was collected on spirit used for fortifying wine an average of 5s. Sd. per gallon. The duty was 6s. per gallon on fortifying spirit made from grapes other than doradillos and 5s. per gallon on spirit made from doradillos. About two-thirds of the spirit has to pay the 6s. excise, the other third 5s. and the average tax collected was thus about 5s. Sd. per gallon. The average will now be 10s. 8d. per gallon. It is proposed to retain an amount equal to the proceeds from the old rate of tax for revenue purposes. Both the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) and the Prime Minister have made that clear. Speaking for myself, I do not quarrel with the Government on this score, because I regard reasonable taxation on alcoholic liquor as a fair means of obtaining the revenue that is so necessary. But I shall point out to honourable members that as the bill is drafted it will be absolutely impossible for the Government to do as it proposes to do. drafted to cover the point to which the honourable member proposes to refer. with the bill as it was introduced by the Acting-Minister. [Quorum formed.] If we export 2,000,000 gallons of wine in the coming season-and that is a conservative estimate, for in the past we have exported more than 3,000,000 gallons in a season-the Government will have to refund to exporters as drawback nearly two-thirds of the amount which it has indicated it intends to retain as revenue. It is proposed to pay the extra 5s. per gallon tax into a trust fund from which the new bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon is to be paid. The Government has applied the principle of the Paterson butter stabilization scheme to the wine industry. The bounty will be provided by the industry itself. But there has been an almost incredible oversight, which has reduced the whole proposal to an absurdity. The Government has forgotten that, unlike the butter industry, the wine industry receives this assistance in two parts; first, as a drawback on the tax paid on exported wine, and secondly, as a bounty. Of course, there is no excise duty on the exported wine. It would be unthinkable to tax directly any exported commodity. Until",30,Earle Pauu What Is Meant By Large Stock And Share Brokers And Opera

It had completely forgotten to take into consideration the. fact that the drawback mi the wine exported was greater by one-third tban the amount paid in bounty. ment will be moved which will cover that point. ordinary that such an oversight could have occurred. The lirst evidence of the fimipoion is in sub-clause 3 of clause 4 which readsThere shall he payable monthly out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, into the Trust Account established in pursuance of this section, a sum equal to five shillings upon every gallon of spirit for fortifying Australian wine upon which spirit duty of excise is paid, or h -i-since the twelfth day of March, One. thousand nine hundred and thirty, been paid. F u r t h e r evidence of it is to be f o u n d in sub-clause G of the same clause, which readsThe surplus iu the trust account, after all claims for bounty in respect of fortified wine exported from the Commonwealth during the \ieriod specified in section five of this act have been paid and after repayment to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of any amount which has been paid from that fund into the trust account in pursuance of the last preceding sub-section, shall be applied in the prescribed milliner in the marketing overseas and the encouragement of the export of Australian wines. Those words entirely preclude the possibility of taking the drawback out of the trust account. It may be possible to amend the bill to provide that the drawback shall be taken front the trust account, but it cannot be done as the bill is now worded. gallon drawback will come out of the trust account. made for that, the difficulty to which I have directed attention will be overcome; but it is extraordinary that the Government should have brought down the bill in this form. The proposal now before us is that the equivalent of 5s. per gallon shall be paid into Consolidated Revenue, whether the wine is used locally or exported. That, of course, cannot be done. The Government, to that extent, is chasing a phantom. If we turn to the other side of the ledger we shall find another extraordinary provision which the Acting Minister may also have discovered by now. It is proposed to retain for revenue purposes an amount equivalent to the yield from the old excise duty. tained, less the drawback. by the Acting Minister yesterday did not. take the drawback into account. The honourable gentleman said yesterday that the average amount of excise collected iu the last five years, on the basis of 5s. Sd. per gallon, was £354,000, and this, he said, he regarded as a fair contribution to the revenue. He added that he looked forward to retaining the whole of that amount under the new scheme. honourable member's words while he was speaking. As the bill is drafted it will not be possible to retain anything like that amount. It, is unlikely that the enlarged drawback of 2s. 4d. will be paid on the wine that will be exported during the next few months, for it will have been made with fortifying spirit on which the old rate of excise was paid. But soon the new drawback of 2s. 4d. per gallon must become operative. From where is that money to come? It cannot come from the trust fund, for the terms of the bill will prevent that. We have to assume, therefore, that the whole of the 2s. 4d. drawback must come from Consolidated Revenue and that a sort, of contra account must be set against the excise revenue which it was hoped to retain. To what extent will this drawback reduce the £354,000 which the Government expects to retain as revenue if we export 2,000,000 gallons of sweet wine per annum. I have already said this is a conservative figure. It is true that last year we exported something less than 2,000,000 gallons, but it is confidently expected that we shall export fully 2,000,000 gallons this year, and on this the full drawback will have to be paid. It must be apparent, therefore, that two-thirds of the revenue which the Government hoped to obtain will disappear.",31,Second Beading

169,Mr Paterson,"I took down theLet me give a concrete illustration to make my meaning clear. I w ill assume tliat our local consumption w ill be 4,000,000 gallons of fortified sweet wine. Various estimates.bave been made of tbe amount of fortified sweet wine consumed in Australia. These vary from something under 4,000,000 to 4,250,000 gallons; but I think that 4,000,000 gallons is a f a i r estimate. If we export 2,000,000 gallons the total production on which excise duty will be paid w ill be 6,000,000 gallons. Under the new rates of excise the Government w i ll collect on this quantity about £700,000. Nearly half of this, or about £330,000 of it, will go into the trust payment the encouragement of the industry in other directions. A iit.tle more than half£370,000-wil l go into general revenue, and the Minister optimistically supposed that it can be retained there. Thef u l l drawback on 2,000,000 gallons at 2s. 4d. per gallon will amount to £233,000, so that nearly two-thirds of the amount paid into general revenue would disappear, leaving only £137,000. Turning to the other side of the picture, we find that the amount paid into the trust account, £330,000, would suffice to pay not merely Is. 9d., but 3s. 3£d. per gallon on 2,000,000 gallons of exported wine. I will illustrate what might happen if the bill be left in its present form . Let us assume that as a result of the stimulus egiven to the industry, the exportation of wine increased to 4,000,000 gallons. If we continued to consume 4,000,000 gallons of sweet wine in Australia, the total production would be 8,000,000 gallons, on which the gross excise revenue would, be f930,000. Of that amount the trust, fund would absorb £440,000 and revenue would receive £490,000. Thef u l l drawback on the 4,000,000 gallons would amount to £400,000, which would absorb nearly the whole of the revenue. whole of the bounty was paid out of general revenue. bounty and the drawback was only 2s. 3d., but under this bill, 2s. 4d. w ill have to be taken out of general revenue for drawback alone. Yet the Minister argued yesterday that his proposal will retain more for revenue than is retained under the existing legislation. Assuming that our export trade developed to 4,000,000 gallons per annum, the trust fund, as the bill is drawn, would still be buoyant, and the £440,000 paid into it would suffice to pay a bounty on this huge quantity ai the rate of 2s. 2it\. per gallon. [Quorum formed.) The reason why the trust fund would remain so strong while the revenue dwindled to practically nothing, is that the new portion of the excise. duty on fortified spirit, the extra 5s., evades its rightfu l share of the drawback payments, while the old tax has to carry not only the drawback applicable to it , but, also fund to be used for the the drawback applicable to the new tax. of the bounty and for The one means of insuring that these two shares of the excise shall retain their relative proportion-by shares, I mean the portion which goes into trust fund , and the portion which is intended for revenue-is by arranging that each shall provide its own share of the drawback. The effect of this would be to l i m it both the trust fund portion and the revenue portion to the excise duty collected ou locally-consumed spirit. On a basis of a local consumption of 4,000,000 gallons the trust fund at 5s. per gallon of for t if y in g spirit, would receive about £220,000 per annum, and the revenue about £250,000. The latter figure is £100,000 less than the Minister estimated, but he must realize that it is out of the question to expect to obtain any revenue from the exported proportion, which must leave our shores free of excise duty, but it is £113,000 more than he will get. if the bill is passed iu its present form. As for the trust fund, the £220,000, representing 5s. per gallon of for t if y in g spirit used in wine for local consumption, would suffice to pay a bounty of 3s. 9d. per gallmi on' 2,500,000 gallons. If the honorahle member for Angas( Mr Gabb) is correct in saying that the local consumption of sweet wine is nearly 5,000,000 gallons, sufficient excise duty would be collected to provide a bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon on more than 3,000,000 gallons of exported wine. Clause6 of the bill contains a defect which is evidently due to an oversight. It readsThe rnte of bounty payable under this act. shall be one shilling and ninepenee per gallon",32,Second Beading

I assume that the object of that provision is to provide for the interim between the 12th March, when the new bounty became operative, and the passage of this bill. Assuming that 'the bill is passed on the 12th May, a period of two months will have elapsed from the date on which the proposed new bounty started, during which a. certain quantity of wine will have been exported and on which bounty at the rate of Is. will have been paid or be payable. The clause is evidently intended to enable an additional 9d. to be paid in respect of wine on which Is. has already been paid. But an oversight has occurred in connection with Canadian wine. The last Government allowed the original bounty of Is. 9d. to continue to apply to wine exported to Canada. Australian wine is not given the same preference in the Dominion as in the United Kingdom, and the object of allowing the bounty to continue at Is. 9d. for a further period was to help the development of the Canadian market. drafted, it will be competent for a merchant who haa exported wine to Canada between the 12th March and the date of the passage of this bill, to claim an additional 9d., and thereby obtain a total bounty of 2s. 6d. I presume that the Acting Minister did not intend that more than Is. 9d. should be paid in respect of wine exported to Canada. interpretation of the clause as drafted that the exporter to Canada may claim 9d. over and above the Is. 9d. to which lie is entitled under the old act. I suggest to the Minister that this clause requires amendment. Although we are now dealing with sweet wine, I should like to pay some little attention to the amount of the bounty itself, which is now Is. 9d. The Government has shown itself to be as changeable as the chameleon in regard to the amount of the bounty, and in regard to almost everything that it has done since it was first indicated in the press that it was proposed to increase the bounty to Is. 6d. In the first place we read in the press that the Government had decided, meeting all sections of the trade, to increase the bounty from Is. to Is. 6d. That was evidently the considered opinion of the Government. All went merry as a wedding bell until the Acting Minister announced some few days afterwards the intention of the Government to collect an additional 5s. excise. That increase in excise brought a storm of protest about the Government's ears, and those engaged in the wine industry realized that while they were to get 6d. extra in bounty-the amount proposed at that time-the y were to give far more to the Government. The wrath of the indtxstry was brought down on the heads of the members of the Government to such effect that they did not stand their ground. The Government realized that the increased excise which it proposed could not be justified if it were regarded as merely being imposed to balance the increase in the bounty, and in order to stop the clamour it offered as a sort of sop to the wine industry to increase the bounty to Is. 9d. I do not know whether it has occurred to the Acting Minister that the bounty of Is. 9d. per As clause 6 is gallon on exported wine is slightly more than enough to pay for the whole of the grapes used by the makers of that wine at the rates laid down by the Acting Minister. If we take doradilloes on the basis of £5 15s. per ton-whic h I think is the price set out in the list-and if we take the other grapes used for the wine itself as distinct from the spirit, at, say, £7 10s. or* £8 per ton, we shall find that the yield that would be obtained from those varieties would work out so as to cost the makers about Is. 8d. a gallon; therefore this bounty of Is. 9d. is just a little more than enough to pay for the whole of the grapes. The wine-maker begins with getting his grapes for nothing and Id. thrown in to the bargain. Viewed from another angle, this bounty is more than suflicient to provide for wood and freight on the wine. The Government was induced to change its mind again by pressure put upon it by those who had made contracts and who pleaded that the old excise should obtain. The Government gave way, and the Minister brought in a schedule in addition to that which he had previously brought down, increasing the ex-",33,Second Beading

173,Mr Paterson,"It is a reasonableeise, which restored the previous excise on fortifying spirit used in wine which was the subject of contracts already made. Again pressure was placed upon the Government by the makers who were caught with large stocks in bond. The Prime Minister made quite a rhetorical display in this chamber, and pointed out that it was quite useless for those gentlemen to attempt to intimidate the Government; that the Government was going to stand its ground, and that the additional excise would remain. Shortly afterwards these gentlemen came to Canberra, and the Government again gave way. I do not suggest for one moment that all these decisions or re-decisions of the Government were wrong. The point that I wish to emphasize is that these repeated changes of ground show that the Government acted in the first place without full consideration, that it acted first and thought afterwards. The bill as it stands is a priceless illustration of that. proposed increase of the bounty to Is. 9d. will no doubt be popular, but that does not necessarily mean that it will prove to be in the best interests of the industry. To obtain the proper perspective we have to go back over recent years. established the export sweet wine industry by means of bounties ranging from 2s. 9d. net for the first three years, then Is. 9d. for one season, and Is. thereafter up to the 31st August, of this year. It is important for honourable members who are interested in this subject to remember the incidence of British duties with regard to empire and foreign -wines during this period. When we began exporting sweet wines under the bounty of 2s. 9d., we had a preference in Great Britain of only 2s. per gallon on wines of our own strength and class, and Ave were at a disadvantage of Is. 6d. as against Avines that wore a little loAver in strength than our OAVU. wines up to and not. exceeding 30 degrees proof spirit. Our wines had to bear Is. 6d. more duty than those foreign wines. Then Avhen the Baldwin Government assumed office early in 1925 we obtained an additional preference of 2s. per gallon. had a preference of 4s. instead of 2s. on wines of our strength and class, and an advantage of 6d. on rather lighter wines up to 30 degrees proof spirit, instead of, as previously, a disadvantage of Is. 6d. We Avere, all round, 2s. a gallon better off in our competition Avith foreign Avines. The former Government, in vieAv of the alteration in the incidence of the British preference, Avould have been justified in reducing the bounty of 2s. 9d. at an earlier stage than it actually did. The bounty was, after three years, reduced to Is. 9d. The next change that took place in Great Britain brought all foreign Avines of over 25 degrees proof spirit into the class on Avhich the higher duties Avere charged, the datum line being reduced from 30 to 25 degrees. The division between light wine bearing a low duty and heavier Avine bearing a high duty was moved dowmvards so that all these Avines Avith AA'hich Ave formerly competed, wines of 25 to 30 degrees proof spirit which previously bore a lower rate, ail came under the higher rate. We thus had a 4s. preference. The Instead of merely an advantage of 6d. over Avines a little Aveaker than our OAVJI Ave had an advantage of 4s. on the whole of our Avines, and the only Avay the Portuguese and Spanish Avine people could, to some extent, frustrate that very heavy additional impost The Bruce-Page Government was by more or less unsuccessful attempts at blending. It will be noticed that successive diminutions in the bounty by the Bruce-Page Government synchronized Avith better and still better preferential treatment from Great Britain. It is true that, at about the time Avhen the last reduction was made, so-called British Avines came into the field, wines which Avere made from cheap foreign must, on Avhich the makers had to pay to the British Government an excise of Is. a gallon. The Australian wine industry thought that that excise should be more than Is. and they clamoured to haA'e pressure put upon the British Government to increase it. I remember, when introducing the bill for the reduction of the bounty from Is. 9d. to Is., that I pointed out to honourable members who talked in that way, that one of the greatest obstacles to the British Government increasing the excise We therefore on their own Avines made from imported must Avas the existence of such a substantial and generous bounty as Is. 9d. per gallon on our Avines competing with theirs. I pointed out that probably one of tlie things that we might hope for that time, there were over 3,000,000 from a reduction to Is. would be that gallons in stock in London. He also said Great Britain would increase its own that those stocks had now been reduced to excise, and thus to some extent n u l l if y about 1,900,000 gallons.

189,Mr Forde,"I should like to knowhis opinion; he may have been a member of the deputation which asked that the bounty be increased to Is. 9d. a gallon. ful of the result of an increased bounty were it not for the existence of the Export Control Board; for the simple reason that, as the Minister said yesterday, buyers in Great Britain sought reduced prices in accordance with the increase in the bounty. No power on earth could have prevented them from obtaining that reduction if we had not had an export control board, because of the position of the industry in Australia to-day. There are large quantities of wine on hand, and it is necessary for certain makers who are in financial difficulties to effect sales immediately. Practically the full advantage of the additional bounty would have gone to the British merchants but for the check which was put upon them by the board that was established recently. I join with the Minister in hoping that the hoard will use the power that it possesses to so regulate exports as to avoid unnecessary accumulations in London. I trust that, if necessary, it will even go so far as to fix a price below which wine may not be exported, and that it will prohibit sales on consignment. So long as wine is sent overseas on consignment, for sale at what it will fetch at auction, it will be impossible to get out of the difficulty in which we have found ourselves for some years. A further argument in favour of the board taking action to prevent exports at a rate greater than the capacity of the market to absorb them is that, within twelve months, a 3 per cent, evaporation takes place. That is to say, a 65-gallon hogshead loses by evaporation 2 gallons in twelve months. The longer we keep our wine the less freight we have to pay. If we export it before the evaporation takes place we pay freight on 2 gallons which later does not exist. factor is that costs of bonding, rental, &c, are greater in Great Britain than they are in this country. It will thus be seen that it pays us to mature our wines as much as possible before they are exported. opposed to the increase in the bounty? regard to the increase is affected by the fact that it is being paid out of taxation imposed on the industry itself. I have no objection to a bounty that is fixed on that basis. But, having admitted that, in the interests of the industry I very much question the wisdom of the increase to this highly artificial level. I believe that it would have been better for the industry if it had battled on a little longer with its feet nearer to the ground. I wish to allude to the provisions that relate to industrial conditions. It is surely unusual to include conditions of that kind in a bounty measure. I agree that it should be the object, of the Government to give a fair deal all round. It is essential that provision should be included in the bill to safeguard the growers in regard to prices. The object of this measure is to assist the grape-grower, not the wine-maker. But I do not think that that should extend to industrial conditions, which in my opinion are foreign to a bill of this character. ""We have State wages boards and a federal arbitration court. It is their duty, and the duty of the unions to which the men in the industry belong, to look after the conditions under which they have to work. It seems to me that we are doing something unusual in embodying provisions of that kind in a bounty bill. cluded in other bounty bills, including some introduced by the last Government. remarks the Government has undoubtedly overlooked the important factor of drawback. The Government expected a substantial amount of revenue as a result of the alteration of excise duties. The Acting Minister quoted the figure £350,000, which he hoped would go into revenue. I wish to point out that nothing of the Another kind will happen. Even after the amendment referred to by the Acting Minister, that estimate will have to be reduced by one-third. I also wish to remind the Acting Minister of his obvious oversight in regard to the payment of 9d. per gallon referred to in clause 6 which, in my opinion, would apply to wines sent to Canada on which Is. 9d. bounty is already being paid.

In that regard he has fulfilled his duty as a member of the Opposition. I do not agree with him. however, in wishing that the industry had its feet a little nearer to the ground before after I had ceased to be a member of the an increase in bounty was given. [Quorum formed.] I fear that if the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr in 1928 to Is. a gallon. During that Paterson) had remained a Minister, and had continued to hold the views he has expressed to-day, it would not have been very long before the wine-growing industry was, figuratively speaking, underneath the ground. I propose to review the history of the bounties paid in respect of this industry; to review the principles of the bill itself; to comment on the increase of the excise rates on spirit used in fortifying wine; to refer to the efforts that have been made by some wine-makers to thwart the purpose of this bounty; and to issue a warning to grape-growters engaged in the industry. The need for paying a bounty to assist this industry can be traced back to the Great War. When the State Governments were faced with the task of repatriating their returned soldiers, some of them, including that of South Australia, resolved to place many of the men in the grape-growing industry for winemaking and for the production of dried fruits. This bounty differs from any other bounty of which we have had experience, with the exception of that on dried fruits, in that there is a moral obligation on the Governments concerned to assist those engaged in the industry because they were really forced into it on conditions determined by those Governments. In South Australia the blame lies largely at the door of the Legislative Council, a Tory house. Legislative provision was made for the compulsory purchase of estates in South Australia to enable returned soldiers to be placed on the land, but that act was made inoperative by the Tory Legislative Council, which must, for that reason, accept the responsibility for making this bounty necessary, and also for most of the losses which have been incurred in respect of repatriation schemes along the river Murray. An effort was made in 1924 to solve the difficulties under which the wine-growers were labouring. I was then a member of this House, and I remember the passing of the first Bounty Bill which provided for the payment of a bounty at the rate of 2s. 9d. a gallon net, and of 4s. a gallon gross. Later, Federal Parliament} the bounty was reduced in 1927 to Is. 9d. a gallon net, and period the cost of the bounty, for the respective years ending 30th June was as follows:£ 1925 .. . . 28,417 1926 . 370,108 1927 . 432,410 1928 . 4.82,843 1929 . 70,454 In terms of millions of gallons the quantities of wine exported during those years was as follows:Years. Million Gallons. 192425 9-10ths 192520 .. .. 1| 1920-27 .. ..3 192728 .. .. 3J 192829 .. If When I was last in Parliament in 1925 there was a net bounty being paid of 2s. 9d. a gallon. When I returned here, last year, that bounty had been reduced to Is. a gallon, and was due to expire within a few months. As I represent a district in which there are more persons growing grapes for wine-making than in any other three or four wine-making constituencies, I naturally felt that it was my duty to do vhat I could to have the bounty increased. I did not hold the same views as the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), and I propose later to justify my opinion by quoting figures relating to the operations of",38,Second Beading

I propose to show that the value of the wine exports of some firms dropped from £38,000' a year to £200 worth. I. stayed in Canberra for five weeks, without returning home one week-end, so that I might be able to buttonhole Ministers, and prepare the ground for obtaining an increase in the bounty. I went back before Christmas satisfied lhat there was a chance of securing an increase. I did not know by how much, but 1. believed that it would depend upon the report brought back in the new year by the Senior Inspector of Excise. Mi.

Later on I shall quote that gentleman's own words on the matter. This Government has not backed down. It did not yield to the pressure brought to bear by the wine-makers when the recent excise increase WHS made. On tba: occasion this Government behaved very differently from the way you did when your Government was threatened by the wine-makers. If you had stood up to your job months ago order.

Hyland pointed a gun at the head of the Government of which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) was a member, it surrendered, and altered the price of grapes as it, was requested to do. That was the thin end of the wedge. When Mr Penfold Hylimd led the revolt of the wine-makers, the Government of the day should have fought him. He should have been told that he did not govern the country. Had that been done, he would not have tried to bluff and bounce the present Government, but would have learned a lesson. Whatever else this Government has done, it has not shown f r i g h t . honourable member say "" f i g h t "" ? do not desire the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) to talk to ine about fighting, for he knows very little about it . Some years ago, when there was a possibility of his being selected to contest a seat in this Parliament, the present right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) entered the field and the honourable member for Warringah did not care to fight. I returned to South Australia onlj after I had satisfied myself that there was a good prospect that the Government would increase the bounty. The increase' can be justified on numerous grounds. The first is the moral obligation that I have already mentioned. I was pleased to notice at the various deputations which waited upon the Prime Minister in connection with this subject that the moral obligation argument appealed strongly to I rise to a point of the right honourable gentleman. We are fortunate to have a Prime Minister who has an earnest regard for moral obligations.

The increase is justified also because the Governments of Victoria and South Australia have invested large sums of money in the industry. One other reason was mentioned by the Acting Minister, namely, that the industry had caused £1,500,000 of new capital to come into Australia. The main provision in the bill is that in increasing the bounty from Is. to Is. 9d. a gallon on exported fortified sweet wine. Seeing that the bounty is as much as was asked for I expect it to have a beneficial effect. Those engaged in the industry undoubtedly asked for the amount of bounty which they considered necessary. The next provision of importance is that a trust account is to be estabcuss that aspect of the subject, except lished. I shall not attempt to enter the maze of figures which the honourable member for Gippsland traversed. To be quite candid on the matter, T am not very much concerned about, his criticism of the proposed trust fund, but I appreciate the provision that any amount left, in it, after the statutory requirements have been met shall be used to assist in the marketing of our wine overseas. The honourable member for Gippsland seems to think that nothing will be left in it ; but when the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) spoke on this subject some time ago he said that, of the amount of £600,000 provided by the industry by the taxation of itself, £300,000 could be paid into revenue and £300,000 into the trust, fund, and that this would be considerably more than the amount required for the purposes of the fund. member had in mind at that time a bounty of Is. 6d. a gallon. ence of 3d. a gallon would not seriously affect the value of the statement. The next important provision of the measure to which I shall refer is that which gives the bounty a five-year period. Eor five or six years those engaged in the industry have asked for a bounty over a sufficiently long period to enable the industry to become, thoroughly established, and I believe that a five[52| year period will make it possible to stabilize the position. If that period is not sufficient the policy can be continued for a longer time. the honourable member favour an extension of the period? amount necessary to provide the assistance comes from the wine consumers of the country. I would also favour au extension of the period, if necessary, for the reason that the grape-growers deserve protection on moral as well as economic grounds. the longer period also enable the winemakers to market a more mature product ? to say that the five-year period should result in the marketing of an improved wine. I am afraid that the action of the previous Government in extending the period of the 2s. 9d. net bounty for an extra three months caused many wine-makers to export immature wine which did the industry a good deal of harm. I am glad also that provision is made in the bill for the fixing of the price of grapes. This Government cannot take credit for that, for the principle was included in previous wine export bounty measures. The honourable member for Gippsland commented upon the fact that provision is made for policing the working conditions and wages paid in making wine on which the bounty is paid. As a Labour man I cannot, take exception to that provision; but I believe that those engaged in our wineries and distilleries are fairly protected, for they are all members of the Liquor Trades Employees Union, which keeps a close eye upon the conditions under which its members work. I do not think that there is very much prospect of applying these policing conditions to the grape-growers, for large quantities of grapes are grown by men engaged in mixed farming, who carry on their operations with the assistance of their families.

220,Mr Hawker,"Did not Mr Penwould have saved a lot of heart-burning during tbe critical period through which the grape-growers have just passed. The following paragraph is taken from a circular issued to all honourable members by Mr Penfold HylandSome members are labouring under the impression that the grape-growers applaud their action, but the truth is just the opposite, but as the Attorney-General, Mr Brennan, knows, of all the growers in Mr Gabb's electorate, Barossa is the loudest in its condemnation of the Government's action. Similar statements appeared in the press, hut I have doubts as to their truth. I question whether some of the growers, who were stampeded, still hold the views that they then expressed. I , myself, have not been intimidated, and have taken the same stand throughout. Eor three yeai'S 1 was secretary of a union, and on several occasions I acted in opposition to the wishes of my members, and was prepared to take the consequences. I took the stand that by opposing them. I was acting in their interests, and I am taking that stand to-day as a representative of those grapegrowers who"" are opposed to excise increase. I advised the Government as to what I considered was the proper course to take irrespective altogether of the views of my constituents. I contend that we, as representatives of the people, should use the brains that the Almighty has given us, and act according to our convictions. I visited my electorate making inquiries at the time of the grape lock-out and I found that among the wine-makers, were those of two schools of thought. I had always been under the impression that as the hymn says, the wine-makers were "" all one body we"", but when I made inquiries I was surprised to find that that was not the position. I found that certain wine-makers practically confined their operations to the Australian trade, and others operated both on the Australian and the export markets. Silling suspended from 6.15 lo 8 p.m.. only in the Australian market are endeavoring to avoid paying the prices that have been fixed by the Government. The following is a list issued about the 17th March by Penfolds Wines Limited and B. Seppelt& Sons, of prices to be paid to the growers. I have placed in the margin opposite each item the price fixed by the Government. It will be seen that the difference ranges from 10s. to £2 a ton.

221,Mr Gabb,"Thos e who are interestedI t w ill be seen that tbe two firms whose names I have mentioned have decreased to a remarkable extent their exportations of wine. I give these figures not only to show that these two firms are now tralian market, but also so that the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) may know what the position is with regard to exports. I hope that he will be satisfied that there was every need for increasing the bounty. figures should convince the honourable gentleman that the bounty of Is. a gallon was not sufficient to encourage many firms to export. In the year prior to that to.which the first list refers, Penfolds were offering for grapes, in some cases, from £2 to £3 a ton less than the price fixed by the Government, . and in the year which precoded that, lie commenced to bring down the prices that were paid to the growers. Some honourable members may wonder why that was done. The reason is that this particular firm has its capital in vested mainly in plant aud tied shops. A decrease in the price of grapes, and a crash that brought in its train a decided drop in the value of vineyards, would have little or no harmful effect upon it . In fact, the policy of the firm seems to be to smash down the price of grapes. The other firms with which it is competing in the retail market in Australia, however, particularly Seppelt's, have extensive vineyards. Seppelt's have somewhere about 2,200 acres of vines. A drop in the value of vineyards is to Penfold's advantage, because it lessens the value of its competitors' assets, and consequently improves its own prospects of securing a monopoly of the Australian market. This bounty is necessary not for the purpose of developing a new industry as is the case with the cotton bounty, but to salvage one that has been established to a certain extent. I hope, however, that the increase w ill not result in additional areas being planted with vines. On the public platform I have endeavoured to warn growers against the danger until they have seen that the bounty has had the intended effect of opening up markets on the other side of the world. If the strike or lockout by tbe wine-makers has not warned the growers, it should have had that effect. The wine-makers at all times have their hands on the throats of the interested only in the Ausgrape-growers, and they need only exert suflicient pressure to place them in the uncomfortable position that they imagined they occupied on the 19th March last. Any industry that is working under a bounty, even if this amounts The to only 3d. a gallon, is not on a sound basis. If the existing British preference be withdrawn, even if the effective preference be only 3d. a gallon as has been contended, their position w ill be an unenviable one. I remind the growers, also, that they have a serious competitor in the industry that is established in SouthA f r i c a . They need to remember that black labour in that country costs only about 30s. a month. The report of the Federal Australian Viticultural Council for 1928 contains the following passage :The difficulties regarding over-production will be realized when it is stated that the acreage under grapes increased from some 07,000 in 1917-18, to approximately 115,000 in 1927-28, while the wine production increased during the same period from 0,805,000 gallons to over 20,000,000 gallons last year. Such a marvellous development in ten years must inevitably be accompanied by serious problems such as face the wine industry today. I further remind the growers that a large amount of British capital is in vested in the wine industry in both Spain and Portugal, and that the "" t h in red line "" of kinship fades away in the presence of gold. There is also competition from synthetic wines, or British wines. One company that handles these wines paid in one year a dividend of no less than 48 per cent. That is evidence of the profits that can be made out of them. I join issue with the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) in regard to the proportions in which blending takes place; it is a case, not of one to one but of three to one. This blending is making both Portugal and Spain a serious competitor of Australia on the British of planting further areas market in spite of British, preference. I warn the growers of these facts because, unhappily, I have not the certainty of the Minister or of some of the officers of his department in regard to the efficacy of the bounty. I regard this as our only chance to save the industry; and it will be saved only if the grapegrowers are sufficiently wise to refrain from the planting of wine-producing grapes for at least the next two or three years. support the general principles of the bill, but regret that it was not introduced prior to the Easter adjournment, so that it could have been circulated among winemakers and grape-growers throughout Australia, and thus have enabled them to bring forward criticisms of its details. Until it was introduced last night, no person, except the Minister and the departmental officers, was acquainted with its contents. The Minister certainly was courteous enough to indicate that it. was to be introduced, and this foreknowledge made it possible for what is probably the wealthier section of the industry to send a representative to Canberra to watch its passage. operative wine-makers, however, have not been able to do that. The associations of growers and the co-operative wine-makers in South Australia will not, receive copies of the bill until the end of this week. I hope that a reasonable interval will be allowed to elapse before the committee stage is proceeded with, so that those sections of the industry may be able to make known their views upon the bill. AlthoughI support, wholeheartedly the general principles of the measure, I have considerable criticism to offer regarding the manner in which this matter has been handled by the present Government. I would not have referred to its vacillation but for the criticism that has been directed against the late Minister for Markets( Mr Paterson), the suggestion being that he had educated the wine-makers to adopt the policy of direct action, by making concessions to them, and that it remained for this Government to refuse to make any concessions. Throughout the handling of the problems that have been connected with the wine industry the action of Commonwealth Governments has not been all that could be desired. There has been a wealth of good intention; but from time to time also a considerable amount of blundering. The suggestion that, another minister, or another government, made substantial, concessions whenever direct action was threatened, aud that the present Government had a sufficiently high moral sense to offer a f i r m resistance, is not. in accordance with .the facts. The present Government has shown to the manufacturing millionaires in this industry the leniency that has characterized many phases of its fiscal policy. The name of Mr John Wren has been mentioned to-night by an honourable member who sits opposite. The extent to which that gentleman's firm benefited as a result of the recent alteration to the excise duty on whisky is well known. The chief 'benefit from the concessions which the Government, has recently had extorted from it was received by some of the 'biggest and richest manufacturers of wine in Australia. I do not wish to mention names, and I am not in possession of exact figures. Yesterday I asked the ActThe grape-growers and coing Minister what would he the total amount of duty remitted to wine-makers as a result of the decision not to collect the additional 5s. excise for the trust fund on wine held in bond from vintages prior to 1930. I also asked how many winemakers would benefit to the extent of £10,000, and how many by £25,000 or more. The Acting Minister was unable to give me the information I sought. A previous speaker on the other side of the House has formed an estimate which i.? somewhere near the mark. It is certainly somewhere near the figure which local gossip in wine-making districts has fixed on as the extent of the benefit received by one particular wine-maker. The figure mentioned by the previous speaker was £50,000. I have a cutting from the Adelaide News of Friday, the 27th March, in which this wine-maker i.s reported to have saidTlie Federal Government is attempting to make private enterprise pay tlie cost of its political promises. This wine-maker indulged in much b it t j v criticism of the Government, and, indeed, led the attack against it . He visited Canberra, and, as a result, undertook to d'j what the other makers had been all along prepared to do, namely, to pay a fixed price for the grapes he was going to buy.",44,Second Beading
222,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [8.101,"IProbably, as a return for that, he received this concession, estimated by honourable members on the other side of the House to be worth about £50,000 to him. W it h i i a few days-certainl y within a few weeks -of that concession being granted he was addressing meetings in South Australia in support of a Labour candidate in the State election campaign.

I should not favoiir the payment of a bounty on the export of wine if it were for the purpose of extending the wine industry. market is much too precarious to justify our giving such expensive support to any movement for its extension; but to-day it. is a matter of salvaging the industry, which has been brought into a very grave condition by a series of ill-judged government actions in the past. Most of these actions were taken by various State governments, which over-expanded the industry. As the vines which were planted partly in the course of repatriation work, and partly for other purposes, came into bearing the market was glutted by the excess production. At the end of last year there was a glut of Australian wine in London. As the honourable member for Gippsland said, some of the surplus wine has been worked off, but there is still 1,900,000 gallons held in bond in London. That represents a reduction of a little over 100,000 gallons during the previous six months, and a reduction of 250,000 gallons over a period of twelve months. The wine glut, however, was not in London only. The improvement in London was largely due to a reduction in the shippings from Australia, and while the glut was relieved in London it was very much intensified in this country. The wine-makers, instead of holding wine in London for sale there, were holding it in their cellars in Australia, and their cellars were so full that it was practically certain that they would not be able to take the whole of the coming vintage. The Australian vintage varies considerably according to the seasons. In 1927, which was the record year, 20,456,000 gallons were made. In 1928 the production amounted to approximately 17,300,000 gallons, and in 1929 it was 1S,399,000 gallons. Of the wine manufactured here a certain amount is distilled to make spirit for fortifying other wine. There are no accurate figures available regarding the total amount of beverage wine manufactured each year, but it is probably in the region of 9,000,000 gallons. Various estimates have been given of the amount consumed in Australia. The honourable memabout 4,250,000 gallons, while the estimate of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) was 5,000,000 gallons. I do not offer any opinion as to which is Our overseas right, but, there seems to be a general agreement that there is, in an average vintage year, a total production of about 17,000,000 or 18,000,000 gallons of wine, and that after this is in marketable state there remains a surplus of something between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 of beverage wine which has no market in Australia. There are not too many possible outlets for that wine. The export",46,Second Beading

226,Mr Hawker,"I merely stated theto England under the stimulus of changing bounty payments varies considerably. Tbe actual imports of Australian wine into England increased from 1,750,000 gallons in 1926, to 4,250,000 gallons in 1927. ""When the bounty was reduced the imports fell to approximately 1,750,000 in 1928. The figures regarding withdrawals from bond in England do not show those fluctuations. The large quantity of wine exported to England in 1927 was really responsible for the glut in the market there during subsequent years. The withdrawals from bond in England have been fairly consistent at something Over 2,000,000 gallons each year since 1927, and tbe change in bounty payments in Australia do not appear to have affected them to any great extent. The question immediately arises then whether any increase of bounty would be likely to lead to any very sudden expansion of our English market. I have been informed by many interested persons that the expansion of our overseas market has been very seriously restricted by the uncertainty of the Government support which may be expected,' and the serious alterations of Government policy from time to time. These conditions were responsible for the fact that the English market was supplied with Australian wine practically on a hand-to-mouth basis. The officials of the newly-established Wine Export Control Board are hopeful that for a period a fairly steady increment will follow in the consumption in Great Britain of Australian wine. probably be the means of finding an outlet for another 500,000 gallons of Awstralian wine, if not immediately, at least within a few years. If the present British preferential duties on Australian wine are continued for a few years, we should be able to increase our exports to Great Britain annum or more. be possible for us to expand our wine trade with Canada. quoted by the Acting Minister last night indicated that although the consumption of Australian wine in Canada had increased, it is still only about 1,500 gallons . per annum. Mr Hawker. McGregor, the new Trade Commissioner to Canada, will be able to do something to increase our business in this regard as the Minister suggested. The quantity of Australian wine consumed in the sister dominion is so small to the Canadian consumers of it, there would be a noticeable increase. We might also be able to develop a trade in wine with some of the northern European countries. Even with the relatively generous increase in the bounty, it is by no means certain that the whole of the Australian vintage for this season can be absorbed immediately. Eor that reason 1 agree with the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), in which he referred to the clanger of extending the area of wine grapes. The principles upon which the bill rests are sound. I am glad, for instance, that a special trust fund is to be created for the express purpose of assisting the marketing of Australian wine overseas, and that this will be provided by contributions from the Australian wine consumers, and not from the Consolidated Revenue. Many taxpayers object to the principle of paying a bounty out of revenue, and the policy outlined by the Government will avoid that practice. much the same, for the consumers will provide the money. non-consumers alike would provide it if it came out of Consolidated Revenue. In that way the bounty may under this scheme, the Australian wine consumers will be able to ascertain the exact amount that they are contributing to assist the export side of this industry. I regret that there is not a provision iu the bill to limit the planting of new areas. The industry is in difficulties at present because it expanded too rapidly by 500,000 gallons per for the markets that were available for It should also its products. The result has been that first the general taxpayers, and now the The figures consumers, have had to be taxed to prevent a large number of grape-growers from becoming bankrupt.

We have not done very much in Australia to encourage a continuation of British preference for Australian commodities. .Although the present British tariff is effective to the extent of only 3d. a gallon in respect to the poorer qualities of Australian wine which compete with similar products of Spain and Portugal, it is worth much more than that in respect to our higher quality wines, which enter into competition with the Taragona wines. done which would have the effect of reducing the preference that our wines now enjoy in Great Britain, this industry would again be placed in the difficult position in which it found itself at the end of last year and five years ago I trust that the Government will do everything possible to ensure the cooperation of the various State Governments and those engaged in the industry to prevent the planting of new areas, for to increase the area under vines would tend to make the industry a purely parasitic growth on the Australian consumers. I shall support the increased bounty, which will enable those at present engaged in the industry to maintain their operations on a reasonable basis. I do not know whether the five-year period fixed in the bill is sufficiently long to enable the industry to stabilize itself. Possibly when the various co-operative wine-making concerns throughout Australia have had an opportunity to consider all the provisions of the measure, they may ask for an extension of the period and for other amendments. I should like to see a limit placed upon the quantity of wine upon which the. bounty will be payable, for that would discourage the planting of new vineyards. I believe that all sections of the industry are in accord with the general principles of the bill, which I trust will be acceptable to both Houses of the Parliament. gratulate the Government upon having provided for an increase in the bounty on fortified wine for export from Is. to Is. 9d. per gallon. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) rightly said that all sections of the industry are satisfied with the measure. It seems to me that the only persons dissatisfied with it are some honourable members opposite; and they are dissatisfied only because those engaged in the industry are satisfied. I listened with pleasure to the remarks of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), who evidently speaks his mind irrespective of the consequences. His speech reminded me of the words of TennysonShould anything be And; because right is right, to follow right Were wisdom, in the scorn of consequence. I admire the honourable member for the stand that he took. He apparently did not care whether his remarks cost him his seat or not. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) charged the Government with changeableness, but I submit with confidence that honourable members on this side of the chamber have been absolutely consistent on this subject. The Government of which the honourable member for Gippsland was a member could properly be charged with having ruined the prospects of the industry by so frequently changing the conditions under which assistance was granted to it. In 1924 it provided a bounty of 2s. 9d. a gallon with a drawback of Is. 3d. Three years later it reduced the bounty to Is. 9d. a gallon and one year later to Is. a gallon. The result was that the industry did not know where it stood. On the other hand, honorahle members on this side of the chamber have consistently supported a bounty of Is. 9J. a gallon. The Government is to be congratulated upon having fixed a term of five years for the payment of a bounty of Is. 9d. I am glad to see in the bill a provision that the bounty shall not be paid in respect of any fortified wine which is not of good and merchantable quality. So far as I know that is a new provision iu measures of this kind, and it will ensure that only matured wine will be exported. Everyone knows that the longer wine is kept the better it becomes.

Immediately the reduced bounty came into force a noticeable slump occurred in our wine export trade. The result, was that the wine began to accumulate in the cellars because export at the reduced rate of bounty was not profitable, and the growers were faced with the prospect of not being able to sell their grapes. returned soldiers were encouraged by the Si ate Governments to settle on the land and to cultivate the doradillo grape. When the bounty was reduced by the Bruce Page Government they saw a possibility of their grapes rotting on the vines because the wine-makers, with their cellars already overstocked, would not. purchase rhem.

That criticism no longer applies, and the existence of a marketing organization is a strong justification for the restoration of the bounty to Is. 9d. That Australia is able to produce large quantities of wine the figures I have quoted prove, but when we were faced with the consequences of over-production the Bruce-Page Ministry, instead of trying to expand the foreign market, reduced the bounty, thus preventing' export at a profit. One of the largest wine-makers, Mr Penfold Hyland, has been referred to frequently during this If r . Jones. debate. He caters almost exclusively for the Australian market, and therefore is not compelled to pay for grapes the prices fixed by the Government. Consequently the growers are at his mercy. Those wine-makers who produce for both export and the home market are compelled to pay the fixed prices for all the grapes they purchase, and are at a great disadvantage when competing with a man who makes only for the home After the war many market. This bill, however, w ill ensure that those who make for the Australian market only, and therefore are not compelled to pay for grapes the prices fixed by the Government w i ll contribute towards the cost of stimulating the export trade. That is a f a ir provision. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) appealed for a f a i r deal all round. I agree with him. The winemakers are to be protected by the payment of a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallou of wine exported. The growers will be proState and Federal Gotected because they will receive for their grapes the prices prescribed by the Government. The grape-pickers and other workers in the vineyards are not so fortunate. The honourable member for Gippsland took exception to the proBy 1927-2S the exportatection of the workers, although provision of that kind is not. unusual in connection The bounty was with bounties and customs tariffs. Certainly, the bill enacts that any claimant of the bounty w ill be required to certify as to the conditions of employment and the wages of the employees; but the exporter may not employ any labour; he may only buy from other makers, and One of the arguments adthere is no provision in the bill to protect their employees.

Some honourable members have advocated a restriction on the further expansion of vineyards.

Growers who plant additional areas will do so at their own risk. should prove a sufficient check on further planting. original bounty of Is. 9d. the wine industry made rapid strides, but since the bounty was reduced to Is. it, has been almost stagnant. The proposals contained iu this bill will restore it to a sound basis. Mention has been made of the extent to which Mr Penfold Hyland gained by the Government's decision that fortified wine iu bond on the 13th March might be removed at the old rate of excise duty. The extent of that benefit has been assessed by one honourable member at £47.000 and by another at £50,000. Whatever may have been his gain the Government did not discriminate in his favour. All wine-makers who had wine in bond on the 13th March were allowed tri dear it at the old rate of duty, on undertaking to pay for grapes during the prices fixed by the Government. T am surprised that members of the Country party should object to an increased bounty given for the purpose of assisting a primary industry.

We give a great deal more in assistance to the fruit canneries than is actually received by the soldier and other settlers for their products.

The ostensible purpose of this legislation, as stated repeatedly hy the late Prime Minister( Mr the groAvers, have difficulty in grasping Bruce) is to help the growers of grapes; but it seems to me that in this, as in other instances, the secondary industry is getting the cream and the grower the skimmed milk. costing 6s. 6d., the grower gets 2d. The assistance that we give to the industry should be more direct. I am not blaming this or the late Government for the position in which the industry finds itself. We have made a mistake, and I believe that we are making a further mistake on this occasion. The bill provides for a bounty for five years, but I suggest that at the end of that period the industry will still be dependent upon the bounty, and the clamour for assistance will be just as loud as it is to-day. This legislation offers no permanent solution of the problems of the industry. The grower has always been made a stalking horse by those engaged in the secondary industry. ber is not contending that the grower has not been benefited by the bounty? been benefited, but he could have been benefited to a much greater extent had the assistance been given in a more direct form.

I take this opporadopted in the payment of bounties upon tunity to add my congratulations to the the production of certain commodities in Australia. To my mind the sole redeeming feature of this measure is that the Government has been wise enough to make a radical departure from the policy that was adopted by the previous Administration. The bounty which that Government made available to the wine industry was paid out of the ordinary revenues of the Commonwealth. This Government has seen f it to alter that principle radically. It proposes to make the industry itself bear the whole of the cost, by raising the excise on for t if y in g spirit used in the manufacture of wine. For that action it is to be commended.

I have neither seen nor heard of fir m within The story begins with the payment of a bounty of Is. a gallon on wine exported. Under that, arrangement things were getting along f a i r l y well, and the industry was settling down. right-dow n and out! the opinion of many engaged in the industry that it would be able to establish itself successfully, having regard to the preferential treatment accorded by the British Government, and the bounty of Is. a gallon paid by the Commonwealth Government. I do not say that there was no difference of opinion, or that there was not room for such difference, but there was a reasonable prospect that a bounty of Is. a gallon would be ample. At this time an election was pending in the State of South Australia. It was important, therefore, that the Government should study carefully its attitude on the subject of the wine bounty, and that once having made up its mind it should stand firm. Soi t finally announced that there should be a bounty of 1s. 6d. In arriving at that decision it must have examined the needs of the industry. the industry really needed in order that it might carry on satisfactorily, having regard to all the interests concerned. After such a complete examination the deliberate decision was reached by the Government that a bounty of Is. 6d. a gallon would meet the circumstances of the case. In order to provide this Is. 6d., the excise was increased by 5s. on for t if y in g spirit. The attitude of the Government seemed to be perfectlyclear. It had a policy, it. had clear views and definite intentions. The 5s. increase in excise was to provide the money for the Is. Cd. a gallon bounty. The Government was standing firm. But a simple arithmetical calculation soon showed that the excise increase of 5s. a gallon provided a much greater sum than was needed to pay the bounty of Is. 6d. One would have thought that the Government, having already determined that a bounty of Is. 6d. was all that was needed a Government standing so by the industry, would have reduced the in so many different ways excise increase to less than 5s. such a limited period. when it was found that something less would be sufficient to provide the money required. As explained by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) the whole theory of the thing was that the industry should provide its own bounty, but not more than was necessary It was settling down all for the payment of the bounty. The Government, however, evidently thought that it must find another position on No t at all. It was which it could stand firm. Its next step was to increase the proposed bounty from Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. a gallon. If tlie Government had made a f u l l inquiry into the industry it must have been obvious that the extra 3d. was unnecessary. If was both unnecessary and unjustifiable fro m the point of view of the public, or in the interests of the industry, unless the Government had made a serious mistake in arriving at the original figure of Is. 6d. However, it then appeared that an increase of 5s. a gallon in the excise would produce more than even the bounty of Is. 9d. can absorb, and the Government had to find still another position on which to stand firm. The Attorney General at that time happened to be in South Australia and was reported in the press to have stated that the additional money would readily be absorbed as the area of vineyards was extended. It must have inquired what that statement appear? the Melbourne press. Only this afternoon, however, we were informed by the Prime Minister that the Government did not, propose to favour any extension of the area under vines, and that the bounty should be employed for the benefit of those engaged on the areas already planted. U p to the present the Government has made three or four unfortunate mis-steps in the process of standing firm. But there are still other facts which illustrate the clear views of the Government, its sound grasp of policy and the great care which it exercises before determining its policy.

265,Mr Latham,"It was published inabout the 12th March, the excise resolutions were introduced in Parliament. They provided that the increased excise was to be paid on all spirit removed from bond after the 13 th March. But, if you please, on the 26th March a new resolution was brought down, and the Government altered its position in relation to this phase of its policy by making an exception in favour of spirit already in bond. As we have heard, that exception was worth over £40,000 to one gentleman who attracted the enthusiastic criticism of the honourable member for Angas( Mr growers and of many of the wineries had Gabb) who actually complimented the Government for standing firm in its dealings with that gentleman. To congratulate the Government on standing firm in view of the facts which have come to light, demands a degree of political loyalty upon which I, in my turn, must congratulate the honourable member himself. However, we have not yet completed the tale. There is in the bill a clear provision proout a means of livelihood. The Federal viding for the disposition of what is described as the surplus in the trust account. If this matter had been handled in accordance with the principles laid down by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) there would be no surplus in the trust account, at all. The money received from excise duty would do no more than provide for the bounty payments. However, tbe question arises, what, is to be done with this surplus. The bill lays it down that the money is to be applied in the prescribed manner. That leaves the matter fairly open, but it is further money marketing overseas, and the encouragement of the export of Australian wines. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) asked what that meant, and it was learned that apparently the Government intended that a portion of the drawback on exported wine was to be paid out of the trust fund. The bill does not provide for that. . This is evidently another change of step in the process of standing firm in many different positions. The Government seems to have changed front in regard to every phase of its policy. I trust that when the honourable member for Angas next uses the phrase "" standing firm"" he will have a better set of facts to which to apply it. Mr Latham. Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.40]. -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), in the speech which he has just concluded, said that under a bounty of Is. a gallon the wine industry was settling down. If he meant that the wine industry was being settled altogether he was probably speaking the truth, because it was evident from the representations which were made to the Government that the industry was in a very serious condition. The representatives of the grapewaited on the Government; others had communicated with me as the Minister, and they all pointed out that some of the wineries would not be able to re-open if the bounty were not increased so as to give an impetus to the export of wine. It was stated that a large percentage of the 27,500 people who were dependent on this industry would in that case be withViticultural Council, representing 98 per cent, of the wine-makers of Australia, waited on the Government and tendered convincing evidence of the unsatisfactory condition of the industry, and demonstrated that ruin was facing them if the Government did not increase the bounty from Is. to Is. 9d. a gallon. The Federal Viticultural Council, the wine-makers and the grape-growers asked for this increase. The Government, guided by the facts placed before it, considered that a bounty of Is. 6d. a gallon would be a fair compromise, but I make no apology stipulated that the for the Government because, after hearshall be devoted to the ing additional evidence, it decided to increase the bounty to Is. 9d. The Leader of the Opposition must, remember that when Mr Bruce was Prime Minister he frequently altered the nature of legislation, even when it was before the House, after receiving representations from outside sources. In some instances he dropped bills altogether; in others he introduced numerous amendments and in some cases he changed the programme for the session. The Leader of the Opposition said that important wine-makers had stated that a bounty of Is. a gallon was sufficient. There are certain traders in the wine industry who control the Australian market, and would be glad if there were no",55,Second Beading

In that case the export trade would collapse, and these traders would be able to buy at a price which would enable them to force their smaller competitors out of business. That is a point which the Leader of tbe Opposition overlooked. When the Government decided to allow the wine-makers to l if t the wine in bond at the old rate of export duty it exacted an undertaking from the principal winemakers that they would pay a fixed price for grapes-equa l to that which would have to be paid to growers in order to receive the export bounty. Tlie wine-makers were not obliged to pay a fixed price for the grapes they required for making wine for the Australian market, but they entered into an arrangement with the Government which resulted in the payment of from 10s. to £2 per ton more for grapes than would otherwise have been paid. That was another definite step forward, which was of substantial advantage to the grape-growers, and therefore to all the persons employed in the industry in Australia. Subsequently the wine-makers advised the Government that not a single pound of grapes would be left to rot this year. When one wine-maker in particular closed his wineries, and threatened that lie would cause all the wineries in Australia to be closed if the Government did not take a certain action, the Prime Minister stated in this chamber that he would not be dictated to by any one, and that the wineries must be re-opened before the matter could be further discussed. The wine-makers waited upon me in regard to the matter, and I gave thorn the same reply. The Government could not possibly discuss this matter while a pistol was being held at its head. No doubt certain honourable members opposite were disappointed when the wineries were re-opened, for they hoped that the Government would be embarrassed and that the grape-growers would accuse it of having ruined the industry. opening of the wineries and exacting a to mention in their speeches that the promise from the wine-makers that, they Bruce-Page Government did the greatest would buy all the grapes required for possible harm to the wine industry in milking wine for the local market at the 1927 when it reduced the bounty from price that was paid for grapes for 2s. 9d. to Is. 9d. a gallon, and [>3 ] r making wine for export, the Government did a great deal for the grape-growers. By allowing the wine-makers to lift the wine in bond at the old rate of duty, the Government did not reduce the revenue, for it was agreed that the amount of difference involved would be paid out of the trust fund. The Leader of the Opposition did not mention this important fact. The Government was influenced in its decision to increase the bounty by reason of the fact that many returned soldiers were encouraged by various Commonwealth and State Govern merits to become grape-growers. hear about the returned soldiers tomorrow. honourable member means; but it is undeniable than many men who were away on war service for several years were advised to plant vineyards, although no steps had been taken to ensure a market for their products. The Government could not stand by and see these men ruined. Another important consideration is that the bounty will be provided by the industry itself. I believe that that policy will receive the approval of at least 90 per cent, of honourable members. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) asked from what fund the drawback of 2s. 4d. would come. One shilling and threepence of it will come out of Consolidated Revenue, and Is. Id. of it out of the trust fund. In committee I shall move an amendment which will definitely provide for this. The honourable member also referred to the payment of the bounty on wine exported to Canada. The amount involved in this connection will not be more than £50, and the only two exporters engaged in the trade have given an undertaking that they will not claim any more than Is. 9d. a gallon on the wine that they export to that dominion. It is not necessary to put a provision in the bill to safeguard this position. By insisting upon the reHonorable members opposite omitted",56,Second Beading

268,Mr Forde,"I do not know what thegave three months' notice of the reduction. this Government for giving what was tantamount to a week's notice of the alteration that it intended to make after obtaining a definite undertaking from the wine-makers that they would buy the whole of the vintage at the fixed price for grapes. The result of the Bruce-Page Government giving three months notice of the reduction in the bounty was that the wine-makers exported every gallon of wine that they could get hold of to England irrespective of its age or quality. This caused a glut of Australian wine on the London market, and led to hawkers carting our wine round the streets and selling it at cut-throat prices. A great injustice was thus done to the industry. The effect of that policy is shown in the quantities of wine exported. In 1927-2S we sent 3,215,612 gallons of wine to England, and in the next year we sent only 1,261,000 gallons there. It can be definitely stated that the previous Governdirectly, for their livelihood. We believe ment greatly injured the industry by giving such a long notice of its intention to reduce the bounty. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) suggested that the five year period was not long enough for the industry to stabilize itself, but I remind him that it is two years longer than the period of the last bounty. The industry need have no fear about the future. A l though this Government cannot bind a government that may be in officefiveyears hence, I think it can be said fairly definitely that if the industry itself is prethat country with regard to wines. pared to provide the money for the payment of a bounty at the expiration of the five-years period there will be no objection to its doing so. Any representations that may be made with this object in, say, three or four years' time, will doubtless receive very sympathetic consideration. The same honourable member suggested that there should be a limit to the quantity of wine on which the bounty should be paid, but it would be difficult to fix such a limit without inflicting hardship upon the small wine-makers. The object of the Government is to have as much Australian wine as possible exported, so ilr. Forde. that the glut on the local market might be Yet they have criticized ended and our adverse trade balance, to some extent at least, corrected. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) complained because he had not been furnished with a reply to a question he asked me as to the value of the wine that has been exported from Australia in the years in which the bounty has been operating. I assure the honourable member that no discourtesy was intended. As soon as possible after he asked the question telegrams were sent to the collectors of customs in the different States to secure the information that he desired. I hope that I shall be able to give him the particulars he wants within the next few days. This bill has been introduced with the object of assisting the wine industry to rehabilitate itself. The Government felt that it had to deal justly with the 27,500 persons who are dependent upon the industry, either directly or inthat it should be possible for us to provide at least 5,000,000 gallons of the 10,000,000 gallons of sweet wine consumed in England annually. If we could increase our exports to even 4,000,000 gallons it would mean a great deal to the industry. It would clear the local market of the present glut and provide much additional employment for our people. We hope also that it will be possible to increase our trade with Canada. The new Canadiau Trade Commissioner will do his best to pave the .way for a more favorable reciprocal arrangement with He is going to Canada well equipped with all necessary information, and is optimistic that he will be able to improve our position on the Canadian market. The object of the Government is to help Australia to produce more, export more, and import less. This measure will do much to further that policy. Question resolved in the affirmative.
