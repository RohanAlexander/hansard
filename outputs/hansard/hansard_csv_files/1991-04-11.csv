The second aspect of that argument on Australia should not sell uranium. We demand is really whether or not demand might well ask what effect that will have. will increase. The first point I would make If we do not sell uranium, is that going to about that is that the European Commumean that all those power stations close nity has made it clear that demand in the down?
