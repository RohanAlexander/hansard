His Lordship is reported to have stated -thatIf the Government wants to shift me off the church property, it -will have to send a big policeman. [ propose to read an extract from a letter which I received from His Lordship as a solemn protest against the Commonwealth Government's seizure of church property In Darwin. It statesBy the "" Darwin Lands Acquisition Act"" of 16.th August, 1945, the Commonwealth Government resumed absolutely 00 square miles of hind around Darwin, including all the freehold titles of this area. No more freehold title will be granted to any one. The only title of land tenure will be a 09-year leasehold. By this bill, the Catholic Church of Darwin is deprived of all her freehold property and she is denied the faculty to acquire any other freehold property instead. The Catholic Church owns iu Darwin'nine half-acre blocks of freehold property for church purposes The new bill deprives her suddenly of this property. As Bishop of Darwin, and in the name of the Catholic Church, I raise a most solemn H as the Minister protest against this way of dealing, which is unjust towards the church and most damaging to licr work and independence. honourable member bases a question on a letter, it is not usual for hi m to read the whole of tbe letter.

But a humiliated and servile church is no good to any one. She can only act properly in perfect freedom. There are only two States in the world where the church is denied the right to possess freehold property. They are Bussia and Mexico. But in these States, might is right, and in them the church considers herself in state of persecution. In every other nation of the world, even in China and Japan, as well as in othor pagan countries, the church it giveiv the right to possess freehold property. Australia, a free, democratic and Christian country, is in duty and dignity bound not to act below the standard of those countries.

Kingdom to Australia, and assisted passages for British civilians and their dependents from the United Kingdom to Australia had been approved in principle but details were being worked out.by representatives of the rwo governments. I have now to advise honourable members that the two agreements have been finally concluded and were signed in London on the 5th March by tbe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, on behalf of the British Government, and Mr Beasley, Australian Resident Minister in London, on behalf of the Commonwealth GoA ernment. Both the T free passage and the .assisted passage schemes will come into operation on a date to be agreed upon by the United ments.

Their conclusions will be of theutmost assistance to me and the officersof the Department of Immigration. I am sure that every honourable member would' also derive much benefit from a careful perusal of the contents of this report.. The members of the committee certainly deserve our warmest thanks for their interesting and instructive survey of conditions in Britain ancl the Europeancountries which they visited.

It is my intention to consult them from time to time, either collectively or indipolicy which I had the honour to vidually, and ask for the benefit of their advice when any matters affecting immigration are under consideration, especially those matters on which they can be of particular assistance. In my ministerial statement last year, I indicated that the Government was still prepared to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition .parties in this Parliament the establishment of a Joint Parliamentai-y Committee on Immigration, and the terms of reference to be given to such a committee. So far, the Opposition parties bave not indicated t'heir willingness or otherwise to accept the offer, which still remains open. I have discussed the matter with the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) who is prepared to meet the Leader of the Opposition. ( Mr Menzies) and tbe Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) immediately, with a view to setting up the committee and determining its terms of reference. Incidentally, I may mention that the first suggestion for the establishment of such a committee came from the Leader of the Australian Country party, and that it later received support from members of ' tbe Liberal party. I believe that it would be a good thing for Australia if action to establish this committee could be taken before the Parliament goes into recess. . There is just one otber matter that I should like to mention-in connection with the subject of immigration; it relates to the interest of the States. At the conferof the International Labour Office? In ence of Commonwealth and State Ministers before that last held, it was decided that a conference of Commonwealth and State departmental officers, to be followed by a conference of Commonwealth ancl State Ministers interested in immigration, should be convened at an early date. Following the signing of the free and assisted passage agreements, a conference of departmental officers was held in Canberra on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week, and agreement on many aspects of tbe immigration problem was reached. Some matters will come up again for further consideration; but the spirit of co-operation displayed by all delegates augurs well for the that only twelve of the 44 conventionsestablishment of a co-ordinated Commonwealth and States plan so as to make a. complete success of the immigration announce eight months ago. Tbe projected conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers will be held as soon as practicable, and the next conference of Premiers will, I hope, make the final decisions that will ensure the ultimate success of our immigration programme. I 'lay on the table the following papers:r . ImmigrationCommonwealth Immigration Advisory 'Committee-'Report.

The veiy grave clanger of inflation when a large amount of money is available in a liquid form in the community, and the supply of goods is not adequate to meet the demands for them, is apparent to every person who has given any thought to the matter. As honourable members know, it has been absolutely necessary to exercise control in many fields other than those relating to prices. These controls have caused some irritation. Many factors are involved before an article reaches the consumer for sale, and the matter of price has to be considered. If at these earlier stages, costs were increased, inevitably the article could not be sold except at an inflated price. The Government is fully alive to the situation. Even though there, has been a good deal of criticism of some of the controls that have been imposed, the Government, in the interests of the community generally, will weigh every factor carefully before relaxing those which this Parliament has the power to maintain, and which, in its opinion, are absolutely essential for the good of the country. In conjunction with the Minister for External Affairs, I shall examine the suggestion of the honourable inember for the ratification of conventions of the International Labour Conference, and shall then let the honourable member know what are the Government's views.

However, I have made a statistical analysis of the available informa.tion, and am in a position to say that the figures will reveal a very considerable change in the distribution of incomes. In brief, there has heen a considerable transfer of income receivers from the lower to the liigher income groups. The figures reveal that for the year 1943, compared with 1039, the number of persons in receipt of incomes below £250 a year decreased by approximately 40 per cent; that those in receipt of incomes above £250 a year and beiow £600 a year increased by approximately 100 per cent.; and that there has been a certain increase of the number of persons in receipt of incomes in excess of £600 a year. I am sure that the figures demonstrate that all sections of the community have shared in the general wave of prosperity inaugurated by this Government.

This is done by a committee consisting of representatives of my department, including the Director-General of Agriculture, the State committees, and the Wheat Board. In New South Wales, the Director of tbe period mentioned, chairman of the Wheat Allocation Committee. Decisions by this committee are implemented by the Australian Wheat Board. Wheat has been used in Australia for the manufacture of dog biscuits for a great number of years. In view of the urgent demand for wheat for export, a survey was made of all the ways in which wheat was being used, as it wasconsidered that some saving could be made in the amount of wheat being released for various purposes, including the manufacture of dog biscuits. inquiry, which was of a searching character, naturally made dog biscuit manufacturers and dog owners' organizations somewhat apprehensive about future supplies. They called on. me, and requested that the matter of supplies be reviewed as speedily as possible, as wheat was being held up, and the demand for dog biscuits was strong. The deputation asked for quantities substantially in excess of the quantity finally made available to them. Later, I requested the Director-General of Agriculture to sun'ey the position, and he reported to me that the withholding of wheat for the manufacture of dog biscuits woiild undoubtedly result in substantial quantities of bread being used to feed dogs, and also that meat consumption would increase. The Director-General of Agriculture considered it more, economical to supply the minimum quantity of wbeat necessary to meet requirements, rather than that inroads should be made on other essential commodities. It was finally decided to allocate 50,000 bushels for the balance of the rationing year. Consideration was given to the fact that biscuits are fed to working and domestic dogs, that the United Kingdom permits wheat to be used for this purpose, and that New South Wales-in which State the wheat has been made available-is the principal manufacturing | 5 APBU 1946.] Wheat Industry. 1103 centre in Australia, and distributes to other States. Originally, about 100,000 bushels of wheat was used in the making of dog biscuits, but this was cut in half when the final allocation was made. As flour is not rationed, it is. obvious that this would have been substituted for wheat. A close scrutiny of the use of wheat is being maintained and, where possible, supplies are reduced. Mr McDonald, chairman of the Stock Feed Allocation Committee, has supplied the following statement:As chairman of the Stock reeds Allocation Committee, I recommended the release of wheat for the feeding of clogs. It was on a strictly rationed basis, as we cut down supplies very drastically by about 50 per cent. A number ot ownerb of dogs in New South Willes .'ire farmers and graziers, thcy use them in connection with the mustering of slieep and cattle ancl keeping rabbits under control. For this work one dog is equal to three men. This Many dogs in town are kept as watch dogs and many city clogs are obtained by graziers to k ill rabbits. Farming and grazing would be impossible without dogs in some areas. If graziers keep dogs they must feed them generally on meat and cereals and they kill a lot of mutton for this purpose. If wheat had been withheld graziers would have had to kill more slieep, thereby cutting down the amount of meat they could send abroad. Colonel Holborow, State Superintendent of the Australian Wheat Board in New Soutb Wales, has advised that, subsequent to the representations made to me, the release of 50,000 bushels for this purpose was agreed to, but, on reviewing the position, it was found that 40,000 bushels would be sufficient. This amount was also allotted under last year's rationing scheme. It is distributed on a monthly basis of4,266 bushels on a quota of nine mills which produce meal for the manufacture of dog biscuits. Tbe allocation of this amount, instead of 5,555 bushels, on the basis of 50,000 bushels for the whole period, saves 10,000 bushels during the next nine months. It is also pointed out that the release of this wheat can be prohibited at any stage. Finally, I quote a report from tbe Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 30th March, which in itself is an adequate reply to the honourable member's allegations, and I thank the Daily Telegraph for having given publicity to this reply.

The item is a3 follows:Racing dogs -in England were fed on wheatmeal throughout the war, and were now fed -on cow-beef, Mr Vic Peters said yesterday. Mr Peters, secretary of the Greyhound Breeders, Owners, and Trainers' Association, -was answeringcriticism by Mr Abbott in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Mr Abbott had said: "" It appears Mr the people at the referendum emScully (Commerce and Agriculture Minister) has given preference to the manufacture -of dog biscuits over tlie needs of the people -of Great Britain and other countries."" Mr Peters said yesterday: "" Mr Scully -agreed to a wheat quota after we proved to him that English manufacturers had used wheatmeal throughout the war. "" There ure twice as many greyhounds in England as in New South Wales. "" Wheatmeal and beef is recognized as staple -diet for greyhounds. "" Feeding cow-beef to Australian greyhounds is forbidden."" LESS WHEATMEAL. One of the largest manufacturers of dog bread and biscuits in New South Wales said .yesterday that he was using almost 8i tons of wheatmeal every month. Before restrictions were applied six weeks .ago, he was using 10 tons of wheatmeal each, -week. The manufacturer added that he supplied sheepand cattle stations in New South Wales with dog. biscuits and bread for their sheep -dogs and. cattle dogs. I offer no apology for this allocation. When the proposal was submitted to me ""by the Director-General of Agriculture I approved, it , and I would do the same again in like circumstances. The charge brought by the honourable member for New England that I was sacrificing human beings for dogs is merely indicative of the level of his mentality. Motion (by Dr. E.VATT) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for aun act to provide for the termination oi the National Security Act 1030-1043. B ill presented, and read a first time. ( SOCIALSERVICES ) BILL 1946. Debate resumed from the 4th A p r i l {vide page 1059), on motion by D r . That the bill be now read a second time. year, 'the Government budgeted for the expenditure of £64,000,000 on social services, and next year the amount w i ll be about £64,00.0,000.. Having in mind the cost of providing social benefits for the people, it is absolutely necessary that the Government shall know that , its programme is based on a stable constitutional foundation. For that reason, the proposal to be submitted to braces almost every form of social service at present in operation and likely to be implemented in the future. This is a very practical way of dealing with the problem, and one which could scarcely be sidestepped by any government, whatever its political affiliations might be. In objecting to this measure, honourable members opposite say that the proposal is not necessary because no State parliaments would refuse to refer to the Commonwealth the important powers that are sought. That contention is disproved by events of the past. For instance, only a few days ago, tbe Tasmanian Legislative Council rejected a very important measure designed to refer to the Commonwealth Parliament power in relation to prices controla measure so important as to be absolutely necessary for the prevention of inflation. The Upper House of every State legislature, except' that of Queensland which has no legislative council, has opposed every proposal to refer power to' the Commonwealth. These councils are undemocratically elected on a very limited franchise, and therefore they are by no means f u l l y responsible to the people for their actions. Tbey w i ll not give power of any sort to this Parliament because they are politically opposed to the Government in office. This was proved in 1944j when the Legislative Councils of the States forced the Commonwealth Government to submit a referendum to the people on an issue which would have' been settled satisfactorily if they had fulfille d their responsibilities and honoured promises which were made by the Premiers at a convention held in Canberra. Their past conduct belies any suggestion that they would be willin g to cede the powers sought by the Government. It would be a waste of",18,Wheat Industry Manufactur E Of Dog Biscuits
43,Mr Daly ( M A R T I N ) [11.18],"Lasttime for the Government to endeavour to bargain with these undemocratic bodies. This Government has a duty to provide social services equal to those in other advanced countries. Its policy in this connection must go hand in hand with its policy of full employment. The bill now before the House sets out a complete and proper constitutional approach to the problem of providing adequate social services. It proposes to give to the National Parliament authority to lay down the basis on which social services shall be financed and administered, an authority which has been sadly lacking in tbe past. The proposal will receive the unanimous support of all people who think intelligently andare anxious to improve social conditions. Any political party which urges the people to withhold the proposed power will commit political suicide, as was done by some politicians in New Zealand who opposed the enlightened social services programme of the Government of that Dominion. I endorse the proposal, and I am confident of the outcome of the appeal to tbe people. The third important power asked for by the Government is the power to make laws with respect to terms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to enforce industrial conscription. This is vital to the future welfare of the working class. The limited authority of the Commonwealth Parliament in relation to industrial conditions is not generally understood. We are constantly asked why the Government does not do certain, things to improve industrial conditions, because people do not realize that this Parliament lacks constitutional authority. Under section 51 of the Constitution, this Parliament's powers with respect to industrial matters are liniited to conciliation and arbitration for tbe prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. not believe in arbitration? that this Parliament, like the New Zealand Parliament, should have complete power over industrial conditions. The Parliaments of Great Britain, Canada, and South Africa, as well as of New [39] Zealand, have such powers. It should be competent for this Parliament to lay ' down the basis on which the arbitration courts must work. Honourable members -opposite frequently praise the Government of New Zealand for its progressive legislation. There should be no obstacle to prevent this Parliament from enacting equally progressive measures. The New Zealand Government fixed the hours of employment, and its legislation is functioning perfectly. The people of New Zealand are very well governed, and all that we ask now is that the Commonwealth Government .shall have power to .govern likewise. Honourable members opposite claim that the Government cannot be trusted to exercise the powers wisely; they say that the people will be regimented and conscripted. That is an old bogy. The terms of the three bills are such as to prevent unwise use of tbe powers.. It is not generally realized that this Government already has wide powers, even in times of peace. Por instance, it has power to prohibit imports of every kind, or to ban the manufacture of boots and other articles. The States have' even more far-reaching powers. Nevertheless no . government exercises them as drastically as honourable members opposite would have us believe the Commonwealth Government would use the 'powers now sought. The people have faith in their elected representatives. For honourable members opposite to say that the Government, which enjoys the overwhelming support of the people, cannot be trusted to exercise its powers in the best interests of the people is merely to reveal a poor national outlook. Irrespective of what party may be in oflice, the powers to be sought at the referendum are necessary if tbe people are to be given a fair deal in the industrial field. The workers have only their labour to sell, and it is vital to every man and woman in industry that conditions of employment shall be improved. Therefore, this Parliament should have power to legislate on a national scale in respect of hours of labour, wages, and conditions of employ-, ment. On the subject of a 40-hour working week, I say that the day is probably not far distant when we shall have to make the working week even less, in",19,Evatt
44,Mr Guy,Does the honourable member,20,Evatt
45,Mr Daly,"Yes; but I also believeorder to conform with world economic conditions. Eur therm ore, the present method of fixing the basic wage can be held up to ridicule. Tbe basic wage in cludes anallowance of about 12s. 6d. aweek for rent; everybody knows that to be completely out of all proportion to the cost of rent under modern conditions. It is stupid to say that, if the Parliament be given these powers, it will go berserk and override the arbitration system. same .as those which every State Parliament now exercises in the industrial sphere. They are necessary for the removal of anomalies in the arbitration system. The pinpricks that are causing unrest in industry .could be eliminated if this Parliament were able in peace-time to exercise these powers. I cast aside the argument advanced by the Opposition that we should not have these powers because we shall use them in the manner of a dictator. That is only a ""red herring "" drawn across the trail in order to mislead the people. These powers are essential, because, although industries have advanced with the times in regard to both buildings and machinery, the administration of industrial conditions has not progressed from what obtained in the dim days of 1901. It is time the people realized the constitutional position of this Parliament in regard to industrial matters. It ib times they realized onr lack of the power to ensure that the workers shall receive a better return from the increased productivity of industry. It is time we had the legislative ability, unhampered by constitutional limitations, to give to the workers the benents to which they are entitled as the result of modern industrial methods. The fruits of increased productivity should not only go to the employers, but should also be shared by the men who sell their labonr. These powers are essential to improve the lot of the workers, who are entitled to shorter hours, and higher wages, and better industrial conditions generally. These powers are to enable this Parliament to remove industrial anomalies.' They are necessary to enable it to stand in the industrial sphere on an equal footing with the State parliaments. Mr Daly. I emphatically support this proposal because it represents progress.. It ought to be supported by every one wbo realizes the need to give the people a fair deal. This Parliament can never be truly national industrially unless it is given these powers, which are essential to.ensure the proper administration of Australia. The referendum proposals should be voted on by the people in an atmosphere divorced from party politics. The powers will be the The Honourable Alfred Deakin, when presenting the Constitution to tbe people, said: ""This is the framework and ground plan of the nation "". Let us' build upon it by giving these increased powers to the Commonwealth, ancl as other powers become necessary to enable this Parliament to legislate in the best interests of this great. nation, let them be given too. I have listened to this debate with great interest, but it has left me perplexed. Any new member would be puzzled by the constant reiteration of "" caucus! "" on the one hand, and "" Baillieu group! "" on the other. The want of knowledge of honourable members who have spoken on these bills bas increased my perplexity. Consider, for instance, the honourable member for Calare( Mr Breen), who, said "" ' Primary products' cover a great field of primary produce "". How enlightening that statement is. It gives no indication of what the term "" primary products "" means. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) struck the right note when he said, "" We want a modern Cromwell "". Cromwell was known as "" The Protector"", and ' if ever there was a time when the people of Australia needed a protector, that time is now. That is amply demonstrated by anotherstatement of the honourable member for Calare, who said, "" The people are being . asked whether the Parliament will enjoy the powers that it is asking for "". Analyse that! Is not the question really whether the people would enjoy the result of the exercise of these powers by this Parliament. This Government has a lust for power. So the honourable member for Hunter' hit the nail right on the head when he said that we wanted another Cromwell. Of Cromwell it was said, "" Vice and folly trembled at his eye and",20,Evatt
46,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [11.33j.,"all good things lay safe' beneath his mighty shadow "". The honourable member for Hunter struck another note when, referring to the proposed industrial powev, he said that Mr Churchill was asked by a British soldier in Normandy, "" When we have done this job are we coining back to the dole ? "" The honourable gentleman then went on to say, "" It seems that that is happening in. Australia. We want these powers so that they shall not come back to a life on the dole"". What is the answer to that ? Almost every day in this House we are told by the Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction ( Mr Dedman) that all but a very small percentage of ex-servicemen are being satisfactorily absorbed in indusbills or not?

It cannot say, on the one hand, that these powers are necessary to re-establish men, ancl, on the other, that they are being re-established. will learn as he grows older. learning something in this House, but I bave learnt little. All I have heard is party bickering. We have in this country great resources, only the surface of which has been scratched. We have men ready to work in factories and fields to produce the secondary and primary goods we need, but, instead of settling down to develop this country, honourable members waste their time by harking back to what happened years ago. The honourable member for Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) and I have been out of civil life for three and a half years. When we came back into it we wanted to know what had been dene, but all we have heard from members on both sidesI do not confine myself to the Government side-is the history of what some one or other said in disparagement of another years back. Day after day that is about all we hear. It would save time if a short history of each honourable member were pasted up somewhere for honourable gentlemen to read if they so desired, at their leisure, instead of members having to listen to it here, when we should be going about the nation's business in as statesmanlike a fashion as is within our capacity. This party bickering will get us nowhere. I desire to review the bills briefly; but, doubtless, like every other honourable member on this side, as soon as I start to do so I shall be subjected to a barrage of interjections from honourable gentlemen opposite of this type: "" What are you going to do about it ? "" ""What is vour attitude? "" "" Are you supporting the question-""D o you still go home drunk and beat your wife? Answer 'Yes' or ' No' "". It is impossible to answer directly in the affirmative or the negative, because every right-thinking man and woman will favour some of the proposals, but will realize that others, if carried to extreme lengths, will wreck the foundations on which we are building this great nation. How far these powers will be .carried we do not know. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) may give assurances that the powers will not be taken to extreme lengths, but our old earth keeps on turning, and the right honourable gentleman, who gives the assurances in all sincerity to-day, may not be here to administer the act. Legislation' must be definite. Verbal assurances that these powers will not be exercised beyond a certain point are obviously ridiculous. Civilization is based on the confidence that men have in each obher, and in their ability, integrity and honesty. The Attorney General, in giving 'an assurance that the powers contained in these bills would not be exercised, beyond a certain limit, would be honest and sincereI have not lost my faith in human nature so mueh as to disbelieve him-bu t he will not always administer the powers conferred by the referendum proposals.

Honourable gentlemen opposite have said that if the indus-, t r i a l powers amendment be approved Parliament will be asked to enact immediately a measure whicb will grant an increase of 20s. or 30s. a week in the basic wage, and I believe the Attorney General has said that steps w ill also be taken to provide by legislation a 40-hour working week. No doubt the working week will later be reduced to 35 hours. Yet the legislative aiithority which would be able to take that action would also have charge of the primary products of this country We need, therefore, to consider what kind of a deal the primary producers would get. A good deal has been said about the undemocratic nature -of the upper houses of the State parliaments, but I ask whether the Australian Wheat Board, in respect of which this Oovernment claims a good deal of credit, is, in fact, a democratic body? I consider that it is not so, because the members of it who are considered to be representative of the primary producers were appointed by the Governmeut, and may hold office only during the pleasure, of the 'Government. That is not democratic. The wheat stabilization scheme, about which some lionorable gentlemen opposite have had a great deal to say, may be accepted as a f a i r indication of the attitude of the Government towards primary producers. The wheat-growers throughout the Wiminera district which I represent are, almost without exception, hostile to it , yet the members of the board who are said to represent the primary producers, are favorable to it . That is because they are backing up the Government. men. own interests The price of 4s. 2d. a honourable bushel at sidings which is tbe Government scheme price is totally inadequate, and does not represent the cost of production, yet that is all that this Government will do for thp wheat-farmers, although it appears to be quite willin g to increase the basic wage by 20s. or 30s. I did not. I "" ask a week and reduce the working week to 40 hours, or even 35 hours. Et has been said that these amendments wpuld favour the poor as against the rich people in the community, but whom does the Government regard as being the rich and the poor?

Day after day we hear honourable gentlemen opposite declare that primary producers are among ! the rich people in the community, but those whose properties are heavily mortgaged are actually poor people. I call to mind a man in Warracknabeal known as "" Itanga "". An acquaintance met him in the street one day and said to him, ""No work, ' K a n g a ' "" ? He replied, "" No work, and no"" mortgage "". Primary producers whose properties are heavily mortgaged struggle along with a. m ill stone round their necks, yet honourable members opposite would have us regard them as wealthy. All kinds of promise.' have been made -to farmers, as they have been made to service personnel who went overseas to 'fight, but when the times comes-to f u l f i l the promises things generally are not too good.

I am afraid that if these amendments be agreed to it will be government of the people, for the people, but not . by the people.

""We all are striving to escape from the war-time restrictions that are still in force, but honourable members opposite, who talk so much about freedom, seem anxious to retain many of the restrictions. The people as a whole, however, are freedomloving, and they object to being hampered by unnecessary controls. The Government's insistence upon the retention ""of uniform taxation and many other war-time controls shows that it intends to keep the State governments in subjection to the greatest possible degree. Yet on occasions it is quite ready to throw its responsibilities on to the State governments. According to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) the Government considers that current drought difficulties are of only minor consequence. In any case, it has declared thar drought relief must be provided by the State governments.

This bill goes too f a r when it proposes that the Commonwealth shall have such power as w ill enable it to nationalize the medieal profession. 1 am definitely opposed to the measure which would empower the Parliament to make laws in respect of the terms and conditions of employment in industry. The bill relating to tbe organized marketing of primary products needs clarifying. One honourable member said that the idea of the Government was tostreamline the Constitution. There is a streamlined rocket which it is proposed to shoot to the moon. I believe that if these proposed powers were conferred cn this Parliament, the sky would be the l i m it in their application. Unless the Government is looking for a negative vote, the bills w ill have to be amended drastically, because the people invariably reject a proposal that is veiled in obscurity. There is no doubt that these questions are being submitted in order to confuse the issue at the next general elections. If the perplexing arguments that have been advanced by both sides in this House are an indication of those thai will bt used on the hustings, tbe people will not know in what position tbey may be placed if they agree to confer additional powers on the Commonwealth; therefore a negative vote may be 'expected. I am not in favour of the measures, because the powers which they propose to confer.are f a r greater than would be in the best interests of Australia. Co-operation between the States and the Commonweal th would be the best means for achieving orderly marketing of primary who is solid in his products. Honourable members w ill agree that any proposal for an alteration of interesting the Constitution should be studied and I commend his analysed in every way. Unless very opposite. drastic amendments be made to these Eremantle bills, I shall not be able to support them. Eepatriation) [12.5] I support these three greater power be conferred on the Commonwealth. I agree with the honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) that we cannot live in the past, and I trust that none of us desires to do so. The honourable member said that he would not oppose the maternity allowance, child endowment, and widows' pensions, and he predicted that the validity of these enactments would never be challenged. But it might be challenged; and should the challenge succeed, we would revert to past conditions. The rearing of a family imposes great hardship on the parents. 1 hope to see the child endowment much higher ihan it is now. I admit that it was introduced by the parties that now sit in Opposition, ancl I give credit to them on that account; but the amount was raised by the present Government from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a week, and it must go higher. I was reared in a district where there were large families, and am familiar with the conditions against which they had to struggle. When I was being reared, my parents had to struggle hard, and a child endowment would have been most acceptable to them. During tbe rearing of my family, my wife and I , having put the children to bed, had to pack apples unti l late at night, in order to make sufficient to pay the interest on the mortgage on our f a r m . Our economic position ought to have been sufficiently secure to obviate our having* to do that. Child endowment provides a measure of security for the women by whom it is drawn. A man who was chairman of a meeting in my electorate during tbe las; election campaign admitted to having a family of twenty. It cannot be contended that large families are not of great benefit to the country; but whereas they were the order of the day at one time, tbey are now practically non-existent. If women lose the fear of economic i h 7 security they will again produce large families. Alwaysi n the back of their in inds is the fear that something might happen to the breadwinner-unemployment, accident, or death-in which event the family would be left without provision for their future. If the powers now being sought are conferred on the Commonwealth, it will be able to provide a bills. It is essential that measure of security. The honorablo member for Wimmera said that the Government, under extended powers, might nationalize the medical profession. It is not necessary to do that. In Tasmania, -members of the medical profession are subsidized to attend to people in outback districts, and the system has proved most successful. About eighteen years ago, in a milling district in the lower part of my electorate, a man told me that when his wife was ill the doctor whom he summoned had to leave his car 3 miles distant fro m the home, and before examining the woman wanted to be paid £15 for his visit. He was taken inside the home and shown that the larder was practically empty. Two children were in bed, with a covering of only one blanket The father told the doctor that he was not in a position to pay the fee that had been asked, ancl the doctor insisted that his wife should be removed to hospital in order that she might receive the medical attention that she needed. Steps to this end were taken, but she died before entering the institution. Happenings of that kind convinced the Government of Tasmania of the necessity to provide medical attention for tliose who were pioneering the outlying districts of the State. I heard one honourable -member say that if a free medical service were provided for everybody, the use of it would be twice as great as the calls that are now made on the medical profession. I was reared in a district in which medical aid could not be obtained free of charge, and because of the poor circumstances of most families, a person had to be on the verge of death before' a doctor would be summoned to attend to him. Under the Tasmanian scheme, medical men visit theschools, and also conduct periodica] examinations of families in outlying districts. We should provide better conditions for all our people than were provided for our predecessors. That is why the Government desires to be empowered to legislate in respect of social services. If a succeeding government set out to reduce taxation, it might be inclined to discontinue some of the existing services in order to balance its budget. So long",24,Evatt

When I returned to EnglandI said to a merchant, "" Y o u said that there was a big surplus of wheat in Eussia. Well, there is not "" . He replied, "" It doesn't matter. There is a big surplus in Canada"". I travelled back to Australia via Canada, and there I learned that, because of the drought in t h e United States of America,. Canadian wheat was being sent to that country, and prices were rising. In 1936, I spoke to the right honourable member for Cowper( S ir Earle Page) just before he lef t for Great Britain, and said to him, "" Before you return the price of wheat w ill be 4s. a bushel "". He laughed, and said, "" Neither you nor I w ill ever again see wheat selling at 4s. a bushel""; and he talked of the huge surplus of wheat .throughout the world.

I hope that the Commonwealth will be given the power which it needs to legislate in regard to employment. If the Commonwealth is able to legislate direetly on such matters that .power will make for much greater contentment among the workers. The Government is asking for definite powers for tbe Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in respect of employment, organized marketing and social services. Surely no one can question the right of the Commonwealth to deal with, such matters. Leader of the Australian Country party) [12.25] -Fo r the second time within two .years this House has before it legislation providing for the making of an appeal to the people to grant new powers to the Commonwealth. The Government has profited from experience. Last time it asked for fourteen powers, and these, together with the three so-called safeguards, were all lumped together so that the electors had to accept them all or reject them all. As a result, they were -overwhelmingly defeated. This time, it is intended to put the proposals separ-ately, so that the people may accept or :reject any one of them. The attitude of the Australian Country party towards proposals for constitutional reform has for a long time been well defined. We believe that a Constitution which was written 45 years ago must need modifying and bringing up to 1. Amendment of the Constitution to(<*-) eliminate overlapping between'federal and State jurisdiction in : ( i ) industry, ( i i ) trade and commerce, and ( i i i ) finance. (?>) re-arrange the financial relationships between the States and the Comeconomic and developmental requirements of each State will be automatically taken into consideration and provided for by agreement between the States and the Commonwealth. (o) provide for co-operative development by the States and the Commonwealth of. ( i ) Public health and hospital services, ( i i ) all forms of transport, ( i i i ) social services. (iv) agreement as to settlement of industrial disputes, and (v) power production and water conservation. ' 2.

Pending this procedure, an approach be made to the States for the transfer of certain indispensable and urgent powers to the Commonwealth to enable them to f u l f i l their joint responsibilities for economic development and social progress. The Australian Country party believes that the Government is approaching the matter in the wrong way, and that the amendments immediately sought are unnecessary. The Government is seeking these additional powers so that it may validate certain legislation, the validity of which is now in doubt. The Government wishes to place beyond question the",27,Evatt

82,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"power of tlie Commonwealtli to continue social services, including child endowment and family allowances. The doubt on the validity of such services has arisen _ as the result of the judgment of the High Court in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case. It is worth noting that, of the fourteen powers sought at the last referendum, this one about family allowances stood thirteenth on the list. The Government is now asking for power to legislate, in respect of organized marketing of primary products. At the last referendum, the Government wanted power to legislate in respect of the ""marketing of commodities "", and the difference is important. The third proposal of the Government is that the Commonwealth should have power to legislate in respect of terms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription. was the second of the Government's fourteen points at the 1944 referendum. appeared under the bald heading, "" Employment and Unemployment "". We were told in 1944 that, if the referendum were lost, all sorts of dire economic results would follow. When the proposals were rejected by the people, the Government said that child endowment was in jeopardy, that its plans for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen could not be carried out, and, indeed, that economic depression could not be avoided. . Strangely enough, the powers which the Government claimed to be most important in 1944, are not referred to in the three bills now under discussion. Therefore, I am impelled to seek tbe reason underlying the Government's new proposals. In doing so, I recall the propaganda of fear employed by the Government in the 1944 referendum campaign. An enormous sum was expended on the campaign by the Government through the Department of Information ancl one advertisement published at the expense of the taxpayers depicted a sad-faced woman above the caption, "" Mother, vote Tes to keep your child endowment"". same sort of misleading propaganda at the expense of the countiy in connection with the campaign for the new proposals. In spite of the Government's campaign of Mr Fadden'. r fear, the 1944 proposals were defeated. I ask the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) whether the child endowment scheme has . been jeopardized in any way in the intervening period. The answer, of course, must be no. This exposes the dangerous nature of the Government's tactics. Its propaganda was entirely misleading, and ii served only to exaggerate unfounded fears in the minds of a few people. No meniber of the Opposition objects in any way to placing the validity of child endowment, maternity allowances and widows' -pensions beyond doubt. But the Government has adopted tbe wrong approach to the matter. A referendum is unnecessary. The Government wants the people, at the referendum, to grant powers with relation, not only to child endowment, maternity allowances and widow pensions, but also otlier extraneous items; all are to be lumped together in the That proposals. Child endowment was brought into being by the parties which are now It in Opposition. The scheme has never been in jeopardy, as the Government claims, and is never likely to be in jeopardy. The Government could easily have made arrangements with the States to have power referred to it in order to place the validity of the legislation beyond doubt. The Government's methods are unfair. The power sought in relation to child endowment, maternity allowances and widows' pensions should be sought separately. There would be no doubt -then that the proposal would receive the almost unanimous support of the people. The Government has arranged for the referendumto be held on the day of the general elections, and it has wrapped up with the proposals which I have mentioned other proposals relating to sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services, benefits to students, and family allowances which are extremely controversial. This will serve only to confuse the main issues. Let us examine the way in which the validity of child endowment, maternity allowances and widows' pensions is to be shackled to the other proposals under the We may expect the Government's plan. At the 1944 referendum, the Government took every possible advantage of its opportunities by wrapping up repatriation with' certain other obnoxious proposals which had to be approved or rejected by the people intoto. The Opposition, then counselled the Gomisguided that the scheme had to be verament to submit the request in relation subsidized from Consolidated Revenue as to repatriation as one specific proposal, so follows:that it would not be jeopardized by the bad features of the other proposals. However, the Government rejected the advice and tried to create a fear complex by claiming that, if all of the proposals were not accepted, it would not be able to deal In operation, the scheme has not achieved with the re-establishment of ex-servicethe desirable results originally envisaged. men. But what has happened since the The physical effects on the people, apart referendum was lost? The Re-establishfrom the economic effects, have been ment and Employment Act has been most unsatisfactory. As evidence of this, passed, and the Government is carrying I refer to a government-sponsored adveron unchecked with its repatriation plans, tisement published.in Wellington on the including its schemes for land settlement 29th December, 1944. This is what it and housing. Therefore, its attempts statedto create fears in the minds of the people ave proved to have been unjustified. Now, . . . The Social Security Fund spent more in its anxiety to obtain authority for certhan £750,000 on medicines last year, supplied tain obnoxious social service schemes, it free to the public. has linked them with other schemes, the It is fallacious to say that a governmental value of whicb is undisputed.

The announcement Its tactics do not deceive anybody. Everycontinuedbody knows why the referendum is to be held on the same date as the general as a nation of tonic-takers and pill addicts. elections. I emphasize that the Opposition does result not object to the safeguarding of child endowment, maternity allowances and. other desirable social services. However, a fundamental principle of the policy result of the scheme is contained in a of the Opposition is that social services, press report which appeared in Wellingin the main, must be financed on a ton on the 27th October, 1945.

83,Mr Fadden,"In amplification of the New Zealand Observer of the 31st October, 1945To-day the Government, as stated in the House by Mr Nordmeyer, is considering a revision of the present method of payment and when .it is seen how the cost of the medical benefits is rising year by year, the need for action is clear. This is the story as told in Health Department reports: 194243 194344 .1944-45 The increased cost in three years is over 'a -quarter of a million pounds. "" Special arrangements"", alone, cost £23,855 last year. Last year the Health Department was not perturbed by the increase in the cost, judging hy the following passage from its report:"" The cost of thegeneral medical service' -shows a slight increase on that for the previous year. The shortage of civilian doctors, and tlie long, hours they are working in many cases, makes it unlikely that the cost will increase further under present conditions "". This year the report dismissed the problem in one sentence: ""General Medical Services: The costs are still rising, and w i ll continue to -do so as fresh medical practitioners enter service"". In other words, because tliere are more -doctors, to treat the same number of patients, more money will have to be paid, though there are fewer patients per doctor. It is curious reasoning, and evidently Mr Nordmeyer -tliought so, from the tenor of his remarks In the House However, the cost of medical benefits is not the only problem. Pharmaceutical benefits are even more of a headache for their authors, as the following figures testify: 194243 . . 194344 . . "" 1944-45 . . The Health Department soberly reported in 1944 that "" it is hard to resist the conclusion that many unnecessary bottles of medicine are prescribed "". This year it says, "" This rise has occurred without apparent deterioration in the general health . . . and is very disquieting "". It may be disquieting, but is it really surprising? Isi t surprising that people are flocking into doctors' surgeries to be treated for minor ills? When people are detached every week from one-twentieth of their earnings, under the heading of social security, they naturally neglect no means of getting something hack for their money. So the chemists prosper (although no' one seems to mind about that) and the doctors prosper, and the public just pays its taxes and grumbles. is back where it was in 1941. It is negotiating again with the medical profession in the hope of evolving some workable substitute for the present fee-for-service Mr Fadden. Whatever scheme is adopted, there are certain to be weaknesses. For the doctors, as Mr Nordmeyer has said, are no better and no worse than otlier people in the community, and if they are put on a salary they may be disposed to demand regulated hours of work, just like the more humble toilers. , The main lesson, perhaps, is that it is all very well to have high ideals, but a dash of practical common sense is still a very useful quality. So much for the New Zealand scheme. I £ now quote from .the Christian Science. . 1,010,052 .. . . 1.179,331 Monitor of the 9th Pebruary, 1946, to .. 1,287,023 show the experience of other countriesExperience with socialized medicine in Europe shows it has led to inferior service and to economic and political problems. In every country there has been a constant increase in the sickness rate after the introduction of health insurance. In Germanyi t trebled from 1885 to 1930. In England the number of claims increased by almost 50 per cent, in a six-year period from 1921 to KI27. In both countries doubtless some of the increase was due to malingering, but an appreciable part was caused by poor medical service Again, in England there has been much argument about the quality of medical care given-the workers. Some of the proponents of the system have insisted that they got better attention than they did in preinsurance days. Others disagree. Ernest Bevin has characterized the medical service given the industrial classes as "" a tragedy of incompetence . . ."" The third and most insidious danger is the political one. Investigating doctors fourifl much evidence about the quality of medical care. The increasing cost of the systems is a matter of record, but the growth in'the political importance of the administrative organization has gone almost unnoticed in most countries £ until a crisis. Such an emergency occurred in . . 503.237 Germany in 1933. One of the first things the . . 702,199 Nazis did after they took over the reins of 980,237 government was to seize control of tlie health insurance funds and to convert the offices into > governmental agencies to aid in regimenting the people. I have made those quotations in order to show that the Government would bepur-, suing a dangerous course in proposing to ask the people to grant it power to operate the very desirable social services that are now in operation together with undesirable services like the so-called free medical service. By lumping them together the Government is placing desirable social services in jeopardy. SoI urge that the Government divide the Apparently, the Government to-day proposal. It should-ask the people for power to place beyond doubt the validity of the existing social services. That system. would have our wholehearted support. If the Government wants power to legislate in regard to medical and dental services it can put an additional separate proposal before the peopie. One has to search for reasons wby tbe Government proposes a referendum on the subject of the organized marketing of primary jjroducts. In and out of season, the Australian Country party has sought amendment of section 92 of the Constitution in order that the Commonwealth might exercise control of marketing. In 1937 honourable gentlemen opposite opposed and succeeded in having defeated a referendum on that matter. In 1944, the Attorney-General refused point blank to include organized marketing in the referendum of that year. Now he shows a remarkable change of front, and the House is entitled to know why. The Australian Country party' believes in tbe continuance of the organized marketing that has been possible under existing and war-time powers of the Commonwealth. be carried out as far as possible on the basis of sensible co-operation wih the States. Much has been learnt since the referendum of 1937. The success of the Australian Agricultural Council has demonstrated the wisdom of a policy of co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. As the right honourable inember for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) said in.his excellent speech last night, the Agricultural Council, which bas years of experience, should be used to the greatest possible degree by making it a statutory body. Organized marketing involves some degree of regimentation, but, by the greatest stretch of imagination, one cannot say that the Commonwealth Government can control the marketing of primary products, ambiguous as that term is, without having a say in respect of production. Does the Commonwealth Government intend to allow the States, which control the land on whicb primary products are grown, to have full control over production and to deal only with the actual marketing of those products? Either the Commonwealth must usurp State functions, and exercise control over production or chaos will result. This matter must be looked at in the light of what the Attorney-General said about section 92 of the Constitution. He saidI have explained my view that section 02 does not altogether prohibit organized marketing. Some marketing schemes have beeu upheld, notwithstanding section 02, on the ground that they were directed not to the mere restriction of interstate commercial transactions but to the achievement of such objectives as tlie preservation of standards of purity and quality, and the maintenance of supplies for consumers. Eor the life of me I cannot understand why the Attorney-General with all his legal ingenuity cannot devise legal phraseology that would satisfy those specifications. I ask the Attorney-General what primary industry is incapable of coming within the specifications that he outlined in his second-reading speech. By exercising his undoubted legal ingenuity, the Attorney-General should be able to draft a marketing arrangement which would not ""be ultra vires the Constitution. When the Lyons Government's marketing proWe believe that it should posal was defeated at the referendum in 1937, the major primary industries were able to continue as the result of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. Eor example, the butter industry was able to maintain its conditions and retain producer-control through an arrangement between the butter producing States. The meat and wheat industries were able to formulate satisfactory marketing schemes. Therefore, I ask the Attorney-General tq inform me what particular primary industry will benefit from the Government's referendum proposals which cannot benefit under the specifications he enunciated in his second-reading speech? In order to gauge the wisdom or otherwise of this proposal for orderly marketing, we must have an unambiguous definition of "" primary products "". The Attorney-General saidAll Australians, for instance, would immediately recognize butter, cheese, flour and dried fruits as primary products, though not cake or bread. If flour is a primary product, I ""should like to know whether sugar is a primary product? Is a distinction drawn between raw sugar ancl refined sugar? And how will margarine, the great competitor of butter, be classified ? If flour is a primary product, can breakfast foods be so regarded? The manufacture of breakfast foods is no more intricate than the milling of flour. Therefore, honourable members on this side of the chamber want to know what precisely is the definition of "" primary products "". I am of opinion that the Attorney-General recognized that the obstacle constituted by section 92 has been made more formidable by tbe judgment of the High Court in the recent Airlines case. Briefly, the. High Court held that the Commonwealtb Government could not have a monopoly of interstate aviation The wider the Attorney General makes the definition of primary products, the more he will break down the obstacle formed by section 92. Obviously, the purpose of this proposal is to give effect to the Labour party's fundamental policy of socialization. Trade unions and Communists have harassed tbe Government to implement its policy for the socialization of the means of\ production, distribution, and exchange. The Government's banking legislation has satisfied the demand for the socialization of exchange. In addition, the Government controls distribution, because it has acquired power over transport. It has decided to conduct interstate air services in competition with private enterprise, and proposes to build a fleet of coastal vessels. Production is tbe only unfulfilled part of the Labour party's policy of socialization. warn the people that the Government's proposal for orderly marketing, in its present form, is no more than the first step towards the 'socialization of the means of production. If production is to be regimented, what will be the result? General stated that safeguards, will be provided against industrial conscription, guards be provided against the socialization of the means of production, which is an indispensable part of marketing ? During the war, Australians experienced the effects of the regimentation of production. The -Commonwealth paid primary producers 12s. an acre not to grow wheat, and the cast of that policy was approximately £1,500,000. Mr Fadden. Despite food shortages throughout the world, potato-growers were instructed to reduce their acreages by 25 per cent. Those are two straws in the wind indicating that the Government intends to socialize tbe means of production, fExtension of time granted.] Tbe Government's proposals for orderly marketing are too ambiguous. Orderly marketing can .be achieved most effectively, first, by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, and, secondly, by encouraging producer-control, as the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) advocated yesterday. Those requirements have been proved since tbe rejection of the marketing referendum in 1937. Honourable members on this side of the chamber desire to know who will benefit from the Government's proposals for orderly marketing, and whether the benefit will be greater than primary industries derive under section 92, as outlined by tbe Attorney-General in his speech on the Constitution -Alteration (Organized Marketing pf Primary Products) Bill. The Constitution Alteration (Industrial Employment) Bill providesSection fifty-one of tlie Constitution is altered by inserting after paragraph (xxxiv.) the following paragrapli:"" (xxxiv.A.) Terms and conditions of employment in industry, but not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription:"". I Why does the Government require that power? Does it intend to usurp the functions of the Arbitration Court and reduce to a dangerous degree the value of arbitration and conciliation? The Commonwealth, we have been told, requires this power in order that the Parliament"" may fix wages and working The Attorneyconditions. In seeking this power, the Government had yielded to outside pressure groups, particularly the Communist but will effective safeelement, which has agitated for a standard working week of 40 hours throughout Australia and an increase of the basic wage by £1 a week. In order to placate the.se pressure groups, the Government has been forced to appeal to the people for constitutional authority to fix wages and determine working conditions. If that power be granted, the Government must interfere very dangerously with the functions of the Arbitration Court, and undermine the sound and desirable foundation of arbitration, and conciliation. Yesterday, tbe honourable inember for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) accused us of insincerity regarding the implementation of tbe policy of the Australian Country party. He stated that the party advocated stabilization, and that if we did not support the referendum proposals, we would be hypocritical because we would neglect an opportunity to remove a constitutional obstacle to stabilization. The inference to be drawn from the honourable member's speech was that members of the Labour party conscientiously desire to implement their policy, and in order to do so, must sweep away constitutional barriers. The policy of the Labour party for a shorter working week, which is contained in sub-division 9 of "" Industrial Begulation "", statesWorking hours not to exceed 30 a week. So it is not a 40-hour week that the economic structure of Australia will have to bear if the Government sincerely desires to implement the Labour party policy. The primary producers, whose commodities are sold in the markets of the' world, matter will be made of what hitherto has been in competition with those of other exporting countries, must vote at the referendum with a full knowledge of the Labour party's goal. Many eminent people, including Labour leaders, are opposed to the fixation of wages by parliamentary action. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) put a strong case in bis usual lucid and logical way against this proposal. It must be obvious to all thinking people that parliamentary action in this respect is entirely undesirable. The determination of wages and working conditions is a delicate and complicated business which should not be left to the 75 members of tins' House and the members of tbe Senate. It should be the work of experts acting in a judicial capacity. I bring to tbe notice of honourable members a statement made by Mr Forgan Smith on this subject at the Emu Park Labour convention. I do not believe that any honourable member opposite will suggest that Mr Forgan Smith is not a thoroughly good Labour man, in fact, as good as any honourable inember sitting on the Government benches. Mr Forgan Smith saidIn connection with the points made by other speakers respecting what they called government reduction of wages, he, as a meniber, vas prepared to take his share of the responsibility for everything that had.been done. Ee stood for the maintenance of the Arbitration Court, free from political interference, and which would adjudicate untrammelled upon the facts laid down before it in accordance with the provisions of the act. Parliament was not in a position to fix wages . . . convention must face the facts of life as they existed. Thc system of arbitration adopted by the Labour Government was sound and just, and none would regret it more than the workers if this structure was destroyed. those statements? 1923. I also direct attention to a statement made by the late Chief' Justice McCawley, President of the Queensland Industrial Court, which is reported in Queensland Hansard of the 22nd October, 1924, at page 1820,'as follows:Arguments which may be suggested against direct intervention are ( I ) Parliament is not suitably constituted for the exercise of this specialized function; (2) a party political regarded as in the nature of a judicial function; (3) wages may vai;y with the swing of the political pendulum. Political gains may be transitory, may be reversed by succeeding Parliaments, and may jeopardize the whole system of arbitration. Mr Theodore, speaking at a meeting of the Trades and Labour Council, on the 5th December, 1923, saidFor a reform to be enduring they wanted to be sure of its economic soundness before they brought it in. . . . It was more desirable to accomplish such reforms as a 44-hour week through the Arbitration Court. When the matter was submitted to the court, consideration was given to the economic question. . . . He was speaking' with experience as the head of an administration administering nationalized industries as well as others. . . . He did not want to deceive them by saying that the 44-hour week had not been legislated upon because the Government had not bad time. The reason was that it was not good poliey by legislation to hamper or interfere with the free exercise by the Arbitration Court of its duties. I say the legislature is not the instrument to effect that kind of reform. If it were, there would be no need for arbitration at all. . . . H might be said "" raise enough money to cover the expenditure "".",30,Cameron Are The Monwealth In Such A Way That The

85,Mr Faddek,"On the Sth March,There is little need for me to quote other authorities on'the suhject although I coul'd do so, and shall do so on another occasion. My point at the moment is that any interference with our system of conciliation and arbitration would be most unwise. To allow a government which is subject to dictation by Communist-controlled trade unions to meddle in this matter would be extremely detrimental to the economic welfare of Australia. The purpose of the Government in introducing the industrial powers proposal is, without doubt, to enable it to implement, to a greater degree than ever, its socialization policy, and to introduce into Australia uot a 40-hour working woek but a 30-hour working week.

The increasing, scope of the Commonwealth Court of Conciiiation and Arbitration has developed a more"" uniform wage system than in otlier federations,, and the established practice of adjusting wagesto the cost of living relates more closely to movement of incomes and prices in Australiathan in most other countries. W it h thismachinery the Australian federal system iswell equipped to develop a progressive economic policy after the Avar. In the light of all that I have said, it will surely not be suggested by any reasonable people that it would be wise for additional powers under the headings specified in these bills to be given to this Parliament. I consider that the introduction of the social services proposal is likely to jeopardize child endowment, maternity allowances and has been developed in a most effectiveis well way. The Australian Agricultural Council ensures the greatest possible degree Australia It affords an marketing of primary products.

The call to tbe people of this country is to "" produce, produce, produce"". We need, also, to do everything w it h in our power to ensure the maintenance of economic equilibrium within Australia, so that our great exporting industries may be able to operate on a competitive basis at home and in the -markets of the world. Economic equilibrium is essential both nationally and internationally. We should not take any action whatever that w ill impair our ability to take our f u l l responsibility as an integral part of the British Empire. These proposals come with peculiar in appropriateness Labour party which opposed the referendums of 1937 in connection, with the marketing of primary products, section 92 and aviation. The Labour party's case in that connection was prepared by the late Mr Curtin, who made it clear in the official pamphlet that was issued on that occasion that his party regarded the proposed amendments as totally unnecessary. I quote the following passage from the matter which he prepared:Once again democracy is attacked. There is never a bold, frontal attack. That would alarm us and we should unhesitatingly resist. But little by little control over the things that matter is stolen from the people. By delegating to unrepresentative, irresponsible authorities the reality of power our "" elected persons "" evade responsibility. Here, under the cloak of technical and ambiguous language, upon the pretext of an emergency is another attempt to whittle away our self-government. Those who believe that responsibility should accompany power will vote "" No"". freedom which the Constitution guarantees: Defend the "" seamless garment"" of Australian unity; resist every attack upon democracy. Mr Curtin wrote on behalf of the Australian Labour party, and he appealed to all the electors of Australia. That is vvhat I am now doing. We are not facing an emergency at the moment and there is no reason for haste in dealing vvith this subject. Proposed alterations to the Constitution should be considered j n 'a proper manner. There should be a thorough overhaul of the Constitution and not a piecemeal approach to tbe subject. For that purpose an elected convention should be held. These measures are entirely unnecessary under existing circumstances. [401 the present, I have considered that the broadcasting of parliamentary debates might not be in the best interests of the Parliament. But the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), vvith his humbug and hypocrisy, has presented the strongest argument in favour of broadcasting to tbe farmers of this country speeches such as he has just made. He has become a complete misleader of the Australian Country party. I have listened very attentively to the speeches of other members of his party on this matter. They first entered this House at the same time as I did, and I know that they were then staunch supfro m the Australian porters of the principle of orderly marketing; yet yesterday and to-day they bave shown' themselves to be completely confused. I wondered why, until I had heard the speech of their leader. That right honourable gentleman claimed that, if the wording of these proposals were broadened, the Government would socialize' everything, and that if their scope were narrowed, the demands of the farmers would not be met. In his opening remarks he said that, the political actions of the Australian Country party in relation to constitutional reform had been clean. Actions speak louder than words. The Government has been accused of a wrong approach to this matter, and it has been argued that before any proposals were formulated a convention should have been held. Let us consider the record of the parties that sit opposite in regard to Constitution Protect the conventions. Since the inception of federation there have been eleven referendums, five of which have been submitted by the Labour party and six by either the Australian Country party or its bedmate the Liberal party, the United Australia party,, the Nationalist party, or whatever the name happened to be at the time. No t one of those six referendums was the product of a convention. Have honourable members suggested how the convention which they favour should be constituted? Should it be an elected body? If so, should it be elected on an adult franchise,' a State basis, or the basis adopted for election to the House of Representatives? Have",34,Anothek Problem
86,Mr Lemmon (Forrest) [3.0],"U p tothey said whether the persons elected should be representatives of commerce, industry, or primary production? Let them state how the convention should be constituted. Even if we had a convention, any proposals emanating from it would have to be passed by this Parliament before they could be submitted to the people. The broadest and most representative convention ever held was that called by the late Mr Curtin. It was attended by representatives of seven parliaments, five of which were controlled by the Labour party, and two by non-Labour parties. Therefore, the Labour party had greater parliamentary representation throughout Australia than had its opponents. However, (hat fact did not have a bearing on the selection of the delegates. Invitations were issued to the leaders from each side of each Parliament. The Leader of the Australian Country party was then the Leader of the Opposition in this House. He went to great pains to implore the convention to take certain action. These were his final remarksOn behalf of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament, 1 desire to thank you, Mr that the correct foundation on wbich to Curtin, for the sentiments and the thanks that you have expressed. I also am pleased to liave been associated with such a historic gathering. I think the bill that we have just passed can be accepted as a monument of cooperation, and as evidence of ' unselfishness and compromise on the part of every one, 1 particularly those who have represented the States here. We must appreciate that the States, who comprised the major portion of thedrafting committee, have compromised to a great extent, as is shown by the terms of tlie bill"". All this goes to show that when Hostility was shown towards me when Australians are required to get ""together and do a big thing for tlieir country, they are prepared' to exert every possible effort to achievetlie result which is best calculated to serve tlie interests of the nation. That occurred' not 22 or 25 years ago, hut as recently as 1942. .What happened'"" subsequently? When the whips of big interests cracked, and our political opponents were given their instructions, they endeavoured to confuse the issue. They are actingsimilarly to-day. When the Leader of the Australian Country party was throwing out a smoke screen, and. declaiming about the terrible things that would happen, be charged honourable Mr Lemmon: members on this side with having Said that there would be certain dislocation of industry, and that serious problems would confront tbe Government, if the last referendum were not carried. He then went on to ask why our predictions had not been verified. The first proposal at that time was for a reference of power by tbe States for five years, the Government stating that the additional powers would be needed wben the National Security Regulations had ceased to operate. As that will not occur before tbe 31st December next, we have no need to apprehend difficulties until the intervening period has elapsed. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) endeavoured to damn the case for extra powers that has been submitted to this House by submitting a price quotation in the most dishonest way, and saying, "" This is the result of orderly marketing. Pre-war, the average price for butter-fat was so much, and since we have been operating under orderly marketing it has been about l d . per lb. less"". The honourable gentleman gave the figures for one butter company only. It may have been a private company, or a co-operative company working on a share basis. Is build a ""case ? What the honourable gentleman did not say was that while tbe party of which he is a member was in power, the Australian average price for butterfat was 13.59d. per lb., whereas wbile this Government has been in power it has been 17.9d. per lb., or an increase of 4.31d. per lb. .Those are the latest figures, made available to me only yesterday by the Commonwealth Statistician. I refused to consent to the honourable member incorporating certain figures in Hansard. My reason for that was that he had refused to answer me when, by interjection, I asked whether he was quoting Australian figures. the honourable member not making an honest statement. When a man is discussing national marketing he ought to give national figures, not those of one company about wbicb we do not know anything.",36,Anothek Problem

88,Mr Lemmon,"I feared that he was 'Anotiier lionorable member opposite told a funny story about one "" Kangaroo Bill"" wbo did not bave to work because be had no mortgage, and tried to connect that in some way with an orderly marketing scheme, which, he said, favoured the poor man, the rich man being favoured by an open market. I point out to him that when a Government which he supported was in power, the rate of interest was 8 per cent. That is the rate which I had to pay when I began farming. Since tbe present Government has ""been in power the rate has been reduced to 4if per cent. Therefore, the man who carried the mortgage has received a great benefit. Two Opposition members have disgovernment will be in power for some cussed the policy of the Government in years to come.

If I were in Opposition, and than one occasion' in this House, was not genuinely interested in the welfare of responsible for the reduction of producprimary producers, I should be most tion in Western Australia by even one anxious that the Commonwealth Parliabushel. The reason for the reduced proment should have these powers so that, duction in that State, and in every other whatever government was in power in wheat-growing State, was the shortage of the future, it might be able to do what man-power, ancl later the inability to was necessary to secure the financial obtain supplies of superphosphate. In well-being of the primary producers. 1942-43, the licensed acreage-that is, the quantity which farmers were allowed to grow-wa s 1,818,000 acres. The crop which they sowed totalled 1,753,000 acres. the war to import wheat into Queensland Therefore, they were 65,000 acres below because the Government refused to pay what they were permitted"" to grow. In the growers more than 3s. a bushel, the following year they were 308,SS8 acres and because production was limited to below what was permitted, and in the 3,000 bushels for each grower. As a two succeeding years they were 446,316 matter of fact, at no time did the Goacres and 66S,338 acres respectively below vernment limit production to 3^000 that figure. That disposes finally of bushels per grower, and the returns of the charges brought by honourable memthe various wheat pools show that the bers opposite. The honourable inember growers averaged considerably more than for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) 3s. a bushel for their wbeat. painted a gloomy picture of the plight of the potato-growers under the control have to wait five or six years for' their system. Perhaps because I take an wages? interest in agriculture, I have received telegrams from every potato-growers' organization throughout Australia asking certainly not the responsibility of this me to bring influence to bear on the Government fo continue the present system of control. The honourable member spoke of a grower being compelled to leave his potatoes in the paddock for a montb; but surely that is better than not having any market for them at all! I remember seeing in a potato paddock in Western Australia a notice hung on a fork, "" Take what potatoes you want, but don't take the fork"". And that was while there was in power a government supported by the Australian Country party ! It is interesting that honourable members opposite, when discussing proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, should concern themselves .so much with the policy of the Labour party. They seem to be resigned to the fact that a Labour The honourable member for Maranoa said that it had been necessary during Government, which has not been in power",37,Anothek Problem
89,Mr Bernard Corser,Why did they,38,Anothek Problem
90,Mr Lemmon,"If they did, it wasfor six years. Labour Government came into office, farmers received in one year only 2s a bushel for their wbeat, and in the following year '3s. Since the Labour Government has been in power, the growers have .received in various years 3s. 5d., 4s., 4s., and 4s., as first payments. There will be further payments in respect of some years, whicb will bring tbe price up to 4s. 7d. from one pool and 6s. 2d. from another. Honourable members opposite need not fear that I shall hesitate to debate with them the wheat stabilization scheme when the proper time comes. I have never pulled a punch yet, and I do not intend to do so while I iam a member of this Parliament. I am in favour of the Government's tbree proposals for the alteration of the Constitution. should place beyond doubt the power of the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of social services, particularly sickness and hospital benefits and widows' pensions. Common humanity demands at least that much. It is also necessary that the Commonwealth should be empowered to pay unemployment benefits. When a man cannot find work, it is the duty of the community to see that he and his family have enough to live on. 2,000 years ago, as is illustrated in the Gospel story when the master went into the market to hire labourers for his vineyard. When he went at the ninth hour he found men standing idle, and sent them into the vineyard. He went again at the eleventh hour and found others standing idle, and when he asked them why, they replied, "" Because no man hath hired us"". also into his vineyard, and when the day was over, they all received the same wages. Thus, as long ago as that, it was recognized that a man who had offered his services to the nation was entitled to receive from the nation support for himself and his family. I also support the Government's proposals for cold, economic reasons. expended on medical research and hospital' benefits 'will prevent many persons ilfr. Lemmon. However, before tbe from falling seriously ill . It will tend to keep men in j>roduction, so that they will be assets rather that liabilities. The second proposal before us is a very important one. If we are to prevent the drift of population from the country to the cities, it is imperative that the standard of living in country districts, be improved. Indeed, if the present drift to the cities continues it will be impossible for the. nation to finance its social services. Orderly marketing wil] do more than anything else to improve living standards in the country, and it is, therefore, of vital importance to the workers also. In 1936, the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) introduced, as a private member, a bill, the purpose of which was the same as that of the proposal now before us. Later in the same year, the Australian Country party sponIt is necessary that we sored a similar proposal which became the subject of a referendum. At that time, we did not know so much about orderly marketing as we know now. The Labour party opposed parts of the proposals then submitted, but since then we have changed our opinions. We have seen that the attitude which we then adopted was not in the best interests of the whole community. .We feared, perhaps with some reason, that the proposed scheme, if put into operation, would This principle was recognized increase the cost of living, but we have learned since that that need not necessarily occur. Orderly marketing does not necessarily mean higher prices to the consinner. By controlling supply to meet the demand, it is possible to maintain a fair, average price. This has been proved in respect of butter. Before control was introduced, the price of butter might be l i d . per lb. at one time, and as mucb as He sent them 2s. a little later, a state of affairs wbich was of no advantage to the consumer or the producer. Now, the worker knows what he will have to pay for butter, and the producer knows what his cheque will be. Farmers have many difficulties t'o contend with--drought"" , disease, fire, and flood-but the greatest of all is the violent fluctuations which occur in the Money prices of his products. It is only by preventing such fluctuations' that we can provide satisfactory conditions for the producer, and at the same time ensure that the consumers, will not have to pay too much. A further successful example -of organized production and marketing is afforded by the rice-growing industry in Australia, which happens to be conined.to the State of New South Wales. When tbe industry was begun, the .growers were up against the competition -of rice produced in black-labour countries, and the first rice grown in Australia was of poor quality. The result -was that the industry fell into chaos. 'The growers approached the Scullin Government for assistance, and a protective -duty was imposed for a certain time on imported rice. The growers elected a Iboard of control which instituted -a system of orderly marketing, and just before the war the Australian ricegrowing industry was able to meet tbe -entire Australian demand for rice, while at the same time exporting rice, and selling it in competition on the world's markets with rice grown by -coloured labour. Moreover, the quality -of the Australian-grown rice was better than that of rice grown overseas. A similar story could be told about sugar. In these industries, both the producers .and the consumers have benefited, the only person who is any worse off being the speculator, who stands between them. We on this side of tbe House are unconcerned with ivhat happens to him. We intend, as far as possible, to remove him -from, the economic field. We have no use for the man who speculates in the food of the nation and of the world. recall our experience in regard to the :flour-millers. I remember when the 'Wheat Board first came into existence. The millers objected to the actions of the board, which declared that during the war they must be millers, not wheat .speculators or dealers. It allowed the millers a fair margin of profit, and they stopped dealing in "" futures"" on world wheat pits. They became so satisfied with this system that they now hope it ""will never cease. They are financially better off working as millers and paying a -fair average price for wheat than operatdistinction between delegates and repreing on the market as speculators. The same story can be told about the worsted manufacturers in America. Owing to violent market fluctuations, they would not undertake long-term contracts because tbey feared undercutting if wool prices fell, and losses wbicb would prevent them from meeting their commitments if wool prices rose. As the result of this state of affairs, a "" wool tops"" market developed, and a wool tops exchange was established for dealing in "" futures"". Their only desire was to protect themselves by purchasing wool tops. on the market so as to guarantee an average price for wool. Many industries other than rural industries would benefit from orderly marketing and would welcome it as a means of preventing violent price fluctuations. In conclusion, I say to the people of Australia that, for the benefit of the nation and the welfare of farmers and industrialists of the future, the Government's three proposals should be adopted.. [3.32] I had not intended to take part in this debate, because I have been away attending to my duties in the Northern Territory and returned only a few days ago. I considered that, having been out of circulation, I should watch and listen to what I thought would be a wrangle between lawyers about tbe proposed alterations to the Constitution. However, having listened to all the encomiums which have passed between bonorable members on both sides of the House, and seeing how matey every one seems to be, I thought I should join in the debate. It is interesting, also, to After hearing some of the speeches, particularly those of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), who advocated the abolition of the States witbout tbe establishment of anything to take their place, and of the young bonorable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), witb whose remarks about the duties of the Commonwealth Parliament I disagree, I . consider it to be my duty, first to my conscience and secondly to my constituents, to make a contribution to the debate. I preface my remarks by referring to a speech made by the famous Burke in the House of Commons, in which he made a very clear sentatives. I fear that many honourable",38,Anothek Problem
91,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"members, particularly on the Government side of the House, do not appreciate their responsibilities, and fail to differentiate between tbe. duties of a delegate and those of a representative. Their speeches indicate that they have come here merely as delegates instead of as representatives of the people. I sball not have mucb to say about social services or orderly marketing. The correct policy to be adopted in connection with orderly marketing was stated clearly by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) and the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Padden), and there is little more to be said about it. However, I wish to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa. He spoke of conditions in a district with which he is very familiar. 1 own a small property in the same district, and I speak in terms common to every honourable member who has an interest in the land and carries a mortgage round his neck. On my property, which is 4 or 5 miles away from the property of the honourable member for Maranoa, I produce 500 .or 600 Hereford cattle every year. Therefore, the meat market is of some interest to me. However, it is of much more interest to the people in the distant Northern Territory whom I represent. During the war, this Government showed so little business acumen that the small cattle-raisers in tbe far north of the Northern Territory received a very raw deal. Therefore, I am not complacent, and those cattlemen will not be complacent, about granting the powers which the Government seeks. ber is only barracking for Vesteys. very reverse of that. I welcome the honourable member's interjection, because I intend to kick Vesteys Limited neck and crop out of the Territory, and compel them to confine their activities to exporting only-as did Argentina. If Queensland Country Life, a journal which circulates in Queensland and the Northern Territory, he would have seen two articles written by me and published about two months ago which indicated what I propose to' do about Vesteys Limited. I shall point out some of the mistakes of the Government during the war, as I have learned of them from my constituents whom I recently visited. The Government let a contract in the Northern Territoiy to a certain cattleraising firm for the supply of cattle at £5 10s. a head. Believe it or not, when delivery was about to be made, Vesteys Limited was given a contract by this Government, which now seeks increased powers over marketing, for the supply of 26,000 cattle at £7 10s. a head. How did Vesteys Limited earn the extra £2 a head for the cattle? One small cattleraiser delivered 400 or 500 head of cattle at the abattoirs S miles down the river from Katherine. The manager of Vesteys Limited, who was sitting in his car at the yards at the time, bought the cattle for £5 103. a head and then took them over for killing at the abattoirs at £7 10s. a head, making an outright profit of £2 a head within a few ininutes. Yet this Government claims to be looking after the interests of the "" little man "". It appals me to learn of the things that happened during the war. I say to the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcahy) that I am waiting for a full debate to be held on the subject of the meat industry, when I shall leave very little unsaid about Vesteys Limited. As the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) said, I shall "" pull no punches "" wben dealing with that firm. tioned by the honourable member of good quality ? member is interested, and I shall repeat I am about to do the the story so that he will have no doubts about what happened. The cattle which I mentioned, numbering about 400 or 500, were brought to the killing yards near Vesteys Limited station 200 miles south of Darwin. The owner wants to-know why this Labour Government asked him to bring the cattle 700 miles to the salethe honourable member studied yards and then allowed Vesteys Limited manager, without getting out of his motor car, to buy tbem and resell at a profit of _ £2 a head. I . ask tbe Government to answer that question. I shall take tbe opportunity on a more suitable occasion",40,Anothek Problem

For instance, the company had large mobs of cattle driven across the Northern Territory and through Queensland, taking two years, including stops of six months at a time .at some stations, to the 'market at Cannon Hills. Eiordan) -Order! .[ ask the honourable member to connect his remarks wibh the bills under discussion. bill dealing with the orderly marketing of primary products. Something of real benefit' to small primary producers should emerge from a proper system of orderly marketing. Steps must be taken to ensure that large profiteering interests, like Vesteys Liniited, will not be allowed to dump cattle from the Northern Territory into the CannonH ill s ' yards and so depress prices to the detriment of small cattle-raisers operating in the Queensland coastal districts. I shall elaborate on this point at a more opportune time. I refer again to the most informative andable speech of the honourable member for Maranoa, who referred to the peanut industry. He gave a fine exposition of the nay in which marketing should be controlled-that is by the producer. In dealing with this subject, I shall speak of the'corn industry, which the honourable member did not mention. In the district of Kingaroy, south-eastern Queensland, only' 16 miles from my home, many corn-growers are established on a rich belt of basalt country. In the old days, large firms in Melbourne, such as the sweets manufacturers, decided that they would depress the price of corn. They bought thousands of acres of land in the Kingaroy district, where the red soil is so rich that it could almost be eaten. They grew corn there, but they were not concerned about selling it . They stored it in great barns, to rot if need be, until the farmers . were receiving a reasonable price for corn, when they dumped their stocks on the markets and depressed prices. honourable meniber for Maranoa w ill confirm my statement on that point. If the Minister is sincere he w ill take the advice offered by the honourable mem[5 APRIL, 1946.] (Social Services) Bill 1946. 1127 ber for Maranoa, and accept my modicum of knowledge, also, to ensure that grower-control of marketing under the aegis of the Commonwealth Government shall operate. I consider that the Commonwealth Government should act in an advisory capacity. I do not say that the farmers should be allowed to exploit the control be allowed to continue. No one with an independent mind would ever dream of trying to take away from the people the benefits of such social services as child endowment and pensions. Many people look on people who draw the old-age pension as having wasted their lives. Perhaps they have, hut during their lives they have been of economic value to the community. A man might even have been a' drunkard prior to qualifying for the old-age pension; nevertheless he has been of economic value to the country. Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is not in question. Invalid and old-age pensions are provided for in the Constitution. I repeat that no one would destroy the already existing social services. I do object to such vote-catching dodges as the provision of benefits to students, family allowances, and all the other services that induce people not to be individualists, but (o lean on the Government. I am not complacent about these proposals; on the contrary, I am suspicious. I think many of the proposed new social services show that the Government is politically craven. I remind honourable members opposite that they were elected to this Parliament as representatives of the people not as delegates, although many of them seem to think that the latter is their role. They should not pander to the people in this way. I favour some kind of contributory social insurance scheme like that brought down by the Lyons GovernThe ment, but opposed by the Labour party. Let us have compulsory savings by those who otherwise cannot look after themselves and must be classed as spendthrifts. WhatI object to about this proposal is that it is mere playing to the",41,Anothek Problem

That the House do now adjourn. [3.48] I direct attention to a paragraph in yesterday's Sydney Sun because it confirms something I learned a little while ago in regard to new conditions prevailing in the British Parliamentary Labour party. It appears that the party has suspended what are known as party standing orders, not the House Standing Orders, to permit every member of the party in the House 'to speak and vote against the Attlee Government, if he feels disposed to do so. The statement published last night was made by Mr Herbert Morrison, one of the foremost members of the party. He said.They have had a great time calling Lahour members a collection of dummies, robots, lobbyhave taken over an attractive property fodder, and so on. Henceforth, it appears, they are to be relieved from the caucus rule that they must vote in accordance with the party decision. I raise this because it is high time that freedom of speech in this Parliament, although it was defeated at the last referendum, should be allowed to members of the Labour party. I am AdjoummetU.

He might have to go, too. Or he might be forced, like Sir Francis Drake, to dine alone. The only difference between him and Sir Francis Drake: would be that, whereas Sir Francis dined to music, the offending member matter to the Prime Minister Mr. Chifley), but, as he is a very busy man, Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell),. and ask him to ascertain whether that report is correct, and whether there is any prospect of our having this control on thestatements of Labour members in this Parliament lifted in order that they might openly say what -we know from.'

My object in making that statement, and in bringing: this case before Ministers is to illustratethe apathy exhibited to ex-servicemen: under the Government's disposals policy.. In the case I have in mind, two ex-soldiers who were formerly prisoners of war, and three other ex-servicemen aresuffering merely because of the authorities' desire to satisfy their greed for excessive prices for materials that can be re-, sold only at blackmarket prices.

100,Motion (By Dr. Evatt) Proposed,,43,Queensland Flood Sin Northern Minds
101,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),,43,Queensland Flood Sin Northern Minds
102,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay>,"No galvanized iron is available in Queensland, and every effort to secure corrugated or fibro roofing material bas failed. Appeals to tbe Co-ordinatorGeneral of Public-Works and tbe Director of Material Supplies, have been of no avail owing to the shortage of supplies. The priorities held will be of no avail for at least five months, owing to the shortage of supplies. Queensland is badly dealt with in this matter by comparison with the other States. The. position cannot be attributed to the shortage of shipping, because in time of war . means were found of hurriedly despatching urgently needed material to Queensland. The Government holds large stocks of corrugated 'fibro roofing and other material used in house-building: This"" and other materials suitable for roofing purposes are stored in Brisbane. The Government has adopted a policy which results in feeding the black market. Surplus war materials are sold at auction to dealers. . This practice is followed in Brisbane, as well as elsewhere, with the result that the urgent requirements of ex-servicemen and others in rural districts cannot be met. In the case now under notice, it was ascertained that 1,619 sheets of corrugated fibro roofing material of various lengths would be sold at auction on the SOth March last. In their anxiety to obtain the material wbich they urgently required, the persons to whom I have referred, again made a journey to Brisbane. It, was found that all of the material was not of first class quality, owing to the way in which it had been stacked, but it was sold at auction to dealers, and some lots disposed of at 25 per cent, above the fixed price. In some instances persons who have committed breaches of the prices regulations have been taken fo court for having sold at a few-shillings, above the fixed price of an article, and have been liable to a minimum penalty of three month's imprisonment. plaint, was made to the auctioneer against the high price paid for some of the fibro roofing material, and he declared that it was no business of his, as he was merely acting for the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. He added that a price fixing official should have been in attendance at the sale, and that his absence was clue to the fact that the sale was held on a. Saturday. Many of these sales take place on Saturdays and no price-fixing official is present. I urge the Government to make supplies of roofing material I repeat that available to those who have obtained permits to obtain it. Instead of feeding tbe black market ring, it should be anxious to meet the needs of ex-servicemen and others, who urgently require homes. The Director of Material Supplies and the Co-ordinator-General of Works should be permitted to take over at a just price the supplies of building materials at tbe Government dumps and make thern available in Queensland, as well as in the other States, to those to whom permits have been issued, and who are in the greatest need of those materials with preference to ex-service persons. The Government should institute such a policy, because the present practice of disposing of these materials regardless of who suffers, is causing much distress and want. appeal to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) to investigate the possibility of co-ordinating the activities of Commonwealtb and State departments in order to restore the production on the north coast of New South Wales of food urgently needed for consumption in Australia as well as for despatch overseas. Last week I saw the heavy damagedone by the recent floods in the northern rivers districts. The chaos is unparalleled in the history of the north coast, wbere butter production has declined to about 60 or 70 per cent, of what it was in the month prior to the floods. Many square miles of the best agricultural land in that part of New South Wales is under water, and apparently will remain so for a long time. Lush grass which was submerged for several days has been destroyed. Practical steps will have to be taken promptly' A comin order to alleviate the situation. The position with regard to stock feed is most serious. The season had been one of the best experienced for many years. The crops were well advanced and there was",43,Queensland Flood Sin Northern Minds
103,Sir Eaele Page (Cowper) [4.2],"Ia good growth, of grass, but the sudden innandation of pastures left the. producers lying districts is bad. The deluge practically without stock feed. If tbe Government would arrange to have several truck loads of bran and pollard sent to tbe producers along the northern drivers immediately, the lives of large numbers of valuable milking cows would be saved. I urge tbe Prime Minister to discuss that matter with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully). Some small areas of crop, which could be used for fodder, have not been destroyed. .They were intended for other purposes, but even those crops will be lost if supplies of galvanized barbed wire bridge which cost £150,000 was destroyed; and fencing wire are not provided to protect them from starving stock. The services should bave ample supplies of those materials for immediate distribution. In this instance, time is of the essence of the contract. What we can do to-morrow will be more efficacious than what we do a month hence. Restrictions' on tyres and petrol for motor vehicles which are required by the men' who drive the lorries conveying cream and transport the employees of butter factories from place to place, should be removed during this period. Those drivers should be given the goods which the butter factories state are necessary. The number of tyres required would not total hundreds, but prompt action in making them available may help to save the position. I shall cite an illustration of what has occurred. On the Bellinger River, there are two butter factories. One was fortunate enough to be situated above the level of the flood. It was thought that the second would be out of clanger, but when the flood rose 9 feet higher than the previous record flood, the factory was partly submerged. Fourteen tons of bacon and other stock were ruined, and the electric motors were temporarily put out of action. Therefore, all the cream whicb hitherto had been supplied to that factory, must be transported some miles tc the othev factory and the employees of the idle factory taken to the working factory. The motor vehicles which arc used for this purpose have worn motor tyres, which easily puncture ancl cause delays on the road. Sir Earle Page. Tbe condition of roads in the outoccurred so quickly that bridges and their approaches were destroyed. Thousands of tons of debris has been deposited on roadways and will not be removed for months if the job is under^ taken by manual workers."" The local shire councils should be assisted to purchase or borrow bulldozers for the purpose of removing this debris expeditiously. The services, the Allied Works Council, and the Main Roads Board of New South Wales have the necessary earth-moving equipment. On the Clarence River a the main bridge on the Bellingen River, which was erected at a cost of £50,000 has disappeared; and many smaller bridgeswhich cost £6,000 to-£8,000 also have gone. Obviously, the shire councils cannot hope to restore those bridges at once; they will have to make temporary arrangements at considerable cost. Therefore, they ask that all available material and bridge building equipment in the possession of the Government in the immediate vicinity shall be made available as quickly as possible. Otherwise, producers will not be able to transport their commodities to the towns. Since the telephone lines were swept away by the floods, primary producers in the outlying districts have not been able to communicate with other centres. Can these communications be restored immediately? The roads are almost impassable. When I drove down the main Pacific Highway last Wednesday 1 mile of the road between Kempsey and Macksville was covered with water to a depth of 2 feet. The shire councils also request that builders and engineers, who are still in the services, should be granted temporary release, or be discharged in order to assist with the restoration of essential services. After a complete-estimate of the damage has been made during the next two months, the Commonwealth Government should confer with the Government of New South Wales with a view, to granting assistance. When the floods occurred, the State Government immediately despatched officers to grant relief to destitute persons in the towns; but the greatest distress w ill be found among farmers, because the f r u it s of a year's, labour bave been, swept away. Losses w ill be between £500,000 and £750,000. As this disaster occurred after two years of severe drought, tbe position of the farmers is desperate. 'TheThe various matters which I have raised are handled by different Commonwealth and State departments. As only parts of Victoria, New South Wales, and a part of Queensland have suffered seriously from flood damage, all available materials in all States s'hould be pooled to meet this immediate emergency, and as other materials become available,-they can he distributed among the States on an equitable basis.

The right honourable member for Cowper made a number of requests; some of them f a l l w it h in the ambit of State activity. The demand for earth-moving equipment throughout Australia is enormous, and supplies are inadequate to meet it .
