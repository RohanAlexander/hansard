That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the GovernorGoneral be agreed toMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCE : We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealtb of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for tbe Speech wbich you haye been pleased to address to Parliament. by way of amendmentThat the following words be added to the propoBed Address :"" hut we consider that your Advisers no longer retain the confidence of this House owing to their attemot to limit the rights of the Commonwealtb with regard to constitutional powers, with special reference to financial and industrial matters; also for the unsatisfactory arrangements made in connection with immigration. ' sure we all appreciate the atmosphere of Sweet Nell of Old Drury, which has been introduced into the chamber this session, and which I am convinced will have a marked effect on the debates of the House. In associating myself with the motion of no-confidence which has been submitted by my Leader( Mr. Charlton) I should like to say that I sympathize with the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in the difficult task that was set them of making good speeches out of the matter contained in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of Parliament. In different circumstances I am sure they eould have given better evidence of their value to the Commonwealth as custodians of its progress and prosperity. The gravamen of the charge made against the Government by the Leader retain the confidence of the House, because, in the first place, they propose to hand oyer to the States fche power to impose income taxation which hag hitherto been, held and exercised by us.

3,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [11.1],"I amdid not state the case as it presents itself to the people to-day. the Opposition has rightly said that one result of the Premiers' Conference is that it is proposed by the Commonwealth Government to shift the burden of the war from the shoulders of those best able to bear it to the backs of the workers. The Prime Minister has not denied that that will be the effect of the agreement arrived at, and I defy honourable members opposite to do so. asked to express an opinion on the proposal I said that it simply meant taking the tiara from "" dummy's "" head, putting it on his chest, and at the same time "" pinching "" a couple of his jewels. In the of taxation; but I remind honourable memprocess of making the change "" dummy "" is to be deprived of one or two of his gems. Apart from the collection of income tax from companies, a power which the Government propose to retain -the financial interests by the way are even stronger than the Government, and we may be sure that the Prime Minister will do nothing to injure them-Customs taxation will be our only source of revenue. If our interest payments on war loans are to be made out of Customs revenue the effect will be most detrimental to the workers. A working man with his wife and family will have to pay the "" 5 per cent, blood money."" the words "" 5 per cent, blood ""money"" advisedly, because I , as a member of this House, bitterly opposed borrowing for war purposes. I urged that while we were sending men overseas to fight for us the "" f a t "" man was stopping at home and securing gilt-edged investments. only democratic tinge that could be given to the plea for conscription was that there would be equality of sacrifice. Has there been anything of the kind? What sacrifice has wealth made? Will honourable members tell me of any wealthy man who was ruined by the war ? I defy them to tell me of one whose assets to-day are less than they were before the war, or whose business has been hurt as a result of it. We have not to ask by whom the real sacrifice has been made. In this House alone we have the answer. I hope that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) will explain what influenced him to put on the market a conversion loan at 5 per cent., plus a bonus of £1, with a currency of twenty-five years. Does such a flotation suggest that the The Leader of wealthy are to make any sacrifice? Before the session closes I shall bring before the House one or two cases that will demonstrate once more that the sacrifices have been made and are still being made by men who should not be called upon to bear the burden of the war. Are the moneyed classes "" footing the b ill "" of a war that was fought mainly to protect the interests which they control to-day? When I was Let the Prime Minister answer that question. He has said that the taxation proposals of the Government, which are the outcome of the Premiers' Conference, involve merely an alteration of the incidence bers that the alteration is to be along lines that will protect the interests of those whom he and his party especially represent. Surely we are not going to -meet out of Customs revenue the interest on our war loans. If we are, then the people have been deluded-the Tariff has been imposed, not for protective, but for revenue .purposes. It presses most heavily upon people with large families. Compare the position of a man with no f amily -with that of a woman whose case I intend to bring before the House. She is the mother of fourteen children. Her husband went to the war and ""paid the I use price."" To-day she is receiving a war pension, but surely she and others with large families should not be called on to bear the brunt of the tax necessary to enable us to meet our war loan interest obligations. Families make up the bulk of the population of Australia, and it is The upon them the Government would place the burden of meeting the interest on war loans. The Prime Minister did not tell us of any other way in which the cost of the war is to be met. Earle Page) will clear all that up when he speaks. his Morganatic husband if he can. The Leader of the Opposition made it quite clear that it is the intention of the Government to put the burden on the backs of the workers.

We are not worthy of the positions we occupy here if we cannot take hold of the affairs of Australia, which belong to the Commonwealth rather than to the States, if the real w ill of the people were given effect. They do not want duplication of Government Departments. They do not want seven Parliaments or six Governors and a Governor General. They want Unification, not only in the matter of taxation, but in every other respect. other side hold back from the people what they desire. They are not ready to meet the will of the people. I can give honourable members an instance in connection with a proposal for prohibition in South Australia to show how some public men fail to judge public opinion. A proposal in connection with prohibition was made in South Australia by Tom Smeaton and one or two others, and Mr Peake, the Premier at the time, said that he would make no alteration in the liquor.law, but would let the proposal be decided by a referendum which all votes for 6 o'clock closing, if not in a majority, would be added to those in favour of closing at 7 o'clock, and all votes for closing at 11 o'clock, if not in the majority, would be added to the votes in favour of closing at 10 o'clock. This wa3 the course adopted to discover the w ill of the people; but the system of cumulation was entirely unnecessary, because the 6"" o'clock closing was carried by a two-to-one majority. The Government are proposing to put an end to duplication of taxation; they have suggested that an end should be put to the duplication of electoral rolls, but they are really toying with the subject. If they asked the people straight out whether they desire Unification, they would be told that they did in so loud a voice that they would be deaf for the rest of their lives. I make definite statements, and I want, not airy persiflage, but equally definite statements, in reply. I propose to refer to the indebtedness of Anstey), instead of the advice of Mr. the Commonwealth, and. show what it is, Fisher, had been followed at the beginand what it means; to show what juggling ning of the war, the Commonwealth would there has-been, and how the people have been defrauded by the acts of the Commonwealth Government at a time when they should have been protected. The first loan at 4£ per cent., free of income tax, I am not was described as a "" gilt-edged security "" ; but the men who had to go to the war could not make the condition that they should go free from the liability to be shot. They could place no reservation on their services overseas, but had to take the thick with the thin, and the bad w it h the good. The"" patriots"" at home in Australia were willin g to supply the money, but before doing so they had to be given "" gilt-edged security ""-somethin g that was not offered elsewhere. I shall quote from a speech made by Mr Speaker, in his capacity as The party on the honourable member for Balaclava, and then show that really these "" patriots "" got something for nothing. The country is paying interest up to the rate of 6 per cent, cn money borrowed; and the Treasurer, Dr. Earle Page, has now a splendid scheme by which he proposes to again turn the money over-h e intends to allow the yeast to rise, so that there can be another "" rake off "" for the next twenty-five years. The history of our war loans is fresh in the memory of honourable members. Mr Fisher, after he became Prime Minister, fell away from the spirit of the movement on a cumulative basis, under which had elevated hi m to that position. He was not "" game"" to be the "" big man "" that he was when the Labour party realized his ability, and placed h i m in jjower. On the contrary, he turned to the financiers of Melbourne and asked them to tell him how to finance the war; and, by God, they told h i m ! Those men "" financed "" the war, and so "" financed "" themselves that they are now "" on velvet."" What they "" d i d in the GreatW a r "" I shall tell honourable members before I conclude. I need not traverse in detail the history of our loan issues, but simply say that one commendable feature was that the vultures were not allowed to get in too deeply. The loans were floated locally through the Labour party's Commonwealth Bank, thus saving some of the commission which would otherwise have been necessary; and I may here say that all such commission might be saved if the proper steps were taken. If the advice of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr. have been £219,000,000 better off to-day. Now that we are in the hands of the financial magnates of the country, we shall remain there until the people are educated up to the point of realizing that fact; and this would mean that the country would be managed for their benefit, and not for the benefit of the financial magnates exclusively. There is much talk of bringing immigrants here; and if we were honest we could bring them tomorrow. Plenty of room could be found for them, with, work at remunerative rates, thus promoting the development and progress of Australia to a position second to none in the world-al l that could be done if our desire really were "" Thy Kingdom -come."" But we do not desire "" Thy Kingdom come""; and, if it were probable, every man on the Ministerial side would be pushing to keep it back, for it is felt by them that things are better as they are. The debt to the extent of £219,000,000 is a fictitious one, due, as I shall prove, to juggling with the finances. If that statement is disputed, I hope that facts will be produced to support the denial. Mr Pisher desired to raise the enormous amount of £20,000,000, as he told us timorously at the heginning of the war. He was informed by his advisers that he must be carefulthat it simply ""couldn't be done."" This is exactly what the Prime Minister( Mr amendment to the effect that £20,000,000 Bruce) would have said, and it was what Mr Speaker, as the honourable member for Balaclava, really did say, when speaking on the first ""War Loan Bill. I am not referring to that honourable gentleman now as the Speaker of this assembly, but as one who has been Treasurer in both State and Commonwealth; and he is quoted as a high authority on such matters. On .the 21st July, 1915, as reported on page 5147 of Hansard, the honourable gentleman saidIn my opinion. Ministers have managed to obtain very skilled advice, judging by the terms of the prospectus and the general outline of -the Bill. would have been practically impossible, or at least would have M to the dislocation of important financial interests lying at the root of the employing industrial activities of the country. He said that to raise such a loan was practically impossible, for the reason that immediately that capital had been withdrawn Mr Yates. from industrial investment, industry would collapse like a pricked bladder. In the end, the Government appealed for £5,000,000, and, speaking from memory, raised £7,000,000; but six weeks had not gone over before the Commonwealth went on to the market and raised another £42,000,000. This, again, was followed by a loan of £50,000,000; and so we went on until our indebtedness reached £219,000,000. The honourable member for Balaclava never dreamed that the indebtedness would increase to that extent before .the end of 1918 or 1919. Where is that money? If we study the statistics, we do not see that it was withdrawn from the banks, because the deposits without interest are now practically the same as then; the fact is that the . great financiers, with their four balls, are able to go a little beyond the ordinary Jew with his three. What does all this mean? If we could obliterate all our war expenditure, and the Treasurer were to propose a loan of £20,000,000 for certain purposes, and an honourable member had demonstrated that within five years the amount would be increased to £219,000,000, what reception would the proposal have had? The whole business is a farce; and once the people realize the truth they will put a stop to it. A practical proposal was submitted at the time by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), who moved an be placed to the credit of the Commonwealth Bank and operated on for war purposes. If that had been done the end desired would have been attained without approaching private financiers, and coming to an arrangement by which the Government accepted a bit of paper drawn by certain persons on another bank. If honourable members read the history of the Commonwealth Bank and the note issue, they will find that Sir Joseph Cook and the late Lord Forrest suggested, when the. Bank was instituted, that it would be a haven for impecunious politicians. According to the Jeremiahs To raise £20,000,000 in one sum of the day, the note issue would be a disastrous experiment, and within twelve months we should be able to buy a £1 note for 12s. 6d., or perhaps a basketful for £5.' When the note issue reached about £10,000,000 Sir Joseph Cook held up his hands in horror, and said, "" You are touching the danger to bring about a better state of affairs, line."" What is the gold backing to our . they are regarded as a menace to the note issue to-day? What did Rathenau community. Communists declare that say?-""If all the gold in the universe workers earn the wealth which is spent were sunk in the sea to-morrow, the by others in luxuries, while they themactivities of the nation would not selves live in penury. Let me continue cease for one moment from producing my quotations from -the speech of the what is required for the people."" Sir honourable member for BalaclavaJoseph Cook declared that we had touched the danger line when the note issue had activity tbere is a filtering processreached £10,000,000. Since then it has This, I think, proves that, in the opinion jumped to over £53,000,000. touched the danger line yet?

Of not half so good as the notes that arc course, honourable members opposite, and being discarded in the Commonwealth the financial advisers of the Government, to-day.

11,Mr Yates,"I am very glad of the regardless of those who have to find the words of the honourable member for Balaclava, when he said that what was then suggested could not be done. The heavy burdens of interest have to be met, and the. Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), with the financial magnates of the country, is now endeavouring to place an even heavier burden on to the working class of the community. "" Through the varied strata of human activity there is a filtering process down to the bedrock, and that is the unskilled worker."" I use those words as my text. position of the Commonwealth is clear to those who carefully study it . financiers are, as usual, seeking their pound of flesh, and the Treasurer is than they ask. 4£ per cent., free of income tax, is now being converted on a 5 per cent, basis for a period of twenty-five years. Let honourable members capitalize that and see what the amount is. When these tremendous commitments have been met the amount w ill still be owing. business men or financiers who have contributed to our loans will not only receive an unduly high interest over a long period, but w ill also receive the amount which they originally contributed. give them interest on their money and ret u r n their capital, but we cannot replace a "" Digger's "" lost limb. W h y do we not tell the truth , instead of throwing dust Minister, in reply to the Leader of -the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) did not quote one specific fact. He did not tell us that it was the policy of his Government to further shift the incidence of taxation to the shoulders of those who made the.greatest sacrifices during the war. The poor devils who went to the Front, arid who are now carrying on their ordinary avocations under great difficulties and endeavouring to rear families, are already carrying too heavy a burden. The Leader of the Opposition was quite justified in moving his amendment, and even if it is rot carried it w ill have the effect of drawing public attention to the position. The comments, on industrial affairs, but gave very few facts. What is the position with regard to arbitration? has been congestion in the Court, and that at times the position has been almost If r . Yates. chaotic; but that does not prove that under efficient administration the Commonwealth Arbitration Court cannot function in the direction intended. We should attempt to put our house in order instead of destroying it . l t is, of course, the desire of the moneyed class and those who represent the manufacturing interests that the Federal Arbitration Court should be abolished. I said a moment ago that we do not judge the psychology of the Australian people aright. If we set our The financial efforts in the direction of Unification there could not be the duplication of toThe day. A majority of the people favour one Arbitration Court, the decisions of which should be applicable to all. .The Ausprepared, to give them more tralian people do not wish the power of The loan floated at the Commonwealth Court to be in any . way curtailed. The Government suggest that another tribunal should be appointed, the duty of which would be to decide which industries should come under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. This tribunal would, I suppose, Those successful be only one of many. It is not only the manual workers who wish to approach the Federal Arbitration Court, because public servants, bank clerks, and many others are We desirous . of having their grievances adjusted by that tribunal. Petty prejudice animates the atmosphereI w ill not say of the Court-bu t of the States, and the States believe that they do not in their eyes? The Prime get the best results from the Commonwealth Court. The South Australian Premier( S ir Henry Barwell) is anxious to see all arbitration laws scrapped. That gentleman suggested the appointment of a Conciliation Board consisting of three, four, or five employers and five employees w i th a chairman without a casting vote. If the representatives of both parties could not arrive , at a decision what would result? A union secretary elected to his position by virtue of the confidence reposed in h i m by the members of the union would mot be allowed to sit on such a Board, because the employees' representatives must be men actively engaged in an industry. I was engaged in a certain industry, and was appointed Prime Minister made specious a member of a Wages Board, and, as I was the only one on the Board who was able to speak freely, We know there I opened my mouth very widely in deed. When the employers' logwas submitted the strongest their representatives was that they were afraid of Victorian competition, but the presiding officer awarded a rate 2s. 6d. lower than that prevailing in this State. That is an indication of the necessity of a Federal Court. We adduced evidence to prove that the competition from Victoria would not affect the industry in South Australia, but that did not matter. I said to' the chairman ( Mr T. J. S. O'Halloran) at the conclusion of the meeting, "" In view of the evidence adduced on what process of reasoning have you given your decision ?"" H is reply was, "" I gave my judgment on my reasoning as a man of the world."" I then in formed Mr O'Halloran, who was a retired magistrate, that I would not sign the award, and he told me that he was the only man who had to sign it . That is what is suggested in place of arbitration; that is the reason why this move is being made in the direction of allowing the States to control their own industrial affairs, particularly in South Austral a, with its jerrymandered electorates. The States can send their representatives to can speak plainly; of the States, owing to the manner in which the electorates have been gerrymandered, many of the people a^e practically without representation. They were so jerrymandered in South Australia that Sir Richard Butler was ahle to declare, "" Liberalism is safe for the next twenty years."" There is also in South Australia a Legislative Council which is an impregnable stronghold, one which cannot be reached by the masses. These are the people, cemented in their positions and throttled with the dead hand of the past, whom we are to be asked to entrust with f u l l control in relation to arbitration matters. If we permit the Prime Minister to w h it t l e' away the rights and powers given to us by the Constitution we shall not be reflecting the true feelings of the people of Australia. B ut this desiTe to give away the control of arbitration matters to the States is linked up with the policv of immigration. Before the "" Pommies"" can be exploited, the Arbitration Court must first be.broken down. Thei m migrant who moves from a f a r m to the city nnd seeks employment in a metropolitan industry must now be paid £ 4 5s. a argument of week. With the arbitration laws scrapped, it would be an easy matter to force these immigrants, because of the circumstances .in which they found themselves, to take whatever wages were offered or starve. A starving man is often compelled to sacrifice the principles that he holds dearest. Therefore, if we scrap the arbitration laws of tbe Commonwealth and leave the control in such matters to the State Tories, the absorption of immigrants w ill be an easy matter, and that is why the suggestion was put forward at the Premiers' Conference. The Labour party in this House w ill not permit the Prime Minister to carry out his indicated intention in this regard without a protest. Tho amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition is a protest against the failure of the Government to do what Australia wants in this regard. Yesterday, when the Prime Minister was attacking the Leader of the Opposition, he said that the position taken up by the : Labour party in regard to immigration only required to be analyzed. I challenged him to analyze it . Howf a r did this Parliament, where they he get when he attempted to do so? He but in some said that we did not want any more people in Australia u n t i l all those already in Australia had employment.' The Prime Minister knows well that no such assertion has ever been made by us. The point is never reached in any country at which ' there is no one unemployed. In industries which offer spasmodic employment it is impossible to keep men in constant work. The shearer cannot be employed all the year round. Farmers require more hands at seeding time and harvest time than in the intervening months. They do not pro^vide work for their labourers all the year round; and the secondary industries in the cities are not waiting with jobs for these casual f a r m hands when they return to the cities. Necessarily there must always be a number of unemployed in Australia, and the Prime Minister knew this when he sought to make the people believe that the attitude of the Labour party was that every man in this country should have a job before another should be permitted to come here. The honourable jrentleman went on to say that the question of immigration had to be solved, and would be much easier of solution if all joined in the attempt to solve it . We are ready to join him in the attempt. The Prime Minister next made reference to certain statements made by Mr Garden and dissatisfied immigrants which had appeared in the public press, and he condemned the Leader of the Opposition for quoting them without having had them confirmed. He said he proposed to reply to them. However, he did not do so. In fact, he did not attempt to analyze the position of the Labour party in any respect, except to say that we .did not want any one to come in until all our own people were employed. As a matter of fact, our position is that we do not want immigrants brought here until there is a fair chance of their securing employment without interfering with the rights and privileges of persons already in Australia. That is the statement we shall make in no unmistakable language to the British Immigration Commission now making investigations in Australia. It is very seldom that I go to the Immigration Department, and I am thus obliged to rely upon the information given in the public press, but if the position has been misrepresented by the newspapers, surely it is the duty of the Government to take steps to correct the error, and thus prevent information going abroad which may be harmful to Australia. The Prime Minister did not place his finger on one spot where he .could hold the Labour party up to ridicule for its attitude towards immigration, although he evidently thought he had done so. We would welcome all the immigrants necessary to fully populate Australia if. they could be settled without heing exploited. to bring out great numbers of skilled artisans, for whom work could be provided, rather than introduce black labour, as the Premier of South Australia ( Sir Henry Barwell) was prepared to do. It is a mistake to say that the Labour party is hostile to immigration. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr sent to Wyndham, where he was set to Austin Chapman), in the absence of the Prime Minister, give me the details of one of bhe schemes of the Government for the absorption of immigrants? honourable member from Western Australia assure me that, under the scheme adopted in that State, a man leaving England will know what area of land he is to cultivate, where it is situated, and on exactly what terms it is to be taken up? studied the Western Australian scheme. It is a magnificent one. more of it when the honourable member speaks. The Prime Minister promised yesterday to analyze the attitude of the Labour party towards immigration, but he has not done so, and I challenge any honourable member opposite to demonstrate that we are antagonistic. I would like to know what Mr Percy Hunter is doing. The Prime Minister would find it difficult to justify the large expenditure on immigration, seeing that the results are so small. During the last election campaign [ believe I heard the ex-Prime Ministei( Mr Hughes) say that it would cost £250,000 to bring out 10,000 immigrants. At the same time, there was an agitation for the abolition of the baby bonus, which gave encouragement to the best immigrant of all. If Mr Hunter could not do better for a business firm than he has done for the Commonwealth, he would be bundled out neck and crop. sent him back to England. Minister does not know his own ofiicers. I doubt if anybody in the Commonwealth knew Mr Hunter was going back to England until he joined the steamer at Fremantle. He managed to dodge the reporters and everybody else; but there is one thing he will not dodge, and that is his £1,200 a year. The honourable memI t would be preferable ber for Dampier( Mr Gregory) suggests that everything is proceeding as satisfactorily as could be wished in his State in immigration matters, and I hope it s ; true. I read details recently in the Adelaide Daily Herald of the case of an immigrant who was a protegS of the Dgly Men's Association. He had £200 when he reached Western Australia, and he was work at 25s. per week. When he found out the wages to be paid to him he left the job and walked to Perth. With four Will any others he stowed away on a vessel, and reached Adelaide. The other men were sent back to Western Australia, but the immigrant in question managed to escape ashore by changing clothes with a fireman. In the Melbourne Argus to-day the",18,Fhanois 1

The Primefollowing paragraph appeared under the heading, ""StowawayM i g r a n t s "" : State executive . of the '.Returned Soldiers' League a letter was considered from the Fremantle branch, which stated that former Imperial soldiers had been sent out to Australia in distressing circumstances. In England, if tbey refused to emigrate, their weekly dole of 15s. was stopped. When they arrived in Western Australia they were charged 3s. 6d. a day at the Immigrants' Home, and 5s. a day after the expiration of a week. The branch suggested that these men should be given a sustenance allowance until they found work. I do not vouch for the t r u th of that report, but I have sufficient confidence in the Returned Soldiers' Association to believe that it would not promulgate a story of that nature if there was not a stratum of truth, in it . I do not think an I m perial Army man would tell a ""digger "" a deliberate untruth."" The authorities in England desire to get r i d of their unemployed as soon as they can. Those who saved tlie world for Democracy were told by Mr Lloyd George that the world was in a plastic state, and could be moulded just as they wished, but it is very evident that that is far from the true position. Tf any one of the unemployed refuses to emigrate whon offered the opportunity the British authorities deprive him of the 15s. dole. Our first duty is to make provision for immigrants so that they will be able to live in comfort as decent citizens, and when that has been done they may come to Australia in droves. I do not kuow just what the position is in Western Australia under Sir James Mitchell's scheme. bably the best of those that have been propounded, I doubt whether it goes fa r enough. . Sir George Fuller has been is the only thing to save Australia. Before he left Australia he said, according to the latest report that I have read, that unless the land-owners threw open their lands his Government would put the Labour party's policy into operation. vernment would pay them for their lands. would also pay them-o n the basis of the value they themselves place upon ( the land for assessment purposes, plus 10 per cent. gard is on record, and if we had the opportunity we would put it into operation. We have done it in the past, and will do it again in the future. The Labour party in South Australia is the only party that has done anything to break up large estates. I hope the houorable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), when he rises to speak on this motion if , indeed, his party allows him to speak-wil l t r y to justify the bringing out of large numbers of immigrants at the present time. What land scheme is there in South Aus-, tralia capable of absorbing immigrants, when even to-day there are qualified returned soldiers who are waiting for land ? The same statement. I believe applies to the other States. The Prime Minister said there was a lot of undeveloped land in Australia, but does he propose to send the poor immigrant, who does not understand our climate or the peculiarities of our soil or methods does not understand the methods of the honourable gentleman's party. party have never injure d any one except the capitalist. We are out for his scalp, but so far we have managed to get only a few hairs. I once said that I was "" out to wring the neck of the capitalistic goose.""

I do not fear in this House or anywhere else to state urging that immigration my position regarding immigration.

THE land is freehold, over which the btase has no control whatever. approval to any transfer, and I cannot see that anything can be done to prevent this kind of ' thing unless Parliament sees f it to introduce legislation to make that impossible. This refers to privately-owned land in the most arable part of South Australia, and it has had a railway put through it. The owner of it holds more than he is entitled to hold in accordance with Holy ""Writ, and has added another 8,000 acres to his already large holding. from memory, the price he paid was £11 10s. per acre. I think the honourable member for Barker( Mr D. Cameron), and the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan Hughes), who were interested in that land in the early days, will be able to verify my statement. The Minister said the land was privately owned, and that bhe -Government could do nothing unless Parliament took action. Even if the gerrymandered Assembly of South Australia decided to take action, the dead hand of thepast in the Legislative Council would prevent them. If you invite a man to your house to have a meal, you should not place him on the door step to gnaw a bone, but should let him sit at your table and have at least a bit of celery. There, again, is the parallel between the Government's attitude and the Labour party's in regard to immigration. I go a little further in regard -to South Australia. Barwell has a really original idea. He is introducing boys. that they will make the best immigrants. They are to be prohibited from join'ng a union,'or conferring with union organizers. It is intended to keep them free from the contamination of that section of the Australian community. They are to receive £1 per week, and their ages, judged by the batch which arrived Inst week, average about fifteen years. At. that age a boy is very sturdy if he is au "" Aussie."" I do not know what the C3 population of Great Britain is like at that age, but Australia, has an Al population a little above proof, in my oninion. Where is .the farmer who will refuse to employ a boy fifteen years of age at £1 Mr Yates. per week, and who will not two years later, -when the boy is seventeen, turn his The place? .Thus the boy immigrant will become the future settler of Australia, There is no question of while the Australian farm hand will be reduced to obtaining a position as a rouseabout in a shearers' shed. When the immigrant has been here for ten years he will be twenty-five years of age, at which age, if he is to become the settler he ought to be, he should take a wife. In those ten years his total wages, at £50 per year, would have amounted to £500. How much land at £11 30s. per acre could he buy for that sufn? From Speaking his earnings must be deducted 6s. for pocket money, leaving him 14s. a week with which to repay £26, the cost of his fare to Australia. In addition, he has to be clothedThe boy will be ""settled,"" but not on the land; his heart and spirit will be broken, when he ascertains the real meaning of the conditions to which he had been brought in this country. That contention is supported by the circumstances of a Scotch lad, who was sent to Wyndham, and whose case I related to the House during last session. Compare the immigration proposals of the Government with the fair and equitable suggestion of the Labour party that suitable economic conditions shall obtain before people overseas are invited to Australia. If our conditions were complied with, the Labour organizations would be prepared to welcome and assimilate immigrants. I support the amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and I Sir Henry hope that before the debate is concluded the Government will realize the true posiHe believes tion, and discontinue their present policy of immigration. There is one noteworthy omission from the Governor General's Speech; there is no reference to the peculiar circumstances surrounding the appointment of Mr Victor Ryan as' co-ordinating officer in connection with the Empire Exhibition. I do not intend to criticise Mr Ryan, because he is not the ""squirrel"" which has to be caught. My objection is to the choice of Senator Wilson to accompany the Prime Minister to the Economic Conference. I 'take exception to the appointment of Senator Wilson because it was made, not on his merits, but merely",22,Perth Thursday A T A Meeting Of The
23,Mr Reidy,"It ought to be impossible.aa a matter of expediency. The Government thought it necessary to choose a delegate from amongst the members of the Country party in order to preserve the balance of power between the two sections of Ministerialists. But Senator Wilson does not really belong to the Country party, because he repudiated that party in Adelaide, and informed his then associates that they were a lot of disloyalists. tendered that information to the House during last session. The extraordinary exhibition he has made of himself in connection with the appointment of Mr Victor Byan shows that Senator Wilson is not qualified to represent Australia at the Economic Conference. Fine credit he will do to Australia if he tells Mr Nationalists. To the same end the honBaldwin that "" he has got into the muck, and now has to get out of it."" That was the language he used concerning Mr Ryan, whose appointment reminds me of a former selection made by another member of the same family. dently a family inheritance. When Mr of the new Country party as "" JohnniesCrawford Vaughan was Premier of South Australia applications were called for the position of immigration officer. The period during which applications could be received precluded any nomination from overseas, but, to the astonishment of all, a Mr Champion, from the Agent-General'3 Office in London, was appointed.

I am not criticising his qualifications, because, if the credentials of all applicants were examined, Mr Ryan would probably he found to have had the most experience in the class of work that is required. diggers "" question Mr Ryan's qualification. Another strange feature was the increase of salary after the appointment was made. Senator Wilson is not competent 'to represent the Commonwealth at the Economic Conference. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) and his colleagues aver that they support the principle of preference to returned soldiers. but the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), proved by a speech he made in this House when a private member, that he does not , believe in the principle, and if he does grant preference to returned soldiers it will be only as a result of the representations made by the Returned Soldiers' Association. During the war Senator Wilson was within the military age, arid II am not sure that if war broke out to-day he would not still be eligible. The Government Whip( Mr Marr), although a returned soldier, was excluded from the Ministry so that the Government could appoint Senator Wilson an honorary Minister, and so preserve the balance of power between the Country party and the orable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster), who has had a wide and varied experience as a State Minister and as a member of this House, was omitted from the Ministry. During recent years the Minister for Trade and Customs The peculiarities are evihas delighted to refer to. the members come-lately.""

The fascination of ofiice has broken down the prejudice which he previously had against the "" Johnnies-come-lately."" When the war broke out the Minister for Trade and Customs picked out several of the younger men in this House and pointedly suggested he stated emphatically that men who were within the military age had no right period. To-day the Ministry have chosen to represent the Commonwealth at the Economic Conference a man who, although eligible for military service, did not go to the Front, and the Minister for Trade and Customs is to-day a colleague of men for whom, do not think the at one time, he expressed utter contempt. This kind of conduct is evidence of insincerity-to put it mildly. If Senator Wilson goes to England as the representative of Australia at the Economic Conference, it will bean affront to the people of Australia, and I shall not be a bit surprised if he brings Australia into disrepute.

The Prime Minister, in stating the policy of the Government, has passed over the most pressing problem that confronts Australia, that of unemployment.

I am pleased to learn from the Governor General's Speech that the Government intends to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, and also to relax many of the restrictive regulations that are imposed under the Act. But even in this regard the Government, to my mind, has been guilty of inexcusable delay. Last year the Leader of the Labour party, of which I have the honour to be a member, brought before the House a motion that the invalid and old-age pensions should be increased. The conditions then more than ever justified such an alteration, but our proposal met with opposition from honourable members on the Government side of the House. Any proposal introduced to increase the invalid and old-age pensions should have a retrospective effect, since these pensioners for some considerable time have been deprived of a rightful increase in accordance with the increase in the cost of living. I desire, also, in passing, to refer to the position of pensioners in public hospitals. In March last I brought under the notice of the Government the fact that inmates of public hospitals in many cases, owing to the restrictive character of the regulations, have been deprived of the allowance provided for in the Act. Tho Government then promised to immediately investigate that complaint, with a view to providing that all pensioners in public hosinaction, is suffering, since many soldier pitals should receive the allowance contemplated by the Act. I find, however, that the Government, during the last three months, has done absolutely nothing in the matter. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases of manifest injustice, which soldier grievances in regard to their homes. are the result of Government inaction in this connection. Any amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should also provide that pensioners shall be entitled to earn an increased amount. The Act lays it down that they may not earn more than 10s. per week, and so offers a premium to idleness. It denies to a pensioner the right to improve his earning power. This requires immediate attenMr Coleman. tion. A blind pensioner is allowed to earn the basic wage, whereas an ordinary invalid or old-age pensioner is allowed to earn only 10s. per week. I hope that any measure dealing with this matter that is put before us by the Government will also cover the question of the accumulated property allowance. The accumulated property allowance should also be increased. Turning for a moment to the War Service Homes Act, I would remind the House that, in response to a question asked by me a day or two ago, the Prime Minister stated that the proposed Royal Commission would be restricted tg an inquiry into one contract. The whole record of the War Service Homes administration reeks with scandal, and the exposures already made warrant the most searching and widespread inquiry. I regret exceedingly that the Government has not recognised that in respect of this matter it owes a big duty to returned soldiers more particularly, and to Australia generally. My constituency includes a large number of soldier settlements. The men in these settlements are groaning under a burden of discontent, but can obtain no satisfaction from the War Service Homes Commission. They have made complaints to me regarding the over-capitalization of their homes. The original War Serviee Homes Act contemplated that the cost of a soldier's home should not exceed £700. By an amending Act the maximum was increased to£800; yet many of these men are being charged as much as £900, or even more, for homes which have been assessed by private and Government valuers as being worth not more than £650. This is a scandal. The Government, owing to its tenants are leaving their homes, refusing to undertake these unjust obligations. I hope that the Government will agree to the appointment of a Select Committee, or some other tribunal, to exhaustively consider In addition to the complaint of excessive capitalization there are also complaints of faulty construction, the presence of borer in inferior timber used in building, and of delay in effecting repairs. The complaints made are such as to warrant the most searching investigation, and I hope that the Government will agree to make an investigation. Their attitude up to the present has indicated a desire to conceal the facts from the public with a view to protecting their own administration. I hope that in the public interest that attitude will be. abandoned. In connection with the question of industrial legislation the Prime Minister has spoken of the appalling confusion which exists at the present time. I do not admit the existence of appalling confusion, but, if adopted, the Prime Minister's proposals will certainly accentuate the poses to superimpose upon the present complex system of arbitration, another Court to define the jurisdiction of the Federal Courti n dealing with industrial matters. An y one possessing an elementary knowledge of existing conditions in this connection w ill realize that the proposal of the Government is calculated to bring about endless litigation and expense to both employers and employees. If the Government proposal is submitted to this House, at a later stage, I hope that honourable members w ill turn it down w it h the contempt which such a proposal deserves. The Prime Minister, 'n excusing his attitude on this very important national question, has referred to the fact that proposals to increase the industrial powers of the Commonwealth have been defeated on three occasions when referred to the people. The honourable gentleman has overlooked the fact that the vote in favour of the extension of the Commonwealth industrial powers has gradually increased, and at the Referendum taken in 1919, three of. the States, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia, recorded a vote in favour of increasing the powers of the Federal Government to deal with industrial disputes. were defeated only by the small majority of 11,00Q. It may be said that the sentiment of practically the whole of the Australian people is in favour of the extension of the powers of the Federal Government in this regard. The fact that the people did not carry .the proposals submitted at the referenda does not j u s t if y the present Government in whittling away the powers which the Commonwealth at present possesses to deal with industrial disputes. Those who voted at the Referendum in 1919, for the extension of the Commonwealth powers, made their desire manifest, but those who voted against the extension proposed at that time voted at least for the retention of the powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution as at present framed. I claim that the Government have been given no mandate to interfere with the existing arbitration laws, and they cannot claim that because proposals for the extension of the Commonwealth powers were lost at the referenda, they are entitled to interfere in the way outlined in the Prime alleged confusion. He proMinister's speech. The honourable gentleman said that employees may go to both Federal and State Courts, but that conveys a manifestly in correct impression, because under the existing system employees are not permitted to utilize both jurisdictions simultaneously. That has been laid down by a number of judgments given from time to time. When the Prime Minister assumes the attitude of the schoolmaster, and talks to honourable members on this side upon industrial matters, he reminds me of the little boy who sought to teach his grandmother to suck eggs. Every honourable member on this side has given service and consideration to industrial organizat'ons, and f u l l y understands their problems. The Prime Minister's experience of industrialism in Australia is very limited. The honourable gentleman's knowledge . of Australia generally must also be held to be limited when "" we remember that his education and experience were largely gained on the other side of the world. I stress the fact that an overwhelming number of State public servants and workers generally favour their right of access to the Federal Arbitration Court. The Government are flirting with trouble The. proposals then submitted in their proposals to deny them that right. If it be the right of one section of employees to approach an Arbitration Court, whether Federal or State, it is only just and fair that all employees should enjoy a similar right. To say that public servants, because they are in the employ of a State Government should be denied the right of going to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in connection with arbitration matters, is too rid cul.uis and : absurd to warrant serious attention.

I have been a member of this Chamber for a short time only,., but I have been here sufficiently long to realize that there is too much cant, hypocrisy, and humbug -That remark is out of order, and must be withdrawn. shall, however, say that I am satisfied that every member on this side of the House doubts the ability of the Government to carry out .even the programme submitted to this Parliament.

The silence of the Goverument supporters deprives one of much scope for criticism. Up to the present, with the exception of We w ill , too. The the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), no one on the other side of the House has spoken. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, to which I shall endeavour to confine my remarks, asserts thatWe consider that your Advisors no longer retain the confidence of this House owing to their attempt to limit the rights of the Commonwealth with regard to constitutional powers with special reference to financial and industrial matters; also for the unsatisfactory arrangements made in connection with immigration. The kindly feelings I may have towards some members of the Government do not prevent me from supporting the amendment. I had the privilege and pleasure The of hearing the speech of the PrimeM in ister delivered in Perth. It was a fine speech, but the audience, which was large, consisted chiefly of well-to-do merchants, shopkeepers, and others. The .When honourable great mass of workers was not represented. A f t e r the meeting I was asked what I thought of the speech, and I said it was a very good one, but that it apThat peared from the utterances of the Prime Minister that this was a one-man Government, and if the Leader of the Government remains a dictator he w ill go f u r ther than its supporters desire.

48,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [2:38],". If the Prime Minister represents Australia at the forthcoming Imperial Conference I trust that on his return he-will present to this Parliament .a balance sheet of his expenses, and if I judge hi m aright, I do not think he w ill be a f r a i d to show in detail how he has expended the money. The action of Senator Pearce, who, when Ministerf o r Defence, represented the Commonwealth at the Washington Disarmament Conference, and has not produced a detailed account of his expenses, which amounted to £8,000, was most dishonourable. The masses outside who had to contribute tbe money he expended, apparently, had not to be considered. public meetings which I addressed in Western Australia whether, if they had the power of recall, they would have allowed Senator Pearce to carry on in that way, and the reply was, "" We would like to drag h i m out."" Let us compare the action of Senator Pearce w it h that of that honourable and splendid man, the MrA l f r e d Deakin, who when given £1,000 for his expenses on a visit to England, accounted for every penny,and paid the unexpended balance into Consolidated Revenue. Strange to say, the ex-Ministerf or Defence is still a Minister, but not by the wish of his constituents in Western Australia, and I venture to prophesy that when he faces the electors on the next occasion he w ill be swept into political oblivion. Minister that if he visits Englandi t w ill be his duty, as an honourable man, to subm it a balance-sheet pf his expenditure. Although the rights of the Commontation of Australia in London, let me wealth are imperilled, gest that Prime Minister the Commonwealth subservient to the States. was understood Federation that the States were to retain sovereign powers, it was never expected that the abominable maintaining don would be continued. pated that there would be six separate know very little about Australia. AccordChief Justices? enough laws, but too little justice! ringing tocsin throughout the length and has published an article in which it is breadth of Australia was that we would declared that "" water is unobtainable in Dr. Moloney. dispense with all unnecessary expenditure. Has that been done? The Commonwealth has been in existence for twentythree years, and we still have six Agents General. Australia House cost, approximately, £1,000,000 to construct; but I do not know how many thousands of pounds have been expended there yearly. I do know, however, that the present H i g h Commissioner ( Sir Joseph Cook), towards whom I have the most friendly feeling, has been complaining of the numher of banquets he has to attend. Australia never sent h i m there to eat dinners, and if he is being asked to partake of too much, surely the surplus can be distributed I ask those who attended the amongst the starving poor in London. What has Australia House done beyond introducing rich Australians to Royalty? Any one who has seen the "" kick-back "" the ladies are obliged to give in order to avoid stepping on .their trains when retiring from the presence of Royalty, must have laughed heartily, as I did when I had it explained. There is nothing more late ridiculous in a pantomime. Australia is maintaining seven government agencies in London. I am sure that at least £50,000 a year could be saved in this direction. The Prime Minister says the Government are whittling nothing away. He said,^ in his reply to the Leader of the OppositionThe position was that the field which the Commonwealth was vacating compared with the payments which it was going to be freed I warn the Prime from making would probably mean a loss to the Commonwealth of £1,500,000. Is not that a pretty substantial whittling away S While I am dealing with the represen-' I do not sugpoint out this further absurdity: Mr. it is the desire of the Tate, the Director of Education in Vicor his supporters that toria, who is now in Great Britain, has should be made been credited with making the statement Although it that in some of the school books in use at the inception of in English schools it is laid down that in Australia children of white parents soon become as the tawny natives around them, and that it is an exception to see white system of children growing up in certain parts of six Agents-Generai in Lonthe Commonwealth.

It is true that water may be unobtainable in some' districts in times of drought, b u t in my life-time there has never been such a drought in Australia that some part of the continent could not supply the food requirements of other parts. According to the Daily Herald also, ""the inhabitants of some townships are forced to buy water."" I can remember when people had to buy water in the city of Melbourne, and even to-day water has to be bought in London, which is supplied by a private company The Daily Herald article also saysMr Lawson and Sir George Fuller omitted to explain why Australians huddle together in the sea-board cities, leaving tbe drudgery, loneliness, and privation of the back blocks to the tenderfoot. I am sorry that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), one of the acknowledged Free Tradersi n this House, is not in the chamber. I have heard h i m interjecting during the debate, but apparently he has had the padlock of silence fixed on his lips and dare not make a speech. mind the younger members on the Ministerial side that their constituents do not expect them to remain silent. They have brains to think, and tongues with which to speak their thoughts, and they owe the duty to their constituents to uphold their end in the discussions of this Chamber. If , however, they prefer to remain silent, I warn them that their electors are watching them. The Commonwealth Hansard is circulated to-day in more homes than ever before. I am fairly well known in Western Australia, and when I am in PerthI am frequently stopped in the street by men who are seeking employment. My last visit to the western State was for the purpose of seeing my son, who is on the land at some distance from Perth. I took the opportunity of making inquiries among the farmers I met ou that occasion, and found that I could easily have obtained work from them for at least three men whom I had met in Perthi f the places which they might have obtained had not already been filled by men arriving from GreatB r it a in . Those who have seen, as I have, the miserable conditions under which men live not only in the East End, but also in the WestE n d of London, would never refuse to give those people a chance of making good in Australia, b u t it is not fair to bring men out to this country in order to cut down the wages of those already living here. One old farmer, with whom I had a long chat on this subject, said, "" I wish I had seen you before I wrote down to Perthi n order to get one of those ' pommies' to come up here. If he does not come up I w ill give the job to the man you mention."" I asked what the wages would be, and the farmer replied, "" They tell me in Perth bhat if I give a man £ 1 a week andTiis' tucker' it w ill be sufficient."" I saw where some of the men were accommodated on these farms. An aboriginal in his mia-mia would be more comfortable than I found these men bo be. H is bush knowledge would enable bhe blackfellow to ascertain which way the wind was blowing, and make himself fairl y comfortable with his feet to the fire, but these men from the Old Country had not had the slightest training in the making of their camps comfortable. My son's partner employed one of them when he was short of hands, but he gave the man £ 2 a week and his "" tucker"" to start witli, and a decent I would replace in which to sleep. not come from the honourable member I would not have believed it . Dr.. MALONEY I do not know any one more capable in respect bo the work he is doing than is the gentleman in charge of immigration in Perth. It is not his faul t that these conditions exist. The excuse offered for the smallness of the wage is that the immigrants do not know the working conditions of bush life of Australia, and it is fair that they should draw only a small allowance until they get their footing in bheir new surroundings. Common sense, however, will tell one that if a farmer can get half the work done for £1 a week and ""tucker,"" he will not pay for a f u l l day's work the 13s. a day, which is the ruling rate in the district where my son is farming. I . believe that there is no Stabei n Ausbralia which helps a man who is willing to work to go on the land more than does Western Australia. Fifty-one years ago I went on the land in Victoria, and surely there should have been enough land in those days for anybody willing to work. I was given a block, ten miles south of Warragul, among the heavy timber. Two years before I went there a railway was promised, but it was not built until a few years ago. Of the original settlers in",32,Commissioner Of Crown Farm Hand Out And Put The Boy I N His
49,Mr Watson,"If that statement hadthe locality no survivor is now living in the district. I was a hank clerk at the time, and was not physically fit to cope with a block containing twenty-five trees to the acre, each over 8 feet in thickness. Comparing my experience with that of present-day settlers in Western Australia, the contrast is remarkable. When my son took up land there a railway route had been surveyed. It had been necessary to carry goods 60 miles, and water had to be carted a distance of 20 miles, but before eighteen months had elapsed there was a narrow-gauge line within a mile of my son's hut. It is suggested that millions should be spent on the unification of railway gauges. Any one who has been accustomed to a bullock dray would value a railway of any gauge, even if the train did not exceed a speed of 5 miles an hour. Western Australia has a greater mileage of railways, and its country people are better catered for in the matter of railway facilities than the settlers in Victoria, which has four times the population and is a much richer State. A man willing to work has a better chance of making a success of a holding in Western Australia than in any other part of the Commonwealth. although I recognise the great potentialities of the northern State, power in Western Australia? Dr. which supports the views of the honourable member. Western Australia is the best place in the Commonwealth in which to settle. vernments have left their legacies in the form of Liberal land laws. That legislation was fairly well based before the preto take from the employees of State in-' sent Government took office in the western State. active in Western Australia as it is in this Parliament. The various parties are working together. able member's statement. I suppose that Queensland and Western Australia will become strong rivals in doing the best possible for those who settle on the land. Men who ought to be in gaol for bribery are going about free in Queensland today. A law should be passed providing that the individuals who werebribed for the purpose of defeating the Labour Government of Queensland should remain in prison until they divulged the names of the rich people who bribed them. If that course were followed, those guilty of bribery would probably confess their offence, knowing that the men in prison might eventually disclose their names. If the people of Queensland were asked for tbeir verdict, I think they would favour having the men kept in gaol until the bribers were discovered. very wise in getting hold of some of that -money, and paying it into the Consolidated Revenue. ture is that the guilty parties have so far escaped. Those who supplied the bribe are worse than the men who received it. Some time ago three men representing the financial interests of Queensland took it upon themselves to go to Great Britain in order to throw the Labour Government's borrowing arrangements into confusion. They told the British moneylenders that they must on no account advance money to the Socialistic Government in Queensland. The Premier( Mr Theodore) went to another money market, and the result, happily, was splendid from a business point of view. He obtained money from the United was three dollars odd to the pound sterling, and now the rate is about four and a half dollars to the pound. The confidence of the people of Queensland in their Labour Administration has been clearly expressed through the ballot-box at the latest elections. I strongly deprecate the action of the Commonwealth Government in proposing strumentalities their right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court. The highest Court in Australia, and the only High Court of a continent in the world, has declared that that right is undoubted. Australians are not all fools, and if the men and women employed in. State activities are prepared to forgo their right in this matter, I have sadly misjudged them.

58,Dr. Maloney,"The regrettable feapublic servant of a State has no right to approach a Court of the Commonwealth. How much better it is for a Commonwealth tribunal to determine industrial conditions and make them apply generally to the States than for varying laws to be put into operation in different parts of Australia. How much simpler it is to say that overtime shall be paid for at the rate of time and a half throughout the Commonwealth than to grant allowances of a varying nature. Prior to the war I ventured to speak on the question of finance. I do not wish honourable members opposite to imagine that we on this side of the House are against capital. We adopt the view held by such men as Sir Leo Chiozza Money, who is not opposed to capital, but to capitalism as it exists at present, which masquerades in the name uf patriotism. I admire true patriotism as much as any man, but not the false patriotism of the rich men of the city who refused to contribute to war loans in comparison with their wealth. As a matter of fact, some of them contributed to the war loans only when the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) nourished his lash and threatened to take their money from them if they would not lend it voluntarily. Those are the men who wave flags, who create distress, and who glory in monuments. I can speak on this matter as the only member of the State Recruiting Committee of Victoria who went through the recruiting campaign from beginning fco end. Others who were with me at the start have gone into the limbo of political oblivion. The chairman attended a few meetings, and then disappeared; another took his place, and disappeared likewise, and so it went on. The wealthy people of this community have not done their duty in assisting the present and past Governments to do justice to the returned soldiers, or to float loans. Over 700,000 Australians offered their services in response to their country's call. Out of that number 430,000 were accepted, and 337,000 went across the seas. They offered their lives, and it is as well to remember, in the words of Ruskin, that "" L if e is the only wealth."" What were they promised? I can answer that question as one who was instructed to promise them that their women folk and children would ibe looked after. no previous war were the veterans and the wounded so well cared for, yet the promises made to our men have not been f u l l y kept. Promises made in this Chamber by the State Government during the South African war were deliberately broken. One great man, Sir John Madden, who was at times Acting Governor of Victoria, was manly enough to say publicly that the promises which his lips were made to utter had been scandalously broken. Twenty years after the money was subscribed for the purpose, a monument is heing erected on St. Kilda-road to the memory of those who fought in that war.. Who were the members of the Committee which was concerned in that matter ? They were the swells of Melbourne, and it is they who have held the money back all that time. The men who served in the South African war were treated shamefully in comparison with those who enlisted in the Great War. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), who is a medical man, will agree with me that it is absurd that a soldier returning to this country with nervous ailments of which the medical profession had little knowledge before the war, and who is liable to be ill at any moment, should be compelled to attend at fixed red-tape hours to obtain an order for his admission to a hospital. I feel sure the Treasurer will take steps to remedy that. Our Australia, in. the words of the late Sir Denison Miller, is worth over £2,000,000,000. That is a very conservative estimate. If any honourable member would like to know my views of Sir Denison Miller, as expressed in his presence, I would refer him to the Honourable Mr Higgs, who was once Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and I give Mr Higgs my permission to relate everything that occurred. Mr Scott asked Sir Denison Miller whether he would be prepared, as he had advanced £365,000,000 to the country for war purposes, to advance a similar sum to organize Australia on good business lines. Sir Denison Miller replied that he would do his best. I am quoting these facts from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 8th July, 1921. A t a later stage, Sir Denison Miller said that he would be prepared to advance the money if asked to do so by the Commonwealth Government. He knew the potenCertainly after tialities of Australia, and he knew that what we wanted was more capital, but not an extension of the system of capitalism under which we now suffer. BeforeI leave the subject of the war, there is another point to which I would like to refer. There are two other classes of intelligent beings in the world besides human beings, namely, the ant and the bee. If one race of ants fights against another race and defeats feated ones have either to go into slavery or suffer death. however, are not so foolish as to hand on the cursed cross of interest, as the human being does, for future to pay.

Maloney. The Government have power to institute that innovation. The late Sir Denison Miller stated thab he was willing to advance as much as £350,000,000 if requested by. the Commonwealth Government. It was stated that it was impossible to build the city railway under Hyde Park, in Sydney, but Sir Denison Miller, it, the dewithin seven days of being approached, undertook to finance the scheme. I have The conquering ants, gained my knowledge of landlordism from the Old Book. The Jewish jubilee occurred every fiftieth year, and in that generations year the Jewish people could return bo their homes; that privilege extended also to children whose parents had died. The law provided that no home could be alienated for more than fifty years; if a house or block of land was disposed. of five years after a jubilee, it reverted to the owning family ini forty-five years.

The only explanation is that the present Government is a one man Ministry. I should like to quote a speech on finance which I made in 1912, and which won encomiums from people in Canada and South Africa, members of the House of Lords, the House of Commons, and the Admiralty staff. In that speech I showed that a considerable amount of money, approximately £20,000,000, could be saved by the transfer of State debts to the Commonwealth, and I suggested that the money thus made available should be spent upon warThere were eleven ships and other means of safeguarding the Empire's food supply routes during war. Had that £20,000,000 been saved and so used it might have had a quietening effect upon the Kaiseri n regard to a declaration of war. I quote from a speech made by Mr Bonar Law, ex-Prime Minister of England. He saidTen j'ears ago we not only had the command of the sea, but we had the command of every sea. What is the position now ? We have the North Sea at this moment. The change has been taking place before our eyes, and many times I have myself been reminded of what happened in the time of the decline of the Roman Empire, when pressure at the heart forced them to call their legions home to Rome. That has happened to us. We bave If he had to call back our legions, and to call them back for precisely the same purpose. Nothing shows more completely how that has happened than an incidental remark of the First Lord of the Admiralty, when he said that a ship we intended to send to China and a vessel belonging to New Zealand had been retained for home service. We are spending money in fitting men I extend it to any to take their places in the A r m y and the Navy. One -honourable member of this House has said that it w ill cost. £1,000 per student. There are more masters than there are scholars, and much that is taught could be included in the studies at our Universities. Certainly we had control of the North Sea as long as there were no submersibles. What happened T h a t is very compliwhen submarines came upon the scene? The strongest array of naval ships that the world has ever seen was forced to lock themselves up like prisoners. A.sloop of war of 100 tons, in the time of Nelson, sailed the seas of the world with greater freedom than is possible to-day to bhese mighty engines of war, which are always confronted wibh the possibility of No attitude could be more being sunk by a torpedo from a submersible. Since the last war improvements have been effected in this type of vessel, yet there are still fools, decorated with epaulets, who advise us ito build capital ships. The naval Base at Singapore w ill cost £9,000,000 to build. For what use is it intended? It is intended to be",35,Maloney A Government States Of America When The Exchange Rate

Investigations that were carried out in the United States of America demonstrated -that though a bomb does not touch a ship, if it explodes near the ship the force of the explosion may destroy every electrical contrivance on board. Honourable members are aware that if the electrical contrivances on board a man-o'-war are interfered with it is all up with the ship. Admiral Sir Percy Scott states that the only reply which he has received to his question, "" What use is a battleship ?"" is that. it is "" no damned use at all!"" In an article on the subject Sir Percy concludes by sayingThe question is, in time of war, how will capital ships get to Singapore, and what will perienced one night caused 50 yards of they do if they get there? The expenditure necessary to build a capital ship to-day would he sufficient to build an air force that would extend round our 12,000 miles of sea-girt coast. If we possessed such a force of aeroplanes, each carrying only two men with bombs, what Admiral would dare >to convoy a fleet to invade Australia? Every aeroplane station would have a radius of 250 miles. It was idiotic to talk of building capital ships even when the submersibles had not reached their present state of perfection and when aeroplane construction was not nearly so far advanced as it is at the present time. The capital ships then had to lock themselves up in order to remain in safety. Certainly they prevented the German fleet from doing any damage. The men who manned the ships of that fleet were as brave as any men who have tramped on any deck since the world began. member give us the cost of building a having regard to its limited opportunimodern Dreadnought? that information the cost was £9,000,000. settlement.

On one occasion I went with the then Minister for the Navy to inspect that Base. The officials endeavoured to prevent his going down on the Mole, saying, "" You can see it from here, sir."" He was man enough to say that he would go down and have a look at it. He did so, and I went with him. It was built of material that I took to be a species of limestone which hardens when exposed to the weather. It had been quarried at a short distance from the water, being blasted out with dynamite or some other explosive. But after being dumped at the end of the mole a large portion was washed clean away. The water near the mole looked just like milk. We-were told that a little rough weather which was exthe mole to be washed away. That Minister made great changes. He was wise enough to bring back with him a bag )f the material. What is the use of spending millions on that Base to accommodate capital ships? A Base for submarines is quite a different proposition, as any naval architect will tell honourable members. We have in Australia naval architects who can deal with these matters. If you ask a naval architect whether a Base that is suitable for the accommodation of capital ships would be suitable for submarines he will say, "" Yes."" If you ask whether a Base for submarines could be provided at a fraction of the cost necessary for a Base for capital ships, "" Yes"" will be the answer. Therefore, why continue wasting the people's money in this manner?

66,Dr. Maloney,"Yes.JapanI have stood on land used only for agricultural purposes, for which no les3 than £1,800 per acre has been paid. In the light of the information given in this book, and of my own first-hand knowledge, I cannot help thinking that it would be well for the Commonwealth Government to acquire a large block of land for settlement purposes, and to deal with it very much on the lines followed in connection with the Kendenup settlement, in Western Australia. The success of that enterprise was blocked only by the failure of an American firm to keep its engagements. I visited Kendenup, and was astonished at the progress that had been made in its development within the short period of eighteen months. It is linked up by rail with the nearest port, 40 miles away, and. although portion of it consists only of second-class country, it also comprises some really splendid land. I saw there f r u it trees, only eighteen months old, that were over 6 feet in height. There is not an acre of land in the estate that; would not grow good f r u it . The seventy returned soldiers who settled on Kendenup are surely entitled to receive from the Commonwealth Government the help that would have been given them had they availed themselves of the repatriation scheme, and I am glad to know that other settlers there will be assisted by the State Government. I came round from Western Australia by a steam-ship on which there were a number of immigrantsa fine body of men and women-journeyin g to the eastern States, and, having regard to the fact that early this year, in New South Wales, there were over 1,060 applicants for one block, If a i l to see how these and other immigrants are to be settled on the land unless action is taken by the Government in the direction I have indicated. The Government should acquire a large block of ground, provide it with railway communication, subdivide it into farms and township blocks, and set up a school and a co-operative store. We have in Australia any number of menwho would be able to manage such a settlement. My first experience of village settlement was when the late Sir James Patterson was Premier of Victoria, and the office of Minister of Lands was held by Sir John Mclntyre. They never in tended that village settlers should be given a chance, since they put them on land which would not carry even a goat. Had good land been secured, they would have made a great success of the scheme. I was one of the caustic critics of the original Mildura settlement scheme, and frequently asked the Government of the day why Chaffey Brothers were allowed to charge £ 2 5 and more per acre for land which' they had obtained on extended terms for £ 1 per acre. Some years later, however, I said good-bye to au engineering friend of mine, who, after working a block at Mildura for some years, was able to set out on a two years' tour round the world, and who told me that he had let his block for £ 1 0 per week. Mildura, when first thrown open for settlement, was 150 miles away from a railway station, and it is 300 miles from Port Melbourne. There is room for more work in the same direction. I have spoken of the high rents which the people are compelled to pay. Early in the war I asked the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to bring in legislation to prevent landlords from charging exorbitant rents. The right honourable member could have dealt with the matter under the War Precautions Act , just as, availing himself of its provisions, he declared a moratorium for his own particular benefitI have in mind the SmithHughes episode-bu t he would do nothing in the direction of requiring that the demands of landlords should be based on a fair rental value. I object to the Commonwealth floating loans on the English market. We can raise locally all the money that we want. The Commonwealth Bank has behind it a whole continent, and, what is more, a continent in which only one language is spoken. Never did a bank start with such advantages as those enjoyed by the Commonwealth Bank. The balance-sheet of the Bank to-day shows assets amounting to no less than £126,438,717. Never in the history of the world has a bank grown so quickly and so safely as this Bank has done. Whilst giving all credit due to the late manager of the Bank, let me say that any well-accredited bank manager or financial expert would have succeeded with the opportunities that he had. When the Commonwealth Bank was formed, it took over the note issues of thirteen associated banks in Victoria, fifteen in New South Wales, and altogether of about thirty-seven different banks in Australia. When I estimated that in a year or two, the note issue of the Commonwealth £10,000,000, I was laughed at. But what is the position to-day ?"" The note circulation of the Bank to-day £51,971,431. that there is now only one bank note current breadth of the Commonwealth. the establishment Bank, if a man in Victoria had a Western Australian bank note, or a note of a New South Wales bank, he had to pay a shilling in the £1 to get cash for it. That has now all been done away with, and there remains only the confounded on cheques, which honourable having bank accounts in the other States will be aware of. With the Commonwealth Bank there is no reason why we should go to other countries to float our loans. We should control the loan business in Australia, and in this connection let me say that the best note struck by the Prime Minister when speaking at Perth was sounded in his references to the proposal to put an end to non-taxable The honourable gentleman explained whereas men of small means could only secure 5 per cent, on Government the wealthy in our community could secure a return equal to 10 per cent.. Why should any of our bonds be free from taxation ? great Napoleon, property consists of two kinds, country so far has sacrificed its right to tax land. Land is sold only and not actually, prevent a Government backed up by the people, from raising taxation on land up to its full' value. Why should the present or past Government attempt to make the bonds of the country free of income tax? When I asked for a list of the richest men in the Commonwealth order to discover what amount of money they had taken up in the bonds of the country, mation. the King and Emperor of the possessions, of those employed Navy, from the Admiral powder monkey, in the Army, from the General down to the private, of Judges throughout the Empire, Prime and Ministers, Presidents and Speakers, and of every public servant Dr. Maloney. the British Dominion, are published.

What is Mr Brown, even if he is a millionaire ? Is he as important as the K i ng of England? We know that he is not, yet the salary of the K in g of England is known. Because, forsooth, some commission people are able to pull strings, whether members in Plinders-lane, Melbourne, or in George-street or Pitt-street, Sydney, what they earn must not be known! Referring to the immigration question, let me say that I do not know of any man belonging to either the present or past Labour party who ever objected to persons coming to Australia to share in the advantages enjoyed by our people, so long as they are given a fair show. But I never loans. knew one, whether of the past or present that Labour party, who did not object to people being brought to Australia to rebonds, duce wages. People are being brought out to this country for that purpose. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a pamphlet which I have To quote the code of the here, and which it will give me much pleasure to hand over to him. It is th«; movable and immovable.

Notwithstanding the general character of the leading article in to-day's Age, I should like honourable members to read the articles on Trusts and Combines published who paid income tax, in in that newspaper, commencing with the issue for the 3rd July, 1919. They will see from those articles how well we might I was refused the inforbe employed during ""the recess which is ro The wages -or salary of be forced upon us because the Leader of British the Government is going to England: I in the think I should read one sentence from the down to the article in to-day's Age, which commends the Leader of the Opposition. As praise from Sir Hubert is praise indeed, this is Ministers worth quoting. The Age saysMr Charlton was quite right in demanding throughout that land should be provided for newoomers, and that they should not be brought here to compete with our own people for employment. I welcome that statement. If Parliament continues to sit during the absence of the Prime Minister -in England, an effort might be made to make the incidence of the income tax fairer. Then, again, Fair Rents Courts are certainly needed in Australia,, and if their creation prove to bo beyond the powers of the Commonwealth, efforts could be made to induce the State Premiers to introduce the necessary legislation. If the Prime Minister has not sufficient confidence in the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), who is second in command, he could avail himself of the services of that parliamentary veteran, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman). legislation that might receive attention, if Parliament were to continue to sit, is the establishment of a national system of insurance, to which I think no objection is raised by financial experts. should a man, willing to work, not be supported if he be thrown oub of employment? I ask leave to continue my remarks at the next sitting. Leave gran bed; debabe adjourned. That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock p.m. am uot opposed bo our meeting on Tuesday, bub ib is rather xmfair on bhe part of the Prime Minister, after having kept the Housei n recess for four or five months, to suit his own convenience, to now propose, because he is jgoing to London in ten weeks' time, to again suit his convenience at bhe expense of honourable members. Many honourable members have believed bhat the usual sitting days would be adhered to, because it is only at the end of a session that additional sitting days are proposed. It is generally realized that bhe -programme outlined by the Government is sulficienb bo keep Parliamenb busy for bhe rest of the year; and, indeed, there is no reason why we should not sit on, in spite of the Prime Minister's absence. I am not endeavouring to evade work; iu facb, I desire bhe work bo go on, but of course in a proper manner. There should be no attempt to rush through in a few weeks important legislation affecting the welfare of the coun[6] try merely to suit the honourable gentleman's convenience. Because he is going abroad he proposes that Parliament shall shut down, and the remaining members of the Government permitted to administer the affairs of the country wibhout Parliament having the opportunity to exercise its right of criticism. The ex-PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes), with all his faults, never took such a course as is now proposed, but, when he went abroad, permitted the business of Parliament bo proceed. The present Prime Minister knows very well that he could be provided with a pair, so that his party would experience no loss of strength in his absence. Surely there are sufficient brains on the fron t bench to carry on affairs in the absence Another piece of of the Prime Minister. The only inference to be drawn from the motion before us is that, in his opinion, there is no one associated with him fib to take his place. What surprises me is that the members Why of the Country party, few in numbers as they are, should be like dumb dogs-for uot one of them, notwithstanding what they say outside about preserving their separate identity, has said a word. I have allowed the honourable member him that the terms of the motion are that the House, at its rising, adjourn unti l Tuesday next, and he must confine himself strictly to that question. ing to give reasons why we should not adjourn unti l Tuesday next; but, on the contrary, meet on the Wednesday as usual.

The rules of Parliament should be adhered to as nearly as possible, and the unwritten rule of meeting on Wednesday ought, I submit, to be observed, unless there is some special reason for departing from it.

It is well known, of course, that the Prime Minister wishes to get away to the Imperial Conference, which, like the Conferences with -State Ministers, is of very little importance to the Commonwealth There may be some Imperial titles ""as the out-oome of that gathering, but it is improper that any personal considerations -should be allowed to interfere with the work of this House. Prime Minister is a young man. Prior to the elections he did not dream that he would occupy his present position, but now that he has attained to place and power he is 'attempting to bludgeon this Parliament into sitting an extra day at the outset. We should not assent to this motion, but, at this early stage, should give the Government clearly to understand that we are prepared to do the business of the country under the ordinary Tules of procedure. The country will not benefit, because the watch-dogs of the people will not he here to see what the Government are doing by their administrative acts. marks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) in reference to the Prime Minister's comparatively recent appointment to the position of the Leader of the House ar.e uncalled for. The Prime Minister, who is supported by a majority in the Ohamber, is the most suitable representative the' Commonwealth oould have at the 'forthcoming Imperial Conference, and a majority of this House is of the opinion that we should adjourn in sufficient time to allow him to be present at that gathering. This House should, therefore, meet on a greater number of days than customary in order to get through the business and enable him to leave. The Leader of the Opposition was rather unfortunate in saying that the Government were exercising their brutal majority in inflicting their will upon the House, as one only has to refer to Votes and Proceedings to ascertain that the Labour party in 1915, when led by Mr Andrew Fisher, exercised their brutal majority. According to Votes and Proceedings., pages 249 and 257, we find ber in order? ber is not in order. Opposition was speaking, I interjected that fifteen divisions were taken on one day; but I -now find that the number was twenty-six. The Leader of the Opposition said that no previous Government had ever had the indecency to treat the Oppo1 sition as they are now being treated. The other honourable members, have to journey from Sydney to Melbourne to attend the sittings of Parliament, and I am quite prepared to sit an extra day if necessary. remarkable the manner in which the people of the Commonwealth are being treated by our elegant Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister, however, has thrown at the head of honourable members a motion which, if carried, entails sitting am extra day, without giving reasons. are to sit an extra day to deal with pressing problems, I , and I believe every other member of the Labour party, will welcome it. for that purpose; this motion has been moved merely to get into recess so that the enemies of the people, the exploiters of Plinders-lane, and the "" boodway. leiers "" of Australia may inflict hardships upon the community while the doors of Parliament are closed. We are told by our cultured and elegant Prime Minister, who comes along like a chocolate Mussolini, and who, like the Premier of South Australia ( Sir Henry Barwell), has apparently been carried away by the actions of that gentleman, that we have no right to object to being treated in this cavalier position in this House certainly entitles fashion.

SIR DENISON MILLER-VENTILATIO N OF THE CHAMBER-SAL E OF WILLIAMSTOWN TION BOARD'S REPORT. That the House do now adjourn. have been requested by Mr J. M . Scott, secretary to the Australia First Citizens Party, to read the following resolution cairied at a public meeting held in Sydney:This meeting of citizens wishes to place on Australia and the British Commonwealth of Nations have sustained through the death of Sir Denison Miller, Governor ot the Australian Commonwealth Bank. In reviewing the past since 1.903, when the agitation commenced for the Commonwealthing of all the banks, and in tracing one event after another since that date, we are almost justified in having the opinion that Sir Denison Miller was born on this earth with a special mission whicli he hns. performed. We thoroughly realize the economic catastrophe that would have been brought about in Australia during the War, when the private banks in 1916 refused to further finance the Federal Government, only for the action of Sir Denison The necessity for this Miller by quietly taking dominion over the minds of the private banks and the members of the Federal Government, and having his will worked to prevent the evil intended.

102,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [4.26],"Icharge, Sir Denison Miller delivered to tbe people messages to carry lis through all the problems that race us. The question is-Are we, the people of Australia, deserving of those messages 7 In July, 1921, Sir Denison Miller undertook to finance Australia for £350,000,000, the only condition being that the Premiers call on the Bunk to finance any constructive developmental work passed by Parliament. That message was delivered to Premiers Storey, Dooley, and Fuller, but they did nothing. In December, .1921, Sir Denison Miller, in his address to the Press Club, said, "" Australia could easily carry a population of 100,000,000."" He suggested an essential work, the unification of -ur railways, and said he would see that the money would be forthcoming. These great offers have been ignored by our Parliaments, and in view of these and other .great messages delivered by Sir Denison, we citizens assembled, urge the people through the Prime ttinister that the railways be unified, the work to be looked upon as a monument to the memory of the great man we have lost; and, further, we Buggest that the title of "" Governor"" be not given to the successors of Sir Denison Miller, but that some title (be created such as ""President"" or other suitable name, so that the people down through the centuries will come to think of Sir Denison Miller as always being with them as Governor of their Commonwealth Bank, assisting in the shaping -f Australia's great destiny. terday afternoon the air that entered the chamber was of such intense humidity that it must have been dangerous to the health of honourable members. I would like to know, Mr Speaker, whether yon have obtained any report in regard to the matter referred to you yesterday, and whether you will Beriously consider the advisability of appointing an engineer who is an expert in ventilating processes to sec if some improvement cannot he effected. -'Yesterday I received sueh a dose of the air complained of that I made, up «iy mind to ascertain, if possible, during the week-end the conditions under which the ohamber is ventilated, and to see if early attention would not effect some improvement in them. ter) [1.29] I desire to inform the House that the sale of the Williamstown Shipbuilding Yards and Dockyard has been effected. The purchaser is the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commission, and the price is £150,000. The sale haa been made subject to the following conditions: (1) Tbat the Commonwealth retain as long as required for present purposes the use of tbe area on which are erected the oil tanks at present used by the Navy Department, willi the right to remove these tanks at any time.
