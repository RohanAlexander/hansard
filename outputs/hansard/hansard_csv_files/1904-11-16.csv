W ill the Minister give us some information on the subject? fence) -This question was raised when the DefenceB ill was under discussion, and it was then decided that canteens should not be prohibited. Consequently, the regulations issued under the Act recognise that canteens are not forbidden, and allow them, but they are controlled in the strictest manner possible. Last EasterI had the honour to be in command of a camp of training, and authorized the establishment of a canteen in the camp, but from the first day to the last not a single man present was under the influence of liquor, nor was a single crime committed in the camp. At the same time, I sympathize with the honourable member's desire that temptations shall not be with him that the drinking habit should not be encouraged; but, speaking from many years' experience of camps, I say that, when canteens are properly controlled, none of the evils which he fears result. In reply to his request for in formation, not a penny of the proposed appropriation will be spent on canteens. Every penny of it is used in other directions, the vote being one of the most valuable we have. However, as he and other honourable members feel strongly on the matter, I suggest that the best way to test the opinion of the Committee in regard to it would be to try to have their views embodied in legislation. the Defence Bill! I intend to move one. troduction of new matter into that B ill , ' I suggest that the honourable member for New England should test the feeling of this new Parliament in regard to canteens when the new Defence Bill is under consideration, instead of by the inconvenient method which he now proposes to adopt. the Committee will not follow the honourable",12,Ordnanc Ebran Ch Officials

I do not know if the honourable member has recently visited camps of training to see how the men there behave, but I have been to such camps frequently,' and I have not seen any indication of an abuse of the canteens. lishment of canteens is not provided for in the proposed vote. the Sydney encampments last Easter, the weather was very wet, rain falling for several days in succession, and on one occaand likely to be correct.

I think that that was a wise precaution to take. The canteens are always under proper regulations. lic houses. I use them occasionally, and I know that they are useful institutions. I trust, however, that the Minister will see that officers are given to understand that they must confine their expenditure to the amount voted for the purpose of encampments. While I was in the Treasury the pistol was, metaphorically, placed at my head on. several occasions by commanding tional grants for camps of training, perhaps after the men had actually started. The military authorities know the amounts voted in the Estimates, and they should cut their' coat according to their cloth. If the amount proposed is not sufficient, let it be increased to what is reasonable; but it is not right that these votes should be continually exceeded, as has been done in the past. diture out of the Treasurer's advance vote of several sums in excess of the amounts voted by Parliament, because I had no option in the matter, since one could not make the men suffer for the mistakes of those in authority, the service should be run on those lines. The Minister should make it clear to the officers who are intrusted with the administration of these matters that they must not exceed the expenditure authorized by Parliament. Commandant sending in, not a request for financial authority for particular camps of instruction or schools of training, but a complete schedule of the proposed expenditure of the vote for the whole year, having notified them of the amount proposed to be placed on the Estimates. These schedules reached me.some weeks ago, and two of them were returned, because they were insufficient in their details, or did not leave a sufficient margin for contingencies to satisfy me that the vote would not be exceeded. They then came back to me in an amended' form. I have been through these schedules for the year, and had them checked by my financial advisers, and, so far as I can judge, they are reasonable, maVidants have received formal notification from me.that they must expect to be held personally responsible if they exceed the amounts set down on the Estimates, after having been duly warned that they must keep their expenditure within those limits. I have every reason to believe that this will prevent the recurrence of complained of. fTwo or three similar cases came under my notice, in regard fo one of which I told the State Commandan' that he must make the excess good out oT this year's vote, that is, I have surcharged him for a portion of his excess out of this vear's vote. am prepared to accept the Minister's asofficers,' who asked for addisurance that honourable members will be afforded an opportunity to deal with this matter.

37,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay),"There is the increased expenditure proposed in connection with the Defence Forces of Queensland. I am quite aware of the fact that we adopt a course different from that pursued by the various States Governments prior to Federation. The States authorities provided for any special defence expenditure out of loan funds, whereas we adopt (he proper course of charging all expenditure against revenue. Comparing the proposed expenditure of £ 7 7 , 9 2 0 in Queensland with the total expenditure of £40,237 proposed in connection with the South Australian Defence Forces, the former amount appears unduly large. South Australia has in this Parliament seven representatives, as contrasted with the nine representatives returned by Queensland; whereas their contribution towards the defence of Australia amounts to only half the sum contributed by Queensland. I think that a very wise economy is being exercised in South Australia, and that the expenditure in Queensland is too high, especially in view of the serious financial straits of that State.. I have always felt that the expenditure on permanent forces and head-quarters staffs is proportionately far too large, and I shall certainly welcome the time when it is reduced, and any money that may be saved under that heading is spent in the direction of encouraging the rank and file. Militia are the cause of all the trouble. the actual field work will have to do the fighting. small that they will not be able to do very .much except act as supervisors in time of trouble. Therefore, every economy should be exercised in the expenditure upon that section of the Forces, and more liberal treatment should be extended to our citizens who give up their time with a view to fitting themselves to take part in the defence of the Commonwealth. The expenditure upon rifle clubs and associations in Queensland last year amounted to £ 2 , 1 4 2 , whereas it is proposed to expend -<""8,9i5 during the current year. for that. do I begrudge the money, especially if it is to be devoted to the purchase of ammunition, and to offering further encouragement to riflemen to perfect, themselves as marksmen. We should not be justified in practising economy at the expense of our rifle clubs, or of the equipment of our soldiers. It would be safer for us to have ten men thoroughly equipped than to have 1,000 men without effective arms or a suf-ficient quantity of ammunition. I trust that the Minister will exercise every possible economy during the current year. what confused by the first four items in this division, which read as follows: Commandant at £800 per annum to 31.7.04 ... ... £6S 13 4 Col. T. Price, in lieu of pay, at £800 per annum from 1.8.04 to 21.10.04 ... 178 9 11 Commandant at ^800 per annum from 22.10.04 ... 554 16 0 Allowance to Officer acting as Commandant, at 5s. per diem from 1.8.04 to 21.10.04 ----2 1 I shall be glad if the Minister can explain these items. I am as anxious as is the honourable member for Wide Bay to keep down expenses. At the same time. I recognise that it would be useless for us to maintain a Defence Force unless we took measures to insure its efficiency. Our Defence Force, whether it be a large or a small one, must be properly equipped, so as to be always prepared to meet any emergency. There is another matter to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister. I The payments to the am given to understand that although in one branch of the service a horse and fodder allowance is provided, it is denied to another branch. PossiblyI may be told The Permanent Forces are so that in the latter case the allowance is included in the salary, but I cannot understand why any such differential treatment should be meted out to the two branches. I should like to have the matter explained by the Minister. the honourable member for Kennedy upon these Estimates, it will be observed that the proposed increase over the actual expenditure of last year in connection with the Queensland Defence Force is very much larger than it is over last year's appropriation. A considerable portion of that increase is due to the fact that at fhe present time the various regiments are nearer their f u l l strength than they were last year, when recruiting was suspended for a long period. The balance of the increase is required to make provision for the purchase of ammunition. Honourable members will understand that we have what is called an ammunition trust fund for all corps, to which is credited the moneys paid by those",15,Hebridesmail Service Should Not Put Temptations Into Their Way

These moneys accumulate from year to year, and when they amount to a reasonable sum, instead of the Estimates being charged with the purchase of the whole or part of the ammunition required, it is paid for out of that fund. year. the fund had accumulated to such an exfent that we were practically able to purchase the whole of the ammunition by that means, without having to charge the Estimates on that account. This year, however, the position is reversed. In my judgment, it is a bad. practice to allow the ammunition trust fund to accumulate and then to disburse it in large sums. Consequently, I propose to leave a certain margin, so that in future the vote for ammunition shall not fluctuate so much as it has done in the past. stopped ? for a considerable period all over the Commonwealth. tralia. is an increased expenditure of £6,500. to be spent in the purchase of ammunition. the honourable member for Wide Bay that last year recruiting was stopped upon a certain date. After an interval had elapsed, the practice wasi again authorized. When recruiting had been in progress for five or six weeks, however, it was again stopped. During that period some of the regiments had obtained all the recruits they needed, and had sworn them inbut others had not done so. In my own case, I was a day late, with the result that I could not enrol fifty recruits until the order forbidding recruiting had been cancelled. I can assure honourable members that these Queensland Estimates have caused me a great deal of anxiety, because of the considerable increase which they show upon last year's expenditure, quite apart from the increase upon last year's appropriation. There is another circumstance which contributes towards keeping them a little higher than they might be. Owing to its geographical position and its area, we need to maintain more troops in Queensland in proportion to its population than we require to maintain in a State such as South Australia, which is less disadvantageous^ situated, and which has a shorter coastline. favour of a national system. In Queensland last in Queensland which continue to be paid as militia, although their duties relate to district defence as contrasted w|ith the duties of a field force. As honourable members are aware, the militia belong to the mobile forces, which may be moved anywhere within the Commonwealth. On the other hand, the volunteers are those to whom is allotted district defence-the infantry! defence of forts, for example. I repeat that there are two regiment's in Queensland which continue to be paid as militia, although their duties appertain to district defence, because it was found by was recruiting my predecessors in office that great difficulties would arise if any alteration were made in that practice, it having existed for such a long period. Concerning the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley, I wish to say that the vote to which he refers appears in its present form in order that honourable members may be supplied with the fullest possible information. Colonel Price, it will be remembered, was Commandant of Queensland for some time. His term of office expired upon the 22nd October of this year. In April last he became ill, and was granted leave of absence on that account. Upon the 1st August he was retired, upon the recommendation of a Medical Board, as it was seen that he could not recover. Seeing, however, that in 1902 the Government of the day had promised him that his term of office should be extended until he reached the maximum age of 62 years, we thought it only fair-as he was retiring without any other compensation-to pay his salary up to the period when he would have relinquished his command under normal conditions. From the day that he actually retired until the date upon which he would have retired under ordinary circumstances, an allowance of 5s. per day was made to Colonel Plomer, as Acting Commandant. Even now we shall save a small sum upon that account, because Colonel Plomer is not receiving £800 a year at the present time. I wish to know what policy the Minister intends to adopt in regard to the Field Artillery? I note that there is such a force in Queensland, but in VictoriaI know that the batteries of Field Artillery have been",16,Hebridesmail Service Should Not Put Temptations Into Their Way

52,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"flouted, discouraged, ignored, and disheartened. Indeed, at the present time, they are kept together only by the enthusiasm and energy of a few officers. They have no instructional staff, and no attempt is made to impart any real instruction to them. I do not know whether or not the Field Artillery is a suitable arm of defence, but if it is it should be maintained and encouraged. Either we ought to disband that force, or to treat it properly. At the present time the position is that its members have practically been told that they must nof expect anything. The money which used to be bestowed upon them is being devoted to what is called the Australian Light Horse. No complaint is made as to the allowances provided for officers and men. The grievance is that they possess little or no appliances, and have practically no-opportunities for practice in the field, or otherwise. I know that the Minister will be told by his officials that some instruction is given to this branch of the service. it. who I am sure is anxious to do his duty in this matter-no t to rest satisfied with any report which he may obtain from his officers, but to ascertain f u l l particulars as to what instruction is imparted. are one or two points connected with these Estimates to which I wish to direct attention. In the first place, I notice that they provide for an increase of £ 1 0 , 4 1 6 over the expenditure of last year. It seems to me that that increase is upon right lines. If it were not for the fact that the Minister of Defence has been such a short time in office, I should ask him to supply me with figures showing what was the expenditure of last year, as compared with that during the year immediately preceding the establishment of the Commonwealth. less now. In the first year of the existence of the Federation, a promise was made by the Commonwealth Government to reduce the expenditure to £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , and it is beteach discipline to our lads in the State low that sum now. that information, because upon the 27th October, 1900, when the Queensland Government submitted their Defence Estimates to the State Parliament, they increased the total amount of the vote by more than £ 4 9 , 0 0 0, under the impression that the Defence Department would be a charge upon the whole population of Australia. The late Government of Queensland was constantly crying out that the Commonwealth Parliament was extravagant, and under the circumstances I think that it is wise to occasionally draw the attention of the public to the fact that the expenditure now is very much less than it was during the year immediately preceding Federation. When it was found that each State would be responsible for the expenditure upon its own transferred Departments, the Queensland Government appealed to this Parliament to cut down its Defence expenditure, and we did so. The result is that notwithstanding the increase which is proposed during the present year, the Defence expenditure in Queensland is still £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , or £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 less than it was in 1900. enough vet. this, as in other matters, it is possible to be a penny wise and pound foolish. I am I know something about glad to note that a small increase is provided in connection with the cadet forces. I ask the MinisterI wish that a similar increase obtained throughout the whole of these Estimates. In mv judgment, that force forms the basis of our whole defence system. I need scarcely remind honourable members that a little more than a year ago the Brisbane Grammar School Cadet Corps defeated all the public schools throughout the British Empire in rifle shooting. In Queensland there is another corps which has since defeated the team to which I have referred upon two occasions. The shooting of these corps, in competition with the whole of the schools of the British Empire, proves that the Australian youth is quite able to hold his own with the rifle. I think that very little is required to encourage the patriotic and martial spirit in our youths. What is learned at school is never entirely forgotten. During the South African war I think it is very much we had evidence that while some time was required to teach men how to shoot straight, it did not take long to render them amenable to discipline. I claim that if we schools, they will render a good acI desired to obtain count of themselves when occasion arises. A portion of this increase is due to the provision made for rifle clubs, and I think that the expenditure will be a very wise one. I proposed to say something about the necessity for the establishment of a State ammunition factory, believing that I knew something about small-arms",17,Hebridesmail Service Should Not Put Temptations Into Their Way

59,Mr Wilkinson,"I .think ,'that i nammunition, but, having ascertained „ the views of experts, I find that the opinion I expressed on a previous occasion in regard to this matter was not altogether correct. I feel, however, that there is need for very close inspection of the ammunition turned out under contract. In using the rifle I have found that the ammunition so supplied is very accurate, but we cannot exercise too much care in regard to its manufacture. There is another question to which I should like to refer, namely, the allowances in respect of horse hire. In looking over some of the regulations, I find that an officer who has to provide his own horse is allowed in some cases twice, and in others three times as much as is allowed a trooper, who often provides a far better animal. I believe that an allowance of 30s. per annum is given to some of the members of mounted infantry regiments. That is scarcely enough to pay a man to shoe a horse, and yet for this sum a trooper is expected to provide his own saddle and bridle, feed his own horse, and keep him well groomed, so that he may appear on parade in a proper condition. includes provision for a number of proper saddles. shod at least four times a year, so that an allowance of 30s. is not more than sufficient to pay for shoeing. I suppose that a trooper's horse will wear out as many shoes, and eat as much corn, as will a horse used by an officer, and yet there is a marked difference in the respective allowances. I should like to ask the Minister when we shall have a supply of the hew rifles which have been ordered? Through his courtesy I had an opportunity a few days ago to -inspect a sample rifle, and I was satisfied that it was a good' weapon. our troops are armed with these rifles the better. able to enter into some arrangement whereby our permanent forces would have a sufficient supply of up-to-date rifles, whilst members of rifle clubs who are arming themselves at their own expense might be able to .become possessed of the most modern weapons. like to say a word or two in reference to the Easter Encampments which are held in the different States. pected to go into camp with the partially paid and other branches of the service at the various capitals. As the Minister is aware, many of our volunteers are working men. They are expected to remain in camp from three to seven days, and during the whole of that period are unable, of course, to follow their usual employment. It seems to me that, as all the other forces are paid, it is not reasonable that the volunteers should be expected to lose their employment whilst in camp without receiving seme allowance. If we had a sufficient number of people to enable us, as in England, to form yeomanry corps-consistin g of men who can give the requisite time to attendance in camp-the position might be different, but, as the volunteers on whom we have to rely must attend the camp from the first day until the last, if any .good results are to follow, I think the Minister might well consider whether an. allowance should not be granted to them in respect of their attendance. think that the Minister of Defence has supplied me with all the information for which I asked a few minutes ago. It appears to me that a preference honourable member for having overlooked that point when I was speaking. complaints in regard to the practice of A horse must be supplying officers in one branch of the services with horses, and granting them an allowance for horse-feed, whilst officers in another branch of the service have to provide their own horses, and feed them at their own expense. That is not desirable.

In the one case, an officer received a salary new rifles which I have ordered ought to and so much in respect of horse allowance, which was practically a part of his salary, and under the new scheme, he received both amounts in the name of salary. alteration made was that those who had been receiving portion of their salary in the name secure his money.

Nothing should be paid to an officer by way of allowance. All payments made to him should be by way of salary. But it must be that those officers who did not receive an allowance before the inauguration of the new system now desire that their salaries should be increased by a sum equivalent to the increased salary granted to others in lieu of allowance. they desire to obtain something which they never had before simply because others now receive something which was paid them by way of allowance under the old system. That is not reasonable. In reply to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I would say that I am watching the interests of the Field Artillery ordered twenty guns by cable. As regards the matter of instruction, I think I know the details of the trouble to which he refers. It is largely a Victorian difficulty, and I do not anticipate that it will continue. The honourable member for Moreton has also referred to the position of cadets. The. reason that the cadet vote is not larger this year is that I find that there is really no system in existence, but I hope through the Prime Minister to be able to arrange with the States for a system applying to the whole Commonwealth.

I have no enthusiasm in regard to getting something for nothing from any man, whether he be a private, or In other words, a colonel, but, unfortunately, we have to limit our expenses, and volunteers are volunteers, because in theory, at all events, they are supposed to have less demands made on their time than have the field forces, which are militia. able member for Parramatta yesterday drew as well as I can, and have attention to the lack of recognition of some of the men who had served in South Africa. ceeding on somewhat irregular lines.

For instance, £3 -510 additional is to be spent upon ammunition, which is more than half the total increase. That expenditure is absolutely necessary, because we must keep up our supply of ammunition. The other substantial increase is £ 1 , 5 3 0 for the Militia Forces. That increase, however, does not make the proposed appropriation quite as large as the appropriation for last year, and bears out the statement of the Minister of Defence in regard to the Queensland Estimates, that, as recruiting has now recommenced, we must make provision for the payment of a larger number of men. But, apart from those two items, I note a tendency, although"" the amounts are not very large, to increase the expense of the Permanent Staff, and to decrease the expense of what are known as the Citizen Forces. Thus, there is an increased expenditure of £ 8 6 9 in connection with the Permanent Forces, made up of a number of small items, the largest being an increase of £ 2 8 2 in connection with the In structional Staff.

South Australia is not paying too much for the instruction she gets. why the instructional staff of South Australia is smaller than that of Western Australia, the first being that the South Australian Forces have been longer in existence than the Western Australian iForces, and were, as a whole, in a more advanced condition, while the second is that in the last Parliament there was considerable questioning on the part of the representatives of South Australia as to the need for a large instructional staff for that State. The honourable member for Barker asked questions on the subject about once a week. In my opinion, South Australia would be the better for an increased instructional staff. One of the best ways in which we can spend our money is in making provision for instruction. The preceding and the present Government, however, have respected, so far as they could, the feeling of the representatives of South Australia in this matter; though, if I find that the instructional staff in any State is insufficient to do justice to the Forces there, I shall not hesitate to take the steps necessary to secure efficiency, and to prevent the instructors from working for unreasonably long hours. reasonable now. plaints on the subject, but I think that the honourable membei will agree with me that The ground of obthe causes of complaint have been, to a large extent, removed owing to statements made to me privately by representatives of the State, to which I have been glad to pay attention. ister tell me the names of the clerks whose salaries are provided for in subdivision 1 ?

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) -It is well known to most honourable memberscertainly it is to the Minister-that for some considerable time the Tasmanian Defence Forces have occupied a very unsatisfactory position. I am reluctant to bring this matter forward because I am not unmindful of the fact that some time ago the then Tasmanian Government approached the Minister of Defence with a request that Every rifleman is entitled to an the Tasmanian volunteers should not be placed upon the same footing as their confreres upon the mainland. The Commonwealth Government acquiesced in that desire, and I am sorry to say that the result has been most disastrous to the Defence Forces of the island State. Now, I find that it is proposed to pay those forces only from the ist January, 1905, despite the fact that early in the present session I obtained from the. then Minister of Defence, che honourable member for Eden-Monaro, a written memorandum to the effect that they would be paid firom the ist July last. That memorandum I submitted to officers of the given in this House by the right honourable member for Swan. MrM c WILLIAMS I visited Tasmania for the express purpose of endeavouring to bring about a settlement of this difficulty. I handed the memorandumto which I have referred to certain officers of the Tasmanian Defence Force, and I have no doubt that if the records are searched, a copy of it will be forthcoming. I regret to have to say that the volunteers of Tasmania regard the non-fulfilment of that promise as a distinct breach of faith on the part of the Commonwealth Government. Personally, I wish to thank the present Minister of Defence, for having given me his assurance that he will visit Tasmania as early as possible during the recess, with a view to removing the friction which now exists, and to placing the forces of that State JOHN FORREST -Apparently , last upon a satisfactory basis.

112,Mr Page,"The same assurance Wasof Tasmania arrived there a few days ago it was not practicable to obtain a proper guard of honour, exclusive of cadets. There were not available men in the Defence Force in the southern portion of the island to form a proper guard of honour to receive His Excellency. At the same time, it must be admitted that the members of the Defence Force of Tasmania have been very longsuffering. For many years the volunteers gave their services to the State gratuitously. Indeed, there are quite a number who are entitled to long-service medals, solely in their capacity as volunteers. members are aware that when the General Officer Commanding visited that State, some time since, an order was given that the men should attend a parade; but, owing to a considerable amount of misunderstanding, and to some dissatisfaction, the volunteer forces failed to obey the order. The result was that a whole regiment was wiped out of existence. Of course, I recognise that discipline must be maintained, and I have never attempted to urge that, in acting as they did, the men did not commit a grave error of judgment. But in that connection it should be recollected that they had ground .for very serious complaint in that they had been treated differently from their comrades upon the. mainland. Indeed, the promise to place them upon the same footing as the Defence Forces of the other States has been made so often-and its redemption so long deferred-that they have come to regard 'its non-fulfilment as an absolute breach of faith on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I am aware that the action of the Government was actuated by a desire to study the finances of Tasmania. I am not anxious to increase the burdens of that State, but I say that when a pledge is deliberately given it should be adhered to, otherwise the Defence Forces of Tasmania cannot be expected to repose any confidence in. the administration of the Department. another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister. Rightly or wrongly, the idea exists in Tasmania that those who framed the conditions of our defence system had an eye upon the speedy transference of militia to the mainland in case of emergency. Unfortunately there are two ends to Tasmania, and from time to time there has existed-no t unnaturallya certain amount of rivalry between them-. In the State Parliament we always endeavoured to surmount that difficulty by dividing the Defence vote as equitably as possible between the north and the south. In my opinion it would be a very good thing if the Minister endeavoured to give effect to that system. Not more than four or five hours would be occupied in conveying troops from Habart to Launceston-if their services were required-or vice versa. Before concluding, I wish specially to emphasize the point to which I have previously directed attention, namely, that there has been an absolute breach of faith on the part of the Commonwealth Government with the Honourable Tasmanian Defence Forces. I ask the Minister, in view of the circumstances which I have narrated, to give me some assurance that this matter will be considered. I have no desire to obstruct the progress of the Estimates. I merely wish to see even-handed justice administered, and to insure that ,a pledge which was deliberately given in this House shall be respected. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Denison) I am indebted to the honourable member for Franklin for having called attention to thisitem during my temporary absence from the Chamber. I think that he has said enough to induce Ministers to review this vote for the current year. He has conclusively proved that a distinct promise was made in connection with the payment of the Tasmanian Defence Forces. The pledge was given by Ministers through me in Hobart last year that in future the Forces of Tasmania should, in the matter of payment for their services, be placed upon the same footing as those of the mainland.. It was the original intention of the right honourable member for Swan to include in last year's Estimates a sum of about £ 5 , 0 0 0 in excess of that which had previously been voted for that purpose. But, owing to very strong representations on the part of the Premier of Tasmania, supported by the Treasurer and myself, and in view of the financial position of Tasmania, the amount There is in question was written off. Our action produced an immense amount of dissatisfaction, which culminated in the unfortunate disbandment of one regiment, owing to its disregard of a call to duty. I find that the sum of £ 1 , 5 0 0 has been placed upon the Estimates this year, as a sort of half redemption of the promise to which I have referred. That£ 1 , 5 0 0 is to be expended in paying the Tasmanian Defence-Forces from the ist January next. If the promises of Ministers are respected, that amount will not be doubled to cover the expenditure for the year, because the f u l l complement of men will not be enrolled, and consequently the vote may be increased by only £ 7 0 0 or £ 8 0 0 . The representatives of Tasmania have every right to ask the Government to keep faith with the Defence Forces of that State by amending this item. will see his way clear to place the Tasmanian Defence Force upon the same footing as that of the mainland from the ist of July last. to hear the honourable member for Denison now pleading that these men should be paid, although, as a member of a former Government, he did not do anything to bring about this much-needed reform. .

There was almost a rebellion in Tasmania last year, and the right honourable member for Swan, who was then Minister of Defence, said that the demand. made by the men ought to be investigated. wards the right honourable member was succeeded' as Minister of Defence by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who took certain steps, with the result that many of the men were dismissed, and some of them were deprived of their military rights.

The right honourable member for Swan, as Minister of Defence, said that these troops would be paid if the necessary vote were granted. The money was voted, and now we have the astounding statement by the honourable member for Franklin that payment is not to be made until January of next year. If we are going to break faith with the men how can we expect them to render us loyal service? Several residents I trust that the Minister of Tasmania tell me that the Defence Forces in Tasmania are in an absolutely rotten state. I trust that the Minister of Defence will give the matter his serious attention. Only a few days ago, when the new Governor of Tasmania arrived it was found impossible to provide him with a guard of honour, and the school children had to be called out. It was a gala day for the boys, and no doubt the Governor appreciated their action, but the posiI took action to pretion is very unsatisfactory. I am surprised that the honourable member for Denison should now ask that these troops shall be paid, although, as a Minister, he did all he could to prevent the adoption of that course. The necessary vote was passed last year, and yet it is not proposed to pay them until January next. whether it would not be possible to pay the It was then a quesmen as from the rst July last.

Notwithstanding that fact, on my first review of these Estimates, I kept on them a vote Shortly afterfor the whole year in respect of the infantry forces as well as the others in order that the men might be paid as from ist July last, and placed on an equal footing with the Forces in the. rest of the Commonwealth.

119,Mr Mccay,"When the Estimates forwith which I had not been previously acquainted. I was informed by the honourable member for Franklin that a definite promise had been made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, as Minister of Defence, that the payment should be made in respect of the current financial year, while the honourable member for Denison informed me that he had the authority of .the Cabinet, of which he was a member, to make a similar promise to the men. That naturally placed a different complexion on the matter, and I felt that even financial exigencies, unless overpowering, must yield to the keeping of faith by the Government. As soon as this information was conveyed to me, I immediately set to work-withou t waiting for the Estimates of my Department to be reached-to specially investigate those relating to Tasmania. I consulted with my Department, and also with my colleagues with regard to this matter, and I believe that I shall be able, without any great increase in the Estimates of Tasmania, to keep the promise that was apparently made to the men. now desire to assure the Committee, and more especially ,the representatives of Tasmania, that I shall pay the militia infantry as from ist July of the current year, instead of from ist January of next year. I am hopeful that, as the result of savings which I may be able to effect in other parts of the Tasmanian Estimates, I shall be able to pay this infantry regiment from ist July last, without any increase, or, at all events, without any substantial increase, in the total vote. I and my colleagues felt that, as the promise had been made so very definitelyand not merely in the way of holding out a hope that the men would be paid this year, if possible-the Government was bound, except in the face of the gravest objection, to carry it out and keep faith with the men. I trust that honourable members will accept my assurance that this will be done without requiring any postponement or readjustment of the Estimates at the present time. the Forces in Tasmania?

With regard to the remarks made by the honourable member for Franklin as to the distribution of the partially-paid and volunteer forces, in some reasonable degree of equalitv. over the various parts of Tasmania, I must say that I am obliged to him for the suggestion, and I shall see how far it will be possible to comply with what is not an unreasonable local feeling in various parts of that State. Knowing that there have been difficulties in Tasmania, largely owing to the financial exigencies of the Sfate itself, I propose, if I am still in the fortunate position of being able to administer the Department, to proceed to Tasmania either at the end of this year or early next year, in order that I may become acquainted on the spot with all the facts relating to the position of the Forces there. I feel sure that by visiting TasmaniaI shall be better able to deal with the matters that are in question than I should be if I remained in Melbourne and merely obtained reports and official documents from the State. When we meet the House at the beginning of next session, I hope that I shall be able to say that, so far as the in the Cabinet Defence Forces are concerned, matters in Tasmania are in a completely satisfactory state.

120,Mr Tudor,What is the strength of,27,Mccay W E Provide For 509 In Masters General Which Have Just Become
121,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I think thatdiscovered that the Public Service Commissioner could not interfere with their offices, or grade their salaries, and that being so, the duty of fixing the salaries to be attached to these offices is thrown upon the Ministry. If the officials who found the loop-hole in the Public Service Act, gave equal scrutiny to minor matters in the Act and regulations, they would find, in the regulations at any rate, a great deal which, in my humble judgment, is ultra vires. The proposed appropriation for the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales remains at £ 9 2 0 , but I think that the feeling to ask the Commonwealth to continue, to of the Committee is that these high salaries should be considerably reduced. I do not say that the gentleman who has been filling the position in New South Wales is not a very worthy and able man, but the salary attached to the office was fixed at a time when As fresh appointments are to be made, the person holding it dealt directly with the Postmaster-General of his State, and was responsible for matters of administration which now occupy fhe attention of the Central Staff. Now that these offices are becoming vacant, a proper and reasonable opportunity is afforded for reconsidering the value of the services to be performed toy their holders. duce those high salaries, we shall leave ourselves open to the charge, which has often been levelled against the Federal Parliament, of doing nothing to decrease expenditure. I think that we should now make a beginning, and thus justify the hope which the people entertained, that Federation would lead to the administration of this Department in a more economical manner. What gain would there be from the transference of the States Departments to the Commonwealth if the higher officials in the service continued to draw the laqrge salaries which were allotted to them when they had greater responsibilities? I do not wish to disparage the occupants of those offices; but it must be obvious to, the Minister that their responsibilities are not so gVeat, and that their duties are not so heavy, as when they were directly responsible to the Postmasters-General of the States. plified, their responsibilities have been diminished, and therefore there is no justification for continuing to pay to them the high salaries which have hitherto prevailed, and for which provision is made on these Estimates. that the Minister will consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie. As has been pointed out by him, it was hoped that under Federation the transference of the Postal Departments of the States to the Commonwealth would lead to a reduction in expenditure, and an increase in efficiency. The honourable member for Coolgardie has pointed out that the officers in the Central Office now do a great deal qf the work which was Tormerly done by the heads of the State Departments. Seeing that the latter have had a great deal of responsibility removed from them, the Minister should consider whether it is fair pay the high salaries which were paid"" prior to Federation. I do not advocate the payment of lower salaries than are earned, but I should like to hear some justification for the proposal to continue the present salaries. there is now a reasonable opportunity for reviewing the duties and responsibilities of these offices. Another matter upon which I should like the Minister to give the Committee some information is the jsystem of requiring guarantees for the installation of telephones. In some cases guarantees have been demanded from large towns, the If we do not rebusiness of which was obviously sufficient to pay working expenses and interest on the cost of construction. I know several instances in which the subsequent working of the telephone system provided has shown that the guarantee required was absolutely unnecessary. I do not ask for the abolition of the guarantee system, because the Department must be run on business lines, but I think that the larger centres of population should be asked to contribute in some measure towards the cost of improving the facilities of communication of those who live in outlying districts. Our desire is that our population shall not centre entirely in our large cities, but that people shall go out into the country, and settle it. Where that happens, the community is under an obligation to keep the settlers as much as possible in touch with their markets, and to make their conditions of life as easy as possible. There are two Their work has been much simtownships in my electorate, Pittsworth and Clifton, which are farming centres, and which, judging by the settlement which is now going on around them, show every likelihood of becoming large permanent townships. I think that the Minister, in considering the position of such places, should not insist on a guarantee if his officers report that their business will, if not immediately, in the future, ade-",27,Mccay W E Provide For 509 In Masters General Which Have Just Become

When a guarantee is required, it is often hard to obtain, and the demand for it provokes irritation. energetic individual has to constitute himself a commercial agent for his fellow townsfolk, and go round collecting subscriptions to make up the amount. Minister has already given attention to the question of cheapening the construction of telephone lines, so as to reduce in some instances the guarantee asked for. I should like him to look into the whole question, and see if he cannot confer a great benefit on country districts by allowing a further reduction. .complaint against the Department is that the red-tape bureaucracy of the Commonwealth paralyzes energy, and demoralizes efficiency. Nothing can be done until about fifteen or twenty heads of Departments have been consulted. General is a man of experience, who knows the requirements of those who live in isolated parts of the country, and is prepared to see justice done. Buti f I ask for the establishment of a post-office anywhere, the matter has to be referred to the head of the Department in Hobart, who instructs some one else in some other place-onl y the Creator knows where-to inquire into the matter. He reports to some one else, and that person reports to Hobart, and Hobart in its turn reports to the Department in Melbourne, and the Department to the Postmaster-General, who, by the time the matter is placed before him, has become almost as demoralized as the administration which he controls. I have heard a great deal about the system of changing men which prevails in America, but the Lord deliver me from the Australian system, and give me the American system. tem, or the Canadian system? care which. Letters sent to me from Tasmania have reached me five or six days afterwards, when they were of no value to me; but I have not complained. I suggest to 'the Postmaster-General, however, that in transferring postmasters and other officials he should transfer from one State to another. New brooms sweep clean, and if Victorians went to Tasmania they might stir up the Tasmanians, while if Tasmanians come toMelbourne they will be sure to make a stir here. Owing to intermarriages in Australia, every man has so many relations that you cannot step on any one's toes without wounding What happens is that some the sensibilities of hundreds of others. It would ibe better to place an absolute stranger in such a position-^on e who would -not be affected by any attempts at bullThe dozing or intimidation. . I admit that the Postmaster-General has kindlv endeavoured to help me in securing a satisfactory mail service for the inhabitants of King Island. He has promised to do everything he can to meet their requirements. There are upon that island 600 or 700 Britisherswhite men, with white skins and white hearts-and I think that they are entitled to more consideration than are the residents of the New Hebrides, who are entirely beyond our bordfers. s The Postmaster General has also endeavoured to provide a better mail service for the residents of Camp Creek and other places where The PostmasterBritishers live, who are descendants of the men who won Waterloo and Trafalgar for England. I trust that the Postmaster General will adopt the plan of sending a responsible officer to investigate all such cases as those referred to. I admit that in Tasmania we have many capable and energetic officers, but I think that the introduction of a little new blood Is often a very good thing. I trust that the Minister will pay due consideration to the suggestions I have made. under the necessity of bringing before the Committee a matter which has been frequently mentioned by me. I refer to the subletting of mail contracts by Mr Vines, who carries on business under the name of Cobb and Co. There were forty-one of these contracts in all. After attention had been directed in this Chamber to the circumstances under which the contracts were being carried out, Mr Vines was notified that within a certain time he would have to transfer all the contracts to the men I do not who were doing the work, and who were receiving in some instances less than half the' money that the Government were paying for the services rendered. This action was taken by the late Postmaster-General, with the perfect approval of honourable members, and the present Postmaster-General has adhered closely to the decision of his predecessor. A new development has arisen, however, and I think that some action should be taken in regard to it. Honourable members may recollect the case",28,Mccay W E Provide For 509 In Masters General Which Have Just Become

126,Mr Poynton (Grey),"I regret beingof a man named Leviston, who was a subcontractor under Mr Vines, for carrying on the mail service between Rokewood and Ballarat. Mr Vines received from the Government in respect to that service £ 1 6 0 , but paid Leviston only £ 7 2 per annum. Mr Vines, after receiving notice from the Postmaster-General, transferred all these contracts but two, one of theexceptions being that which was being carried out by Leviston. He waited on Leviston, and asked him, in the event of the contract being transferred to him, to sign a sub-agreement which -would entitle him to receive £ 1 0 8 per annum for doing the work for which Vines was to draw £ 1 6 0 . Leviston was also requested to give Mr break this contract. Vines authority to draw the money from the Department until the termination of the contract. Let it be said, to the honour of Mr Leviston, that he refused to do anything of the kind. The matter was brought under the notice of the Postmaster General, who gave Mr Vines notice that unless the contract was transferred within so many days it would be forfeited. He disregarded the notice, and the contract was forfeited. Shortly after this took place Mr Vines served a notice on Leviston, through a Ballarat solicitor named McGowan, claiming £ 5 0 for breach of contract. Mr Leviston, who is still conducting the mail service, upon making an application to Mr Vines for his last monthly payment of £ 6 , met with a refusal, upon the ground that he had broken his contract. I have every reason to believe that not one of the former sub-contractors to whom the contracts have now been transferred are receiving the f u l l amount which is being paid by the Department. I do not think we should allow what was practically a decision on our part to be disregarded in that manner. ject of legal proceedings, why does the honourable member refer to it at this stage? some action should be taken in regard to it. We should not allow a man to suffer because he had the moral courage to resist an attempt to make him sign an agreement which was intended to defeat the object the Postmaster-General had in view in requiring the transfer of the contracts. Further, I think that we should cause the f u l l General can suggest any way out of the difest inquiry to be made into the conditions under which all the contracts were transferred. I believe that inquiry would reveal the fact that not one of these men are receiving the amount which the Government are paying for the carriage of mails. It is immaterial to me who carries the mails, but I hold that those who perform the work should receive the money which we pay for it. I shall certainly not rest content until this matter has been further investigated. Does not the Postmaster-General think that Mr Leviston is entitled to be paid for the work which he performed during the last month? Does he imagine that this man who has the back-bone to resist the demands of such a strong company, should be"" victimized, or that he should be compelled to incur expense in defending his case in a court of justice? Mr Leviston did not The Postmaster General broke it . If Mr Vines should proceed against any person, it is against the Postmaster-General. But he has not the courage to do that. He prefers to select a poor man whom he has been sweating during the past two-and-a-half years.

From a private conversation which I have had with the Minister, I gather that he is of opinion that this matter is one between Mr Vines and' Mr Leviston. I do not share that view at all. These contracts had to be transferred upon a certain date. They were not so transferred. If Mr Leviston had signed an agreement to do the work for £ 1 0 8 , Mr Vines would have transferred the contract in question. But because he refused to do so, the Postmaster-General was placed in the position of having to forfeit the contract. If the Postmasterficulty, I shall be very glad; If not, I shalf insist upon instituting an inquiry into the whole business, with a view to ascertaining how much Mr Vines is getting.

143,Mr Spence,"I agree with the honorment refuses to supply them with a mail service unless the residents give a certain guarantee. The settlements in question are on mining fields, which give every indication of becoming permanent; but the townspeople for the most part are miners, and have no means of raising the necessary funds, with the result that they have to suffer for want of mail communication. I am not complaining of the general principle that when telephonic communication is desired by the people of a small town or settlement, interest on the cost of erecting the line should be guaranteed ; but I say that the Department goes to extremes. Considerable savings have been effected by the refusal of the Department in many cases to build new post-offices, and also by having what are known as unofficial post-offices. In some cases a saving of £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 per annum is made by having an unofficial instead of an official post-office. A miserable pittance is paid to those who carry out the service, for many persons are ready to undertake the work for a trifling remuneration, believing that it will benefit them in other directions. The savings being made in this way should be sufficient to enable the Department to connect such post-offices by telephone, and I feel confident that the business would be more than sufficient to pay interest on the cost of the construction of the line. I am speaking entirely of the position of affairs in the back country. It would be ridiculous, of course, to say that a telephone service should be provided for every man who asks for it, at the expense of the rest of the community; but I repeat that the Department is refusing applications that might well be considered. I hope that the policy of the Department in regard to both the mail and the telephone service will be more liberal than it has been. Mining settlements sometimes spring up very rapidly, and must reach a stage when it will be absolutely necessary to provide them with official post-offices. My contention is that before that stage is reached the Department should, be prepared to connect such settlements with the telephone system, and that the wires could ultimately be devoted to the purposes of a telegraphic service. occasioned by the adoption of this practice. The pressing demands that are being made for the erection of new post offices are due to the fact that it is only in this way that the people of many settlements can hope to secure the faciliII K ties that they really require. I bone thab the Postmaster-General will look These are two typical cases. into these matters, for they certainly deserve to receive his immediate attention. The matter to which the honourable member for Coolgardie has referred, namely, the reconsideration of the salaries of the Deputy-Postmasters-General who are retiring, should be dealt with by the Minister. This is certainly the right time to review the work of those officials, to ascertain whether it justifies the continuance of the high salaries which were fixed for their offices by the States. The people expected that under Federation there would be a saving in the cost of administering the Postal Department, and while we have no desire to be other than liberal in fixing the salaries of offices which only able men can fill, consideration must be given to the fact that the responsibilities and duties attaching to these offices are not so great now as they were prior to Federation. The Minister might give us some information as to how the classification scheme affects these positions, and express his opinion as to whether there should not be a limit fixed which should not be exceeded. listened very carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for Grey in regard to the case of subletting to which he has drawn attention, and while he has my sympathy, I do not see how the Minister can interfere in the matter. He cannot write to one of the parties and tell him not to sue the other, nor can he ask the Law Courts not to interfere. It would therefore be very foolish to attempt any interference. If rnoney has been paid to Mr Vines ton, I do not see how the Minister can interfere.

Actem. I do not say that guarantees should not be required, but more consideration should be given to the scattered population in our country districts. In the cities people have their letters brought round to their doors three or four times a day, and enjoy other advantages; but in the country the settlers have a very hard time, and their means of communication are poor, so that they need some special consideration with a view to making their conditions easier. Surely the Commonwealth could afford to bear an occasional loss incurred in giving better communication, to those who are engaged in developing our industries in the far interior. There may have been loss under the New South Wales system, but it was a better system for the country than is the present system. I know of cases in which refusals have been justified, because people often ask for what they should not receive; but each, case should be treated on its merits, and when men are prepared to guarantee interest on capital and working expenses, that .guarantee should be accepted. I hope that the Postmaster-General will adopt a forward oolicy, and do all that he can to assist the toilers in the country. which the honourable member for Grey referred has been brought up in this Chamber on previous occasions, on the first and second of which the honourable member for Coolgardie occupied the position of Postmaster' General. ber for Denison was Postmaster-General on the first occasion. sympathy for Mr Leviston 'on the statement of his case presented by the honourable member for Grey, because I thought that he was being unfairly treated.

161,Mr Crouch,"I think that Mr Vines'enough of my duties as a member of the House not to refer to them, seeing that, according to the statement of the honourable member for Grey, legal proceedings were threatened. Mr Vines is no longer a contractor in regard to the particular route affected. He has yielded to the pressure which the Minister, heckled by honourable members, and against his better judgment, brought to bear upon him, and has given up his contract. There are other facts which I could put before the Committee, but they are of a purely private and personal nature, affecting only Mr Leviston and Mr Vines. These are matters with which this House has no right to interfere, and with which the Postmaster-General cannot deal. As legal proceedings have been entered upon, it was unfair for the honourable member for Grey to refer to the case, and we should do well to allow the matter to drop. rect attention to the contribution of £ J 0,000 which has to be paid by the State of Victoria towards the loss incurred in the working of the Pacific Cable. The other States interested-Ne w South Wales and Queensland-eac h have to contribute a similar amount. I find that the actual expenditure last year, under this head, so far as Victoria is concerned, was £10,171. I do not underrate the advantages which were conferred upon the community by the reduction of the cable rates, and I admit that the benefits thus derived afford some compensation for the loss which has to be made up by the various States concerned. At the same time, I should like to know what steps are being taken to place the cable arrangements upon a better business footing. We were promised some timeago that the Pacific Cable Board would shortly meet in London to consider matters connected with the extension of the business, but I understand that no such meeting has been held, partly owing to the fact that Canada has not yet appointed a representative. Surely we should not stand idly by without entering a vigorous protest against the continued delay inconducting the cable business upon sound lines. Without casting any reflection upon the Postal Department, I may mention that it is quite within the knowledge of those who do business with the two cable companies that the arrangements of the rival concern, the Eastern Extension Company, are immeasurably superior, and that no efforts are spared by their officers to secure business. still losing such a large sum of money 1 11 ic 2 annually in connection with the working of the cable is a matter of serious importance to the States, and in the name of the commercial community, and of the public generally, I Would urge that some vigorous effort should be made to induce the Pacific Cable Board to take action that will tend to bring about better results. member suggest? Pacific Cable Board to meet in London, and to appoint private agents to co-operate with the officials of the Post and Telegraph Department here, in offering additional facilities for transacting business. fectly free to do what they conceive to be best to make the cable pay. they have . not taken steps to place -their business here under control of the same efficient character that is exercised over the affairs of the Eastern Extension Company. It is full time that some steps were taken in that direction. I desire to refer to another matter. I find that, according to the Estimates, Victoria will be asked to contribute £22,512 towards the cost of the conveyance of mails to Europe during the current year. I understood that it was expected that some saving would be effected under the poundage system, which is to be brought into operation in the event of no further tenderers for the English mail service coming forward. I should like to know, therefore, whether we may expect any reduction upon the expenditure for last vear. The commercial community of Melbourne view with concern, and even alarm, the prospect of uncertainty in connection with the transmission of our mails to Europe. I know that this matter is, to some extent, beyond the Minister's control, because he is compelled to comply with certain conditions which, in my opinion, wrongly interfere with his administration and prevent him from making the best possible arrangement in the interests of the communitv. I hope that the Minister will see his way to indicate the position in which we m»y expect to find ourselves under the ne'iv arrangement. I desire to know whether &?e are to have a service equal in all respects to the present one, an improved, or an intermittent and irregular service.

The honourable member for Denison, when he was Postmaster-General, was good enough to promise that he would seek the advice of medical men as to the steps that could be taken to protect the users of the telephone against the spread of tubercular and other disease .germs. however, that the changes which have since taken place in the Administration have resulted in the mattey being lost sight of for the present. I would suggest that directions might be given to subscribers as to the means which they should adopt in order to disinfect the telephone transmitters, and that facilities should be offered for obtaining supplies of the necessary materials for this purpose. I am perfectly .sure that the honourable member for Hunter will bear me out when I say that the telephone transmitters are the means of spreading disease, and that .some steps should be taken to get rid of this menace to the public health. desire to direct the attention of the Minister to a matter to which I have previously referred, namely, the' rates of pay given to casual employees. Honourable members have distinctly expressed the opinion, which I believe was placed on record, that casual employees should be paid at least the same wages as were received by the permanent employees whose places they had taken. That rule, however, is not being observed in some of the branches of the postal service. I believe that such casual employees as porters and mail-cart drivers are not being paid the same rates as are given to permanent hands. I trust that the Minister will make f u l l inquiries, to insure that the casual employees shall not be required to work for less pay, or for longer hours than permanent hands engaged in the same occupations. There has always been a tendency in Victoria to employ as many temporary hands as possible at rates considerably below the permanent scale, and thus effect a saving in the public expenditure. This should not be encouraged. We have fixed ^ 1 1 0 as the minimum wage for permanent employees, and we should not allow that minimum to be disregarded in the case of temporary hands. MrR EDWARDS (Oxley) I endorse to the fullest extent the remarks which have fallen from the honourable member for Kooyong with regard to the Pacific Cable. The loss incurred in connection with that service falls upon three States only. Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, are each required to contribute £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . a loss as the result of a portion of the cable business having been diverted to the Pacific route. I am afraid, Australia is not called upon to contribute towards the actual loss incurred in carrying on that service. I do not see any reason why Queensland, with her comparatively small population, should be called upon to contribute in the same proportion as New South Wales and Victoria. No doubt those members of the community who find it necessary to use the cable have derived great benefit from the reduction in the rates. At the same time, I am of opinion that all the States should share in the loss, which will be sustained upon that work for some years'to come, according to population. I maintain that that loss should not f a l l entirely upon New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. I protest against the northern State, with its small population, being required to make the same contribution towards any deficiency upon that undertaking as are the two larger States. honourable member for Oxley has evidently forgotten that it ""was the three States which he has mentioned that entered into the agreement for the laying of the Pacific Cable, despite the protests of the other States. In this connection, I would point out that South Australia suffers a very severe loss upon the Transcontinental telegraph line, owing to the business which is carried by the Pacific Cable. life of trade. refer more particularly to the matter which has been brought forward by the honourable member for Grey. In his piece of special pleading, the honourable and learned member for Corio misstated the position. He overlooked the fact that, in order to avoid the penalties which the Postmaster-General had power to inflict, Mr Vines actually agreed to transfer these contracts to the sub-contractors. That fact, in itself, is an admission that he has been doing something which he was not entitled to do. But after having agreed to transfer those contracts, he is now attempting to rob the' poor sub-contractors. What do we find disclosed by the lawyer's letter which he has sent to Mr Leviston?

Mr Vines declares that the sub-contractor, Mr Leviston, owed him £ 5 0 13s. d . , but that he has reduced 4 that amount to £ 4 4 13s. 4d. by deducting ton owe this amount? Because Mr Vines entered into a contract with the Government to carry the mails at a certain rate. The fact remains, however, that he did not perform the work. He got somebody else to do it for him, for £ 7 2 per annum, and pocketed the difference between that amount and £ 1 6 0 . In my opinion, the duty of the Postmaster-General is clear. He ought to take this matter out of the hands of Mr use of the telephone were reduced, the Vines instantly, and inflict the penalties which are provided under the -Act.

But he has not f u l filled that condition. He is still putting into his pocket, money which does not belong to him, and is threatening Mr Leviston with an action at law which may ruin him. I ask the Postmaster-General-who , I believe, is anxious to do what is fair-to at once determine Mr Vines' contract, inflict the penalties which are provided under the Act, and hand over the contracts to the subcontractors. are some facts with which the Committee are not acquainted. If that be so, I ask the Minister to state them without further delay. gratulate the Commonwealth upon having at the head of the Postal Department a gentleman of such wide experience as our present Postmaster-General. I hope that he will endeavour to reform our postal system root and branch. In a general way, I desire to refer to certain reforms which, in my judgment, are worthy of consideration. I entirely agree with the honourable member for New England in the statement that there is too much centralization in connection with our Post Office system. I believe that the large cities are being favoured at the expense of the country districts. I think that in a country like Australiaa country of such magnificent distances-the telephone should be popularized as much as possible. The best way in which to achieve that object is to cheapen the use -<sf the instrument to the general public. How is it that telephone subscriptions in the country districts are as large as are those in the cities ? In a town which boasts only fifty or sixty subscribers, does a man obtain value for his money when he is required to pay f . & or £ 9 per annum for the use of a telephone-a n amount as large as that which is paid in the city, where there are thousands of subscribers? member should recollect that it costs a lot more to provide country districts with telephonic communication. all citizens of the Commonwealth, and that therefore we should be treated equally. If in the country districts, the charges for the number of subscribers would increase. Take ample. Immediately the fares were lowered, the traffic upon them increased fourfold. Similarly, I maintain that if the charges levied for the use of the telephone in country districts were reduced, the number of subscribers would materially increase. If £ 5 annually were charged for the use of a telephone for business purposes, and £ 3 for a private house connection, the receipts would be very much greater than they are. How is it that in the large hotels of our capital cities, the guests are able to use the telephone for nothing? In London, a guest is not privileged to use the It is just possible that there telephone free of charge whenever he wishes to do so. There, each hotel has a telephone office, and if anybody wishes to make use of it, he is required to pay a certain fee. In one of the leading Melbourne hotels, too, there is a special telephone office which is presided over by an attendant. I cannot understand why numbers of people are allowed to use the telephone without any charge whatever being made. I would also point out that in the telegraph offices in England, one does not find pens, ink, and superfine creamlaid paper provided. Instead, pencils are supplied, and paper of an inferior quality. Why cannot a similar practice be adopted here? I cannot understand how it is that such a difficulty is experienced in obtaining telephonic communication for the country districts. I have received dozens of applications for the establishment of telephone offices in my own electorate, but when I make inquiries regarding them, I am met with the objection that ""the undertaking would not pay."" As a matter of fact, the officers of the Department reported that",36,Bamford Di D Not The Honourable

The Department having supplied them, If a i l to see why they should remain silent. There is another matter to which the Postmaster-General ought to give his serious attention. I refer to the fact that many of our popular newspapers-the Argus, the Age, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Bulletin, and other journals-whic h contain pernicious advertisements, are circulated through the post-office. I think that if the Postmaster-General is worthy of the name of a man he will see that newspapers containing such advertisements are not distributed through the agency of the Department. This is a matter of vital importance. I know how far-reaching these evils are. I know what is the result of the distributtion of such literature throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth; it is a disgrace to the press; and I maintain that it is our duty, and more particularly the duty of the Postmaster-General, to do everything that is possible to put an end to its circulation. or two grievances which I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General. On referring to the classification I find that, would be getting an increase of £ 7 0 . although a certain degree of liberality has been shown in the treatment of postmasters in other States, not one postmaster in Queensland has been granted an increase. The duties of these men are very onerous, and in order that the Committee may judge of their character, I should like to cite a case in point. I have received a letter from a gentleman whose identity I shall not disclose, although I can vouch for the accuracy of the information which he furnishes me, No sooner, howstating that he is a postmaster with a staff of ten men, that over 650,000 postal articles pass through his office every I am satisyear, and that he handles in cash alone £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 per annum. He works from 6 a.m. until after 6 p.m., or a total of seventyI see no reason why the .teletwo hours per week, and he is also Electoral Registrar for twelve .polling places, the rolls relating to which comprise about 10,000 names. cially for his work as Registrar? ceives payment at the usual rate of 2s. 6d. per hundred names, but he has to attend to many matters outside the actual preparation of the rolls. A good deal of the time of a In the West Maitland postpostmaster who acts in this capacity is taken up in attending to inquiries by persons who desire to know whethei their names are on the rolls, and if not, what they are to do in order to secure enrolment. In New South WalesI believe that postmasters have also to take some action regarding electors' rights, which, of course, is a State matter; but the postmaster in Queensland to whom I have referred receives only £ 1 6 2 per annum for discharging his multifarious duties. That is a starvation wage, and is almost a temptation to a man in such a position to help himself. Under the State regulations he had to give a fidelity guarantee for £ 4 0 0 , but latterly the Department has called upon him to increase his guarantee to £ 7 0 0 . I think that the Committee will admit that a little more than £ 1 6 2 per annum should be paid to a man holding an office which entails so many duties, such long hours, and so much responsibility. service ? am personally acquainted with him, and know that he is deserving of better trearthe Public Service Commissioner, or he with which I hope we shall deal when the classification scheme is under our consideration. It is, to say the least, singular, as the honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, that whilst certain officials immediately under the eye of the Public Service Commissioner have received increases, others who occupy positions that are equally responsible, have been overlooked.

183,Mr Bamford,"That is a matterthe postmasters in Queensland is worthy of some consideration. The representatives of that State, however, are placed in a somewhat invidious position. We are aware that our constituents are lacking many requirements, and I have repeatedly brought many of these matters under the notice of the Department; but at the same time we know that the Government of the State are appealing to the Government of the Commonwealth to keep down expenditure. We have to do what we conceive to be our duty, and to secure such conveniences as we believe to be necessary 'for our constituents ; yet, even in .pressing just claims, we feel that we are to a certain extent emthe present, my request has not been combarrassing thefinancesof the State. That is a very illogical position for honourable members to occupy, but in any case, there are many conveniences to which the people of Queensland are certainly entitled. I have interviewed several Postmasters General, as well as the Secretary of the Department, on many occasions in regard to the necessity for a telephone line to Ebagoolah. miles from the main line, and as it is a populous place, its claim to be connected with the telephone system is certainly a good one. master-General is taking into consideration the advisableness of using trees, fences, or any other suitable object for supporting telephone and telegraph wires in outlying districts. izing trees in that way in Tasmania for twenty-five years. that respect, at any rate, the people of Tasclaims upon the Government, owing to the mania are certainly up-to-date. The failure to cheapen the system has been due not so much to the Department itself as to the engineers. When loan moneys were plentiful in Queensland the engineers had the idea that all the material used must be of the very best quality. They would not allow anything but iron poles and wires of. a certain gauge to be used in the construction of these lines, and all work had to be carried out in the most elaborate way. Whilst at Chillagoe recently, I noticed that the tops of the trees had been cut off, and insulators placed on the trunks, which served the purpose of telegraph poles. The line in some places was inclined to be something in the nature of a zig-zag, but it answered its purpose. I compliment the Postmaster-General on his expressed intention to resort to this practice in erecting telephone lines in sparsely populated districts, where it is impossible to have the most up-to-date material. When the honourable member for Hunter referred to the chimes in the post-office tower at West Maitland, I could not help thinking that it was remarkable that the residents of large centres in New South Wales and Victoria should have such extravagant notions in regard to clocks and chimes, when for nearly two years I have sought in vain to induce the Postal Department to supply a very simple clock, at a cost of 30S., for a Post-office in a populous district, where it is much needed. Up to plied with.

That town is only twelve were to provide everything which is necessary for their constituents, at their own expense, the starvation wage to which the honourable member for Darwin sometimes refers, I understand that the Postwould not go very far. The Postmaster General is taking a very wise step in regard to cheapening the telephone service, and there can be no doubt that the cheapening of this and other services would lead to a large increase in business. As I have already said, although there are many works,' such as post-office buildings and defence works which we require in Queensland, we feel a certain hesitancy in pressing our unfortunate financial position of the State. It is to be hoped that circumstances will so alter before very long that we -shall be in a position to demand the carrying out of these works with a greater degree of assurance that they will not press unduly upon the finances of the State Treasurer. I believe that not only the Treasurer, but the Premier of Queensland occasionally asks that the expenditure of the Commonwealth shall be cut down, and it is only natural, in the circumstances, that they should do so; but there are certain requirements to which the people are justly entitled, regardless of the financial exigencies of the moment. draw the attention of the Minister to the delay which occurs in carrying out improvements and other public works under the administration of the Postal Department.",38,Bamford Di D Not The Honourable

For a period of twelve months attempts have been made to get certain necessary alterations made there, and a huge mass of correspondence on the subject has piled up, but nothing has been done. Newcastle is the second town of importance in New South Wales, and its post-office does a busiwhich are absolutely prohibitive.

I have no particular complaint to make on the subject of telephone extensions, but I agree with other honourable members that the New South Wales system was preferable to that adopted by the Commonwealth Administration. I think that every telephone installation placed in the Newcastle district since the inauguration of the Commonwealth has paid handsomely. When a town of 10,000 or 12,000 inhabitants asks for a telephone system, the Department should -have no hesitation about complying with its request, particularly since the lines which have been erected during the past twelve months are returning a handsome profit. Persons in the country districts are deprived of the advantages which those who live in the city enjoy, and the least we can do is to improve their means of communication.

I should like to give the Committee an example of the length to which red tape can be stretched by the officials of the Postal Department. The regulations provide that no trunk telephone line shall be constructed by the Department unless the officials are satisfied that it will pay. The officer who has to deal with the matter usually makes a guess at the probable receipts, and if he thinks that the line will not pay, he reports accordingly to the Postmaster-General, and the Department then imposes conditions ton is a pretty big town in the western district of Victoria, and is growing rapidly. Its residents recently asked for the erection of a trunk line"" from Hamilton to Ballarat, a distance of 124 miles, which would place them in communication with Ballarat, Geelong, and Melbourne. If that line were made, the through line from Hamilton to Melbourne would be the longest in Victoria, and possibly in Australia. .The Department, however, came to the conclusion -the reasons are not given-that the It would reline would not pay. I do not object to that, but ' I object to the absurd conditions which it would impose, should the people of Hamilton desire to go further. It assumes not only that the line will not pay, but that for seven years after its construction it will not earn a penny, and requires a cash deposit covering maintenance, interest, and sinking fund, equalling 10 per cent, of the cost of the line, and the total cost of operating it for a period of two years, with a guarantee from approved persons of £ 3 1 0 a year for five years more, to provide against any subsequent deficiency. compared with one which I know of. the Department. There is a telegraph line from Hamilton to Ballarat, so that the Department would be put to no cost in erecting poles for a telephone line. If a reasonable guarantee were asked for, the money would be forthcoming in a week, because, those who wish for the connection are men of substance ; but a deposit of £ 6 2 0 , and a subsequent guarantee of £310* per annum for five years is out of the question. Some radical change must be made in this matter. It is of no use to leave it entirely to officials. If a.Minister is content to initial the minutes placed before him by them he will be useless. What he should do is to shake the Department out of the rut into which it has got.

I look forward to the time, which I think is approaching, when it will be made self-supporting. I do not desire that less facilities should be afforded, but I trust that by the consolidation of the post and telegraphic business under one control, great savings eventually be effected. In view of the fact that the revenue for the present year is expected to reach the large sum of £2,560,000, it is somewhat surprising that any loss should be involved in carrying on the business of the Department. I find, however, that the expenditure is estimated at £2,813,713, or £ 2 5 3 , 7 1 3 more than the anticipated income. correct the statement days ago to the effect that Victoria occupied the best position as regards this Department. and that South Australia is the only one of the States which shows a profit. current year the loss in New South Wales will amount to £ 4 3 , 5 4 0 ; in Victoria, to £ 3 9 , 1 3 1 ; in Queensland, to the large sum of £ 1 2 8 , 1 9 4 ; in Western Australia, to £ 3 9 , 8 1 0 ; and in Tasmania, to £ 1 2 , 9 1 1 ; glad to say, the income is larger than it has whereas South Australia is (expected to have a surplus of £ 2 , 6 7 3 . Sir spite of the reduction of the telegraph rates. the business of the Commonwealth, including the appropriations for the erection of new works and buildings, shows a deficiency of £ 2 5 3 , 7 1 3. It is not pleasant to reflect that this loss is increasing, year after year. Leaving out the year 1901-2, which does not lend itself to the purposes of comparison, because very few new works were carried out during that period, we find that the loss in 1902-^ amounted to £ 1 6 4 , 1 1 6 ; and in 1903-4, to £ 1 8 7 , 3 4 1 ; whilst during the current year it is expected that the deficiency will represent the amount I . have already stated. No doubt some portion of this deficiency is due to the extent to which the cost of new works and buildings is charged against revenue. £ 3 5 > 6 99 was spent in this direction, and I in 1903-4, £ 1 8 7 , 7 7 2 ; whilst this year provision is made for an outlay of £ 2 1 7 , 6 4 8 . the whole of the deficiency. is estimated at £ 2 5 3 , 7 1 3 ; only about half. expended upon buildings can hardly be regarded as loss. but I am dealing with the whole of the expenditure. honourable gentleman regard the buildings as assets? some extent; but still the money has to be found.

To that extent the position is satisfactory. I have no particular Post and Telegraph Department in my own State. There have been complaints, and there always will be. Western Australia has had an exceptional experience in regard to the Public Service, and the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, inasmuch as a gentleman from one of the other States, without any local knowledge was appointed as the Public Service Inspector ' for our State. No other State has been treated in that way, and however qualified an officer might be, it would be idle to suggest that he could be as intimately acquainted with all the intricacies of the Public Service of Western Australia as would an officer who has been resident there all his life. friends to be placated.

When he sneers at the Public Service of Western Australia, and suggests favouritism, I resent his insinuation It was a misfortune that the inspector appointed to the Public Service of Western Australia was not familiar with the local affairs of that State. Personally, I believe that the officer in question is an excellent one, but from lack of local knowledge he has laboured under a disability, and I am satisfied that as a result the Commonwealth has suffered. Want of knowledge is one of the greatest dangers with which we have to contend.

Twenty years ago the Government of that State erecteda branch telegraph line some ten miles in length to a country town called Maradong.

It certainly must be very small, and there is In this connection I therefore no reason to disturb a system which has been so long in operation. ' The Greenough is in the centre of rich, fertile country, and naturally the residents do not like to forego the convenience which they have enjoyed for many years prior to Federation.

They naturally resent anything of I do not see what the kind being done.

I have a most pronounced aversion for the system upon which the Post and Telegraph Department-including the telephone service-is conducted. Although the Department, as a whole, does not pay, it seems to me that the revenue would be largely increased if greater facilities for telephonic communication with telegraph stations were afforded. Let me deal with the case of a farming district.* I know of a little township called Pleasant Hills, in my electorate, which is twentv miles away from a telegraph station. If there were a telephone line between that township and the station, the farmers of the district would avail themselves of it to send telegrams to various places in reference to their produce and supplies. But sent time, they must undertake a journey of twenty miles. The result is that, exnot transmitted, and the Department in this I have no doubt way is deprived of revenue which it would The Department The right honourable memline will actually pay at the outset.

There is a scattered farming population in the Gobarralong district, to which a telephone line would be of great service; but the Department refuses to construct it. I could also refer the Committee to other cases of a similar character. When an application for the construction of a line is made, the reply usually received is that it would involve a large exDenditure in the purchase of posts'and wires, and that the Department cannot see its way clear to accede to it. Another matter to which I desire to refer, and which is a very sore point with me, is the failure to make provision for the housing of a clock at the Corowa post-office.

I hope that the Minister will not fail to be members the injury done to country districts by depriving them of telephonic communication. 1 think that the people in the country should be given all the conveniences possible, even though occasionally a telephone may not pay. To give another Illustration of bad administration, I would repeat an experience to which I have already referred in this Chamber. I recently had occasion fo send a telephone message* from Sydney to Katoomba. I therefore went to the telephone and rang up the local post office, but as the telephone was not registered for the purpose, the officials would not take my message, and I had to walk a distance of half or three-auarters of a mile under which work of this kind is done. to the office. Then, having paid for the privilege of transmitting my message, I had to place 3d."" in the slot to pay for the use of a bureau telephone, so that altogether I spent is. 6d., when I could Kave sent a telegram for 9d. I wish to impress upon the Minister the need for taking hold of some of these officials by the coat collar and shaking them into altering their rigid rules, so that we may nave a progressive system like that of New Ztealand. There are rriany other matters connected with post-office administration to which I might refer, but I do not intend to say anything more at present. I should not have risen to speak, had I not wished to notice the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan, and to emphasize what has been said by other honourable members about the discontent existing in New South Wales, and, I believe, throughout Australia, in regard to the preThis is an illustration of how unsent state of affairs. wish to discuss to-night the action of the late Government in regard to the mail contracts, or the wisdom or folly of the provision in the Postal Act to which reference was made by the right honourable member for Swan, because I shall have some other opportunity for dealing with those matters more effectually. My object low is to draw attention to several matters connected with postal administration, to which I should like the Postmaster-General to give consideration. In New South Wales many country post-offices are conducted by The administration of the unofficial postmasters, whose services are valued by the amount of revenue earned by the office of which they have charge, rather than by the extent and the nature of impressed iby what honourable their duties. I know of cases in wli cn ; have pointed out as to these unofficial post-officers are practically sweated by the Department. In one ase an unofficial postmaster has to attend to three telephones, and during a visit not exceeding an hour in duration I have known him to be required to answer one or other of these telephones at least three times. About 4,000 letters pass through the office. 800 messages are sent by telephone to the nearest telegraph office to be transmitted as telegrams, and 400 telegraphic messages are received, the revenue of the office being £180 a year. That amount, however, is not an indication of the value of the ser' vices performed. I maintain that regard should also be paid to the surroundings The case I have mentioned is not an isolated one. I could refer to a number of others which are equally hard. When the Post Office was under State control, the rules were not so hard-and-fast as they are at present, and manv of these men would have been made official postmasters, and would be in receipt of salaries more commensurate with their services.

336,Mr Webster (Gwydir),"I do notnot be forgotten that, in addition to its direct revenue, the Post Office returns a large indirect revenue to the Commonwealth and it must not be viewed too much from the financial stand-point. Our circumstances are very different from those of Continental countries, where there is a large population and an immense amount of business to be done within a comparatively limited area. Ours is a young country, which is in need of development, and we should assist to develop it by giving every convenience we can to those who settle on the land, so that they may not only remain there, but may induce others to follow their example. be doing our duty to the people of this continent if we permit hard-andfast rules to be drawn which will prevent this assistance being given. The people in the country have to depend entirely upon the post-office, the telephone exchange, and the telegraph office for the transaction of their business, and their success depends very largely upon the proper administration of the Postal Department. Unless we recognise our duty in this matter we shall fall short of our obligations to those whom we represent. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the practice under which officials are sent out to, and are left many years in, arid parts of the country, where there are few of tfie comforts and conveniences of civilization, and they cannot get their children properly educated, while their wives and female relatives suffer from the climate. There should be some provision for the occasional relieving of such officers, and men living under more. comfortable conditions should occasionally be made to exchange places with them. I know one case in which an official, who has proved his worth by his services to the State since he was a boy, was sent into a hot, dry part of the country fourteen years ago, with the result that his wife's health is now almost permanently undermined, while he himself does not enjoy the robust health which he would probably enjoy if differently situated. The Postmaster-General knows how trying the climate is in the western and north-western parts of New South Wales, and I wish to impress upon him the need! for introducing some system which will provide for the occasional relieving of these men. After a man has been two or three years in a disagreeable or unhealthy climate, he should be removed to a more salubrious one, so as to preserve the health' of his wife and children. There should be some such system of exchange, as they have in the Wesleyan body, whose ministers occupy a circuit for only three years, and are then moved on to another. Again, it often happens that a boy obtains a position in the Postal Department at the age of fourteen or fifteen years, and his parents have then to leave the State, to go elsewhere to obtain employment, leaving him behind at an age when he should not be without their care, attention, and guidance. In such cases the boy should be transferred, if possible, to an office near his parents' new home, so that he may remain under their guardianship a little longer. We shall not Several cases of that kind which have come under my notice seem to point to an irrational administration of the Department, without regard to surrounding circumstances. I think that all these matters are worthy of consideration. There is another important matter to which I wish to direct attention. I have taken some trouble to obtain information with regard to the difficulties which surround our telephone system. I find, upon looking through the records of the Department, that in 1901-2 conferences of the principal electrical officers of the Commonwealth were held in Adelaide and Melbourne with a view to advising the Postmaster-General upon the most economical and practicable system of working our telephone system. It would be idle for any honourable member to pose as an expert authority on telephone matters, but I think it may be interesting to honourable members to have placed before them some of the information contained in the report of the electrical officers who met in conference. It is stated that in Germany, Switzerland, and England, it has been found' impracticable to carry on the telephone systems upon terms and conditions similar to those which apply throughout the Commonwealth. They came to the conclusion that in order to carry on their services economically, it was necessary to introduce the toll or call system. In some cases telephones were almost continuously in use, whilst in others the subscribers only occasionally rung up the Exchange, and it was considered unfair to make' a uniform annual charge for the use of a telephone irrespective of the'extent to which it was availed of. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the toll system under which a subscriber pays according to the number of messages he sends. The English and German scales differ somewhat. registering the number of calls made by the subscribers ? automatic register, because there is no means of discriminating between calls which are answered and those which are not. The system adopted was to place officers at the telephones for a given period, and to check the number of calls, distinguishing between those which are replied to and those which are not answered, and to then strike an average. It has been found that this works out very well, and with fairness to subscribers. The members of the Convention in their report say :It may be urged in favour of the toll system that it is more equitable than the flat system of uniform rales of subscription, inasmuch as the charge is based on the extent to which the exchange is used; moreover, under the toll system the wear and tear, cost of attendance, and all working charges are reduced, seeing lhat each subscriber will economize, as much as possible, in the use made of the service. Not only will reduced wear and tear result, but the attendants will be able to deal with more subscribers and give a quicker service than under a flat rate giving unlimited service for a fixed uniform charge. In England the charge is id. per call up to 1,500, £d. per call from 1,500 to 3,000, and is. 6d. per 100 for any calls beyond that number. charge of Jd. per call is made, and no limit is fixed to the number of calls which may be made. It has been found necessary to increase the charge to subscribers in accordance with the number of subscribers who may 'be connected with any particular service. As the number of subscribers increases so the charges advance. Where what is known as the flat system, now in force in the Commonwealth, prevails, the charges are much higher than those which prevail here. It is highly desirable that subscribers should be called upon to pay in proportion to the extent to which they use their telephones, and that something should be done' to deter subscribers from making use of the telephones for other than legitimate purposes. One of the great complaints made in New South Wales-and I have no doubt that the same thing would apply to other States-is that a great deal of the time of the attendants at the switch-board is taken up by people who gossip over the lines. It is calculated that if the toll system were adopted, only one-half of the present number of calls would be received, and that the volume of serious business transacted would be just as great if not greater. The unnecessary messages which are sent over the lines not only entail extra work upon the attendants, but also greater wear and tear upon the telephones. The report of the experts points to the necessity for a radical change in our telephone system. If we introduced the toll system, we should make subscribers pay in proportion to the use they make of their telephones. The telephone subscribers obtain wonderful value for their money, and large business houses could not grumble if they were called upon to subscribe upon a higher scale than at present. If the toll system were introduced, the instruments would not be used for other than legitimate purposes. Subscribers who only occasionally used their instrument's would be placed upon a fairer footing, and we should have far less wear and tear upon our telephones. If we were able to cheapen the service, we should popularize it, and at the same time make it yield a profit. At present also a great deal of time is taken up by the misuse of the telephone by friends of subscribers. guard against that. difficult to enforce it. The only system by In Switzerland a uniform which we can check abuses is that which I have indicated. The report from which I have quoted is a very valuable one, and I earnestly commend it to the attention of the MinisterI f he will take this matter in hand, and introduce a more satisfactory system, I shall give him my hearty support, and shall consider that he has justified his occupancy of his position. The Minister has intimated that he intends to introduce a new system which will do away with the heavy charges now imposed upon subscribers to country telephone systems. WhilstI heartily approve of any scheme which will afford relief to the man in the lonely bush, I know that the Postmaster General will experience difficulties in giving effect to any such scheme. Should he adopt the suggestion that in country districts telephone wires should be run along the tops of fences, we shall require to throw the whole cost of maintaining these lines upon the people whom they serve. Othewise, endless trouble will be created. The experiment which has been outlined, constitutes a step in the right direction. These temporary wires will demonstrate whether the Department would be justified in erecting",54,Langdon Bonython Tha T Is In Fault To Find With The Administration Of The

340,Mr Webster,"Yes; but it is very* permanent lines, and from that point of view alone, the innovation suggested seems to be a desirable one. partment is one in which a man of brains can initiate reforms which are very sadly needed. At present, I find that differential treatment is being meted out by the Department to various towns throughout the Commonwealth. Thus, in the Richmond River district, Lismore receives different treatment from Grafton. The former has communication with Ballina and Coraki, but subscribers are subjected to no special charge in this connection. /The same practice, however, is not observed at Grafton. I think that the Postmaster-General might very well investigate existing anomalies in country districts In the Sydney metropolitan area, there are something like 5,000 telephones, and subscribers are called upon to pay £ 8 a year for the use of the exchange there. tricts, however, subscribers are required to pay the same fee, although they have not nearly the same conveniences. As a matter of fact, the towns in the country districts at present receive very different treatment from that which they received prior to Federation. Formerly, fire brigades were connected with the telephone exchange free of charge. Now, however, they have been cut off by the Postal Department. ceived a letter from the Grafton Fire Brigade, asking me to interview the Minister with a view to preventing it from being deprived of telephonic communication. (However, I have since learned that the brigade-station has been cut off from the exchange. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. The canegrowers in the northern portion of New South Wales strongly object to telegraph poles being erected in their cane-fields. I know of one instance in which the poles were placed practically in the middle of the cane crop. I think that in future the Minister might see that they are erected along the road. Honourable members will admit that our farmers already suffer from sufficient disabilities. Yet, we find that the moment a request is made for telephonic communication by a new settlement, the Postal Department sends the applicants a form, setting out an estimate of the cost of the work. It actually deters the people from asking for these facilities. Where settlers are some nine or ten miles distant from a doctor, telephonic communication is nothing short of a boon. I claim that it would be wise not to frighten the people by imposing these high charges, but to make an endeavour to popularize the telephone as far as possible. say a word or two upon the point which has been raised by the honourable member for Cowper. The treatment which has been meted out to the country districts in regard to telephonic communication is unjust. Around Melbourne and Sydney people are able to communicate by telephone for a distance of twenty miles or more without paying anything more than the annual fee. The ordinary interpretation of the term "" trunk line "" is from exchange to exchange. In the metropolitan districts no such interpretation is placed upon that term; but if residents in the country districts desire to In the country disobtain a mile of telephone wire, it is regarded as a trunk line, and, as a result, special rates rule upon it. There ought not to be one procedure in the case of our great cities, and another in that of the rural districts. I am hopeful that some reform will yet be effected in this connection. It is not right So ask, as a concession, that one should be able to talk upon a trunk, line, over great distances, without payment of some special charge. WhatI have suggested is that in districts where there is a community ot interests, that fact should be recognised, and subscribers should be allowed to communicate without any trunk line rates being levied within the district. It is unjust that a resident of Sydney or Melbourne should be able to talk over long distances without paying any additional fee when a person in the country cannot speak upon a wire which happens to cross a river, as at Grafton, without being called upon to pay for the use of a trunk line. But in our anxiety to obtain all that we can for our constituents, we ought not to forget that this matter has a commercial basis. Any ""district which is prepared to guarantee a return of 10 per cent, upon the cost of construction to meet all charges, should be provided with telephonic communication. We all know that the telephone has accomplished a great work in every part of the world. It should accomplish a great work in Australia.

344,Mr Ewing (Richmond),"I desire to the White Ocean policy. In dealing with the question of black labour, to which his attention was drawn by the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan, he said that although the French and German liners employed white crews they received no greater subsidy than did the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Gompanies. I desire to place before the Committee a few facts with regard to the matter. The Peninsular and Oriental Company receives £ 8 5 , 0 0 0 per annum for its Australian service, while the Orient Company receives a similar subsidy -On the other hand, the North German line receives a subsidy of £1.15,000 per annum for its Australian service, while the French line-the Messageries Maritimes Company-ha s an annual subsidy of £ 1 2 4 , 0 0 0 in respect of its Australian and New Caledonian service. It will thus be seen that the English services are granted' a much lower subsidy in the aggregate than are either the German or French lines. But the fairest way to state the case is to take the rate of subsidy per mile. For their Australian service the North German Lloyd Company receive 6s. 8d., and the French service 8s. 4d. per mile run, while the Peninsular and Oriental Company receive only 2s. yd. per mile run. Therefore it is not a fact that the Peninsular and Oriental and the Orient Companies are receiving anything approaching the subsidy paid by foreign Governments to foreign mail steamers on our coast.

He spoke as if the big English shipping companies were philanthropists, and sent their vessels here to assist us in developing with the wreck of the Quetta. I was in our industries, whereas, if it did not pay them to carry our butler and other products, they would not send their vessels here. Steam Navigation Company at one time refused to enter into negotiations for a new mail tender, except at an exorbitant rate, and so extortionate were their demands that Mr afterwards Sir Charles, Lilley, cabled to London, and ordered two steamers, of which the Governor Blackall was one, to enable the Government to carry' its own mails. The company, seeing he was in earnest, gave way, and eventually had not only to accept his terms, but to buy the boats as well. Commonwealth might make arrangements for the transmission of its mails on steamers of its own, manned by white labour. Great Britain subsidizes only vessels which are so constructed that, in times of war, they can be used as cruisers; and, if we took the matter in hand, we might obtain vessels which could not only be used as cruisers, but would provide proper accommodation for the carriage of our products at the right temperatures, which is not done now, and would give opportunities for the training of Australians in naval pursuits. If such action was threatened by the Government, it would bring the present companies to their bearings. They think that the Government are in a hole, and a combination has been formed to extort as much as they can for the carriage of our mails. I do not see much difference between having railways for the conveyance of goods on land under the control of a Government, and having vessels for the transit of goods, by water under such control. I see no reason why we should not run our own steamers for the purpose of carrying our produce to foreign markets in proper condition, and at reasonable rates. I do not think that the right honourable member for Swan was quite sincere in his references to the advantages attaching to the employment of black crews. that we should be consistent, and that if we would not send our mails by steamers manned by black labour, we should not travel by them. not proved very successful, so far as our mercantile marine is concerned. I remember very well the incident mentioned by the honourable member for Hume in connection Northern Queensland at the time, and I can assure honourable members that the circumstances connected with that wreck were In Queensland the old Australian not very creditable to the black crew. Not only were the boats rushed by the black members of the crew, but many unfortunate women and children, who were clinging on to pieces of wreckage, were thrown off in order to make room for lascars. lar character could be quoted against white seamen. recently on the American coast. MrM c DONALD I would sooner have a white man than a black man at any time, and I think we can point with pride to the manner in which British seamen have acted in times of shipwreck. of the honourable member's remark? MrM c DONALD It has been stated that black crews are just as good as white crews. upon that point. orable members have. It is astonishing that whenever the question of obtaining cheap labour comes up for discussion, some honourable members take advantage of the opportunity to decry white labour. We have been told that our white seamen are loafers, drunkards, and the scum of the earth. I say that they are nothing of the kind, but that, on the contrary, they are as good men as are to be found upon the face of the earth. I trust that the Minister will give attention to the various matters which I have brought under his notice, and that the remedy will be applied as early as possible. Progress reported.
