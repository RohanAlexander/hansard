It is interesting that the particular matter we are debating this morning was actually tabled quite a long time ago. The formal report, New directions in Australia's overseas aid program, the ministerial policy paper and the fifth annual report to parliament on Australia's development cooperation program, is dated February 1995, and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs( Mr Bilney) of course made his statement on 2 March 1995. So we are actually almost six months down the track. My understanding is that a number of things have in fact moved on since this report was tabled and, therefore, we are talking a little about some history but also about a very active area at the present time. It seems to me that this whole area of overseas aid and Australia's development cooperation program is one that could almost have the subtitle of 'It isn't as simple as it seems'. The reason I say that is that most Australians would be kindly disposed towards our overseas aid effort: both the taxpayer funded money that comes from the government and also the money that is collected from the public. When you look at some of the public subscriptions that go on, the vast amounts of money that are pumped into many of those NGOs and the money that is then spent overseas, the Australian public is, by and large, very generous, and there have been a number of issues during the course of this year that have brought these matters very much to newsworthy attention. In spite of that good intention and considerable support, the reality of how you spend that money and where you spend that money-and, in fact, the problems of actually being able to spend that money in the way that one would like to see it do the good that it is intended to do-can often be very difficult indeed. It is perhaps indicative that, even in this relatively slim document, the actual tabled reportwhich is in three sections: 'Recent developments in Australia's aid program', 'New directions in social development in the aid program' and 'New directions in humanitarian relief in the aid program' -covers a very considerable range of activities. It talks about the South Pacific and PNG; about Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos; and about Africa. It also talks about the social sector and cross-sectoral developments, the environment, micro-enterprise development, private sector linkages, refugees and relief programs, the NGO program, volunteers, research, aid effectiveness, policy frameworks and so forth. So it is a very complex area. Minister Bilney, in his speech, probably encapsulated what the government is on about at the moment, and I will talk a bit about some of my views. But I think we need to understand where the government sees itself as going. He encapsulated it when he said in his statement to the House that the government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three major components: firstly, encouragement of sustainable economic growth; secondly, investment in",137,Committees Ordinary Australians

I do not think there would be too many of us who would argue with those as principles and aims. It is important that we recognise the efforts that Australia does make as a nation, and it is important that there is a degree of continuity between governments and a degree of crossparty support for many of these things. But I do have to chide the government at least gently on one particular matter that is in this report: the statement made in the report that claims that we are now ranked 13th amongst the 22 OECD donors in terms of aggregate aid volume. Our aid currently stands at 0.33 per cent of GNP, substantially better than the 0.3 per cent figure for OECD donors combined, says the report. In his statement the minister also claims that we are one of only four of those 22 nations which spent a bit more money in the last financial year than we did in previous financial years. However, given that most people who take an interest in this sector would like to think that we are moving ever closer to the accepted international target of 0.7 per cent, and we are not even halfway there at the moment, that is a matter for regret. The government prides itself on improving aid substantially and moving in that direction. It has had 12 years in which to achieve that figure. When you measure success against those real targets, it is somewhat disappointing. I am not going to stand here and make some outrageous claim that the coalition, when it wins the next election, is suddenly going to go to 0.7 per cent, but I would certainly hope that we would all work towards getting governments of whichever persuasion to up the amount of money that we contribute. One of the things that has happened to me since this report came out is that I have become much more closely associated with this area. The House will be aware that the minister has set up a advisory committee called COPAC, the Code of Practice Advisory Committee, for non-government organisations-NGOs-particularly for those that operate overseas. This is an area that is often fraught with some difficulty and the recent CARE case has highlighted that difficulty. But there are not only the concerns that were raised by the particular instance of CARE; there has also been an Industry Commission inquiry. The Industry Commission report, although it has not yet been publicised, as I understand it, is likely to raise a number of concerns. The Industry Commission was looking at not only those charities that function overseas, but also charities that work at home. The Industry Commission was looking at the whole question of accountability and accounting and reporting and those sorts of issues. That will involve changing federal legislation and coordinating those changes with the states. The minister has set up this committee and it is charged with providing a code of practice in the short term until the Industry Commission can come up with a more viable longer term process. I do not propose this morning to canvass the issues being considered by that committee or what that committee is likely to find. It is going to report to the minister on 31 August and so it would be inappropriate for me to talk about that committee and its deliberations before that. AllI will say is that I have found the process of taking evidence and working on that committee to be very educative. It seems to me that there are a number of issues to consider. This is why at the start of my comments I made the remark that, when you talk about aid, it is not as simple as it seems. There are a number of issues that come to mind, not least of which is that many governments and private organisations, when they go overseas and try to provide aid to countries in need, Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 311 often encounter this very difficult dichotomy of paternalism versus providing some long-term help, some self-help. They try to set in place sustainable improvements rather than just give handouts and then walk away and find that the mountain falls in straight afterwards. There are simple problems of accounting. What accounting standards do you use? What exchange rates do you use? Do you send your money via some international headquarters? Does it lose value on its way through that headquarters to its final destination? Do you burden aid organisations, particularly the volunteer ones, with onerous administrative and accounting requirements and reporting requirements? Bear in mind that with many of those organisations we are not just talking about government grants; we are talking about organisations that get tax deductibility and, therefore, it is a charge on the taxpayer. Many of those organisations would find that onerous reporting requirements would detract from their direct work. How do you deal with donations in kind? How do you define how much of your budget, in an aid organisation, is going to be spent on administration? What is administration? I am reminded by the Fred Hollows Foundation, for example, that they spend much of their money in this country on research and then, having perhaps in the current financial year spent a large amount of their income on research and developed some new minute lenses, they will set up factories in overseas countries and produce them relatively cheaply in order to put their programs in place on the ground, whereas other organisations may have a far higher proportion of their funds going directly overseas every year. Late last year I had the opportunity, as part of a study tour, of visiting Thailand and Indonesia. World Vision were very good in setting up a number of visits for me whilst I was overseas. I might mention that World Vision moved from their old headquarters in Melbourne to a new headquarters and only made one mistake with their new headquarters-they put it literally on the other side of the road from the boundary of my electorate. If they had been on the other side of the particular road they would have been in my electorate and, of course, that would have been great. Nevertheless, I am sure that the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) is pleased to have them. As I said, with the assistance of World Vision when I went overseas I was able to go and look at not only what they were doing, but also some of the things that the Australian government was doing overseas. For example, in ThailandI travelled up to Chiang Mai in the north, and from Chiang Mai, having visited some hospitals and organisations in the town, I went out into the country, into the hills in northern Thailand where the AIDS problem is absolutely horrendous. I think there are few people in this country who understand that, in places like northern Thailand, the incidence of AIDS is running at about 20 per cent amongst the women-and this is quite young women, as well. Therefore there is a tremendous amount that needs to be done. The Thai government was very slow indeed in coming to grips with this and it is Australian aid that is starting to make some impact on the AIDS issue in Thailand. In Indonesia, one goes to Jakarta and hears from the government about some of the wonderful things the government says it is doing for its country. But, in fact, I went just to the outskirts of Jakarta and saw aid programs where they were installing basic facilities, such as water, in ordinary housing. I went and visited young boys and girls who would not have been going to school if it had not been for Australian aid being pumped into that country. I went up to Bandung in the hills and saw an official Australian aid project helping to sort out MC 312 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 and rationalise the control of the railway system. My concern there, I have to say, was that once Australian expertise was withdrawn I was not too sure how long that system would actually stand up. What worried me, having seen those things in Indonesia, was that I was also taken by my hosts to see the Indonesian aircraft factory where billions of dollars are being spent to produce an aeroplane that is hardly commercial, to be honest. Billions of dollars in high technology and equipment are being spent to try to leapfrog that country into the technological age-and not very successfully-when basics are not being put in place for their own population. Three or four years ago I went to Tonga as part of a delegation to the South Pacific Forum. Again, it seemed to me that, whilst a lot of our aid money was going to buy Mercedes for relatively junior bureaucrats, every primary school I went to did not have a decent waste water or guttering system. While there is a place for humanitarian aid and there is a place for enterprise development, it seems to me that the amount of money and how best we spend that money are, in fact, major problems. There are difficulties of disposal and it seems to me that we have not yet got the process right. Nevertheless, having said that, I think we have to continue to try. As time goes by and we develop better ways of making sure our money actually reaches the target, I am sure we will start to give people back some self-respect and some hope for the future in many of these developing countries. I conclude by saying that earlier this month I was in Malaysia. Malaysia, of course, is a country that no longer takes aid from us and has made giant strides in the last couple of decades. It seems to me that we should be aiming to get many of the countries that we are currently helping to that stage where they can in fact help themselves. pleasure, too, to follow the honourable member for Aston( Mr Nugent), whose continuing interest in this area I have noticed for some years. I compliment him on the work that he has done. He has a genuine concern about poverty in developing countries and about ways of encouraging economic development in developing countries and that is very valuable. I welcome this debate, too, because it arises from a recommendation made by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in a report on overseas aid about six years ago. In that report we proposed not only that this statement be made to parliament every year but that it be debated in parliament. Even though the debate is overdue, it is better that it happen now than not at all. I also welcome the content of the statement itself. I think it is a very valuable statement. I want to speak in two parts: firstly, about the statement itself fairly briefly; and secondly, about the overall context of financial flows to developing countries in trying to broaden out that concept a bit. The first thing to be said about this statement is that it demonstrates how extraordinarily disappointing Australia's aid performance is. That is not to say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs( Mr Bilney) have not struggled valiantly to increase our aid flows and that their achievement has not been significant. The fact is that, in each of the last two years, Australia's aid budget has increased by about $80 million, and that is a not inconsiderable amount. But it does remain true that our total aid contribution is now 0.33 per cent of our GDP, that the",139,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Langmore (Fraser) (10.15 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. It is aWednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC313 global target for aid is 0.7 per cent and that the average contribution of aid from donor countries-from the 20 donor countries-is in fact 0.46 per cent. This figure is constantly distorted. What happens is that what is presented is a weighted average which weights aid from the United States in relation to its GDP, and Japan in relation to its GDP. It is not a simple arithmetic average. So we get the figure quoted that the weighted average is 0.3, which is true, but that is not a realistic figure. The realistic figure-the proper, accurate figure-is 0.46 per cent and, at 0.33 per cent, Australia is far below that. That means that two-thirds of other countries are providing more aid than Australia as a proportion of their GDP. Some, of course, like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands-France evenaverage, but the other three Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and, in fact, most of the social democratic countries of Europe are providing considerably more than that average. Even Canada, until this year, has been providing about that average 0.45 per cent. So we are constantly given a distorted view. This is not entirely the fault of our own Treasury and the other economic fundamentalists. It is the convention within the DAC, the Development Assistance Committee, of the OECD. It obviously suits the countries that give less, particularly the United States, whose performance is absolutely abominable-down to 0.15 per cent in the most recent figures I have seen. It is disgraceful. A high proportion of funds go to Egypt and Israel. Egypt, of course, does need the funds, but it is a very distorted and politically biased aid program. The performance of the United States is shocking. Japan's has been improving, actually, and is quite useful. Our performance is something we should be ashamed of. That is not to say, by the way, that the opposition, I fear, would do any better. At the last election the opposition was saying that it would cut the aid budget by $200 million, which was an appalling proposal. This is not at all a partisan point I am making. I am making a point about the level of Australian generosity towards people living in absolute poverty. We must remember that a quarter of the global population-I.3 billion people-are living in absolute poverty. That means that at the end of every day they are still hungry, they do not have an adequate place to live, they are inadequately clothed, their lives are disrupted, dislocated, cramped and confined, and their personal potential is not fulfilled because they lack the basic requirements for a good life. We sometimes blame 19th century Britain for the inequities that Dickens demonstrated so vividly in his novels, but we have those inequities writ even larger on our television screens, and yet we do not adequately respond. That is not to say that some people do not respond generously-they do, as the honourable member for Aston said. There is a tradition amongst millions of Australians of contributing generously to voluntary aid programs. Well over $100 million is contributed annually to those programs. One of the interesting features of the statement that we are debating is the report on a survey of public attitudes to development assistance. It reports that the majority of respondents thought the level of Australia's overseas aid should be either increased or maintained at current levels. That is an encouraging reflection of community attitudes. However, I emphasise that our own performance is something about which we should be ashamed and that we are not, in any sense, responding to the intensity of the need.",142,Representatives Main Committee

Actually, Finland is 0.45, so it is about on theMC 314 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 Having made that point as strongly as I can, I now go on to the orientation of this statement. I think the orientation is excellent. It is a very valuable statement. It demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the uses of our aid and to the regional destinations of our aid. It talks particularly, for example, about the South Pacific region and Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, where there is great poverty, and about Africa, which is the greatest centre of poverty in the world. Then it talks about the particular areas to which aid will be given. The report also has a very good section on social development. I particularly draw attention in that to the way in which the present minister has upgraded the population program. Probably the most cost effective form of aid is support for population programs. If the rate of population growth is even marginally reduced, then the possibility of increasing per capita incomes, of investing more productively, of increasing productivity in agriculture and industry, is significantly increased. A real inadequacy in our aid program for a long time was that we gave so little to population programs. The present minister and the previous minister have redressed that, and there is now a whole series of very valuable programs that we are supporting in countries that want themIndonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, China and countries in the South Pacific. I think that this development of the aid program is one that deserves the wholehearted support of all Australians. There has been some controversy about the nature of one or two of those programs and it is very important, of course, that population programs be voluntary, that they be educative and that they aim to provide family planning information and capacity to people who want it, but that people not be forced to accept it. That is very important, obviously. But, given that proviso, this is one of the most cost effective forms of aid that we can offer and it is very valuable that it is being increased. There are also good sections on health and education, both of which are profoundly important in development programs. In fact, to oversimplify only a little, one could say that investment in education is perhaps the best indicator of determination to achieve greater economic and social development, because it increases people's skills, it increases their capacity to help themselves and it is the basis for many other forms of change that are essential if economic development is going to be strongly sustained. It is very good that we are building up our commitment there. I think this section was in the report because it was prepared just before the world summit for social development. That summit was concentrating on ways of reducing poverty, unemployment and social disintegration. Australia made a very valuable contribution to the preparation for the summit and this report was part of that. I want to move on now to briefly talk about the wider issue of the total resource flow to developing countries. There has been a tendency to be rather traditional in our approach to development and to see development assistance simply in terms of aid, but of course what matters to developing countries is the total level of resources they receive, from all sources. That includes not only concessional financing but also private investment, trade credits and lending to governments. All of those forms of resource flows are of value to developing countries in the development process. There is quite a good table in the budget paper on overseas aid programs which draws together all the resource flows to developing countries. It shows that in total resources flows in the 1990s have been rising, particularly because there has been an increase in private investment. However, total resource flows are still well below what they were the beginning VVednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 315 of the 1980s. It is that figure which perhaps most clearly demonstrates the problems that many developing countries have in achieving the resources they need in order to expand their investment. I think it is very important that we not only look at total resource flows as the best indicator of international development cooperation but see what has been happening to those total resource flows. VVhen we do that, we find not only that they have been rising recently and that they are lower than they were 15 years ago, but also that they are concentrated in a few developing countries. This is another source of worry. The principal recipients of total flows are China, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand and the Republic of Korea. In fact, in 1993 and 1994 China received most of the net increase in resource flows. China is a quarter of humankind, so that is not entirely surprising, but it has been very fashionable for private investment to flow to China in the last few years. That is important but it demonstrates gaping holes in total resource flows to countries which need it most. However, there has been some response to that situation of concessional public sector aid flows and now an increasing share of total resource flows is going to the sub-Sahara in Africa and other really impoverished countries. The response of the aid agencies in many countries has been to increase the flows to the poor countries. I see my time is just about up. I have a lot more to say but I will use another occasion to do so. contribution. I am pleased to follow my colleague the honourable member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), whose contribution-and, indeed, whose commitment-to this subject is so well known. VVhat he says is always interesting, but I was particularly interested in his comments about the United States because it just so happens that last week I was in the United States-in VV ashington-and I met with some of the congressional people there. VVhat came across to me, with this new Congress they have in the United States, is just how isolationist they are becoming. looking into Africa and I spoke with the equivalent committee in the United States. First of all, they said they had great difficulty getting anyone to serve on that committee; and, secondly, they said to me-and they made no apology for it and said it most unashamedly'There are no votes for us in Africa, there are no votes for us in aid, and what we are trying to do is deal purely with the local issues.' VVhenI raised the question of the position of the United States in the world, they did not laugh at me, but they looked at me if I was a very naive person from some other part of the world. They were making the point that, in Congress, they have elections every two years and they are not going to worry too much about what is happening in Africa and other parts of the world. They were going to very much worry about what was happening in their own particular bailiwick. I left that meeting, and VVashington, very disappointed. There has always been a tendency in the United States to become isolationist, but that tendency is very strong today and it is a bit frightening. It is disappointing that they do not see that they have a very important role in the whole question of aid.",143,Represent Atnes Main Commitiee

251,Mr Hollis,"Yes, it is getting worse. As people know, I chair a committee here that isMC 316 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 I took note of what the member for Fraser said in the criticisms he offered, but I also agree with him that the paper we are debating is a very welcome and well-focused paper. We cannot correct all the wrongs of the world and there is never enough money to do everything we would like to do. But it is important that our aid is focused: we must not have a broad-brush approach but a very focused approach to our whole aid question. I naturally also very much support the comments he made on the population issues. Like all members of parliament I am often challenged on the aid question. One group in the community argues that Australia does not give enough overseas aid and claims that what it does give is poorly channelled. Another group points out the real or imagined economic problems we have in this country and suggests that, really, charity begins at home. Some would say that there should be no government aid at all and that all aid should be raised through the private sector. I suppose that, as in all things, government action is a matter of competing interests, but I believe that this government has made a significant contribution to poverty alleviation through the Australian aid program. Of course, those who argue that Australia should give no overseas aid overlook the fact that much of this money is spent in Australia, or by employing Australians on overseas aid projects. I know the linking of aid to trade is a contentious issue. Nevertheless, it is an issue of considerable economic significance to many Australians. In this parliament last week there was a seminar organised by Community Aid Abroad and World Vision. This whole question of tying trade to aid was raised there and I thought it was dealt with in a very sensible and understanding way. The honourable member for Aston( Mr Nugent), in his contribution, said that the question of aid is not as easy as it seems; and that is true. But I must say that I have visited many Australian overseas aid projects and I have always found them to be well run and of great benefit where they are. I guess, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the question of aid is raised with you by your constituents-as it is with me-the Mekong Friendship Bridge is always mentioned. I actually doubt that any other issue has generated as much misinformation as the Mekong Friendship Bridge has. Last year, as part of a parliamentary delegation, I was privileged to cross this bridge, which is one of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of Australia's development assistance. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand, and will yield significant economic benefits to both countries. Indeed, if anyone needed proof of this, they need only look at the entrepreneurial activities which have already commenced on the Thai side. On the Laos side, there will actually have to be something done about the road. It is not particularly the best road-it is not the federal highway that we are used to-when you try and travel from the bridge into the capital. Nevertheless, it has been of tremendous importance to those two countries. As important as the bridge is for the economies of Laos and Thailand, it is one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years-and, incidentally, it was completed under time and under budget. The bridge is a showcase of what Australian excellence in technology design and infrastructure transfer can achieve, and of what Australia can deliver; as such, it is very important in our expanding trade relationship with Asia. Population issues have continued to be an important aspect of Australia's overseas aid program. As one who is convinced that overpopulation and economic underdevelopment are closely linked, I welcome the emphasis in our aid program on population issues. The priority Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 317 which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in December of last year. Australia was active in encouraging the international conference to adopt the groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women, and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health services. I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget, with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas: malaria, polio, tetanus and HIV/AIDS. The innovation involves additional funding of $110 million over four years, nearly doubling Australia's current spending on health under the aid program. As with assistance for population activities, AusAID has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and well-being of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children. Changes are also under way in Australia's program of assistance to education and training. Australia has recently refined its aid program to Africa, under a statement entitled 'New framework for Australia's aid to Africa', made on 16 August-only last week-by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs( Mr Bilney). It is important. Australia still makes a significant contribution of aid to Africa-something like a $190 million-but that aid is going to be very much targeted to Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique, and I have a few worries about the targeting. AlthoughI welcome the specific targeting of aid, one worry I have is that, with South Africa being flavour of the month, as it were, at the moment, all of the money not only from Australia but from many other parts of the world-be it from the European Community or other areasis going to flow into South Africa. That is good for South Africa and I think it is good that we are making a contribution. We are not the largest aid giver to South Africa but the money that we are giving should, I believe, be targeted to short training courses which bring people to Australia for, say, nursing or teacher training. We do not want to be funding any more PhDs. My worry about South Africa is that all the countries are putting money into South Africaand that is fine-but, unless the countries surrounding South Africa can deal with their problems, whatever we do in South Africa is going to come to nought. For example, unless the economies of Mozambique and Angola come right, refugees will cross the border in their millions. As poor as parts of South Africa are at the moment, it is still much better off than the surrounding countries. Already there are a couple of million people crossing the border each year. If the aid that people are giving is all going to South Africa-and, for sure, South Africa has the economic structure and is the economic power of that region-that country will be a magnet for those poor people all around it. Unless we can get their economies right and persuade them not to seek the higher economic advantage of going to South Africa, all the work we are doing in South Africa will not be for nought but will become much more difficult. I think we should look a bit broader. We cannot tackle all the problems of Africa, of course we cannot. Instead of just focusing on Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa-and it is important that we focus on these three countries-perhaps we could spread the net a little wider and help, say, the 11 SADC countries to get their economies right. If we provided some MC 318 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 economic aid for those countries, perhaps many of the problems coming up in South Africa will not need to be addressed. One of the real issues for South Africa is people crossing the borders all the time from surrounding countries. In conclusion, I would like to commend the government for the courage it has taken over the last few years in increasing the funding on the population issue. I know it has not been easy and I know there has been criticism raised about it. I know also that there has been a lot of nonsense spoken about it and that a lot of misinformation has been peddled out in the community. Those who argue against funding for population issues have to justify why they are arguing to keep women and children in a situation of absolute poverty and in life threatening conditions. I think there is a link between underdevelopment and overpopulation. Anyone who has been to any of those countries would have seen the sorts of conditions that people are subjected to in the way they have to live. I think every child born should be a wanted child and that every child born should have the opportunity to reach its full potential, whatever that potential may be. While we continue, for religious, moral or social grounds, to deny these people this attitude, we are subjecting people to a life that we would not particularly want to live. I have always been amazed by the line the Catholic church takes on population issues. It also surprises me that ageing clerics run around in drag, dictating how women should control their own fertility. The people who should be able to decide how they control their own fertility are the women themselves, but they should have the education, the opportunity and the means to do so. Mr Barry Jones-No role for cross-dressing. telling women how they should control their own fertility. It is an outrage and it is an outrage that we should tolerate no longer. I welcome this discussion paper on Australia's development cooperation program and I commend the minister for it. I also welcome the decision to have such a paper for debate each year and I hope that this paper is the first of many papers on these topics. about Australia's development cooperation program provides members of the parliament with an opportunity to canvass some of the particular issues about our aid program and the extent to which Australia fulfils its responsibilities. To follow people like the member for Aston( Mr Nugent), the member for Fraser( Mr Langmore) and the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) and to precede people like the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner), who will, presumably, follow me in this discussion, is something of an honour because all these people have shown by their earlier actions and by their continuing concern the depth of their feelings about a lot of the issues that are involved here. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of one of our former colleagues, Mrs Elaine Darling. Mrs Darling was the very highly regarded, very well respected and very much liked member for Lilley and she was among us for a period of 13 years. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Mrs Darling was the first woman member of the House of Representatives to represent any constituency in Queensland. It is particularly appropriate that Elaine is here at the present time because Elaine is one of these people who have a passionate concern about social equity not only in Australia but throughout the world.",145,Representatives Main Committee

I welcome Mrs Elaine Darling. Mrs Darling is the sort of person who should always-and will-be welcome in this institution. The Australian aid program is an expression of a number of things about the way in which the Australian community relates to general questions about aid and its international responsibilities. We have sought to secure a balance between a number of the elements which could be expected to influence our attitude. First of all there is our humanitarian concern, particularly in the context of the admirable comment which was made by my colleague, the member for Fraser. The Australian aid program is also recognition of the fact that Australiaparticularly in terms of our resource endowment, our level of development, our institutional stability and our per capita income-is one of the most privileged countries in the world. The program reflects Australia's growing recognition of the fact that the world must be seen as a global community. Some people refer to the world as the global village within whichMr Barry Jones-Marshall McLuhan's term. because it is so apt. Within that global community and within that global village, all countries have a responsibility to others. There is also the matter of Australia's acceptance of our special responsibility towards Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, South-East Asia and, increasingly, the countries in the Indian Ocean area. I refer particularly to the question of the nature of the global village because I am reminded that my maternal great-grandparents and my paternal great-great-grandparents came out from England, Wales and Ireland in the middle of the last century. The fastest time in which my ancestors could get to Australia was three months. I can now get to England, Wales or Ireland in 24 hours. In effect, as a result of that technological development, the speed of travel, the bringing together of communities around the world, we have physically contracted the globe from the size that it was in the middle of the last century to something which is now one-ninetieth the size, because what took us 90 days before now takes us one day. So those people who, at one time, we thought were around the other side of the world are not. They are next door; they are 24 hours away. Within that distance of 24 hours travel, there is abject massive poverty. And they are neighbours; they are like the people next door. We would not tolerate starvation of Australians in Victoria, Western Australia or the Northern Territory. We are prepared to tolerate it elsewhere. My friend and colleague John Langmore said that we should be ashamed of our effort. What we are providing this year is 0.33 per cent of GOP. The UN target is 0.7 per cent. We are about 13th among 24 countries of the OECD in terms of the contribution that we make to international aid. Last year our increase was 3.6 per cent, which was less than our GOP. John Langmore said that we should be ashamed. I think so too. He also made the point that one-quarter of the world's people live in abject poverty-that is 1.3 billion people. Those 1.3 billion people are not just under difficult circumstances; they are in abject poverty. Once before, I made an observation, and let me repeat it so that we put this into context. I made the observation that every three to four seconds one child dies as a result of preventable",148,Representatives Main Commjttee

That is 1,200 every hour; that is 30,000 kids every day; that is II million kids every year. Preventable diseases and preventable malnutrition! Let me put that into some further context. Every year the world spends money on what we like to call military expenditure. You can call it whatever you like. You can call it defence. In some cases, quite clearly, it is preparation for war, though not on our part. Unfortunately, there are still aggressive nations in the world, as we know, so that is part of it as well. Every year the world spends on military expenditure one million million dollars-$I trillion. What a reflection that is on the morality of the world. At Copenhagen earlier this year, at the World Summit for Social Development, a paper was issued-John Langmore provided me with my copy-which drew attention to that fact. It also drew attention to the fact that, by taking one-quarter of that $1 trillion-by taking $250 billion or $250,000 million-out of that total military preparation budget, the world could eliminate those critical problems which cause massive suffering and all of those deaths. For example, the world could eliminate starvation and malnourishment with $19 billion; health care could be covered with $15 billion; shelter, for the people who do not have shelter, could be provided with $21 billion; safe, clean water-something that we take for grantedcould be provided with $50 billion. We could retire the Third World debt with $30 billion. We could prevent soil erosion with $24 billion. With $10 billion, we could stabilise popUlation, a matter that was referred to quite correctly-let us make no mistake-by my colleague Colin Hollis. We could have clean, safe, efficient and renewable energy with $50 billion. With one-quarter of the total military budget we could overcome those problems of the world-and we do not do it! So when John Langmore correctly says, 'We should be ashamed,' I say, 'Yes, we shouldeveryone of us.' I repeat: every one of us. Let no-one try to excuse himself or herself from the fact that they are single members of the world community which allows that situation to prevail. Let no-one claim innocence. I said that with $250 billion we could overcome those problems. That is only about half of Australia's gross domestic product each year, and we are just a little country in the world. Half of our GDP each year would overcome all of those problems throughout the world-and the world fails to act adequately. This report, New directions in Australia's overseas aid program, is the fifth annual report. Last year's report concentrated particularly on Australia's approach to reducing poverty. This year's report builds on that and deals in particular with our approach to social development and humanitarian relief, and of course the details are adequately canvassed in the report. I applaud, endorse and support the attempts that people make, including, let me say, those of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs( Mr Bilney), in whose name the report was issued. Gordon Bilney has a proud background and record in connection with questions of this kind. He is a well-chosen minister in that portfolio and I know that he, as well as so many of my colleagues, is doing what he can in connection with this. There are certain historic reasons as well, I should say, why Australia should pay so much attention to Papua New Guinea. I think about 22 per cent of our total aid program goes to Papua New Guinea. The responsibility of assisting there means that the program is then reduced for other countries in the world that we may be able to assist, but we do have those historical responsibilities and that is quite appropriate. I would like to see the aid program increased. It did increase in real terms by, I think, 3.6 per cent last year. We were one of the very few countries that increased our aid program last year in real terms, so some effort is Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 321 being made. But, while ever the reality of those circumstances that I just described prevails, we are not moving fast enough, we are not doing enough, and it reflects on every single one of us. address the question of the ministerial statement and the accompanying booklet, New directions in Australia's overseas aid program, that was tabled not so long ago by the minister. I would also like to take the opportunity of making a few remarks on the broader question of Australia's aid budget and the direction of our policy with respect to overseas aid. I do have a number of observations that I would like to make in that regard and, from memory, this is the first opportunity that I have had in the parliament to make some comments on the question of our aid program. I will start by pointing out that, certainly in my electorate, overseas aid is a fairly major issue. My electorate is not necessarily a typical electorate in many respects, but I do believe that this issue is an important one right across the community. In my electorate I am contacted, virtually on a weekly basis, by constituents, church groups, and local aid organisations about a whole variety of issues associated with Australia's aid program. There can be no doubt that there are a lot of Australians who are active in aid groups, people who donate to the many worthwhile projects that the aid groups participate in, and people who are very concerned about Australia's overseas aid program. Those people have some strong views about how we should be pursuing our assistance to countries-particularly in our region, but also generally. Often politicians tend to understate the importance of aid. Like rabbits out of a hat, they pull out statements like 'charity begins at home', without realising that for a lot of people this issue is important, even in a fairly narrow sense. I will tum quickly to the aid budget for this year, which has been mentioned by previous speakers. I think it is worth placing on the record my views about this budget. This year's aid budget was increased by $83 million. In real terms, the increase was effectively worth about $28 million, so the total budget is now up to $1,563 million or thereabouts. In context, that was a reasonably good result. SinceI have been here, I have been part of the debates in the pre-budget period about the aid budget, trying to make sure that it is increased-and also at the ALP national conference last year, where similar issues were dealt with. As has been noted by the honourable member for Fraser( Mr Langmore), one of the unfortunate aspects of this year's aid budget is that it has again reduced our total aid contribution-not to a historically low level, but certainly to one of the lowest levels for some considerable period of time-down to 0.33 per cent of gross domestic product. It is fair to say that this decrease will make it fairly difficult for us to achieve our official policy target of 0.4 per cent by the year 2000 and 0.5 per cent by 2005. On the face of it, this is a grim statistic and something that we ought to be taking some stock of. It is true to say that Australia is above average relative to the OECD with respect to aid-although, as the honourable member for Fraser indicated in his contribution, there are some doubts about the methodology of assessing that average-but I do not think in an area like this we are entitled to consider that that performance is good enough. So, in my view, it is fundamentally important that we improve our performance in terms of our overseas aid contribution. It is worthwhile pointing out though, as something of an alibi, that it is slightly artificial to be critical of the government for failing to increase the overseas aid budget sufficiently in",149,Representatives Main Commitiee
255,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.59 A.m.),"I am very pleased to have the opportunity toMC 322 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 a time when growth rates are running at a very high level. The countervailing proposition is that when we are in recession it is okay to reduce the overseas aid budget, or not to worry about trying to increase it, because the base against which you are measuring it is not growing, or in fact may well be contracting. So an alibi, with respect to criticisms of the government, is that one of the reasons why we have seen a drop is that the gross domestic product has been growing over the last year or two at a very high rate. Turning to a couple of specific aspects of the aid budget, I was pleased to see that aid to Africa has been increased by 21 per cent, up to over $122 million. This is an area that we have historically neglected. It is also good to see that aid to south Asia has been increased to $74 million, although it is a bit distressing to see that both of these increases are substantially explained in terms of, in a sense, catching up on last year's promised increase. It is also worth pointing out that some of the increases can be explained by program increases that are, in my view, of limited value. For example, assistance to the coal industry in India, which is designed to increase the efficiency of the coal industry there, is unlikely to have any great benefits for the vast bulk of the poorer people in India. However, it is worth noting that there are quite a number of important new initiatives or improved initiatives in the aid budget. There is an extra $25 million to cover basic technical and further education programs in Bangladesh, Mongolia, Gaza, the Philippines, South Africa and the Pacific. It is also worth noting the funding to the International Crisis Group and the Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance. There has been a doubling in funding for the Women in Development Fund. The increases to expenditure on women's education and child labour issues are also worthy of note. However, there are one or two disturbing aspects. For example, $6.8 million is to go to the Korean Energy Development Organisation, which is part of the process of supposedly defusing nuclear tension on the Korean Peninsula. In reality, it involves us in developing the nuclear industry in Korea and that is something that I have some trouble with. I am also pleased to see that the DIFF program has been reduced by $10 million, from $130 million to $120 million. That is because that is essentially driven by commercial objectives rather than by aid objectives. The fact that virtually everybody else does it is not a sufficient argument to justify Australia saying that our aid program is basically a self-interest exercise designed to deliver commercial benefits to Australians. I think it is worth remembering that the Jackson committee report in 1994 recommended that our aid strategy should be based on poverty alleviation and humanitarian objectives as the primary focus, and that diplomatic and commercial objectives should be subsidiary to that. It is certainly questionable as to whether we have achieved that objective. It is concerning that, particularly in that light, Au sAID still seems to harbour economic growth as the primary factor in poverty alleviation, hence the assistance to the Indian coal industry. It states in AusAID's poverty policy that 'sustainable economic growth is an essential pre-requisite for poverty reduction' . There is a sense in which equity issues and distribution issues are seen as, in some way, being secondary. Not far below the surface we have the infamous trickle-down analysis, and the notion that if the economic circumstances of the wealthier elites of a country are improved that will inevitably drag everybody else in the country up with them. In fact, the evidence and experience suggests that the reverse occurs-that there is growing inequality, that there is Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 323 growing disruption in communities, and that there are serious adverse impacts from major projects and the like. I am not being strongly critical of AusAID in this regard, because I believe that this situation is changing. It is changing in the wake of changes with international institutions such as the World Bank. The 1990 World Development Report of the World Bank states: Rapid and politically sustainable progress on poverty has been achieved by pursuing a strategy that has two equally important elements. The first element is to promote the productive use of the poor's most abundant asset, labour. It calls for policies that harness marketing incentives, social and political institutions, infrastructure and technology to that end. The second is to provide basic social services to the poor. Primary health care, family planning, nutrition and primary education are especially important In my view that is something approximating a reasonable balance in an aid philosophynamely, that equity issues are at least as important as growth issues. It seems to me that, at least until recently, we have been somewhat lagging behind on that particular issue. In 1993 the World Bank said that government intervention appeared in some instances to have resulted in higher and more equal growth than otherwise would have occurred. It is also particularly clear that strategies of aid based on market libera1isation tend to have serious adverse consequences-for example, particularly adverse consequences on women in rural and tribal communities. A recent study for the Asian Development Bank entitled Rural poverty in Asia confirmed those conclusions. There are signs that our policy is shifting to a greater emphasis on human capital, on assisting people with things like family planning, basic health care and education as a greater priority. For example, it is very pleasing to see that in recent times the proportion of our education aid budget that goes to tertiary education has significantly declined and there is an increasing shift in emphasis towards primary and basic education and technical education, which is obviously where it ought to be. I would think that, although there is some value in providing assistance through the mechanisms of tertiary education, that is predominantly going to assist entrenched elites in the countries where the assistance is provided and the direct impact on people in poverty in those countries will be very, very limited. However, the impact of broadening the provision of basic education in those countries can be of considerable value. SoI think that in some respects, to be fair to the minister and to AusAID, the emphasis is changing for the better. Certainly the statement that we are giving consideration to today is a good indication that that shift is under way. I would like to see it go further, to ensure that the emphasis is very strongly on the question of poverty alleviation and social justice and that questions of equality, equity and access to basic health and education services have primacy in our strategy. The next comment I would like to make is on a matter that was addressed by my colleague the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) which I have very strong views on, as he does. That is the question of population control and family planning programs. In the 1993-94 budget we went through a bit of a fiasco where, to satisfy the rather peculiar views of one independent senator, we had to put on hold a very substantial increase in the population and development programs in the aid budget. Thankfully, the study that was undertaken as part of that agreement did confirm the clear connections between population growth rates and levels of underdevelopment, poverty and the like. It is good to see this in the minister's statement to the House in March this year: Access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right. MC 324 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 It is long overdue that religious fundamentalism is removed from these debates and that Australia pursues strategies with respect to family planning assistance to poorer countries that are based on the practical realities of life and not on religious zealotry. I certainly would share the views of the honourable member for Throsby that any attempt to disrupt our aid program or to disrupt population strategies and assistance in that regard should be condemned. The final comment I would make in the one minute that remains to me is to endorse the remark made by the member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) towards the end of his contribution that these issues are, as a result of internationalisation, rapidly going to become domestic issues. The notion that charity begins at home is, in my view, valid in the sense that the earth is our home, and so I see Australians and Australia as having just as much interest, both in a practical and a theoretical sense, in the lives, futures and circumstances of people overseas, particularly in our region, as they do in problems that we face here in this country. We will have to confront these issues more and more as practical problems that we have to deal with domestically. Because of internationalisation, they are not things over there; they are things that are going to confront us here and now as issues that do affect us, and that is something that will, hopefully, inform increases in our aid program in the future. Debate (on motion by Mr Hawker) adjourned. Justice Statement Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. the contribution of many eminent people in the production and development of the Justice Statement. The ability to access justice is an issue that goes out to touch many people in our community, and that is particularly so for women, whom I represent in my portfolio responsibilities as shadow minister for the status of women. The Justice Statement is, undoubtedly, the result of the dedication and effort of some very highly qualified people, and that is certainly evident, as you read through this report, in the quality of the recommendations presented. A feature of this government has been its eagerness to undertake and commission studies, reviews, committees and so forth. In fact, one cannot fault the data collection process, and it has usually been done by the best available people. But the government's commitment to implementing and progressing the recommendations made so often falls on infertile ground. It certainly does not match the commitment of the review process, and that has to be of concern to everyone, as well. The government continually stalls in its implementation of inquiry recommendations. We see this across many portfolios, and it is very evident in my other shadow portfolio of small business, with too many reports being left to gather dust on ministers' desks or on the many bookshelves in this place. The Justice Statement is yet another example of the government's regurgitation of existing policies. They have a wonderful statement here but, in terms of translating this Justice Statement into actual policy, they are short on. What we have actually seen is a regurgitation, in some areas-not new initiatives, and not always the implementation of the recommendations that have been made. So, under the guise of a new cover, and with the pretence that the community will not notice such a sleight of hand, we get the outcome of that report, and it",151,Representatives Main Committee
256,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (11.15 A.m.),"It is important from the outset that we acknowledgeWednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 325 is not entirely in keeping with all of the commitment and recommendations that have been made. Existing programs in some instances have been operating for a period of time already, before this report came out. Sometimes there is a bit of tinkering at the edges but no substantive move to change, but the programs have been conveniently repackaged to provide the perception that the government is initiating new policies. This is alluded to in the foreword of the Justice Statement, which states: The Government now responds to the challenge for change in our legal system with this Statement. That statement has to be analysed, and I will comment on a number of aspects of the Justice Statement as they relate to women and small business. PerhapsI will take a look at two or three of the positives first. There has been, of course, some commitment to increasing the funding in order to fund some of the recommendations made by the task force. For example, provision will be made of $12.3 million over four years to establish a national network of women's legal centres, to provide advice and assistance to those women in city and country areas who have legal problems. The government will provide an additional $5 million over four years to enable the network of women's legal centres to establish specialist services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and those shifts are welcomed by the coalition. The government will commit an extra $500,000 to establish a national outreach and development fund to develop legal information resources on issues relevant to women, including family law matters, violence against women, discrimination, employment matters, 'sexually transmitted debt' I am not sure what that last one means-and other areas of law. So there are some moves by the government to increase funding levels in relation to the delivery of justice. The government's commitment to justice for women, though, must be considered objectively against its other funding priorities. The Justice Statement is forecast to receive nearly $39 million in 1995-96. Of these funds, approximately $26.48 million has been allocated to issues closely associated with women and their families. So, out of that total funding, about $26 million will go specifically to women and to their families. Approximately $6.6 million has been specifically allocated to justice issues of immediate concern to women. On a per capita basis, this represents an outlay of $1 per woman aged 15 years and over in Australia. By contrast, the Australian Trade Union Training Authority will receive $8.7 million from the 1995-96 federal budget for its activities, a per capita rate of approximately $1. On balance, this reflects the government's priority to look after its mates ahead of the interests of women. One dollar a year is unlikely to provide any meaningful solution to the access and equity difficulties confronting many Australian women in their dealings with Australia's justice system. The services of a solicitor today could cost between $100 and $250 per hour while the cost of the services of a QC begins at a low of about $2,000 but can go very quickly upward depending on the complexity and the nature of the issue being addressed. There are many in the community who simply do not qualify for legal aid and who have no recourse to justice in this country. That is particularly so for many thousands of women. A further feature of the Justice Statement is the deceptive nature of many of the sUbprograms. Take, for example, the expenditure allocated to domestic violence. The budget reduced the community education violence against women program in Budget Paper No. 1 and announced the cessation of the program which was delivered by the Office of the Status MC 326 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 of Women. The saving for the government is $1.15 million. This is particularly interesting in view of the fact that yesterday the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Dr Lawrence), in a big media scene, announced that the government had now completed, through the Office of the Status of Women, a research paper on community attitudes to violence against women. I have no criticism of this report at all and it reveals some very interesting points. For example, it reveals that community attitudes toward violence against women have shifted very dramatically. A large number of people believe now that violence against women in domestic situations is a crime and that violence is no longer an acceptable way for people to deal with disputes within the family home. But it is curious: the minister said that this education program to produce a shift in results is a very important part of the process of dealing with domestic violence; when a survey was done in 1975, the results clearly showed that most people thought that domestic violence and disputes in domestic situations were only the business of the people involved in the dispute. Most people thought that the police should not have any jurisdiction in such situations and that domestic violence should not be considered to be a crime. Clearly, community views have changed and there is no doubt that part of the shift in attitude about this matter is because of the allocation of funds to the community education program through the Office of the Status of Women. What do we see? We see a program that is working and that is producing a result and yet the government has swiped the funding out from under its feet. The government is saying that it is not going to fund that program any more and that the program will cease to exist. I do not believe-despite the big shift in community attitudes-that we can afford to let go of this. We need to continue with a community education program to make sure that people understand that domestic violence is not an option. At the end of the last sitting, the minister declared that the government was going to spend another $1.1 million on yet another data collecting process on domestic violence. What we see here is a policy vacuum created by the government: an inability to translate its data collection process into policy and an inability to deliver outcomes to the electorate, in many cases. It is one thing to change community attitudes, but we have seen an increase in the incidence of violence against women in their own homes. Clearly, the next step for the government is to take measures to change the behaviour of people in our community in terms of their use of violence as an option to resolve disputes. We are not seeing that agenda moved forward. We are not seeing that agenda move forward. It is one thing to change the attitudes and it is another to change the behaviour. What we are seeing, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is an increase in the incidence of domestic violence in Australia today, and it is quite a substantial increase. The national crime statistics, for example, reveal that the number of sexual assaults for the 12 months ending December 1994 has increased by eight per cent or 515 additional assaults. In total, 13,277 individuals reported being sexually assaulted during this period. That is 37 sexual assaults per day. Clearly, it is going to take more than an education program to get these behaviour changes. It is going to take more than setting up centres for people to go to find out what their rights are and get some access to justice, and there will still be many women who simply will not have that option. If they do not qualify for legal aid they are unlikely to obtain justice in this Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 327 area. What we have to do is start changing the behaviour. That is a critical part of the move to deal with this problem in the community. One must question the efficacy of disbanding a policy that was clearly delivering some outcomes. But this program will be replaced largely by a network of women's legal centres, including five centres to be newly established and others with their roles expanded. Some of those centres are already in operation in the capital cities. This was hailed as a new initiative but, in fact, it is an old one that is just being expanded. There is no criticism of the expansion. There is a gap in the provision of services to women. The Justice Statement states that, over the next few months, the government will consult with local communities to determine the best locations for the new services and the most appropriate options for delivering services to meet the needs of each region. In other words, services and support for women will decline while the government procrastinates, yet again, over the next move. After 13 years in government, with a high focus on this particular area, they still now have to proceed with a process that may take several months to complete before this process of expanding the legal centres happens. There is a gap here which would cause a great deal of concern and more delays in the provision of vital services. It would be reasonable to expect that the process of identifying the need for the initiatives outlined in the Justice Statement would also have been suitable for the development of models for the identification and establishment of delivery mechanisms to ensure immediate implementation of services to women. After all, many-if not all-of these issues have been the subject of numerous studies, reports, consultancies and commissions over the last 13 years. What we have in here is all the recommendations but no plan as to how to implement these recommendations. Now we will go through another gap period before the implementation of those recommendations that are going to be implemented occurs. BeforeI wind up, I would also like to touch briefly on small business. The small business sector does not gain much new benefit from the Justice Statement, as almost all of the initiatives outlined in the report are already established. The commitment of an extra $1.7 million over four years to expand the corporate law simplification program is welcome, but is unlikely to generate the much needed focus required to accelerate the pace of the reform process. Small businesses are still being overwhelmed by the proliferation and complexity of corporations law, as well as taxation and trade practices law. In fact, if one looks at a list of items that are constantly raised within the small business arena, one sees that issues such as legislation affecting competition, copyright law, parliamentary consultation, the drafting of legislation, the simplification of corporations law, the rewriting of the taxation act into plain English, the review of outdated legislation, business regulation, consumer protection, delegated legislation, trade practices and the Freedom of Information Act are just some of the many issues that are impacting severely on small business today. We have to get beyond delivering the reports and deliver the outcomes. (Time expired) contribution on this report today because it is only about nine or 10 months ago that I and colleagues such as the honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham) were here discussing the Sackville report-as it was colloquially titled-which was the progenitor of the government's",154,Representatives Main Committee
257,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.30 A.m.),"There is a slight sense of deja vu in making aMC 328 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 Justice Statement. In fact, it was October of last year that we were debating the proposals in the Sackville report in the Main Committee. Just to recap on the propositions that the Sackville report put, they included the proposal that the proceedings of certain courts be open to the electronic media, and television in particular-a proposition which I and the member for Banks are very strongly opposed to, and I reiterate my opposition to that proposition. The Sackville report proposals also included: the development of a single national market for legal services; the establishment of mechanisms to ensure that clients are provided with far greater information by lawyers about their circumstances, the proceedings that they may be involved in and the services that are to be provided for them; a proposal that lawyers be required to provide written quotes to clients, roughly in the same way that tradespeople usually do; and proposals to provide for limited options with respect to contingency fees, with which I have some reservations but which, as they were developed, seem to me to be fairly cautious and reasonable. There were also proposals for independent complaints bodies to scrutinise lawyers and the delivery of legal services-a proposition which I am extremely strongly attracted to--and strategies to eliminate some of the many procedural delays and tangles that tend to cause enormous problems in our court system. Most of these proposals, of course, related to state jurisdiction matters and I am pleased to say that some of them, in various forms, are being pursued by some of the states. I do not necessarily agree with everything that the Victorian Attorney-General, Jan Wade, has done in her time in that office. In fact, there is an awful lot that I disagree with, but I do at least acknowledge her courage and willingness to tackle issues of legal reform along these lines. However, there is a long way to go on many of these issues. I was present, along with other members of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, at a discussion with the Law Council of Australia some weeks ago and it was very interesting to discuss some of these issues with the council. One of the points that I raised with them was: how serious was their commitment to the notion of a national uniform market for legal services when they continue to defend the existence of separate professions in states like Victoria? The result is that we have a situation where what a lawyer can and cannot do in South Australia, for example, is different from what a lawyer can and cannot do in Victoria. A barrister in Victoria is unable to perform services that fall within the traditional scope of a solicitor, whereas in South Australia you have a merged profession. It would seem to me that, if you are going to have a uniform national market for legal services, one of the most obvious components of uniformity is that the various players in that market can do the same things, and deliver the same services, irrespective of what state of _he Commonwealth they happen to be in. I was disappointed to see that the Law Council did not seem to see any contradiction in those two positions. Nonetheless, I do feel that the winds of change are blowing fairly strongly through the legal profession and it is pleasing to see that there is impetus for this coming from both sides of politics. Although there is considerable work to be done, I have no doubt that, over the next 10 years or so, major change is going to occur which will be of benefit to the community, both to lower income earners, who in many respects are excluded from legal services, and also to the community generally in the sense of improving economic efficiency and reducing costs that legal services do constitute. Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 329 Having made those background remarks I now tum to the content of the government's Justice Statement. It is based on three key themes-prevention, reform, and equality and social justice. I would like to run through some of the basics of the statement, as the first government speaker. Firstly, concerning family mediation strategies, $18.7 million over four years is allocated to a variety of initiatives associated with marriage and relationship courses, family skills training, the development of eight new adolescent mediation and family therapy services, and up to 20 new financial counselling services. And an amount of $13.5 million over four years is allocated for the Family Court to increase counselling services and registries in provincial and rural Australia. Secondly, in the area of criminal law, in a safer Australia strategy, $7.3 million is to be spent over four years. That entails a variety of prevention oriented measures, further work on the development of a model criminal code, the establishment of a national missing persons bureau, and, perhaps most importantly, work on pursuing tighter gun controls. It is not an issue that tends to get debated a great deal in the federal parliament but, for the record, my view is that tighter gun controls are essential. I would support very strongly further restricting access to guns in our community. The third category of initiatives is associated with the general delivery of legal services. We will see the establishment of an Australian legal assistance board which is intended to coordinate and plan the delivery of legal aid assistance across the country. There is to be $24 million spent over four years for more legal assistance, particularly focusing on family and civil law cases. An amount of $30 million over four years has been allocated for the doubling of the community legal centres' budget and that involves the establishment of nine new community legal centres across the country, something that I will say more about in a minute. An amount of $10 million has been allocated to a national disbursements assistance fund which, in effect, will enable the funding up-front of public interest cases. For example, environmental cases and the like which otherwise would not have been able to be funded will now be funded. There is to be a women's justice strategy, which the honourable member for Pearce( Mrs Moylan) has applauded. I note her support for that and I will say more about her comments in a minute. There will be $17 million spent over four years on specialist women's legal centres in each capital city. There is to be a toll-free phone service. There will be specialist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services within the framework of those women's legal centres. And, as the honourable member for Pearce outlined, there will be an outreach service for women consumers of legal services in remote and rural areas. Then we have the strategy to reform procedures and the profession, which, of course, largely depends on cooperation with the states and negotiations with the states about change. As part of that, there is to be an overhaul of the Federal Court fee scales and the initiation of a Prices Surveillance Authority study of lawyers' fees, both of which are welcome initiatives. A strategy will also be developed to assist courts and tribunals to develop charters of access to their services and to simplify their rules and procedures. We will develop strategies to tackle the backlog of cases which so many courts in Australia are bedevilled by. There is also a strategy to develop judicial education, professional development training, with respect to things such as cross-cultural awareness and gender issues awareness. MC 330 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 There are specific initiatives with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders such as funding for interpreter training and Family Court outreach services and similar initiatives with respect to people of non-English speaking background. In overall terms, I applaud the Justice Statement. I have had a fair degree of involvement in the past with community legal centres. The increased provision of services through community legal centres is a major initiative. There are many people in our community for whom the only serious prospect of access to legal services is via local community legal centres. There are many parts of the country-not those I represent, I hasten to add-where people have no real access to community legal services. If they lack the income and the wealth to be able to get ordinary legal services, then those people are left high and dry. For many common or garden, mundane legal problems, be they criminal problems in the Magistrate's Court-perhaps somebody has pranged their car and they cannot get the other person to pay up because they are uninsured-civil problems or disputes and the like, in a very high proportion of these cases people are unable to get justice. The barrier that prevents them getting justice is the high cost of participating in our legal system. I applaud women's legal centres because it is very obvious that there are many legal issues which are focused on gender questions. I can only cite my own experience as a trade union official dealing with sexual harassment matters where the general preference for female victims of sexual harassment, very understandably, was to be represented by a female union official. It seems perfectly reasonable to me to have gender specific areas in legal services because there will be many areas where it will be of much greater benefit and assistance to women consumers to be able to deal with things on a gender specific basis. I also applaud the assistance to environmental and other cases-which I expect will be offered through the national disbursements assistance fund-and prevention strategies with respect to crime and family problems. It is not only in the health area that prevention tends to be a very poor relation. In legal and criminal areas, prevention also tends to be neglected. It is long overdue that we pursue a more prevention oriented strategy. This is a very worthwhile initiative. I have already made some comments on procedure reform and the reform of the profession and I applaud anything that is done in that regard. I am sure anybody who has experienced some of the Byzantine procedural arrangements in areas like the Victorian Supreme Court and elsewhere would applaud the initiatives designed to improve those things and to make them more accessible and less expensive. Finally, before I tum to comments made by the honourable member for Pearce, it is worth noting that what this Justice Statement ultimately shows is that, even in a budget that was necessarily contractionary, this Labor government is still able to deliver on important social justice initiatives. After 12 years in office, it is still reforming and pursuing basic Labor programs that help people who are on lower incomes and suffer as a result of having less wealth than many others in society. Access to legal services and justice is a critical component of being able to participate fully in our society. It is great that, at this advanced stage of being in government, we are still pursuing initiatives like this. There is a lot more to be done. I am sure the government will continue to do it. Finally, I tum to some of the comments of the honourable member for Pearce. I am almost tempted to offer her membership of the Left of the Labor Party for some of the things that she said. It was very good to hear her criticising the government for reducing funding on Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 331 domestic violence education and saying how we have not given enough money to the women's initiatives in the Justice Statement. WhatI would point out is that the person speaking was somebody who was elected to parliament, along with my honourable colleagues opposite, on a platform which centred on reducing federal government expenditure by $10 billion per annum. has a long list of efficiencies that he would be able to pursue. There is an obvious hypocrisy in that, again, the coalition is attempting to criticise the government from the left. That is our job. You just stick to your job, which is being neanderthal. It is grossly hypocritical to be attacking the government for not spending more money in areas of social assistance to lower income people when you know, just as well as we know, that in the unlikely event that you ever get into government these will be the very first programs that will not only be cut but completely abolished. There would be very little of this access to justice strategy that would survive the election of a Howard government. Much as I applaud the comments of the honourable member for Pearce, I suggest that, if she is serious about the views she is expressing, she should consider which party she is in. range of subjects, and I want to deal in the main with chapter 8, which deals with consumer protection issues, but I naturally must comment on some of the empty gongs and clashing cymbals that were so evident in the contribution of the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner). Indeed, Labor has been very good about the rhetoric of social justice, but its actual achievements have, of course, been abysmal. The Prime Minister( Mr Keating) looked decidedly uncomfortable in delivering a justice and equity statement, because those are areas where he has never taken any significant interest and where his own performance and results have been utterly abysmal. Whilst somebody no doubt wrote the right words for him, he clearly did not have his heart in them, because his objectives have always been elsewhere. Indeed, after more than a decade of Labor rule, we clearly now have a much more unequal society than we had when Labor came to office. If that is their record of social justice and social equity, then there is indeed a need for a major turnaround, for a new direction, and so a policy statement on these sorts of issues was long overdue. Unfortunately, the statement is, however, long on rhetoric. It contains many words which are obviously supportable-motherhood statements of support for all the good things of life-but, in reality, very few initiatives which are likely to achieve much to benefit the Australian people through better access to justice or greater equity in policy delivery. I am especially concerned that many of the matters that are referred to require legislative action; yet, as I look through the legislative program, the reforms to the Trade Practices Act which are central to the consumer protection elements of this statement are not on the program for the rest of this year. That gives you some idea about the level of government commitment. We had a grand statement and plenty of rhetoric last May, but none of the legislation dealing with these matters is going to see the light of day in this parliament-because we all know that this is virtually certain to be its last session. The Prime Minister is saying, 'Here is a long list of Labor objectives, none of which will be achieved by the election; but you have got to believe in us as you believed in the tax cuts and all of the election promises last time, if you want to see any of them delivered.' I think",157,Representatives Main Committee

There were a number of initiatives, spoken of in relation to consumer matters, which I warmly welcome and which I think can achieve real benefits. The government has never really taken consumer affairs issues very seriously. We have a relatively small consumer affairs bureau but it has primary carriage of very few issues. Most of the important consumer issues are dealt with by other departments and, just as an afterthought, sometimes the consumer affairs department is invited to give its comments. Perhaps the biggest consumer issue running around at the present time is the question of bank fees. Of course, it is the Treasurer ( Mr WiIlis) who has been ringing up the banks and trying to persuade them to reduce their fees. This is another example of the government's empty rhetoric. that one of the reasons the banks are increasing fees at the present time is that, in the last federal budget, Labor imposed hundreds of millions of dollars of extra taxes on the banks: $180-odd million just by reducing the interest on their statutory depositsmaterials and increased sales tax in a whole range of other areas. The government imposes massive new taxes on industry and on business, and then complains when they put up their prices to consumers.

The member for Wide Bay has the floor. understand the government's sensitivity on this issue. It is another example of hollow comments, bank bashing, when they have failed to deal with the real issue of bank costs, the real issue of having a competitive environment for the banks to ensure that there is a better service provided to consumers. Having said that, I am not anxious to let the banks off the hook either. They have behaved with all the subtlety of a herd of rampaging elephants. It was highly offensive for the banks to come out within days of the Prices Surveillance Authority review into bank charges with suggestions of further increases. The banks need to respond to the matters that the Prices Surveillance Authority has raised about their levels of charges. We need to look very sensitively at those matters. Indeed, in this particular statement a number of things are dealt with in relation to the protection of consumers. The government has made a commitment, which I commend, to seek the development of a national scheme of easily understood consumer protection law to replace the current overlapping and sometimes inconsistent law. That is a classic example of a motherhood statement that everybody would support. We do need to have much more consistency in consumer protection laws between the states. However, the goal of uniformity in consumer law can only be achieved through cooperation",161,Representatives Main Committee

Past history suggests that it can be a very slow process to achieve this sort of agreement. In fact, the Director of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, Jenni Mack, in commenting on this particular initiative, and welcoming it, stressed that its success would depend on actions by the states and on uniform agreements reached by the Council of Australian Governments. She then threw in the very obvious comment that these are bodies 'not noted for quick or consultative decision making'. Sadly, there is a long process likely to be required to achieve that degree of uniformity. The coalition will soon be in government and will have the responsibility of implementing this announcement. It is committed to vigorously pursuing the development of uniform and readily understood consumer protection laws and it will be working and encouraging the states to work towards that objective as a very high priority. There are some areas which obviously need immediate attention. For example, there are areas where transactions which cross state borders can make it difficult for manufacturers and suppliers to comply with appropriate standards, and there are areas where appropriate dispute resolution procedures are not available because state boundaries get in the way. These sorts of things need to be addressed as a matter of priority. I also welcome the proposal to develop standards for consumer complaint schemes. One of the positive developments over recent times has been the development at state and national level of industry based ombudsman schemes. It has to be said that some of these are working very much better than others. The obvious example of dismal performance has been the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In fact, that has got off to such a bad start that there is an inquiry in the other place at the present time going on into its performance. A real problem with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is the lack of a broad based jurisdiction. It is interesting to note that more than half of all of the written complaints that have been given to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal have been struck out because of lack of jurisdiction. In addition, there were 5,188 telephone enquiries which led to only 881 written complaints. The obvious reason for that is that the telephone inquiry quickly established that the body in most instances did not have jurisdiction over the areas of concern. The one obvious problem is that the complaints tribunal has so far not had the capacity to deal with medical evidence. They were promised that they would have that jurisdiction by May but then the government backed off and now there is a promise that it will be there by November. Frankly, any further delays by the government will be unacceptable. I am concerned though that there are so many other matters that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal seems unable to deal with. I think all of us in our electorate offices have had complaints over recent times about the very poor performance of many superannuation funds and generally that is also outside the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. There are few things that the Tribunal can actually deal with but even those that it deals with proceed so very slowly that in a year since it began operation over $1 million of taxpayer-' money has already been spent and it has the grand record so far of handing down 12 decisions. It has 416 active cases and, of those, 321 were still at the inquiry conciliation stage, 83 had completed the inquiry and conciliation, but only 12 had gone to the review hearings. So this is an example of an ombudsman scheme that has really got a long way to go to be considered effective. MC 334 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 On the other hand, also in the insurance field are the general insurance industry review panels. I think their performance has been quite commendable. They deal in detail with the matters put before them and consumers have a very good record, with about 55 per cent of all of the reviews finding in favour of the consumer. The way in which they deal with issues seems to be thorough, efficient and commendable. Of course, not everyone is always happy with all of the findings but, frankly, some of the stories that are put before them would make really good novels. It is amazing what some consumers try to put over their insurance companies, too, so fault is not always on one side. This body has done well in trying to deal with those issues, and it is interesting that the number of complaints is reducing. I think that is a sign that the industry itself is responding to consumer concerns by adopting better standards and being prepared to recognise that business and industry have a responsibility also to their consumers. There is a proposal in the statement to work towards developing common standards of independence, impartiality, accessibility, efficiency, effectiveness, openness and accountability. If there is to be widespread consumer confidence in the ombudsman schemes, particularly when they are industry based, this sort of thing is desirable. The coalition is also happy to commit itself to working towards the development of a more comprehensive ombudsman system to ensure that in every instance high standards are not only set but actually achieved. That is a very worthwhile objective. There is also a need to look at gaps in the ombudsman schemes to ensure that no areas of complaint fall between the various jurisdictions. There are a number of examples of that at the present time, and I hope that this proposed review can deal also with that sort of issue. It is important that the various ombudsman offices maintain integrity and are regarded by the community as balanced and fair in assessing the various issues that are before them. Some very worthwhile initiatives are being taken up in this area. I notice that the Trade Practices Commission, presumably eventually the ACCC, its successor, is also to be given greater powers and resources to pursue consumer protection issues. That is also an important initiative. I suspect that because of a lack of resources the Trade Practices Commission has tended to devote maximum effort to corporate fraud, crime and major issues that are headline grabbing. Ordinary consumers with perhaps just their own complaint against a particular manufacturer or a supplier feel that their issue is not being regarded by the Trade Practices Commission as worthy of having the necessary resources devoted to it. That is disappointing because the Trade Practices Commission needs to be a body that supports the little person as well as deal with the high-fliers in Australian industry. There are also proposals to deal with post-sale consumer protection, which has been identified in many areas as a matter of considerable concern. I believe that the issues I have mentioned are important, and it is good to see consumer issues being addressed in a justice and equity statement. As I have said, however, so far the government has not demonstrated any capacity to act to support its empty rhetoric and it is now time for some action.

267,Mr Cleeland (Mcewen)(L2.01 P.m.),"In rising to speak on the Justice Statement, IWednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 335 We really are faced with a totally policy free opposition. For members of the opposition to stand up in this place and criticise the government for the Justice Statement when they do not have one policy point to raise is nothing but empty, hollow rhetoric. When we look at access to justice, the first thing we in this parliament always should recognise is that the bulk of justice is in the hands of state governments, not the federal government. The vast bulk of Australian citizens who have recourse to legal proceedings do so through state instrumentalities: the courts of summary justice, the district county courts and the supreme courts of the states. If we look at the states, which are now principally controlled by the opposition parties, we can see the attitude to access to justice. If we look at Victoria and at the Liberal-National party coalition governing it, the first thing we notice is massive cuts to legal aid, and in the actions of the Liberal and National parties we see a denial of access to the courts. In Victoria today, large numbers of people appear daily in magistrates' courts charged with offences which have the potential for conviction and gaol. These people appear in court totally unrepresented because the National Party and the Liberal Party in that state do not care about access to justice. Community legal centres and community organisations in Victoria are being slashed to the bone, ripped into by the government, while coalition party members stand here and say, with hollow rhetoric, how concerned they are about access to justice. If they are really concerned they should go to Victoria and talk to Jeffrey Kennett and say, 'Put your money where your mouth is,' but, no, they sit up here policy free, with no suggestions for change, and are critical. They should just go to Victoria where the people know full well what the Liberal and National parties stand for: it is certainly not to provide access to justice for ordinary Australian citizens. This is a very important and innovative statement that the government has brought forward. As my colleague the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner) correctly pointed out, it is evidence of a government which has not lost its way and which is maintaining its Labor priorities in ensuring that ordinary people are provided with appropriate services and access to justice, because a denial of access is a denial of justice. People who do not get access to legal services have no justice at all. Many points have been raised in the debate so far and there are several that I want to touch on. The first is the increasing tendency for the legal profession in Australia, encouraged by governments of both political persuasions, to charge what are known as contingency fees. It is a process whereby a legal firm can advertise and say, 'We will handle any legal case without fee unless we win,' in other words, 'You come to us and take potluck at our financial risk and we will sue who you want us to sue and we will do what we can to get you megabucks.' Let me say that I dislike such a process intensely; I find it offensive. Increasingly I am very worried about the way our legal professionals are going when they are advertising along the lines of 'Come in at no risk and we will sue.' I oppose it and I think we are heading the way of the United States whereby we will have legal firms in this country issuing or inventing quite outrageous causes of action simply for the fact that they can take 10, 20 or 30 per cent of the gain if they are successful. That is what is happening in the United States, the most litigious country in the world, with a legal system I find appalling, unprofessional and outrageous, and I am very concerned that that is the way we are going in this country. I just want to place on record today that, when it comes to access to justice, I do not think that improves justice and I do not think it improves MC 336 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 access. It prostitutes, in my view, the legal profession; it is unprofessional. Other people may disagree with that, but I am firmly of that view. The other thing that worries me greatly also, as a former practising lawyer, is the enormous increase in the number of lawyers in this country. There is in Victoria, my home state, a lawyer on every street corner struggling to make a living out of a diminishing share of the marketplace as the numbers of lawyers increase. As in any group of people who need to make a living, they will stretch professional integrity to the nth degree in order to maintain a living in a very tight marketplace. I really think it is a great tragedy that young people are still flocking into our law schools seeking law degrees on the basis that they will enter private practice when there is simply no room for these people in private practice. I find it quite alarming that the number of law undergraduates in Australian universities today is larger than the number of current practising lawyers in Australia. If you stop to think about those figures, when each of these young people coming out with a white collar and a law degree has an expectation of a right to earn a good income, the fact is that they are not going to make it. You wonder what the legal professional in a professional sense is going to be like when it is going to be so overcrowded and so difficult to make a living. You see that today in Victoria, where the number of lawyers defaulting is increasing at an exponential rate. A profession I was proud to be a member of is now being viewed by the public as just a lot of leeches sucking on the public purse. It saddens me greatly that a profession that has got a long tradition in this country is seeing so many of its members dipping into their trust funds and basically stealing other people's money. I do not know about other states but certainly in Victoria it is happening at an alarming rate, and yet increasingly we are being told we should deregulate more, we should take away controls on lawyers and let the market work its own forces. That worries me-I suspect that lawyers are under-regulated today-much as it used to annoy me as a former practising lawyer that there were all the auditing rules and the sheer amount of paperwork you had to do to maintain your trust account and your practice. If lawyers as a profession are going to breach the basics of honesty and integrity, then there is only one way to treat them, and that is to regulate them further so that we try and stop that kind of activity taking place. I have mentioned my concerns about legal aid and I am pleased that the Commonwealth at least is looking at means of increasing legal aid. My worry there, though, is that, as the Commonwealth increases its contributions to the states, in Victoria they keep cutting them. This seems to be a pattern in Victoria. If you take Medicare, for example, in 1993 the Commonwealth signed a new Medicare agreement in Victoria and an additional sum of $500 million of Commonwealth funding flowed into the Victorian health system. Within two months of that statement, the Victorian Liberal-National party government cut $380 million of state funding to health and hence we have had over 800 beds closed. This is what happens in legal aid: anything we increase in funding, the Victorian Liberal-National party government immediately cut, so there is no greater access or no greater benefit for the people of Victoria. We will see this again-that, as we increase the Commonwealth contribution to legal aid, we will see the Victorian Liberal-National party government increasingly cut their own component, and so pedple will be worse off in terms of accessing legal aid. Legal aid is essential, absolutely essential. As I said, it worries me greatly that I could walk into Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 337 magistrates' courts in Victoria and see people facing the court without any legal representation at all, often not even knowing the structure of the offence with which they are being charged and often not even knowing the consequences of a conviction-and that conviction often carries a term of imprisonment. If our system is going to go that way, such that people face imprisonment without proper legal advice, I think this country will stand condemned for not providing sufficient resources to ensure that every person facing a gaol sentence is adequaldy an'; t ivperly l-presel"",:d, whether it be in a magistrate's court, a district court, a county court or a supreme court. Of course, it is true that superior courts, such as the Supreme Court, will not allow people facing capital charges-such as homicide, for example-to appear before the court unrepresented. Even though we no longer have capital punishment, the history of that goes back to the day when superior courts said that no-one should face without representation a trial where the punishment was death. We do not have it any more, thank God. Nevertheless, the courts still maintain the view that on serious charges a person must be represented. It seems to me that that principle-that people who face courts are entitled to appropriate and proper representation-should be carried through, as a matter of right, in this country. It may well be that the profession itself stands to be condemned for the excessive fees that it sometimes charges. But I am led to believe that, in Victoria now, even middle-ranking barristers will do a Magistrate's Court appearance for around $250 or $300, which is basically what it was some 10 years ago, when I was in practice. So maybe the competition and number of lawyers in the system is actually reducing the cost of legal service in the courts. I have mentioned my great concern about contingency fees. I really am quite horrified by the way this country is following the American system. May I say, with no disrespect to the United States, that there is nothing that country can teach us. There is nothing it can teach us in terms of social policy, and nothing it can teach us in terms of anything which involves decency, because its legal system is so appalling. Quite often, one just cannot believe it. Their social system is such that people fall out through the bottom. To stand outside the White House in Washington and be surrounded, every way I look, by homeless people, in the middle of what is said to be the world's wealthiest country, makes me come back and say there is nothing the United States can teach us. Yet we still seem to want to follow some of the things this most appalling-in social terms--country quite often does. There are a lot of things here that really please me. I think the increase in funding for community legal centres is very important. Some years back, I spent every second Friday night at a legal referral centre run by the local council at the Greensborough shopping centre. Most of the local lawyers in Greensborough, in those years, did provide that service on a Friday night. It was really interesting legal work to actually have people come in off the streets, able to access competent legal advice at no fee or cost, and to be advising on which way they should or should not go with the particular concerns they had. I have often thought that we really need to have a lot more of those shopfront legal services available in Australia, and the fact that there is $30 million provided for in the Justice Statement for community legal centres, which doubles the existing funding, is indeed very pleasing. The other difficulty which the Justice Statement is seeking to redress is the difficulty that many people who were born outside of this country have with language communication in our justice system. There is no doubt at all that a lot of people who we think can communicate in English really do not understand the nature of the legal problem they are facing, be it civil MC 338 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 or criminal, because of different comprehensions of the use of words. I think it is essential, if we are going to have decent justice in this country, that people who do have legal difficulties, either civil or criminal, are able to access competent and well-trained interpreters to assist them. That is another measure which is there. Another matter, which again pleases me, is looking at the Federal Court scales and initiating a Prices Surveillance Authority survey on lawyers fees. Our profession in Australia is a profession divided between the bar and solicitors. Even though in Victoria that was fused, in some states it is still a separate profession, and barristers need to be brought back into a fee scale system which is capable of public scrutiny. It is offensive when people can charge the sort of money that top QCs are capable of charging today, when they are the minority of the total profession and they take the biggest slice of the public cake in legal aid funding. (Time expired) issued by the government is, to my mind, an outstanding statement in canvassing all of those issues with which it deals. It is comprehensive and thorough, and certainly brings together a lot of the issues that have been of concern to the Australian community over a long period of time, as the member for McEwen( Mr Cleeland) indicated. The report is based on the Sackville committee report on access to justice. That committee reported last year. It made something in excess of 70 recommendations-which, to a very large extent, provided a solid approach to the types of reform that are necessary within the legal system. Especially did it deal with the problems of inadequate access to justice and the inefficiencies of the court systems. The range and number of those recommendations brought home to everyone who was aware of the report the nature of the inequity which relates to the Australian legal system and the fact-again, as Peter Cleeland just indicated-that it tends now to focus more on rewarding the practitioners within that legal system than on dispensing justice to those who can afford to pay for it or to the majority of people who have become trapped in a costly legal maze. One of the fundamental elements of the system that we live in is, and must be, the right of people to access the legal system, to have their grievances heard and redressed and, where necessary, to have judgment made by their peers. They are fundamental, basic elements; but, as a result of the complexity and cost of the legal system, to a very large extent they are becoming something which is not available to Australian citizens. To a large extent, that is what the Justice Statement attempts to deal with. It is a comprehensive statement. It covers 188 pages. I am not going to go through the contents, but I am heartened by the fact that chapter 1 deals with families. People express concerns about family instability and family breakups and the legal maze often associated with that: questions of what we used to call access and custody. Fortunately, a lot of the terminology is changing, but the difficulty being confronted by people in those circumstances has not materially improved. It has got worse. Perhaps the government's commitment to those changes contained now in the Justice Statement will make it possible for us to start to redress some of those growing inadequacies. When the Justice Statement was launched by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), with what I should also say was an outstanding statement by the Prime Minister, there were some reputable commentators who responded very well to it. I refer firstly to the editorial in the",164,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (12.16 P.m.),"The Justice Statement which has beenWednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 339 Australian. I will read the first paragraph of that, because I think it is important that it get into our records just the same as it is in the public record of the media. The Australian said: The Federal Government's justice statement is welcome for its promise to make the law financially fairer and more accessible. They are the two fundamental elements of that Justice Statement: financially fairer and more accessible. The editorial went on to say: In a democratic society such laudable purpose cannot sensibly be contradicted. There is political wisdom behind the decision to establish women's legal centres in each State and Territory-adding resources to family mediation and support services as well as allocating more money for legal aid advice. There is also merit in the proposals to reduce costs for the ordinary litigant and to boost public confidence in the justice system. This package, taken in total, sets a reasonable direction for reform. That is a sensible, intelligent, balanced, reputable response. But there were some cynics as well within the media. The Sydney Morning Herald is a major metropolitan paper in New South Wales with great tradition behind it over a long period of time, but the last paragraph of its editorial said: It is, perhaps, being unduly cynical to see the reforms as handouts to interest groups who will be vocal during the next Federal election campaign. CouldI say to the editorial writers of the Sydney Morning Herald, 'Yes, that is being unduly cynical.' Do they expect us to suspend government? Or if the opposition at some time in the long distant future comes into government, will the Sydney Morning Herald editorial writers expect them to suspend government before elections? Should governments suspend their initiatives? Do governments need to suspend the responsibility that they have to overcome injustice and to give people financially affordable access to the court system just because there is an election coming up? That is not very smart on the part of the Sydney Morning Herald, not very smart at all. Let me say again, 'Yes, it would be unduly cynical for them to make such a claim.' Let me put it into context. Because the Sydney Morning Herald and a lot of the other media commentators have become accustomed to good government, their judgments become harsher and they become more demanding. That is understandable. A fine day gives you a measure against which you assess what the alternatives might be. If you do not have the fine days, you do not know how bad the crook ones are; but when you have a fine day, it can always be just a little bit better. That is what the community and some elements of the media do with this government. We have provided good government. But as the Prime Minister says from time to time, every time we do something good, the commentators and the community lift the bar, like the high jump. 'Well,' they say, 'you have done pretty well. You got across that bar. Now try that.' And you get across that one and they say, 'Now try that.' The bar rises all the time. Let us put this Justice Statement, a great statement, into context. I say it is part of the whole mosaic of good government. Since we have been in government, we have been responsible for the most significant period of industry restructuring that this country has ever seen. Australian industry now, as it was never before, is competitive; it is flexible, it is adaptable, it is efficient-right across industry. I know there are problems. In the process of that restructuring, problems emerge. And, yes, we have looked after those people as well to a very large extent, the people who would have been bearing the burden of that restructuring. We have been fiscally stringent. We have been fiscally responsible. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, during the 1980s there were four occasions, Mr Deputy Speaker, MC 340 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 as you would recall, when this government budgeted for a surplus. Everyone wants a surplus, and we gave them four-with a cumulative surplus of $18 billion over those four years. We did it again this year, and they said 'Oh yes, but that's only because you are selling assets.' We have been fiscally responsible. We have been fiscally stringent. We have provided a safety net in the area of social security or welfare. We have provided real increases in benefits to the less advantaged people in the community. We have finely targeted where those benefits go. We have extended the range of services to make sure that the safety net for those people in Australia is adequate so that they do not fall through it, and that people do not drop in and take advantage of the safety net when they do not need to. We have restructured our priorities in the total budget. We have balanced social programs. We have developed infrastructure. We have assisted the states in a more adequate, more targeted way than was ever done before. We have restructured our defence commitment and we have done the same thing with overseas aid. More recently, we had the One Nation statement-one of the most significant statements that any government has ever provided in terms of indicating the nature, direction and volume of investment in national infrastructure. After that One Nation statement, people said, 'Well, that is pretty good, that is okay, but now what are you going to do?' We said, 'We will do something about the unemployment. We will have the Working Nation statement. We will target an increase of half a million jobs.' The next day they said, 'That was pretty good, but now what are you going to do?' We said, 'What we want to do is to determine the pattern for the future development of arts, craft, music, drama, skills and culture of the Australian people and so we will have the Creative Nation.' 'Oh, yeah,' they said, 'That's okay, but now what are you going to do?' So we said, 'Look, as a result of the Mabo decision, the indigenous people of Australia deserve additional attention and we will legislate on the basis of that. We will give those people a level of justice they never had before. Not only that, but we will give them a land fund to make sure that the most dispossessed are able to get back some of that land.' They said, 'Yeah, well, that's all right, but now what are you going to do?' So we said, 'We'll talk about a vision for where this nation is going. We will talk about a vision for the pride, dignity, sovereignty, independence and self-assertion of this nation in terms of the republic that's going to occur in the future.' That was pretty well received as well and they said, 'Well, what else are you going to do?' So we gave them a budget with a surplus. They said, 'That wasn't a bad budget, but what are you going to do tomorrow?' So we gave them the Justice Statement. Some of the media, as I say, are pretty cynical about it. Perhaps some members of the community are as well. That is understandable. We can carry that burden because we know that that burden of criticism and cynicism is visited on us because we have provided good government. When we bring in our innovation statement, they will say with a yawn, 'Oh, yeah, well, what are you going to do next?' I think they have been pretty tough in their judgment. This has been good government. This has been outstanding government. Of course there have been individual problems, individual inadequacies. There have been problems that have been created as a result of all those changes, initiatives and vision. We have made sure that where problems were created we gave attention to them as well. The Justice Statement gives priority to women's legal services, legal aid funding, the Family Court and community law centres. They are the types of things to which attention has been Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 341 given but, at the same time, a whole range of other things have also been considered. On the question of effective competition within the legal service, we have found the value of competition in Australia by building efficiency and bringing down costs and prices. The same applies to the legal profession. The questions of legal fees, gender bias on the part of judges, the wigged and gowned members of the court system and televising court proceedings are addressed. I know my colleague the member for Banks( Mr Melham), who is an eminent legal person and chairs the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, has reservations about that. I do as well. I do not want Australian courts turned into a circus. I have seen circuses in other countries and I know the effect they have, not only on the position of those people, but also on the question of justice. The questions of consumer protection and the settlement of disputes outside the legal system were also given consideration in the report. It is a good report and a good statement. It reflects good, sound and continuing government. (Time expired) going to make some general comments later in my speech, but I want to talk initially about the benefit of this Justice Statement to my electorate in Cairns and Far North Queensland. Families in my electorate will directly benefit from a range of new services in the $160 million Justice Statement, which outlines a comprehensive national strategy for creating a simpler, cheaper and more accessible justice system. Cairns and Far North Queensland have already received significant federal government assistance to provide legal services and family counselling from this government. The Cairns Community Legal Service received more than $158,200 to assist in providing community legal services, as well as dedicated funding for disability, discrimination, legal advice and advocacy. It means that, as well as a general lawyer employed by the Cairns Community Legal Centre, there is also an advocate in discrimination law. More than $63,300 has also been allocated to Centacare in Cairns to provide marriage and relationship education and counselling in 1994-95. In addition, Youth Link in Cairns received more than $117,700 for adolescent mediation and family therapy. As part of a four-year program under the Justice Statement, the government has significantly expanded community based services to help families in Cairns and Far North Queensland overcome legal problems. New support services, such as marriage relationship education services and at least one new financial counselling service, will be established in the Cairns and Far North Queensland region for funding under the Justice Statement. The government will also fund the Family Court to upgrade its Cairns registry-which is very significant-to give better access to Family Court services for people in Far North Queensland. The government's strategy encourages mediation in family law matters to help minimise the trauma of marriage break-up. It will increase the availability of counselling and mediation services throughout the Cairns and Far North Queensland region with new community based mediation services. The Justice Statement funding will also build on these existing services with establishment of a specialist women's service linked to the existing women's service in Brisbane. It will be part of a national network of women's legal services established in response to the needs of women for specialist legal assistance in areas such as domestic violence and family law matters.",168,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Dodd (Leichhardt) (12.31 P.m.),"I support the government's Justice Statement. I amMC 342 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 As part of the overhaul of the legal aid system, the Commonwealth will substantially increase funding for legal aid commissions and community legal centres, such as the Cairns Legal Community Centre, while developing innovative new ways of meeting legal costs, such as the national disbursement assistance fund, which I will speak about later. Also, there has been an announcement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General( Mr Duncan) that an Environmental Defender's Office will be located in either Cairns or Townsville. I will certainly do everything I can to make sure it comes to Cairns. It will be funded to $70,000 and will become part of a national network made up of environmental defender's offices in every state and territory. I had an input into this part of the Justice Statement. I was lobbied by the national environmental defender's office organisation and I subsequently lobbied both the Attorney General( Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) on this issue. I consider it very important that legal advice is available to community groups and individuals in relation to environmental law matters. These matters are very important in my electorate and in a lot of other parts of Australia. We need to be able to provide people with adequate advice because, quite often, the people on the other side of these disputes-developers and the like-are well equipped to access advice. I am not saying I am against all development and developers, but they quite often have very good access to legal resources whereas community groups do not, and that is why this initiative is very important. Very clearly, the Justice Statement presented by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) was very good for my constituents in that it addresses a lot of the problems they face in relation to access to justice. I now have some general comments about the statement, particularly with regard to the future, based on my personal experience as a lawyer and solicitor. I have had experience in private practice, I have worked as a salaried lawyer for legal aid commissions in two states, and I have also worked for the Public Trustee in Queensland-a body which, until recently, provided a great deal of free legal advice in a different area of the law to the people of Queensland. It is a great disappointment to me that the Public Trustee decided last year--or perhaps early this year-to withdraw a lot of its services. That decision was certainly not in the spirit of the Justice Statement, and I ask the Queensland government to consider reversing the decision and restoring the Public Trustee services. People in remote areas, such as many in my electorate, received advice on drafting of wills, for example, and it also gave advice in relation to estates and the like. I hope that the Queensland government will read the Justice Statement and perhaps adjust that situation. The advisory committee that produced the Justice Statement stated that there had been a lack of strategic direction at the national level on legal aid policy, resulting in inefficiencies and unequal access to legal aid. That is certainly an understatement. If you go to one state, you might be eligible for legal aid for one legal problem but, if you go to another, you may be ineligible. Some states have more stringent means tests than do other states. Some states have merit tests for some matters and some states do not. So it becomes a bit of a lottery. I will talk more about lotteries later because, to some extent, we still have a legal system where access to justice is unfortunately a lottery. I applaud the measures in the statement to reverse this situation. They involve a more active Commonwealth role in legal aid policy and administration, which I welcome. An Australian Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 343 legal assistance board will be given $16.8 million over four years for delivery of legal services in civil and family law. That is over and additional to the mainstay of the Legal Aid Commission, which is criminal law. Balancing civil and criminal law obligations for legal aid is a very difficult task for any legal aid commission. Some legal aid commissions have merit tests for criminal matters, and it seems to me that it probably is appropriate to have means tested delivery of services when there are limited resources. However, it is totally inappropriate to have merit tests in criminal matters. Basically, this initiative allows the legal aid commissions to prejudge the matter and to reverse the onus of proof. In lay terms, that is a reversal of the principle of innocent until proven guilty, and is something that should be avoided. If only criminal matters are given legal aid, ordinary citizens feel that the legal aid system excludes them. Of course, a perfect legal system would be one which provides for a right to legal assistance for people in at least serious criminal matters, and a targeted system, by merit and means tested, for both civil and family law, supplemented perhaps by something like the national disbursement assistance fund that we have got in the Justice Statement. But we do not have a perfect system because there is a limit to funding by government or any other sources. My belief is that there at least has to be some commitment by all states and the Commonwealth to fund legal aid from their budgets and not rely on solicitors' trust accounts or some other source in that regard. The reality is that, if you rely on solicitors' trust accounts, when there is a downturn in the economy, a downturn in legal work, that is often a time when you need more legal aid funds and that is a time when those solicitors' trust funds go down. So there has to be a commitment, I believe, from all states and the Commonwealth to provide legal assistance from the budget. I make the following comments. They are not on behalf of the government, but I think that, if we are going to have an equitable legal system in the future, we have got to really look beyond the Justice Statement and look to some sort of wholesale restructuring of the legal system in terms of delivery of legal services and also in terms of the litigation system. I think that in the future, if I might predict, we will have a legal care system as we have now got a Medicare system. I think in the long run that is the only way to provide justice and equity in terms of access to the legal system. Mr Nehl interjectingis: how are you going to fund it? I think that the public, if it wants an accessible justice system, has to accept that there may be the need for some sort of levy like the Medicare levy. To keep costs down it would have to underwritten by perhaps professional indemnity schemes and some financial incentives. I think that that is one wing of a very important reform. The other wing of an important reform that would keep costs down is to implement-as the Whitlam government tried to do though it was thwarted by the Senate and the events of 1975-a no-fault compensation scheme. At the moment it is a lottery. If you go to one stateand I use that phrase advisedly-you get one award for a particular injury; if you go to another you get another award. If you happen to be lucky enough to be in a motor car and you lose your leg, you are at least covered by a compulsory scheme. But in Queensland, for example, if that happens because someone assaults you, you have got no hope of recovering, certainly",171,Representatives Main Committee
270,Mr Dodd,"I did not hear the honourable member's interjection but the obvious responseMC 344 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 in relation to any criminal compensation scheme. Of course, workers compensation schemes also would come into that. Contrast that situation, where people have difficulty in receiving any sort of compensation when they are bashed senseless by someone in the streets, with a situation-and I do not want to make any comment about the person-such as the one where the courts in New South Wales awarded about $300,000 to Andrew Ettingshausen, money for damages arising out of a proven defamation because he was inadvertently exposed in some magazine. The public just do not see that as fair and equitable. The only way to resolve that is to really have a no-fault scheme coupled with greater access to legal aid. Then there might be eventually a fair and equitable scheme. In the short time that I have got left I just want to make some general comments about matters that could be raised in the future. As a lawyer, whether in legal aid or in private practice, one of the problems that I came across was where people came wanting simple assistance for dissolution of marriage. I think that there should be some assistance provided but I think the Family Court could provide assistance. They insist on things being typed, they insist on the applications and the affidavits being typed and in a proper form. If the Family Court registry actually sat down and devised a simple, plain English form which people could fill in, we would have a system for access to dissolution of marriage which would be more equitable. I cannot emphasise more the need, as has been highlighted in the report, for counselling services. As a legal aid lawyer, and in private practice, quite often people would come to me seeking legal advice when what they really needed was financial counselling. They had debts and they had the debt collector knocking on their door. They needed someone to sit down with them, go through their accounts, give them advice-not legal advice-and get them out of the system. There is even provision in my electorate for that but I think we have to do more than that. It is important that we fund cases of national importance. It is important that any system fund test cases. It is also important, as I said before, that we fund the Environmental Defender's Office. But, if we do that, we have also got to reform the law of standing. It is not good and it is a particular problem in Queensland if we give people or community groups legal access to courts. If they are required to put up litigation bonds to take action against powerful forces in society, that effectively prohibits them from access to justice, and that is something the states will have to look at. (Time expired) non-lawyer who has spoken so far on this debate. I do so in the context of genuinely believing that this is not one of those debates where one is just going through the motions for party purposes and pushing a line that one does not really agree with. In contrast to the member for Wide Bay( Mr Truss), I actually think this is more than a grand gesture, more than hyperbole. I actually think there are some very valuable initiatives in this action by the government. One of the few areas I want to talk about that does not really concern my electorate is the issue of interpreters-particularly with regard to the Aboriginal community. In the Australian Institute of Criminology'S 'Trends and issues No. 47', John Walker and David Macdonald again refer to the high incarceration of Aboriginals-constituting, as they do, 14 per cent of the prison population. They, of course, went through the usual realities: Aboriginals are three",173,Representatives Main Committee
271,Mr Ferguson (Reid) (12.46 P.m.),"I think that on the government side I am the onlyWednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 345 times more likely to be unemployed, 2V2 times more likely to be in rental accommodation and 14 times more likely to reside in what are termed 'improvised dwellings'. That again interrelates with the question of whether they will get bail, et cetera, and their incarceration. They also said that, in addition, linguistic difficulties in some parts of Australia would make it difficult for indigenous suspects to communicate their situation to police. I guess we are quite aware that that also occurs in the court system. In the Northern Territory, Western Australia and some other areas, there can be no doubt that many Aboriginals are in gaol simply for want of an interpreter. We run around -he place talking about other NESB groups, but I think this issue has been neglected. I am pleased that the government has done something about this initiative. The overall thrust of the $160 million, which is not a meagre figure over four years, is-if anything-to limit the need to go through the court system and, in periods of anguish, worry, concern and stress, to try going towards mediation or other alternatives in some areas. It is also about simplifying the system and giving more access to information for people-if they have to go to court-to ensure that they have more knowledge. Equally, in the federal sphere at least, it is about requiring lawyers to give more information with regard to costs and alternative methods of reducing those costs. There is a big thrust in the overall proposal with regard to family services, domestic violence and community legal centres. There is also the issue of training for court personnel and judges to make them more aware of the changing nature of this country. There has also been a fairly strong effort on a diverse range of events. The member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner) alluded to his attitudes on gun laws. I put on the record my strong position on this issue. In fact, in my 1984 maiden speech in the New South Wales parliament, I concentrated on this issue. I am pleased to see that, in this particular overall Justice Report, the government is moving towards further restrictions on the importation of machine guns. The government also notes that it will seek that all territories and states tighten gun licensing requirements and that gun registration is introduced in those states and territories where it does not exist. We are going to find that some individuals will manage to carry out offences despite all the registration requirements in the world. We know that criminal elements can obtain guns, whatever the best efforts of the community, but, essentially, this country has started to go down the wrong road already in regard to the increasing number of people in possession of guns. In addition, there is a large number of people with a vested interest in resisting restrictions. Once you give people something, it is very difficult to take it back, and we are slowly drifting down the US cycle. Despite our culture and despite a lot more reticence about guns, unfortunately those first few steps have been climbed and there are more people who feel they have to have guns: they feel threatened; they feel that society is increasingly unsafe and insecure; and they require to be armed. As I say, I am pleased that the government, in a very broad document of about 190 pages, has emphasised that issue and intends to try and do something about it. The document also concentrates on a few areas that matter to my electorate in a very fundamental sense. In my electorate, 29V2 per cent of people over 15 years of age were born overseas-believe it or not-and 13 per cent of the entire electorate have been in this country less than five years. We have a number of initiatives in regard to non-English speaking people: assistance in professional development programs so that Family Court judges, Administrative Appeal Tribunal members, et cetera are aware of cross-cultural aspects; detailed research on MC 346 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 the disadvantages faced by people of non-English speaking background in the justice system and focusing on determining the levels of unmet demand; introduction of reforms in legal aid at a national level to ensure increased access and equity in the legal aid system for people of non-English backgrounds; funding of women's legal centres to develop appropriate forms of assistance for women of non-English speaking backgrounds; and an overall emphasis on financial counselling, marriage guidance and other relationship support agencies. All these initiatives are trying to ensure that people of non-English speaking background have equal access. I have got to say, having lived my whole life in an electorate where there are a number of new arrival cultures, that this is a fundamental problem. It is possible to see women who are, basically, divorced and shipped overseas by their husbands without knowing what day of the week it is. It is a situation where people, because of the language problem, tend to gravitate to a very small circle of solicitors who then have a captive market. I am not saying that this a majority trend, but a minority of these solicitors come to this country with legal qualifications from elsewhere. They are, perhaps, imbued with the culture of these legal systems and the knowledge of how lawyers might operate elsewhere rather than the standards we might prefer in this country. As I say, there is a very great problem in communities in areas such as the inner west of Sydney in regard to people-mainly women-getting access to our court system, knowing their rights and being able to fight for them, and being put into networks of people who can assist them. I see it in a real sense. It is a necessary effort to undertake to change this situation, and this particular document does something about it. It is worth noting the overall expansion of legal aid, and there are a number of proposals for a national network of environmental lawyers. Honourable members are quite aware that, regardless of which party is in government in different states, there have been restrictions on who can undertake very necessary legal action on the environment. This proposal allows more rights to the individual through environmental lawyers. The government is to expand the network of legal services and will establish a natural human rights and discrimination law centre, specialist litigation advocates in a number of existing community legal centres, and also, most importantly, nine new generalist community law centres. I notice that they are in a number of regions where there is obviously a need, and I do not think that people will quibble about the areas. The areas are: the Riverina area between the Victorian and New South Wales borders; the northern part of New South Wales; the central coast; and, close to my electorate, the outer west of Sydney, which is represented by the member for Chifley( Mr Price) and the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). There is no doubt that huge housing estates have massive policing problems and socioeconomic characteristics and that the people who live in the estates have a proclivity to be involved in crime. These areas need this kind of community legal aid centre, and I put on the record my support for the government in undertaking the establishment of such a service. There is also another matter that I have been interested in locally. I am aware that, in the last few years, the St Vincent de Paul Society has initiated handover centres for separated couples. The actual process of arranging times and places and the questions of access are very often the source of great friction in those relationships. The St Vincent de Paul Society pioneered a scheme in New South Wales. In this overall Justice Statement, the government has taken those suggestions on board and is spending $5.3 million on prototype centres to see Wednesday, 23 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 347 how well they operate. Those centres will have legal workers who are trained in dealing with family violence. That should reduce what is a very traumatic national problem. On the question of a national missing persons bureau, the figures are that in 1993-94 over 27,000 people were reported missing. They were a very diverse range of people-people with mental disabilities, people in stress situations, people with emotional problems, people who were abducted, et cetera. People can knock any kind of overall justice statement, but I think this national missing persons bureau is a worthwhile initiative by the government. The bureau will be part of a national exchange of police information. Over a million dollars is going into it. There will be photographs here and overseas. There will be an emphasis on children who are missing and on foreign nationals who go missing within Australia. Once again, it is worthwhile, the electorate wants it and I am pleased to see it mentioned in the Justice Statement. In this document there are a series of proposals that deal with safety. One of the unfortunate developments in Western political systems over the last few years-and it was fairly obvious in the last state elections in New South Wales when the Labor Party did it, and next time around the Liberal and National parties will probably do it-is the attempt to exploit fears in the electorate about violence. A document by the Australian Institute of Criminology mentions a 1991 survey which asked Australians and people in other Western countries whether they had a feeling of being a bit or very unsafe when alone at night. In Australia the figure was 31 per cent who felt unsafe. That is significantly above that of a number of European countries, with Belgium at 20 per cent, Finland at 18 and Sweden at 14. There is no doubt that there are concerns out there. We know that it is related to people's personal experiences and whether they have been victims in the past. People are also more inclined to be concerned if they are women or older people. WhilstI support the government trying to do something to reassure the electorate, I draw attention to Australian Institute of Criminology document No. 44, by P.N. Grabosky, which says: Overseas researchers have concluded that the effect of newspaper coverage is complex, with some forms of coverage increasing fear and other forms of coverage decreasing fear. The effect of official crime rates on fear is also mediated through the newspaper coverage of crime. In Britain, readers of tabloid newspapers which have more sensational crime coverage reported higher levels of fear than readers of broadsheet newspapers, whose crime coverage is less predominant and less dramatic. This applies to the political system as well. There is no doubt we can increase the fears of people, we can make them more inclined to support harsh regimes in prisons, and more inclined to demand that extreme measures be taken, but there is a public responsibility. The things that the government is suggesting in this scheme are worthwhile, but on the way through I must express concern about the developments in the political system in this country, and also in the media, that are leading to unnecessary, exaggerated fears within the population. Contingency fees are another matter that the government attempts to move on in this document, with $10Y2 million for national disbursements essentially saying that, yes, it is a good idea to try to explore the possibilities of no-win, no-payment litigation. But there are initial, up-front fees that people often cannot pay, so this Justice Statement provides that money so that we can at least see how it will operate. Payments will only have to be made if the client wins. MC 348 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 23 August 1995 There are also proposals for a specialist women's legal centre. I am pleased to say that, as a state member of parliament, I had an involvement with the housing department in gaining premises for the women's legal centre in my own electorate. I am quite aware that, once it was established, it provided a useful part of the network-Immigrant Women's Speakout and other groups, and the Workers Health Centre-that provides a service for women. There is no doubt that these centres are necessary, that women have confidence in people of the same gender who are giving the advice. These will provide referral to other agencies, some advocacy and some representation, as well as giving a broad range of advice and information. In conclusion, I strongly support the document. I think it is a worthwhile initiative and I hope that the government is a bit more active in publicising it. Debate (on motion by Mr Neb) adjourned.
