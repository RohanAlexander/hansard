Did he notice that in the majority of cases the costs to-day are less than they were in 1929-30, but that those of the Treasury increased in the period from approximately £1,000,000 to over £4,000,000?

One of these precautions is keeping away from infected persons. Children should be prevented, so far as is humanly possible, from attending theatres, cinemas, or crowded assemblies of any kind. Other precautions are, of course, the building up of the health of children and the banishment of fear. There is no need for alarm.

45,Sir Archdale Parkhill,"ISINO-JAPANESE CEISIS. General) -by leave1 propose for tie information of honourable members briefly to review recent important developments of the Sino-Japanese crisis. On the 17th August, the British Government made a proposal to the Chinese and Japanese Governments to the effect that if both the Japanese and Chinese would agree to withdraw their naval and military forces from the Shanghai area and would also agree that Great Britain, the United States of America and France should be responsible for the protection of Japanese nationals in the International Settlement, the British Government would undertake this responsibility yjrovided that it could secure the co-operation of the United States of America and France. The British Government also made it clear that its sole object in making this proposal was to keep the International Settlement free from hostilities, and the commitments contemplated would be of a temporary nature to hold good only during the continuance of the crisis. The Commonwealth Government has reason to suppose that the Chinese Government would have favourably considered this proposal if it had proved acceptable to the Japanese Government. The Japanese Government has now replied to the British proposals in a note which contends that British interests in Shanghai are being endangered not by the Japanese army but by illegal Chinese attacks on the Settlement and that Japanese troops were landed to protect 30,000 Japanese residents from attack by Chinese forces. The note concludes by stating that the protection of British lives the British Ambassador to China, was and property in Shanghai, is always a matter of concern to the Japanese Government, whose forces are constantly devoting themselves to this end. A pact of mutual non-aggression between"" China and Soviet Russia was signed on the 21st August. This consisted of three clauses:(1) That neither party should commit any act of aggression on' the other; (2) that neither party should assist any third party which might commit an actof aggression on either of the signatories; (3) that all existing agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral, to which the signatories were parties should remain in . force. ' The Chinese Government has informed the British Government that this pact is purely negative in character. It merely indicates China's fixed purpose of living at peace with its neighbours and does not signify any abandonment on the part of China of its fixed policy of anti-communism. Honourable members will recollect thai the British Government recently addressed a note to the Japanese Government protesting against the attack on the British Ambassador in China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, by Japanese aeroplanes as the result of which he was severely injured. The full text of this note has appeared in the press, and it is sufficient for mc to remind honourable members of the three requests made to the Japanese Government by the British Government. These were: First, a formal apology to be conveyed by tlic Japanese Government to the British Government; secondly, suitable punishment of those responsible for the attack; thirdly, an assurance by the Japanese Government that the necessary measures would he taken to prevent a recurrence of incidents of such a character. No reply ""to this note has yet been received, but the text of a statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Office on the 27tli August is as follows:It was with profound regret that we heard the news that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, seriously wounded by machine-gun lire from an aeroplane, whilst he was on his way from Nanking to Shanghai. The Japanese Foreign Minister immediately instructed the Japanese Ambassador to China to convey to the British Ambassador his (the Foreign Minister's) sympathy, while the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai called upon the Acting British Consul-General and expressed his regret. Tlie Japanese Government is now conducting an investigation into the matter at Shanghai.

Bill brought up, and read a first time. ter for Repatriation) [3.8] -h y leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Under this measure it is sought to adjust war service pensions in relation to thc increased invalid and old-age pensions, by increasing the rate of pension by 'Is. a week from 19s. to 20s. Clause6 of. the bill seeks to give statutory authority to the payment of pensions to the children of a pensioner's widow who remarries. Anticipating the approval of Parliament in this matter, the department has been paying these pensions in respect of the children concerned, and validity is now sought for such action. It will be noted that the date from which the increase of pensions to soldiers will operate is the 16th of September but in sub-clause 2 of clause 2 the operation of clause 6, which relates to the time for the payment of the pension to the. children of a pensioner's widow who remarries is made to date back to the 10th March. the next pension pay day? paid on that day, and invalid and old-age pensions are paid a week earlier. I i would bo extremely difficult to alter that arrangement. do not propose to move for the adjournment of the debate on this bill, although, as a matter of general practice, it would be wrong for the second reading of a bill to be agreed to before honourable members had an opportunity to consider its contents. The Minister for Health( Mr Hughes), however, was good enough to lot me have, in confidence, a copy of this bill earlier to-day, and I am able to confirm his statement that it merely provides for the increase of the pension to £1 a week, and validates the action of the department in paying pensions to the children of widows who marry again. If the bill were not passed now, pensions would have to continue at the rate of 19s. sions to the children of widows who remarry, this action was taken by the Government, at the request of honorahle memhers so that the rights of those children under the Repatriation Act might he preserved. It is true that there are many provisions in the principal act which honourable members might like to discuss, but the terms of this bill restrict us to the consideration of the two points contained in it . The Opposition agrees that the course taken by the Minister is a proper one, and offers no opposition to the passage of the hill. bill lacks one provision which I should have liked to see it contain. A few soldier pensioners are inmates of public institutions, and, while there, receive 6s. a week. I should like to see the remainder of the pension paid to the institution as is done in the case of invalid and old-age pensioners. Under the present system, when a returned soldier goes into an institution, he becomes a total charge upon it . He is thus placed in an invidious position, and sooner or later, if he remains, becomes an unwelcome guest. I am sure that that is not the wish of Parliament.

There seems to be considerable misconception, over the matter at. present. This bill deserves the commendation of the House, and is in the terms of the promises made to soldiers during the war. In my opinion, service pensions should be granted on the same ground as invalid pensions, namely, that the applicant is totally and permanently incapacitated, instead of,, as at present, that he is unemployable. To me it seems to be absolutely stupid that a. returned soldier can, on the grounds of total and permanent incapacity, get an invalid pension he can still work and refuse him a service pension. Dozens of returned soldiers are being deprived of a .service pension because of the wording of the act. Throughout the northern coal-mining districts of New South Wales and, 1 think, also in Lithgow, there exists an industrial contributory system under which' employees make weekly contributions to the hospitals in return for which they receive hospital treatment at no further cost. Some provision should be made whereby the pensions would be payable direct to returned soldiers and not to the hospitals in which they happen to be inmates. Why should the hospitals paid by the contributors and they should not also be entitled to ^draw patients' pensions. Invalid and old-age pensioners, who are contributors, should also receive the full pension direct when in hospital. -Section 45 of the principal act says-^Provided that the pension shall not be payable under this section to any person who is not a bona fide resident in Australia. Does that mean that the pension is not payable to an English reservist who, since the war, had adopted this country as his home ? applies to those persons who come within the category set out in the act.

Does it mean that the returned soldier is to get the whole of the increase? I contrast this with the proposal in the bill discussed yesterday' under which the pensioner was to get only half of the shilling increase. to him, and to him only. Honourable members on this side of the House yesterday expressed the view that the whole of the proposed increase should be given to old-age and invalid pensioners.

It also proposes to give statutory authority to a practice that has been in force in the department since March of this year, by which (he children of a widowed mother who has re-married receive a pension.

In the case of old-age pensioners, the balance of the pension goes to the institution, but returned soldier pensioners have to be maintained by the institution without their receiving any contribution fro m the pension. I think the committee would like an explanation as to why there is this discrimination between returned soldiers and invalid and old-age pensioners. should like the Minister to provide that where a pensioner is an industrial contributor to an institution, an industrial contributor being one who pays a weekly fee to.ensure that if he falls sick he shall receive necessary attention without f u r ther charge, no further payment shall be made to the institution. W h y should thc Government want to double the amount paid to the institution? Sir gets nothing from the Government. to the pension that shall he payable to a pensioner who is an inmate of a.public institution. I am asking that payment be not made to an institution to which a pensioner is an industrial contributor. Nothing could be fairer than that. No Government policy is involved. In thc district from which I come, the Government of New South Wales has been saved considerable expenditure in the erection K u r r i , Cessnock, Wallsend, Lithgow and other hospitals out of their industrial contributions. The Government has been in the habit of paying to institutions, in districts where the same pride is not shown by those who have to make use of them, the difference between the amount paid to the pensioner and the total pension. Many accidents occur in a mining community, and it is not infrequent for a man to be taken to hospital broken in limb. The miners wish to make sure that will receive hospital attention without though many of the returned soldiers had their health broken by the war, they still continue their industrial contributions to these institutions, or the contributions are continued by their sons. I have contributed on behalf of m y aged father. I suggest that the following proviso be added to the clause:Provided that, where the pensioner is an annual contributor to a public institution, this section shall not apply.

Sir 'CHARLES MAEE -The only alternative would be for the Government to pay £1 a week to worn-out soldiers; but if they were to enter an institution, they would bepaid nothing.

Up to date, it has been paying a soldier 6s. n week pocket money, but now it proposes to increase that sum to 7s. a week. ter for Eepatriation) [3.48] I cannot accept the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr pendants.

If I wore .to do so, the men whom ihe honourable gentleman seeks to benefit would be placed in a worse position. orable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) stated, that no money whatever is paid by the Repatriation Department to the institution? ber misunderstands the position. The honourable member for Parkes explained the matter quite clearly. At the present time the Government pays 6s. a week to certain persons in certain classes of institutions. It is now proposed to pay to them 7s. a week, and that is the beginning and the end of the matter. They will be lhat much better off and no one will be a penny worse off as the result of this amending legislation. The present section provides that if an applicant for a service pension becomes an inmate of one of the institutions named, the service.pension payable to him shall not exceed 12s. a fortnight. According to this measure, that maximum will be increased to 14s. a fortnight, but the bill does not say that the maximum shall be paid. It appears to me that the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) would not accomplish the object that he is desirous of achieving. thc interests of the soldiers concerned, 1 ask the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) not to press his amendment. To-day, the soldier receives as pocket money 6s. a week or 12s. a fortnight. Before the introduction of the amending legislation by the Minister for Health and Eepatriation ( Mr Hughes) he received nothing when he was an inmate of the institution unless he was a soldier in receipt of a war pension. This amending legislation represents an enlargement of the assistance granted to burnt-out soldiers who are suffering or unemployable; in other words those who are in receipt of service pensions. If a soldier were suffering from a war disability and were drawing a war pension, some of that money was paid to him and the remainder went to his deof the repatriation legislation, a worn-out soldier received 6s. a week, but the present proposal outlined by the Minister increases -that sum to 7s. a week. As I understand the amendment submitted by the honourable memher for Hunter, the soldier would receive nothing at all unless he were a contributor to a general hospital. In any case the honourable memher is desirous of doing something which is beyond the scope of the original intention of the bill. cussion of this nature always enlightens honourable members. After the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) had addressed the committee, I realized that the aggravation to the soldier is increased by more than I had previously anticipated. According to the honourable member for Parkes, while a soldier is an inmate of an institution, he will receive 7s. a week, but the balance of thc full pension is not paid to the hospital. Where, then, does it go? The Repatriation Department must retain it. Sir CHABT.ES MABB It does.

If he should become ill and enter an institution, that is the time when he needs more money to meet the additional expense. I speak on behalf of a number of returned soldiers who provide for the contingency of having to enter a hospital by contributing to an institution under an industrial insurance scheme. I , myself, am a contributor to such a scheme. By a system of the exchange of contributions, if I were to be injured-and I recently sustained injuries in a motor car accident-and were taken to the Cessnock Hospital or the Newcastle Hospital, I sliould be granted free treatment, which would be made good by the Kurri Kurri Hospital, to which I contribute.

Taking into consideration, the £5,000 exemption, owners of properties valued at £50,000 would be taxed on £45,000. In 1931, they were required to pay £573 15s. each. When the first reduction was made their assessment fell to £3S2 10s., which showed them a saving of £191 5s. After the reductions made from 1933 to 1936 became effective, bhey showed a saving -of £286 17s. 6d In'other words, while tlie owners bf large city properties showed a saving of nearly £300 a year, farmers with properties valued at £6,000 showed a saving of only £1 19s. 6d. It is interesting, also, to learn that the reductions, in the aggregate, benefited the owners of city lands to a far greater degree than the owners of country lands. report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, and also in reports of the Commissioner of Taxation, shows that from 1932 to 1936, land tax on city properties yielded £3,814,649, and that on country properties yielded only £1,878,858. City land-holders, therefore, benefited to the extent of about £2,000,000 more than country land-holders, in consequence of the remissions of land tax granted by this Government. What, then, becomes of the statements we have so often heard about the benefit of this policy to the struggling farmers? The leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) has certainly let these farmers down. With the Government handing out liberal prizes to its supporters, the. Minister forgot the small farmer, who could have been entirely relieved of this land tax at the expense of the banks and breweries. While such taxpayers benefited to an amount of about £2 a year on properties of an average value of £6,000, large city land-holders benefited to the extent of hundreds of pounds, arid, in the aggregate, of £2,000,000 more than country land-holders. farmers pay £30,000 in land tax each year, or an average of about £7 each, and they benefited under the reduction scheme by an amount of £2 a year each on the average, whereas reductions of no less an amount than £120,000 were enjoyed by banks and financial institutions, and £130,000 by large city retail a year to the breweries. Moreover, 22 financial institutions gained £100,000 a year each from these remissions, whilst 4,400 farmers shared only £30,000 between them. These facts entirely support the contention frequently made by honourable members on this side of the chamber that the Government's policy has benefited the wealthier classes of the community at the expense of those not so fortunate. Furthermore, they entirely support the statements made yesterday by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), concerning the effect of the changed policy of the Government. In the light of these considerations, honourable members, and the public at large, should carefully consider the consequences of the Government's policy of Information contained in the reverting to overseas borrowing, into whicli it has doubtless been forced by its supporters in big financial institutions. Is it any wonder banks, financial companies and retail stores are able to build .elaborate premises. All these came out of taxation rebates. The Australian .people have been led to believe that that policy of borrowing overseas had been left behind for all time. This point could be elaborated with considerable enlightenment to the general community. I wish now to refer to the taxation of Crown leaseholds. Under the provisions of the Land Tax Act, a person who leases land from the Crown becomes liable to land tax, provided that the unimproved value of the leasehold exceeds £5,000. The appropriate section of the act dealing with this matter reads as follows:For the purposes ot this section' (a) thc unimproved value of a leasehold estate the present value of tlie annual value of thc land calculated for the unexpired period of the lease at 4 i par cent, according to calculations based on the prescribed tables for the calculation of values; About 4,400 (6) the annual value of thc land means i i per cent, of the unimproved value of the land; I admit that the language of the section is very involved, but I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer one point, which, if I am advised correctly, calls for prompt attention should it be found that taxation is being evaded. In order to calculate the value of the leasehold, the land tax regulations contain a table of calculation covering leases with a tenure of from 1 to 100 years. So, up to 100 years, the department can calculate the value of the lease for land tax purposes. My information is that an interesting position arises regarding the largest Crown leases in the Commonwealth which are principally held by overseas pastoralist companies. These are perpetual leases, and the holders escape land tax because the land tax regulations made no provision whereby the value of the leases can be ascertained. the honourable member is referring in Queensland? tirely concerns New South Wales. There are a few in South Australia. point as to whether it might be held generally that perpetuity is to be reckoned on a basis of 100 years; that is, in respect of perpetual leases, the department would work on the scale or schedule for 100 years. I am informed that owing to an omission in the regulations, or the memorandum, large areas of land held ""under perpetual lease cannot be brought under taxation, the loss of revenue to the Government resulting therefrom amounting approximately to at least £200,000 per annum. In most cases, it is argued that these properties are held -by overseas interests-by absentee landlords. I draw the attention of the Treasurer to this point in good faith, because it may be found upon investigation that a set of circumstances exists under which those properties have been overlooked, creating an anomaly as frequently arises after amendments of legislation aro put into operation. I am mindful of the fact that very often t.he law has first to be set i i i subject. I am not raising this matter in motion before gaps in it can be discovered, and gentlemen of the type with which I arm now dealing are not slow to seize an opportunity to evade tax. | Leave to continue given.'] I take it that the Treasurer will investigate the points which I have raised with a view to seeingwhether they can he borne out. In respect of land tax and the policy pursued by this Government"" in making the remissions it has already made, the view generally advanced to-day is that the Government has destroyed the principles for which the federal land tax was established. The first was that it would be a means of breaking up large estates in order to make land available to those in need of it. able member has just shown that two-thirds of this tax is paid in respect of city areas, it cannot be of much help in breaking up big estates. member is not intent upon breaking up city estates? tical proposition of which'.! ean give an instance. The Hordern Estate held fairly extensive properties in Sydney, ' and, largely because of land tax, some of them became a drain upon the estate. Consequently, portions of the estate were sold, and I could give exact figures showing that such sales resulted in the properties being distributed among a number of different buyers. Thus, this tax has an apnlication in respect of both country and city estates. It could be argued, of course, that my reference would largely apply to the manner of making land available for agricultural purposes. On that point I sliould say that a survey, would show that most of the 33 per ceni. of the tax received from country holdings is paid by fairly large pastoral interests. Mr. ARCHIE CAMERON A few years ago, we were sorry we had so much agricultural country and let much of it revert to pastoral occupation. point. During the Gwydir by-election campaign, the inatter of closer settlement figured more prominently than any other any controversial way, but in the contentions which I am now putting forward, I am naturally guided by general principles. I have discussed this matter with quite a number of men in country towns throughout New South Wales. They told me that they were looking for land on which to settle their sons. Invariably the argument they advanced was that no land was available on their own properties and there was not hope of their sons securing",21,Casey

115,Mr Beasley,"That is anotheradjacent land. Consequently, tlie sons were forced to leave home and seek employment in shearing sheds and at all sorts of occupations. I have no doubt that those opinions were the honest opinions of those men. The point I am making is that most of the 33 per cent, of the tax received from country land, comes from people holding large areas, and further that owing to the unimproved exemption of £5,000 many of the people relieved from paying the tax are those who can be classified as struggling or working farmers. The reductions in the scale to which I have referred have given a. decided impetus to land monopolists. Instead of tending to make the holders of large areas disgorge some of the land tliey possess, this legislation is having an Commonwealth and thus a burden is not opposite effect. During the last few years, the properties of a number of people who have failed because of mortgage liabilities and the like, have fallen into the hands of big companies. I'n the Parliament of New South Wales, particularly, I have heard of many instances of this kind. The reductions of tax applicable to the more wealthy section, is giving an impetus to. that tendency. . Instead of having the effect of ' breaking up large estates and making land available as a practical aid to closer settlement, the policy of this Government is tending to have an opposite effect. That circumstance is of great importance to the Statesi f not to the Commonwealth. extending their areas almost monthly. being helped by the policy pf this Governservices of which they stand so much in ment this tax on large estates. Consequently, I submit that such a policy is wrong and inimical to the best interests Yesterday, the right honorahle member of this country. Prior to the reduction of for Yarra( Mr Scullin) delivered an these rates, sales of land amounted on an interesting speech in this House.

Furthermore?, what is definitely a tense party dummying operations are going on in this debate. The honourable member told a particular field with the object of evadparable of the settler who created an ing the incidence of land tax, and it is orchard, clearing and tilling the land, and the expressed opinion of those who have planting the trees, but, it happened that had the opportunity to take a close view before, that orchard was in production, of this matter, even people in the departanother person took over the control of No 2 399 ment itself, that dummying is rampant. It is being said repeatedly that we did not obtain any advice from the Commissioner of Taxationi n respect of this matter. It is not mentioned in any of his annual reports. There seems to be a sort of deathly silence in respect of this matter with the result that, rightly or wrongly, one is forced to draw the conclusion that the people operating in these fields are capable of evading taxation or have a strong influence in preventing their position from being disclosed. The department itself seems to be taking no steps to make the actual position known either to the Parliament or the public. In this particular sphere a good deal of revenue is being lost to the being placed upon the shoulders of those best able to carry it. It cannot be denied that the groups of people to which I have referred are capable of meeting all of their commitments. There is abundant evidence available in respect of that fact. Therefore, nothing should be left undone on the part of the Commonwealth to investigate this matter as fully as possible in order to see that all the revenue available -from, these sources is collected. I hope that the Treasurer will give attention, to this matter to the end that if , by a change of circumstances, he shall not have the opportunity to see the work tlirougli, his successor will he able to probe this problem to such an extent that there will be. no need for us to go outside necessary to defend Australia and tc in remitting portion of need.

On that parable^ the honourable member constructed a story of events from the pre-depression period up to the present in an attempt to show that th© prosperity being enjoyed by this country to-day is in no small measure due to thc ground work that was done by his Government some years ago. He dealt with this story very skilfully and, from his point of view, very satisfactorily; but I suggest there were many omissions in the story; and as it is a kind of story that has been related in this House on different occasions it would be well to examine the details omitted by the right honourable gentleman. What were the conditions preceding the depression in Australia ? before the orchardist arrived? point which I am coming to. If the right honourable member for Yarra is able to claim some credit for doing the groundwork, he must in fairness admit that the method was suggested to him by honourable members on this side of the House before ever he took action. It is only necessary to cast our minds back to 1929 to remember that the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, repeatedly told the publicthat forces were in operation overseas which would, before long, compel Australia to reconstruct its methods of finance. over £500,000,000 of government securiDuring the election campaign which occurred that year, I can well remember that the party now in Opposition, led by the right honourable member for Yarra, refused to accept the advice of Mr Bruce. They placed before the people a glowing account of what they would do if they were returned to office. Such grandiose promises were made that the people, unfortunately, were hoodwinked, and the Labour party was swept into office so that they might carry out their promise to usher in a period of unparalleled prosperity. There was in New South Wales at that time another government known as the Bavin Government, which took early steps to reconstruct the States' finances in a manner suitable to the time. [Quorum formed.'] There was another gentleman in New South Wales, Mr Lang, who went before the people with glowing promises of what he would do for the State, with the result that, at the subsequent election, he, too, was returned to office. We now come to the time when the depression began to develop rapidly. The -bottom dropped out of our export markets, and unemployment was becoming an increasing problem. The Scullin Government was in office, and from the Opposition side of the House it was being constantly exhorted to face the situation, and to reconstruct the finances of the country according to the reduced national income. Eventually, we reached the time mentioned by the right honourable gentleman, when the credit resources of Australia were exhausted through the inability of his Government to face the situation. This led to the introduction of the Premiers plan, and the conversion loan, which have been referred to in the course of this debate. When bhe Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) the other night stated that the Premiers plan and the conversion loan represented the work of this Parliament, rather than of any party, he was speaking ths exact truth. When a conversion loan was first mooted, the idea was to make it com-, pulsory, and had the matter been left to the Labour caucus, I have no doubt that that is what would have happened. This conversion, which is to-day one of the bright spots in our history, in that ties were converted at an average interest reduction by 22£ per cent., would have been carried through on bhe principle of compulsion, instead of with the willing co-operation of the investing public. Fortunately, the honourable member for Kooyong, now Sir John Latham, who was then Leader of the Opposition, was called into consultation with the Premiers, and he strenuously resisted the idea of compulsion, and urged that the conversion be carried out voluntarily. The Premiers plan was given legislative effect in the Financial Emergency Act, but that act wftuld never have passed the House had it not been for the assistance and co-operation of the Opposition led by Sir John Latham. If praise is to be bestowed for the inauguration of thc Premiers plan and the conversion of our internal indebtedness it must go, not to",24,Casey
119,Mr Casey,Who tilled the ground,25,Casey
120,Mr Hutchinson,"That is any party or any government, but to this Parliament aa a whole. Never, on the public platform or in this House, have I sought to detract from the merit of the part played Iby the right honourable member for Yarra at that time, but I maintain .that, had it heen left to his Government and his party, such measures as were necessary to save the country would never have been given effect. It is certain that the successful conversion of Australia's internal loans was not due to the fact that the Scullin .Government had strengthened our national credit, because only a little while before it had to pay 6 per cent, for money. That conversion was carried through successfully only because the people realized that a sacrifice on their part was necessary in order to reduce the burden of the national debt. The right honourable -gentleman also said that unemployment was no greator in Australia than elsewhere during the depression. The present Government has demonstrated beyond doubt that there were, in fact, two depressions in Australia, one caused by outside influences such as the collapse of export markets, and another superimposed on that, a psychological depression engendered by the failure of the Scullin Government to take immediately such steps as were necessary to meet the situation. This is borne out by the fact that in 1932, under the Lyons Government, although export prices were even lower than before, economic recovery began. A new atmosphere was created, and Australia began once more to go ahead. The claim has also been made that the Scullin tariff has been responsible for innities so that they may develop econocreased factory activity throughout Australia. As a matter of fact, there was never a more preposterous claim than that. The fact is that to-day the Scullin tariff has practically ceased to exist. No fewer than 2,000 alterations of it have been made, the embargoes and surcharges have been removed, and the tariff in operation to-day bears very little resemblance to the original. It was noticeable during the life of the Scullin Government that in no case were the claims made by tbe then Minister for Trade and Customs of the ' tariff ever borne out hy subsequent events. When he tabled a new schedule still further increasing duties, he promised that there would be an immediate increase of employment, hut almost invariably the exact reverse occurred. In contrast to that I point out that every prediction of the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has been more than fulfilled by the course of events. There can be no doubt that the secondary industries of Australia are flourishing under the present tariff, because factory employment has never been greater. The Government has been vigorously attacked by the Opposition because of its policy in regard to overseas borrowing. The right honourable member for Yarra condemned it for, as he put it, going back to the dope that nearly killed Australia in previous years. The idea of securing outside money is not new to many of us in the' course of our private undertakings. Honourable members opposite, of course, maintain that any borrowing from outside Australia is bad, but with that view I cannot agree. We have to realize that without capital from outside it would have been impossible for Australia to develop as it has done. Even the telephone standing on the table in front of me reminds me that the many thousands of miles of telephone lines, and the thousands upon thousands of telephones throughout the country, would not be there to give service to the people of Australia had it not been for the help of outside capital. It is held by leading economists all over the world that it is the duty of creditor countries to lend to the younger and more vigorous commumically. Many economists have asserted that the cessation of long-term lending definitely contributed to the depression hy the disorganization of the exchanees, and the destruction of international trading. It is true that money raised overseas should be placed in such a manner as to increase exports and that, in view of the already large external debt of Australia, care should be taken -not to increase it unduly. But the right honourable member for Yarra himself supplied the reason for the Treasurer's decision ( Mr Forde) on behalf to raise a. loan of £2,000,000 in Great Britain when he stated that the position of the London funds should be -watched very carefully, so that nothing would be done that would mean that our overseas position would become less secure. The right honourable gentleman spoke about the dangers of a reduction of the London funds and said that Australia should be in a position to stand up to a drought or other internal or external influences that would cause a reduction of the income from exports. With that I agree. Why the Treasurer ( Mr Oasey) has anticipated the borrowing overseas of only £2,000,000 sterling is because of the Government's desire to be able to huild up the overseas position into a sound state. borrowing ? ment is needed to the extent of about £2,000,000, which, if .paid for out of the show that with the exception of a few London funds, would bring about an undesired diminution of those funds which will be obviated by the raising of the money on the London loan market. Another reason for the decision to borrow the money abroad is the fact that the Commonwealth Government will not approach the Australian loan market this year for one penny except that required for farmers' debt adjustment. The total amount of borrowing for this financial year, Commonwealth and States, has been fixed at £16,000,000, and next year Australia will have to convert over £73,000,000 of internal debt. Australia is thus faced with the necessity to raise nearly £90,000,000 by December, 1938. It is absolutely essential to the Australian taxpayer that this enormous conversion should be made at as low a rate of interest day they cost ahout £16,000,000 a year, as is possible. Eveni per cent, would make an immense difference to the taxpayers. Advised probably by the Commonwealth Bank Board, the Government has decided that it must safeguard the Australian credit position in order to make that conversion and to raise the required £16,000,000 on as satisfactory a basis as possible. Those are the reasons for this proposed issue of treasury hills that will later be converted into a loan in London. There is no intention to embark upon any wild borrowing abroad. The lessons of the past have, heen learned and, whilst T. say that the wisdom of borrowing abroad can be substantiated to a degree, I agree that an excess of such borrowing would not be desirable. Nevertheless, in view of the need to conserve the London funds and for other reasons I have set out, the Government cannot be condemned in pursuing its present policy. Another point upon which the Government has been criticized is the high rate of expenditure. It has been held, quite correctly, that we are spending more money now than ever before in the history of the Commonwealth. Critics outside rather than inside this parliament have asked, "" Why not reduce the departmental votes and thereby save considerable sums of money which could be expended in the directions which the Government desires?"" An examination of the departmental votes since 1929 will departments the Commonwealth departments are being run at a much cheaper rate than they were previously. No person, therefore, could point out any great saving that could be made in that direction, and it is necessary to look in other directions for the cause of the increase of the cost of running this Commonwealth. The first cause is increased liability in respect of invalid and old-age pensions. I notided when the budget was being introduced that honourable members opposite were strangely quiet when the extra Is. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners was mentioned. Aa a matter of fact, their faces seemed to say "" I am sorry you have done that."" Pensions once cost this country somewhere between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000 a year. Towhich is a rise of between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000. Do honourable memhers opposite question this expenditure? Then we have defence. When I first came into this House the annual defence vote was about £3,000,000; this year it is to be £11,500,000, of which £6,000,000 will be found from revenue and £3,000,000 from the trust funds created from surpluses earned a few years ago. One important point in the budget is the fact that this year the Government will spend on public works about £7,750,000 from revenue, whereas previously expenditure on public works came from loan moneys. I think that fact",25,Casey

122,Mr Hutchinson,"Defenc e equipis a definite indication that the Government is pursuing a strong line of policy in regard to its nnances. Then there are some departments upon which additional money is being spent. The Health Department is one. The health of Australia to-day has assumed importance probably greater than in any other period. Money for health is being voted in ever increasing amounts. additional expenditure in respect of repatriation amounting to £1,400,000 more than four years ago. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will cost £170,000 this year, which is a substantial increase on votes in former years. Measures designed to produce oil in commercial quantities in Australia will Labour's policy on defence was formed absorb a further £334,000. All of the items which I have mentioned will bear criticism. These are the causes of the intimes since. The country is interested creased Commonwealth expenditure; it is not due to any negligent handling of the finances. The defence vote of £11,500,000 is the highest peace-time defence vote in the history of Australia. In 1935 I travelled through many European countries and found, without members will agree with me in thisa feeling in those countries that the British army and air force. In other words, Empire was becoming decadent. The pacifist policy adopted by Great Britain was leading to the belief abroad that it had lost its vigour, and there waa a feelOn the other side, we have the Labour ing among foreign nations that they would build on the. ruins of Mighty Albion. They believed that the British Lion was becoming old and mangy. Towards the end of 1935 Mussolini sent troops to Libya with a view to sweeping through Egypt to the Indian Ocean, but when the British Lion roared disapproval the dictators of Europe became embarrassed and fearful, and thereafter the world became less uneasy. Whatever we say about the position elsewhere, to-day, in Europe, it is easier, I believe, than it was in 1935. Undoubtedly, that is due in no small measure to the rearming of Great Britain and the British Empire. Nothing will contribute more to world peace than a strong co-operating British Empire. In those few words there is the basis of the defence policy of this Government, which is a policy of co-operatioa. the Kangaroo and less about the Lion. of the Kangaroo is largely bound up with the strength of the Lion.

That is the policy so far announced by the Labour party. The policy of declining to fight to save a neighbouring dominion, like New Zealand, will he branded as a most selfish one, and the policy of not fighting without a declaration from the ballot box will be branded as one of arrant cowardice.

The verdict of the people will be expressed in these terms: "" Go ye back, ye good and faithful servants, to the place whence ye came, and continue to advance the prosperity and welfare of the Australian people "". The honourable member for Indi( Mr out human life on a scale never preHutchinson), who harked back to the experiences of the years 1929 to 1931, evidently failed to remember that what then occurred was not in the nature of a "" bolt from the blue "", but was rather the accumulated results of the stupidities and contradictions of a system which is, and has been for many years, rotten at the core. The horrors of the years 1914 to 1918 were perpetrated purely and simply in the interests of the capitalistic profitmongers of the world, a gang which knows no nationality, colour, class or creed, but exploits all. Proof of that is to be found to-day in every publication, and in all the inquiries that have been made into what happened when, as the result of the operation of the capitalistic system, Christianity reverted to paganism, and the different races tore one another to pieces. The heritage of that holocaust of slaughter and expense was not reaped immediately. Any one who has the slightest knowledge of the economic history of the world knows that the aftermath of any war is felt many years after the war itself has ended; and, as the last war was unexampled in the intensity of the slaughter and hatred which characterized it, the aftermath was more intense than that of any other struggle in the history of the world. Those who took some account of the historical significance of events perhaps anticipated the aftermath earlier than it was experienced. I was one of them. I marvelled that the world could stagger under the load which had been piled on it up to that period. What has been experienced is the responsibility of a system which cares for nothing but profit. Anything that will make profit is good, whether that profit be derived from the manufacture of implements or the prostitution of science for the production of deadly gases to destroy human life. One of the latest boasted inventions of science I have no misgivings about is an airtight container in which the mothers of England can put their babies, and into which air can be pumped to keep them alive, when the next war occurs. Another of the boasted achievements of science is a gas-proof perambulator. The future citizens of Great Britain, and, I suppose, of the world, will be propelled in these when the "" Mad Mullahs"" again run rampant, and stamp viously reached. Honourable members talk of war as though it is inescapable. So long as there is talk of war, there will be war. If this Government and the governments of the world are prepared to spend on the propagation of peace and goodwill one quarter of the amount that they extract from the people for the piling up of armaments to keep alive hatreds, antagonisms and jealousies, war would soon be stamped out. It is the financier who first arouses the war scare, so that he may make loans to governments on which he may draw interest. The financial interests are interlocked and allied with all the armament rings of the world, and they encounter no opposition in their nefarious activities. That was proved long ago in the United States of America. It was then shown that when tenders were received from every armament firm in the world for over 100,000,000 dollars worth of contracts, there was not one cent difference between any of them. Having aroused a war scare and loaned money to governments, these interests then sell armaments to every country in the world, and derive profits from both transactions.

Neither the principles, the policy, nor the philosophy of the party to which I belong, in this or any other country, can be held responsible, because that party could exercise no control over any administration. The heritage that we reaped was the heritage of the system of capitalism under which* we live, and so long as that system continues, the events that have always. been associated with its operation will recur. The experiences of the yearB 1929 and onwards were the result of the mismanagement, not only of this country, hut also of every Minister( Mr Lyons) who is seldom in country in the world, and followed the operation of a policy that has its roots deep down in old paganisma policy which regards wealth as sacrosanct, and human life and well-being as of no account. The basic principle of paganism permeates every feature of this Government's economic policy. No charge can be laid against those who espouse the principles of Labour, except by lunatics, ignorant people, or liars, who deliberately better than those that existed in the days distort events. policy or philosophy cannot be blamed, because they have not been in operation long enough to make their imprint on the economic life of any country. All of those things of which honourable gentlemen opposite can boast, all of those things which sive as almost to make them fit subjects have a healthy influence in the national economy of this country, have been propagated and made popular by the party to which I belong. That is my answer to those honourable members who talk so much ahout the years 1929 to 1931. But what I want to refer to particuo'clock in the morning and travel long larly, is the astounding statement of the distances to commence work at 8 o'clock, Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkand then continue without a break until hill), supported by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), concerning the unexampled prosperity of Australia to-day. I ask the Treasurer: Is he, as an Australian, satisfied with the conditions under which our people are living? If he is, he is a poor 'statesman and a poorer Christian. His vision of nationhood is dimmed almost to blindness. Let the honourable gentleman forget London for a moment. Let him put out of his mind the cocktail parties and the feasts that he shared with the wealthy classes overseas. honourable gentleman about 1931. He and his class are responsible for what then happened. He knows that, and cannot deny it. He still stands for what made possible the happenings of that period. In a few more years, the perpetuation of the existing system will lead to another war with all the misery and desolation that are inseparable from war. In the name of the Australian people, I ask the honourable gentleman: Does he say that the conditions in Australia to-day are satisfactory? I ask the Prime this chamber nowadays: When he spoke in Queensland, to whom wa3 he speaking when he said that the lot of the Australian worker to-day was a. happy one? I ask these honourable gentlemen to forget their trips overseas and the banquets that they attended. Let them accompany me for a couple of days through miy electorate and the outskirts of Sydney. I shall show them conditions that are little Labour principles, of slavery. If any man says that they are good enough, I could wish that he would have to experience them himself. In some places, , there are as many as 500 or 600 men working , in slush, slime and filth, the odour from which is so offenfor a hospital.

129,Mr Lazzaeinl,"I have told themidday under tlie conditions that I have described. I do not believe that the slave labour which bnilt the pyramids in far distant times had to work under comparable conditions. The Treasurer talks of "" marching through the valley of despair, into the sunlight of prosperity "". He misrepresents the position and knows it. I ask him to read the Church Standard, which in one of its issues used a phrase that I quoted in this House a few weeks ago. Referring to certain men who are working under a government similar to the present Commonwealth Government, this publication used the descriptive phrase "" a valley of lost and forgotten men "". The sanitary conditions of their environment would arouse a feeling of horror in the breast of even an Indian coolie. The Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) stated in this House that 40 per cent, of Australian children are suffering from malnutrition, and apparently the right honourable gentleman regards that state of affairs as being satisfactory. he does not believe that when this vain boa3t echoes in the electorates, it will assist in the return to office of himself and the Government of which he is a member. I recall that government supporters unsuccessfully enunciated their policy to the voters of the Gwydir electorate who turned a deaf and offended ear to their proposals. infantile paralysis this afternoon, the right honourable gentleman mentioned that, in his opinion, the spraying of the nasal passages was a satisfactory method of treatment. majority of the workers were of a better class, the children better nourished, and their mothers given improved pre-natal treatment, I am confident that such epidemics as infantile paralysis would not stalk through our midst so often as they do. allow the present system of the housing of the workers to continue, the heritage -of older civilizations will be the outcome of this callous -disregard to the welfare of the masses. I invite the Treasurer to read the speeches and reports of those heroic people who are exposing the conditions which now exist in the slum areas bf Sydney. Does the Treasurer read only those documents which do not irritate a Ur. Lazaarvni. cultured gentleman, as no doubt he considers himself to be, because he is accustomed to the good things of life, and has had an easy passage so far as economic and social conditions are concerned? Does the recital of these human problems offend him, or is he endeavouring to hypnotize himself in order that he may always be able to regard life from a pleasant viewpoint? I remind the honourable gentleman that, in some of the slum areas in Sydney, four families are living in one house, and share the same sanitary convenience. Centuries ago such sanitary conditions caused epidemics and deadly plagues in Europe. _ The intense overcrowding in Australian cities will transplant to Australia those social evils which have wisely been abolished in older countries. In the sunlight and amid the beautiful shrubs of Canberra, my statements in respect of slum conditions may appear to be exaggerated, and that is one reason why some honourable members fail to realize that such conditions exist in Surely this fair land. I therefore remind honourable members that I am in constant association with unfortunate persons who are living in slum areas, and who are subject to the insanitary conditions which I have described. I visited a relief workers' encampment, where the homes consisted of bags and iron nailed to four upright posts sunk in the ground. For a few weeks Referring to these poor huts are inhabited by one set of workers, whose places will then be taken by other relief workers. When the job is completed the huts are dismantled, and the nails are ripped from the iron so If the homes of the that when it is used later in the erection of further huts, rain pours through the nail holes. I emphasize these statements, because honourable gentlemen who support the Government claim that the workers are happy under their present conditions, and that we are now passing through a If the Government be content to period of unexampled prosperity. I realize that the Treasurer has known no social conditions other than those of prosperity. He has referred with pride to the increased employment in factories. According to the census figures, 1,300,000 factory hands in Australia earn less than £2 a week, but no doubt that form of employment and remuneration suits this Federal Government. For years it has been contemplating the introduction of an unemployment insurance scheme of which it has been said for the last twenty years in Germany that, "" its benefits yield on trucks to the seaboard for shipment not enough on which to live, but just too much on which to starve."" The fact that 130,000 factory hands are receiving les3 than £2 a week is a return to the had old days of 50 years ago. In Sydney, girls between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years are being employed in factories, but as soon as they become entitled to the payment of a little more money, they are dismissed and new hands are engaged. That is employment of the type that the Treasurer would persuade this Commonwealth Parliament to encourage What will be the social condition of Australia in another 30 years, when two-thirds of, the younger generation of the present day will be the fathers and mothers of children ? The Treasurer referred to the increased investments in the building trade. In respect of New South Wales the principal building activities have been £11,000,000 on the destruction of their confined to the renovation of shop fronts, and the erection of great palatial business houses, because the capitalistic interests are taking advantage of the opportunity to pay lower wages to the workers and of a reduced cost of building materials. A few new hotels are also being erected by breweries, but the majority of buildings for the dwellings of workers has heen limited to the poor huts constructed by the Stevens Government, doubtless with Commonwealth money. The Anglican newspaper, the Church Standard, has severely castigated those responsible for these structures. With the approach of the federal elections, the Government will certainly make lavish promises in the hope of being returned for another term of office. Before the last elections, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would spend £20,000,000 on the erection of homes. At the present time he can .point to the proposed expenditure <rf £11,000,000, presumably for the destruction of homes. The right honourable gentleman is impressing upon Australians that we have to defend this country, and he has hinted that a great power in the Pacific is the one from which we have most to fear. While I was participating in the Gwydir by-election campaign, I saw persons who were offering to purchase any supplies of old rusted iron which they proposed to rush to Japan. From Yampi Sound, in Western Australia, iron is pouring in .shiploads into that country. I remind honourable memhers that Japan is destitute of this mineral and unless it imported iron, it could not make a battleship or a gun. Although we are told to prepare for war, we are selling to a potentially hostile nation the materials with which to create guns and battleships which may belch shells and poison gas on our shores. It will be nice indeed for the parents of Australian soldiers and for the troops themselves who are being slaughtered, to know that the engines of war opposed to them, were made from iron in the same way as British guns sold to the Turks mowed down Australian sons on Gallipoli. After a period of six years of office all that the Government can tell the electors is that it proposes to spend homes. The whole position is ludicrous in the extreme; it is a screaming farce. While we propose to build battleships and aeroplanes for the defence of Australia, we pay not the slightest heed to the physical condition of our people, which will be one of the principal factors in the salvation of Australia against an aggressor. I invite the Treasurer, instead of speaking in a well-lighted hall or from a padded chair in a comfortable studio upon the -unexampled prosperity of Australia, to accompany me through the electorate of Werriwa, and through various parts adjacent to Sydney, involving a distance of 100 miles, in order to study at first-hand the conditions of fhe workers there. If , after that survey, the honourable gentleman has the audacity to repeat his claim that the country has emerged into unexampled prosperity, I shall be satisfied that he has more "" hide "" that any other man whom I have met. As on previous occasions, the Administration has bolstered up its case with the same hoary, stupid references to improved employment as revealed in the trade union figures. I personally consider that this source of information has been drawn on more than enough, but I contend emphatically that for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to assert that unemployment has beeii reduced to the extent that the figures indicate, is a misGovernment proposes again to go on the representation of the true position. It is overseas market for loan requirements. high time that the trade unions woke up to the fact and refused to issue to the Commonwealth Statisticianfigureswhich, they are well aware, are misleading, in order to enable the Government to boast about using trade union data with which to bolster up its case. Such figures do not convey anything like the true state of affairs. Tens of thousands of Australians never had an opportunity to become members of a union and many trade unionists who were registered on union books between 1929 ancl 1931 have drifted into relief work. unions do not submit the returns to the Commonwealth Statistician. others have large numbers written off their books. In a number of instances, ex-unionists are endeavouring to .scratch a living as poultry farmers in the Suthercould for itself. The Sydney Morning land Shire. When the anti-Labour government abolished rural awards in New South Wales land. government restored the awards in Queensland. awards in New South Wales affected many bush workers who ceased to belong to unions. Thousands of men throughout Australia are involved in similar circumstances, ancl they have been put on relief work. Both the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales, who have put them on to this abomination at Cook's River, near Campsie, claim that they have thereby relieved unemployment, but the relief worker will know what to do at the forthcoming elections. When the Treasurer is speaking in his electorate and elsewhere on behalf of the United Australia party, I wonder whether he will say, as he has stated in this House, that relief work is relieving unemployment ancl is giving a standard of unexampled prosperity to the workers. No other impression can be gained from the honourable gentleman's statement in the budget speech. The right honourable member for Yarra. these cheques came hack through the ( Mr Scullin) referred to the policy of underwriters, the London and West"" borrow and bust"". I regret that the The honourable member for Henty( Sir Heiiiy Gullett), who probably has not studied our problems for any length of time, referred to the procuring of new money as though we obtained from overseas a roll of sovereigns when we borrowed money. As the result of the borrowing policy in the past, Australia has been hied white. When I listened to the Treasurer explaining what Australia owes to the rest of the world, I wondered whether any red blood remained in our veins. In the 'fifties, Disraeli said in the House of Commons, crystallizing the opinion of the British capitalists at that time: ""These cursed colonies are millstones around our neck."" Great Britain, at that time, took every British soldier in Australia back to Great Britain and, in effect, told Australia to do the best it Herald and the Melbourne Argus at that time wailed about the manner in which Australia had been left undefended, hut a Scotchman in the country, the Rev. Dunmore Lang, proved himself to be a better Australian than many people who had been born here. He The abolition of rural wrote a. series of articles which was afterwards published in a pamphlet entitled "" The Future History of the United Provinces of thc Republic of Australia,"" in which he said that Australia could look after itself. Two or three years later, gold was discovered here and tens of thousands of people came to the country to join in the gold rush. The mountains were crossed and the wonderful resources of the continent were revealed. British capitalists then once more became the champions of Australia. They took our gold overseas and we heard a great deal about the necessity to have gold as the basis for our currency. About £500,000,000 of gold was taken from Australia and we were given printed notes for it. The currency was inflated again and again as our gold was shipped away. In place of our gold, we had given to us cheques on London banks. When, say, £10,000,000 worth of",30,Casey

All that Australia actually received through the degradation of the peoples for its gold was a few figures sent by cable from Great Britain. The country has been pawned over and over again to pay interest on these phantom loans, in order to feed, not the British people at large, for 95 per cent, of them suffer as we ourselves do, but to feed a few polyglot financiers who are merely money changers and money mongers without country, class, colour, or creed. One of these gentlemen has said "" My country is where I work, and I work everywhere."" This gentleman has had a title conferred on him by almost every country in the world, including Japan, China, and Eussia prior to the revolution. What does such loyalty? The Attorney-General told us the other day that it was stupid to say that the King of England could go to war although the King of Australia, who, of course, is the same individual, could remain at peace. The King's person never goes to war; but some honourable gentlemen opposite use the King to serve their own unmoral and unethical ends'. The King can neither start nor stop a war. He might be the most peaceful man in the world, and his heart might bleed because of the slaughter of his subjects; but if the financial ring, or the armaments ring, said there must be war, war would occur in spite of what the King might say. I suppose honourable members opposite will say on the hustings in a few weeks' time that we are disloyal, and they will drag the King's name into their addresses; but it will be they who are disloyal in so using the King's person, ]STo decent people would do so. That is my answer to honourable gentlemen opposite who accuse the Labour party of disloyalty. We are loyal to the workers of every country and particularly to those of our own national outlook and attitude of mind. When we attack the great financial institutions of the world we are not attacking the people of any particular nation. We all know that it was the international financiers who made possible the holocaust of 1914. The same international group reaped vast [IS] financial benefits from the unholy activities of those years, and they are still taking to themselves economic advantages of the world. These same people arc to-day preparing for a new Armageddon and are doing it in the name of loyalty and patriotism. They are cornered, altd once again they will demonstrate thc truth of Dr. Johnson's famous saying: "" The Plea of Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."" not propose to make any comment upon the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini). I wish to give my attention principally to the parabolical orchard described for us yesterday by the right honourable memb,er for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who pictured in a most an individual know about plausible manner the beauty and potential profit of this metaphorical property which once belonged to him. The right honourable gentleman appeared to be greatly hurt because the Government had uot given any credit to the Scullin Government for the success which had attended its conduct of the orchard which he himself had planted. Personally I would not deprive the right honourable gentleman of any of the credit due to him for the aGtion he took on that occasion, hut one thing is certain; he did not do what was done at that time with thc support of his own party. It was done with the support of the Opposition of the day. Therefore, whatever credit attaches to the preparation of the groxmd and the planting of the orchard should be shared by both parties. The right honourable gentleman told us that he cleared the ground and planted the trees. WhatI should like to know is what would have happened had he continued to be the husbandman. How would he have treated the orchard? Would he have pursued the policy adopted by him. The right honourable gentleman said that he was pleased and proud of the position disclosed in the budget. This Government, therefore,, must have managed the orchard as the right honourable gentleman himself would have done; otherwise he would scarcely have expressed his pride at the results achieved. But would he have pursued a similar policy ?",33,Casey

I am sorry that the right honourable gentleman is not in the House at the moment. honourable member for Eorrest would noi be attacking him. worthy of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens). I have done nothing to keep the right honourable member for Yarra out of the House. [Quorum formed']. The Opposition winces under argument. It winces whenever the splendid position revealed by the budget is referred to by honourable members on this side of the chamber. It winces when invalid and old-age pensions are increased. It realizes that its thunder is being stolen. The right 'honorahle member for Yarra has admitted that the Government has. developed the orchard in a splendid way. WhatI fear is that if he had been left in charge of it a very different result would have followed. Honourable gentlemen opposite have frequently said that the Ottawa Agreement was against the interests of Australia and beneficial to the interests of the In connection with old-age pensioners, we British manufacturers. argued again and again that the reduction of the Scullin duties would prove ruinous to our secondary industries; yet statistical information at our hand indicates that the number of employees in the, factories in this country is greater than ever before. What really happened when the Scullin Government introduced its policy of embargoes and high duties? Over £20,000,000 in tariff revenue alone was lost and that had to he replaced by revenue raised by sales tax, primage duties and increased direct taxes. Because of that increased taxation during a period of depression, the people were losing faith in this country, and if further increases had been made Australia would have gone from bad to worse. I could criticize this Government, as I could criticize any human agency, in respect of quite a number of its actions, ibut speaking by and large it has taken up the work of tilling the orchard to which the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) referred in his parable yesterday, and it is doing that work in a statesmanlike way with beneficial results to the people of Australia. I now wish to direct a few remarks to the Minister representing the Postmaster General. I feel, that the Postmaster General's Department in recent years has been adopting somewhat of a cheeseparing policy in respect of the extension of postal and telephonic services. It has made considerable profits. I have never held the belief that the department should be a taxing machine, but we are too often reminded of. the expenditure involved when, requests are made for postal and telephonic facilities for thoso people who arc blazing the track in sparsely settled areas -Tliose people certainly need modern means of communication in order that they may keep in touch with the rest of civilization and may be able to communicate with their tradespeople and their friends, and, in an emergency, with tlieir medical advisers. The department can be a penny wise and a pound foolish in neglecting to extend these facilities to the areas I havo indicated. I hope that the Government will recognize the importance to these people of such communications. They have heard much concerning those pioneers who blazed the track, but I assure honorahle members opposite that there are many who are still blazing the track in Western Australia under thc most difficult of living conditions. It is on their behalf that I make this appeal, and I hope that in tlie coming year greater consideration will be giveu to them. The department should not hesitate to extend postal and telephonic facilities to people living in the outback not only in Western Australia but also in all parts of Australia.",34,Casey

138,Mr Prowse,"That remark is notI should like to direct the attention of the House to the provisions of two ordinances recently promulgated, and applying to the Federal Capital Territory, each of which is known as an Unlawful Assemblies Ordinance The two ordinances were made within less than one month of each other. known as Ordinance No. 9 of 1937, has been considerably modified, and all I should like to say about it is that a more oppressive piece of legislation could not be conceived. It has been modified by another ordinance made on the 18th August, 1937, known as No. 14 of 1937, which follows very closely the provisions of the Victorian Unlawful Assemblies Act. It provides that a meeting of a certain number of persons cannot ho held within 100 yards of this Parliament House building, with the object of achieving an unlawful purpose, or of achieving what thc regulation describes as an unlawful purpose. It prescribes a regulation dealing with persons who have no representation in this legislature and no vote at all, and whose only means of protecting their interests is in making representations to this Parliament and to its members. These are the unlawful purposes made by this regulation for which more than 20 persons are forbidden to meet within 100 yards of this Parliament HousePor the purpose of making known their grievances. For the purpose of discussing public affairs or matters of public interest. ( If that is done by the voteless residents of Canberra it is unlawful.) For the purpose of considering, preparing, or presenting .any petition, memorial, complaint, remonstrance, declaration or other address to His Majesty or to the Governor General, or to both Houses or either House of the Parliament, or to any Minister or officer of the Commonwealth, for the repeal or enactment of any law, or for the alteration of matters of State. If more than 20 persons assemble within 100 yards of Parliament House for the carrying on of such discussions, or making such representations, they are engaged in an unlawful purpose ancl are participants in an unlawful assembly, and are liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months. This regulation has only one Australian precedent, and only two in the world. The one Australian precedent is in the State of Victoria. This Parliament sat in Victoria for over a quarter of a century ancl never at any time did it find The first, it necessary to place upon the statute book any legislation like this. It never passed any act prohibiting any person from meeting, within a certain distance of Parliament House. Thero was an act passed in 1865 by the Victorian Parliament, and that act applied to the site occupied by the present Victorian House of Parliament, which was formerly the Federal House of Parliament. But when the Federal Parliament sat in Melbourne the Victorian legislature amended its own act excluding the site of the Federal Parliament House ancl applying that prohibition to the Exhibition site, where the Victorian Parliament was then housed. The Federal Parliament did not find it necessary to pass any enactment providing that no meeting could be held within a certain distance of Parliament House. There is no similar legislation in any other State hut Victoria, nor is there any similar legislation in the dominion of New Zealand. I doubt whether I could find similar legislation anywhere except in Victoria, as I have already stated, and Great Britain. The British legislation was adopted in 1817. Honourable members will be familiar with the class of legislation passed by that Parliament at that time. If they have forgotten it, I should like to quote a survey of the legislation passed contemporaneously with legislation of this kind by the British Parliament. Sir Erskine May, in his Constitutional History of England 17G0-19U, describing the act of 1817 and the circumstance's in which it was passed, says as follows:It was proposed to extend the acts of 1795 and 1700, against corresponding societies, to other political .clubs and associations, whether affiliated or not; to suppress the Spenoean clubs, to regulate meetings of more than 50 persons, to licence debating societies; and, lastly, to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. The act of 1817 provided that a public meeting of more than 50 persons could not be held to discuss anything unless notice of it had been advertised in a 9",35,Casey
139,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [5.49],"daily newspaper, with the signatures of seven householders. That notice had to be sent to a clerk of the peace, who sent it to three justices in order that the meeting be subject to supervision. The quotation I have given indicates the class of legislation which was being enacted in Great Britain when a law similar to -the Unlawful Assemblies Ordinance of the Eederal Capital Territory was passed. When the Victorian Parliament amended its legislation in 1903, so as to apply its provisions to the Exhibition site, and not to the site of the Parliament House occupied by the Eederal Parliament, Mr abide hy it. Unfortunately, the Acts Donald Mackinnon, afterwards Attorney General in Victoria, saidI think it is extremely doubtful whether it is. desirable that this legislation, which originated in tlio reign of George III . in a time of panic, should be adopted. I do not think it is necessary. In 1865 we adopted the act of George III . I should have thought it would be better to allow legislation passed at tlie instance of Lord Castlereagh, in a time of panic, to sink into oblivion. This legislation was enacted in Britain at a time when all sorts of oppressive acts were being passed directed at every popular movement under the act of 1817. Even friendly societies found that they could not recover funds unless they were registered, or protect members, because their societies were illegal. In fact, when the formation of the Australian Natives Association was proposed, advice was given that such a body would bring itself under the provisions of the act, if it attempted to extend its activities. Yet that kind of legislation has been adopted by the democratic Parliament of Australia, and applied to persons who have no vote, who can look only -to this legislature for protection, ancl who cannot make their influence felt by their vote, but must rely on representations to members. This legislation would prevent a deputation of more than twenty persons coming together within the forbidden radius with the object of making know their grievances. If they did they would constitute an unlawful assembly. They would constitute an unlawful assembly if they came to this House to interview members and lay their grievances before them, and would be guilty of an unlawful purpose If r . Hlavkburn. in trying to get consideration for their grievances by this Parliament or this Government. It seems to me that this legislation was conceived in the same spirit which has dictated the arbitrary acts this Government has taken in recent years. The original ordinance could not be tolerated for.ono minute; I do not think that the Government would dare to face this House with the first ordinance; but the present ordinance is bad enough; it is a disgrace to this House and to members of this House who are willing to Interpretation Act 1937 not being yet in force, we have no opportunity to move for the disallowance of this ordinance. I should have been happy to move in that direction, because I regard it as a piece of arbitrary impudence on the part of any legislature to say to the people that they shall not approach it. I believe that the people have the right to approach it. Electors have the right to approach this Parliament and lay their grievances before members or the Government. In Victoria, where legislation of this kind exists, no attempt, to my knowledge, has been made to enf orce it. Large numbers of people approach members of the Victorian Parliament to lay before them their grievances, and large numbers themselves against defaulting visit the Victorian Treasury Buildings, which are within the forbidden area, for a similar purpose. But here, in the Federal Capital Territory, where the people are voteless, they are told that, if more than twenty of them assemble within 100 yards of Parliament House, for any political purpose, or to discuss their grievances, or to make representations to any member of Parliament, or to the Executive, they are concerned in an unlawful assembly and are guilty of an unlawful purpose, for which severe penalties are provided. I hope that this ordinance will be withdrawn by the Government. There is no need for it. The legislatures of the States do not need to hide from their electors in this way. When this Parliament sat in Melbourne it did not need to do that a either, and"" I suggest that, if the people affected 'by this ordinance had a vote, this Government would not pass it. It is.only for the reason that these people have no vote, and, to that extent, no strange is it that although one might control over this Parliament, or the think that the parliamentary members Government, that this ordinance has been of the party should control it, as made. 16.0] I rise to take part in this debate party operates and the machine operates because of certain very obvious inconthat a Labour government might be gruities that have manifested themselves obliged to give effect to a policy which in statements made by honourable members not one of its members could motally supopposite, particularly in the statements port.

It is well to remember that members of that party are to-day strongly criticizing the Government for its financial policy. Yet the outside interests, including trade unions, could determine the policy of the Labour Government without asking the Prime Minister for his views. This example reveals how literally any Labour leader is fortuitously obliged to follow the injunction contained in the old French proverbI am the leader, tlierefore I follow. A couple of days later, a conference convened by the South Australian Labour party executive-not e that, the South Australian executive-and attended by members of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, thc Federal Australian Labour party executive, and the New South Wales Australian Labour party executive, was held in Sydney. The conference lost no time in dictating to the Commonwealth Government. Mr J. J. Graves, of Sydney, who presided, announced at the outset that it was essential that Mr Scullin should give a clear declaration of policy. Then he proceeded to attack the Government. He was followed by Mr Chifley, the then Minister for Defence, who was my predecessor in this House. That gentleman dramatically announced that, notwithstanding his personal views, he would be guided by the majority decisions of the conference. The Melbourne Argus in ai report of the meeting, saidWhatever views of national importance U r . Scullin might have had to place beforo the electors of Parkes may have to lie subordinated to the definite orders emanating from the Sew South Wales Labour machine. It is possible, however, that Mr Scullin may decide to uphold the dignity of the Prime Ministership nnd refuse to accept dictation from a section of the party whose activities are the result of secret organizing which hits extended over nearly the whole period of Mr Scullin's ahsence from Australia. A supporter of Mr was a lueasure that was to have a vital Scullin's pointed out that thc question of inflation was nover included in the policy speech delivered by Mr Scullin, and if he acted in strict accord with Labour principles lus could refuse to take any notice of thc New Soutli Wales section. The right honourable memher for Yarra, of course, as are all leaders of the Labour Mr John La-icson. party, was a hapless victim of the machine which operates from outside Parliament. Subsequent events showed how impossible it was for the right honourable gentleman to disobey the dictates of these outside bodies. The Labor Daily, reporting the Sydney conference, saidOn the niotion of Mr Lazzarini it was agreed that the decision of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions be the financial policy of thc party in the federal sphere. There were very few dissentients. Accordingly, this means that the Government extends credit to the extent of £20,000,000. Of course, the right honourable member protested-as any self-respecting leader would protest. But his protests were of no avail, although he stoutly affirmed that he would not accept dictation. He delivered a speech in Melbourne, in which he pleaded with all the emotion which he displayed here yesterday for the right to exercise the responsibility of leadership. Could there bo imagined a more humiliating spectacle of a Prime Minister, even though it be a Labour Prime Minister, publicly pleading for the right which should be accorded any .Prime Minister without question.

I believe that tlie history of the Scullin Government and of that measure should be written in letters of fire in every That decision was reached at a meeting home in thc Commonwealth. There were numerous other instances of domination by outside forces during thc unhappy regime of the Scullin Government. For instance, in September, 1930, the secretary of the Sydney Labour Council, Mr J. S. Garden, who was not then a member of this Parliament, but who enjoyed vastly greater power as secretary of the Sydney Labour Council than he has ever possessed as a member of this .House, announced that members of the Federal Government who attempted to give eifect to the Niemeyer decisions would be automatically placed outside the Labour movement-. "" There is no bluff about it,"" said Mr Garden, "" the Federal Government must break with Niemeyer, entirely and finally."" In obedience to those instructions the Labour party did as they were told. Earlier in the same yoar, the New South ""Wales Labour party executive had discussed methods of enforcing their demands on thefederal pxecutive for drastic action in the coal dispute, and one member of the executive tabled notice of a motion calling upon the Federal Treasurer to show cause why he should not be dealt with for having failed to attend a certain coal conference. There was also a move to summon all Federal Ministers and members from New South Wales to a special meeting of the Australian Labour party executive to discuss methods for giving effect to the decisions of the conference. A report published at the time statedA. small but important section of the Ausclusion that heroes would not have yielded tralian Labour party executive favours the t.o the union bosses of the day as they did. adoption of immediate disciplinar}' measures The real heroes of those times were the utrainst Federal Ministers. Of course, honourable members opposite those of his colleagues who decided to will say that I am now reciting the unhappy history of by-gone days, and the preseut Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) would have us believe that things are now quite different. In answer to that suggestion I quote the following from thc preface of a booklet recently published by the Leader of the Opposition himselfIs'o State executive may direct members of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party in regard to mutters affecting thc federal platform inid/oipropose legislation which the Federal Parliamentary Labour party haa to deal with in the legislature. of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party in Sydney on the 27th April. As a matter offact, it is so much balderdash. It is merely camouflage. What it really means is that the Federal Parliamentary Labour party will be controlled by the federal executive, and tlie federal executive, as honourable members are well aware, is a body composed entirely of persons who are not members of the Federal Parliament. In other words, the elected representatives of the people would have little or no say in what a. Federal Labour government would do. Its actions would be dictated by the. gentlemen who meet behind closed doors in the Trades Hall and other offices throughout the States. Every member of the Labour party knows well that when the Leader of the Opposition makes his policy speech in the forthcoming federal election campaign he will be making it with his tongue in his cheek, ancl with the knowledge that he may be compelled at any moment to vary or completely reverse that declared policy. He will know that his ability to implement his policy will depend on the decision sf the union bosses in the various parts of the Commonwealth. Therefore, when we see persons like the right honourable member for Yarra and the Deputy Leader' of the Opposition strutting like heroes in this House as they did yesterday, and calling for recognition of the service? which they .rendered to the country in the years 1930 and 1931, we are forced to the melancholy conpresent Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), and 416 defy the union bosses, and discharge their responsibilities to the people of the Commonwealth. They vindicated the widely held tenet that courage is the greatest of all the virtues, and the most important thing in life, because it was their courageous action which saved this country. It was they who prevented the economic edifice of Australia from becomunder five year3 of age were suffering ing a shambles. It was they who saved hundreds of thousands of people from becoming a bankrupt and ruined rabble. Paradoxically enough, however, they have never sought recognition for . what they did, nor asked for appreciation, and probably they w ill never receive more than a fraction of the recognition which is their due for the services they rendered to the Commonwealth in those days. The honorahle member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) was evidently at a loss for a convincing argument why the Government should continue to hold, the confidence of the people. He occupied the whole of his time with a recital of what happened in the years gone by, but 'had nothing to say about the SupplyB ill which we are ostensibly discussing. According to the speeches of Government supporters we are to believe that present conditions in Australia are normal, and that the people have no reason to expect any improvement under existing conditions. conditions as they are. supporters an endeavour to show that the economic position of Australia is much better now than it was, and that the era of prosperity has returned. They have said, among other things, that the depression began in 1929. beginning of the depression for me. I had gone through many depressions before then, and there are thousands in Australia to-day who are still in the depths of depression.

The honourable member for Macquarie had a great deal to say about the domination of the Lahour party by outside influences, hut let us consider for a moment thc influences which dominate the Government at tke present time. Eor my part, I should much prefer to take instructions from workers' organizations which exist for the purpose of raising livin g standards than from those interests from which the Government must take its instructions. Only recently the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Eadden) said that the Government was being supported by the blood-sucking interests of the city, but I pass over that for the moment because he is only a junior member of his party. I shall quote the opinion of no less a person than the Assistant Ministerf or Commerce( Mr Thorby), who is reported in the Northern, Daily Leader, a newspaper controlled by the honourable member for Then let us examine the New England( Mr Thompson), as Govermnent followshave quoted figures in AT BEAD END-FEDKKAI , MINISTRT-LOS T Dubbo, Friday. "" I tliink the man realizes in his own heart, that he is up against a dead-end as Prima Minister cf Australia.

Mr Lyons has no policy, and never had one -His policy is laid down by the Chamber of Manufactures in Melbourne and he cannot deny it,"" said Mr Thorby. 1 must explain to honorable members that that was before the honourable member was admitted to the Cabinet. Evidently those members of the Country party who say that they place principles before portfolios have been practising this policy for many years. The following remarks in regard to the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) were made in this House by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane):In the New South Wales Parliament about twelve years ago, two farmers were admitted to the Fuller Government in return for the Country party's support. Tho honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) barged his way into a ministry on the promise of thc Country party's support. Thc honourable memher for Darling Downs also made certain references to the present Government when he was trying to tickle thc ears of the electors in his constituency. He then saidThe United Australia party gave its allegiance to the big financial and manufacturing interests of thc cities and to the middlemen and monopolists, because it received its support and power from thoso people. How, then, oould the United Australia party serve the countryside as well as .those in the city who sucked the life blood from the countryside? l i you put a United Australia party man into the Federal House to represent the Darling Downs, you are going to give your allegiance to your political enemies-the manufacturing nnd commercial groups and the middlemen. No man associated with the United Australia partya party backed and influenced by city interests-coul d conscientiously serve city inmission, recommended that certain action terests and ambitions, and at the same time adequately realize what the countryside required in the way of legislation. The Minister for Health-( Mr Hughes), when Tunning as an independent candidate for the North Sydney seat a few years ago, made some very slashing attacks on the present Government and the interests outside this Parliament which control it. T heard the honourable member for Macquarie refer to meetings held by trade union representatives, at which the future policy of the Labour party was discussed. As a matter of fact, they acted perfectly within their rights, because the trade union movement constitutes the backthose who compose the Government forces are not . prepared to tell us from whom they take their instructions. They go to such fashionable clubs as the 'Savage Club in Melbourne, of which the Attorney-General is a member,' the Melbourne Cluh, and the Millions Club and Australian Club in Sydney, which consist of the anti-Labour exploiters of the community. Let us consider for a moment one or two incidents which show how faithfully the Government has served .those interests. During the life of this Parliament, the present Eederal Treasurer ( Mr Casey) introduced a measure which, I believe, was entitled an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Some years ago, a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the operation of Commonwealth and State taxation laws, and as a result of its findings and the pressure of the Labour opposition the Government was forced because of fear of exposure to take certain action. On the 5th July, 1934, the particular bill to which I have referred was introduced into this House. The royal commissioners had drawn the attention of the Government to the fact that there, had been large-scale tax evasions by its supporters. Large companies had made distributions from their profits, not only by way of dividends, but also by the issue of bonus shares. Previously, profits distributed by way of bonus shares were not taxable, and consequently these wealthy concerns had escaped the payment of a considerable amount of tax to the Commonwealth. The royal comshould be taken not later than the 31st December, 1933. When the Treasurer introduced the measure into this Hous* on the 5th July, 1934, he was questioned as to why the Government had delayed its introduction beyond the time recommended by the royal commission, and his reply was that the Government had many more important matters to deal with before it reached that particular measure. accuracy of what I say. The honourable gentleman was questioned from this aide",41,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack
146,Mr Casey,That is untrue.,42,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack
147,Mr Waed,"Hansard will prove thoof the House as to what had occasioned the delay in introducing legislation to prevent large-scale tax evasions by the friends of the Government ancl those who provide its political funds. These interests dominate the Grovernment, and give directions as to what particular policy shall be pursued. If the Treasurer wishes to make an explanation, let him explain to honourable members what he has so far failed to explain, namely, why on the 22nd July-seventee n days after he had introduced the bill-h e brought down an amendment of it? The bill provided that profits distributed by way of bonus shares should be taxable in the same way as were profits distributed by way of dividends. The amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman provided that that particular provision should not operate until the 31st December, 1934. that amendment? It meant that the Government gave six mouths' notice to its political friends and supporters of what it intended to do, so that those wealthy concerns, might be able to get rid of the loot which they had taken from the people of this country before they were compelled by this legislation to pay tax on it. The members of the Labour party at the time wanted to know who were the influential people who had been able to induce the Treasurer to make this alteration of a measure that he himself had introduced. admitted that representations had heen made, and said that the Government considered that the request for an extension of the period was a reasonable one. memher to read Hansard on the point. happened. The Treasurer suggested that only Labour members would consider that there was anything wrong in the transaction. Prowse) -Order! I ask the Treasurer not to continue interjecting. Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the directors of which are supporters of the Government;-the Fairfaxes, Sir Norman Kater, and the Knox family-mad e the largest distribution of undistributed profits, by way of bonus shares, that had ever been made in the history of this country. Let the Treasurer deny that. By issuing 292,500 shares, this wealthy concern doubled its share issue. For every share already held, a bonus share was issued. Thc nominal value of its shares was £20, but they were quoted on the market at the time at a figure in the vicinity of £58. But even taking them a t their face value, the effect was that this company, by the mere stroke of a pen, doubled its capital; and upon this watered capital the consumers of sugar, those who grow the cane in Queensland, and the workers who are exploited in the industry, have to provide the large dividends which are paid in season and out of season. This Government allowed that large concern to escape without the payment of one penny by way of tax on profits that had been earned in previous years. The protest of the honourable member for Macquarie against the proposal of tlie Scullin Administration to issue fiduciary notes to an amount of £20,000,000, was rather laughable. That proposal simply meant an increase of the national debt of this country by the amount stated. For what purpose? To assist the primary producers, whom, he says, he is interested in assisting, and to enable unemployed workers to obtain work. What is the difference when the national debt is increased by the process The honourable gentleman decided upon by the Labour Government or the process of floating loans supported by members of this Government? The only difference is that no interest is payable upon that portion of thc national debt which is represented by the note issue, and that is why the Government does not want such a process to be adopted in the carrying out of national undertakings in this country. It does not care to what extent capital is increased by a private company uncier the protection of the Government, nor does it mind what national works are undertaken so long as the "" moneybags "" can invest their capital, in them, and obtain a rake-off from the labour' of others.

Yet Mr whereas in 1934-35 the proportion was Ince, the 'appointee, not of the Labour party, but of the present Government, had the following to say about his figures, in the report that he submitted to adult wages but was due largely to an the Government upon unemployment i nsuranceThe absence of satisfactory statistics throughout Australia as to the rate of unemaccomplishment, let it tell the public so. ployment makes it a matter of much diftirulty to determine on what rate to base the finances of a scheme. statistics. ([notation in order that the Treasurer, dense though he is, may be able to assimilate it. Mr Ince saidThe almemie of satisfactory statistics throughout Australia not in the Statesas to the rate of unemployment makes it a matter of much difficulty to determine on what rate to base the finances of a scheme. Evidently, therefore, we cannot accept the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician in relation to unemployment. The position can be accurately gauged only by taking a census of thc people. When the oonsils was taken in 1933, we found that slightly under 1,000,000 breadwinners were receiving less than £1 a week, and 481,000 breadwinners were fully unemployed, while this so-called "" prosperity "" Government was in oflice. The latest figures available, which constitute a record, disclose that there are 305 old age pensioners and 119 invalid pensioners to every 10,000 of the population. Those figures conclusively prove that conquestion. If conditions generally have ditions in this country have become worse, because it is only when times are bad that the number of applicants for a pension is abnormally increased. By quoting figures in relation to factory employment, the Treasurer and ministerial supporters have attempted to make it appear that because a little more employment has been provided, the people generally are much better off. As a matter of fact the latest figures disence with the liberty of the subject, by close that in 1930-31 the percentage of child labour employed in Australia was 4.06, but in 1934-35 statistics show that the percentage had increased to 5.84 per cent. The proportion of female adult The Treasurer set this labour to male adult labour employed in Australia in 1931 was 100 to 265, 100 to 254, proving conclusively that this increase of employment had not been given to adult Australians receiving increase of female and child labour. If the Government desires to consider the sweating of female and child labour an To show that there is justification for my statement, I point out that the average wage in Australia in 1930-31 was £193.88 but in 1934-35 it had been reduced to £169.34, showing conclusively that this large increase of employmentthat had taken place was actually of very little benefit to the people who were performing that work. In respect qf the position in JNew South Wales in 1929, I find that 185,000 employees of factories earned an average wage of £208 a year, or £4. a week: yet in 1936, the number of these employees had risen to 197,000an increase of 12,000-bu t the average wage dropped to £170 a year, or £3 5s. a week. The total wages paid in 1929 amounted to £38,545,000, but in 1936 the figures had decreased to £33,298,000, despite the faot that there were 12,000 more employed. That should -be sufficient proof to show that the workers of Australia have not derived tbe benefits from this increase of employment which members .of the Government suggest has taken place in Australia. BeforeI pass to other matters in which the Government has been active during recent years. I desire to ask it a become so prosperous in Australia, why did the Government introduce in the Federal Capital Territory, only a few months ago, an ordinance for the purpose of preventing the unemployed in Canberra from coming to ParliamentHouse in order to submit their grievances to honourable memhers ? The Government has attempted to defend the introduction of this ordinance, which is an interfersaying that it is necessary. I hope that the",43,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack

156,Mr Waed,"I shall repeat thatGovernment will prove to my satisfaction in what respect this ordinance is essentia!. The unemployed in this Territory have held several meetings on the steps of Parliament House, and I challenge any honourable member to say that such gatherings were not conducted in a proper orderly manner. I hope that any member of the Government forces will indicate to me, if he is able to do so, any instance at all when he or any other honourable member was interfered with in regard to the carrying out of his work in this House. those occasions were led by the son of the Minister for Health( Mr Hughes). ployed were anxious only to bring under the notice of the Government certain grievances. To show that their complaints were justified, I point out that on several occasions when they sent their representatives to interview the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) their conditions were improved. In making that statement. I do not wish to imply that conditions in the Territory are by any means wholly satisfactory afc the moment. The Government evidently is afraid to face up to the position. It is afraid to admit the truth to the general public because it knows that while it is talking this prosperity "" bunk"" in this House, and the unemployed outside are crying out for some practical action, it cannot get away with the propaganda issued for the purpose of deluding the general public. I can recall other occasions on which disloyal organizationscertain organizations which were prepared to advocate the overthrow of constitutional government in Australiawere not proceeded against by the anti-Labour parties. The Sydney Morning Herald, the official organ of the United Australia party, published on Thursday, the 19th February, 1932, a flaming editorial which incited the people to open revolution and called them to arms against the government of a State, which, of course, is part* of the Oommonwealth, a 3 followsI t is a matter in whioh repudiation, seceslarge section of farmers was in dire need. sion, and possibly civil war itself are involved. The Scullin Government proposed to pay There is no other way than by violence. Secession is in danger of becoming not only in that year it placed no conditions upon a watchword bnt a call to arms. Yet this Government desires to impress upon honourable members that hungry and starving workers in the Federal Capital Territory should not be permitted to come to Parliament House in order to interview the parliamentary representatives of the people. I understood that under a democratic form of government the members of parliament were supposed to be the servants of the people; yet this Government when the workers are crying out for some bread ancl shelter for their dependants, can only suggest that the police should be let loose upon them, to unemployed on flay them with their batons, so that after the unfortunate unemployed have run to their hovels and hidden their heads, the Government will be able to resume its ""bunk"" about the return of prosperity. During the Government's term of office there has undoubtedly heen a certain improvement in respect of the budgetary position. I sliould not be so foolish as to say for one moment that as the result of the advent to office of the Lyons Government certain sections of the community have not become more prosperous. Honourable members have only to pick up the financial journals to see that, the dividends of various wealthy companies are increasing and that they are able to make distributions of bonus shares to their subscribers. ment's prosperity. wealthy companies have increased, but how are those profits made? They are made by exploiting the workers and robbing them at the source of production where the wealth is actually created by the workers in industry. While the Government has been distributing, by way of remissions of taxes, large benefits to its direct wealthy supporters, what has it been doing in other directions with the support of the alleged Country party representatives in order to assist another section of the community? In 1931 the Scullin Government introduced a measure for the purpose of granting assistance to wheat-growers because in that period a to them a bounty on their production, ancl",44,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack

160,Mr Ward,"The profits of thethe distribution of this money. In 1932, after the general elections, the Lyons Government was returned with sufficient numbers to be able to form a government without the support of the Country party. The Lyons Government then introduced a measure for the purpose of assisting wheat-growers by the payment of a bounty, and I remember that the then Minister for Commerce( Sir Frederick Stewart), when introducing the bill, said that there was a vital alteration, in this legislation compared with the original measure passed by the Scullin Government. He stated that the proceeds of the wheat bounty had in many eases gone into the pockets of those persons who were not deserving or in need of it, and he quoted many figures to show that such was the case. He said that one gentleman wheat-grower received in one year nearly £4,000 from this source. In the same year a slightly smaller sum was paid, not to an Australian wheat-grower at all, but to an overseas British company which was interested in the wheat growing industry. Because of this state of affairs, the Government decided, in the Trade and Customs that henceforth it would "" assist only the needy and not the greedy."" The Country party strongly opposed this provision in the new legislation. It contended that such an amendment discriminated between certain sections of wheat-growers and should not be allowed to become law. The Government, however, stuck to its guns because it had thc numbers, and passed the legislation, which contained the provision that only those wheat-growers who in the preceding year had had a non-taxable income should receive the bounty. After the general elections in 1934, the numbers of the supporters of the Lyons Government were reduced and the Country party was then able to influence it, with the result that the tail began to wag the dog and this particular amending legislation was altered. When the Lyons-Page Government was dealing, in 1935, with a measure to grant assistance to wheat growers, honourable members found, on perusing the bill, that no mention was made therein of this _ particular provision which had discriminated between the needy and the greedy. Evidently the greedy wheat-grower, who had strong representatives in this Parliament, was able so to influence the Government that it was compelled to drop out of its legislation the provision which in 1932 it contended was so necessary in order to ensure that the maximum benefit was given to the needy wheat-growers. Any reasonable man will comprehend that where a limited amount of money is available for the assistance of wheat-growers, the more that goes to the wealthy grower, the less there will be to distribute to the needy grower. Why did the Government drop that particular provision from the legislation of 1935? References to Hansard disclose that the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) and other supporters of the Country party declared that the Government should not discriminate between wheat growers because it would cause delay in the payment of the bounty. They said that if it was necessary for a man to prove that he was in necessitous circumstances beforo he could obtain the bounty the help would in many cases come too late. It might appear, on the words of the Minister for surface of things, that there was some ( Mr White), justification for such a contention hy the members of the Country party; but I knew that they were not sincere in the opinions that they expressed, in this House and I deeided to test their sincerity. When the hill was at the committee stage, I moved for the inclusion of a provision that the definition of "" wheat-grower"" should not include any member of the Commonwealth or State Parliaments. No delay would have been occasioned by the adoption of that amendment, for everybody knew who were members of the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. As every member of the Country party voted against the amendment, that, to my mind, completely disposed of their contention that they wanted this particular provision of the previous act eliminated simply in the interests of needy wheat-growers. The honourable member must not reflect upon a vote of the House. what occurred. This indicates clearly",45,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack
161,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. J. Bell),,46,Control Mr Thoiwt S Biiter Attack
162,Mr Ward,"I have simply statedthat tlic Government not only -wished directly to reward its friends and supporters who dominated it outside of Parliament, but also desired to benefit its personal supporters inside the House. The result was that the bounty was paid not only to needy wheat-growers, but also to some honourable members of this Parliament, who, consequently, received bounty payments while they were also in receipt of their parliamentary salary. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins) had something to say on-this subject in 1934, when the Flour TaxB ill was under consideration. It was alleged by the Government that ths flour tax was necessary to obtain the money to pay the bounty to the needy wheat-growers, but this tax was taken directly from the pockets of the poor people of Australia, for it was a tax on the staple article of food on their table. According to a report which appears on page 1014 of Hansard of the 11th December, 1934, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro saidA member of this House told mc recently that last year he had bought out two of his neighbours, and paid a fairly high price for the land.

Let us now examine the record of the Government in connection with another great primary industry. I am not concerned about the big graziers whose association is the dominant force directing the Country party, but I am concerned about the small producer.

Some time ago this Government sent what was called a good-will mission to the East headed by no less a person than thc present Chief Justice of the H i g h Court, Sir John Latham.

After the return of that delegation to Great Britain, the leader of it said that ho was highly satisfied with the results that had been, achieved.

The Japanese at once retaliated and declined to compete in the Australian wool sales. Consequently the price of Australian wool was depressed. Many of the alleged supporters of this Government, and particularly the small wool-growers, protested against the adoption of the trade diversion policy; but the big wool-growers were not particularly interested for they were able to sit back and hold their wool until the trade dispute was settled. The small men had to sell at the lower price, but the big men held their wool until the price recovered, as they knew it would when the dispute was settled. Tbe honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins) did not sell his wool while the dispute was proceeding. He was able to get inside information about when a settlementwas likely so he held it until Japan was again in the market. After the settlement of the' dispute, the price of wool rose by £3 a bale.

173,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs) [9.2].,"the course of which he asked, in effect, how could the people of Australia be asked to believe that the Lyons-Page Government had reduced taxes when, at the same time, it had collected more revenue in taxes in 1936 than had been collected in 1932. He stated that from 1932 to 1936 this Government had progressively increased taxes by £9,000,000. That is a fact. I do not challenge the honourable gentleman's statement, hut I question his implication. This composite Government, which is enabled to hold office through the co-operation of the Country party, has increased its revenue from taxes by £9,000,000, but it would bo just as fair, or unfair, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) to ask his famous namesake, Henry Eord, how it would be possible for him to reduce the price of Ford cars and, at the same time, increase his turnover and profit, as it is for the Leader of the Opposition to draw the inference which I have mentioned, from the statement he made. Mr land, income or sales tax. If we are Henry Ford has increased his revenue and profits from the sale of his cars by reducing his price and, at the same time, giving better value to purchasers of Ford cars. That is exactly what this Government has done in respect of the remissions and adjustments of taxes which it has made. By altering its taxation rates and schedules it has left millions of pounds in the pockets of the people for investment in industry. Furthermore, in doing so, it has not reduced the standard of its social services; indeed, it cannot be denied that it has raised those standards. No amount of haranguing or abuse can refute the fact that by its wise and sound system of financial adjustment this Government has left in the pockets of the people millions of pounds, previously collected in the form of taxes, thereby increasing the purchasing power and the taxable capacity of the community. This Government has been adversely criticized because it has reduced taxes and, by its financial policy, has generally increased the taxable capacity of the community. If that is a censure every member of the Government should be proud to accept it. Revenue from taxes received by the Commonwealth Government rose from £53,959,042 in 1932 to £63,617,306 Mr Fadden. in 1936. Of course, honourable membera opposite, as they have already stated in public, will contend that that demonstrates beyond any doubt that the Goment has extracted an additional £9,000,000 a year in the form of taxes from the people. Supporters of this Government will welcome such criticism because it is undeniable that reductions of taxes have been brought about by its wise and scientific financial administration. Since it came into office it has reduced taxes by various means, all of which have been calculated to ena'ble every section of the community to benefit, because it must always be remembered that in thc final analysis the worker and the producer pay all taxes. From the time. I commenced to take an interest in politics I can remember leaders of Labour thought expressing, in no uncertain manner, the axiom that the worker pays all taxes whether it be in the form of customs and excise duty or in the form of to accept that as a truism-and I acoept it as such-is it not reasonable to say that all reductions of taxes benefit the workers and producers? In this respect I will deal first of all with the incidence of the sales tax. As every honourable member is aware that tax was levied as an emergency measure. I shall not be so unfair as to say that it was not indispensable, or could have been avoided, or to suggest that when it introduced that tax the Scullin Government was not faced with a set of special circumstances in which it firmly believed it had to act according to the certain ways and means available to it at that time. I must add, however, that it is ironical that the same people who always find excuses for the Scullin Government invariably condemn, ih no uncertain manner, the actions of the Moore Government when it was faced in Queensland with a set of circumstances similar to those which confronted the Scullin Government. The difference between the positions in respect of the Moore Government and the -Scullin Government was that the Scullin Government was followed by an administration which took full advantage of the rise of world prices and moulded its fiscal policy in such a way as to enable it to take immediate advantage of the position by reducing all forms of taxes and improving the standards of our social services, whereas the Moore Government was succeeded by an administration which increased taxation to such an extent that Queensland to-day is the heaviest taxed State in the Commonwealth. Those facts cannot be denied, yet those people who are loudest in making excuses for the Scullin Government are loudest in their abuse of the Moore Government. I raise this point primarily to show the inconsistencies of certain advocates in certain circumstances. The sales tax is paid by every consumer in the community. It was originally levied by a government affiliated with the political party of honourable members opposite, during a time of emergency, but it was applied to all foodstuffs and wearing apparel required by .the workers. For instance, as the result of the sales tax of 6 per cent, on building materials the cost of the average worker's home increased by £30 ""When this Government assumed office it immediately reviewed the sales tax schedules and exempted those commodities which the primary producer and the worker could not escape purchasing. In addition, it reduced the rate of sales tax from 6 per cent, to 4 per cent. This has undoubtedly been to the advantage of the consuming public. Can any honourable member reasonably contend that thc benefits of these reductions and exemptions have not been passed on to the consumers and the producers? Has not such relief increased the purchasing power of the people? If it is contended that the worker pays all tax then reductions of taxes must benefit him. It cannot be disputed that if this Government had declined to alter the sales tax schedules as they were left to it by its predecessors, and had f ailed to reduce the rate of tax, it would have collected not £8,000,000 a year, hut £16,000,000 from this source. To meet the argument?, however, that the volume of sales may not have been maintained, can it not be assumed that the workers and producers of Australia have heen saved at least some millions of pounds through the reductions of sales tax made by this Government? Has not that boun of advantage to the workers? Let us now consider the position in regard to income tax, which this Government has reduced at various times. We must remember that income tax is assessed on scientific principles according to the capacity of the taxpayer to pay. Naturally, a person with an income of £600 a year pays more than twice as much as one who receives £300 a year. A person receiving £301 a year pays 16s. lOd. tax, whereas a person receiving £601 a year pays £10 10s. lOd. The Leader of the Opposition, in his recently published blue book which tells us why the Lyons Government should be put out of office, states that a man with a net income of £317 has had his tax reduced by 15s. 8d., while the man receiving £2,000 a year obtained a reduction amounting to £15 7s. 10d., or about twenty times as much. He did not point out, however, that the person receiving £317 a year previously paid £1 5s. 8d. in tax, whereas one receiving £2,000 a year previously paid £109 15s. 10d., or approximately 90 times as much. The science of taxation is to assess the ability of the taxpayer to pay, and the important consideration is the amount that remains to the taxpayer to live on after he has paid his tax. It must be remembered that i i is the total of national production which not only pays all the taxes collected, but also provides the means of livelihood for the community. The value of production in Australia from 1932 to 1936 averaged £372,000,000 a year, whereas for the year 1931-32 it was only £305,000,000. The average annual improvement was £67,000,000, which works out at nearly £1,500,000 a week. That was the amount that the Lyons Government placed to the credit of the taxpaying community of Australia. By its scientific tariff policy, and its proper system of taxation, it increased the national income of the country by £67,000,000 a year. I do not say that the Government is entirely responsible for that increase; I admit that world conditions generally improved during the period under review, but I maintain that the Government should be given credit for pursuing a financial policy that enabled Australia to take f u l l advantage of improved world conditions when they arrived. This improvement haa been reflected in the general economic life of the community, and has resulted in the rehabilitation of industry and the restoration of public confidence. We have a lot to be thankful for. For the five years to 1936-37 the improvement was still more marked, and the additional benefit to the public by way of national income amounted to no less an annual average than £118,000,000, which represents an improvement of approximately £2,270,000 a week. The position is set out fully in the following table:£ Industrial duction Pro305,018,000 390,500,000 Federal Taxation.. 53,1159,000 03,(117,300 Balance paying Taxation) 351,058.736 332,382,09-1 389,154,000 Benefit to the Public Let us now consider where the extra revenue came from. Most of it came through the customs, and included primage duties. Thc Country party is charged with being a low tariff party; in fact, we are called a free trade party, among other things. When we investigate the figures, we find that, during the five yeajs under review, import duties increased by £10,100,000, or 56 per cent., while imports increased by £46,400,000, or 105 per cent. When this Government took office the volume of imports had fallen away practically to nothing. The previous Government had so mismanaged thc situation by the imposition of skyhigh ""tariffs that there was an unprecedented shortage of capital Imports for 1931-32 were the lowest for twenty years, despite the increase of population. The first work of the Lyons-Page Government when it took office was to revise the tariff in a scientific way in order to bring about a better balance between imports and general production, and results have justified its action. The value of imports £44,042,000 to £90,485,000, and whereas duties collected in 1932 mounted to only £18,444,678, they rose under the Lyons-Page Government to more than £28,500,000. whereas in 1932 duties represented Mt. Fadden. 42 per cent, of the value of imports, in 1937 they represented not more than 31^ per cent., a reduction of 10^ per cent. Nobody will deny that the workers have benefited by this reduction because, whatever may be true of direct taxation, it is certainly a fact that the workers pay indirect taxation. The importer is merely the agent who passes on the tax to the consumer. Therefore, any reduction of indirect taxation must benefit the consumers, who consist very largely of the workers. Far from injuring the secondary industries, the tariff policy of this Government 1031-8!!. 1035-311. 1936-37. has revitalized them to such an extent that, despite anything that may be said £ i to the contrary, they are more prosperous 432,000.000 to-day than they have ever been in the 0-2,846.000 history of Australia.

It wonld be useless to give the number of employees if the wage fund were affected by cheap or child labour.

The figures which I have used, even if they he not correct, arc relevant, because they are based annually on the same sources of information and, therefore, provide a comparative basis! Previous to last year, the highest level ever achieved in factory wages was in 1927-28, when £91,365,319 was paid, whereas, in 1936-37, it, is estimated that £93,000,000 was paid, which is an increase of about £2,000,000. The figures remove any doubt as to whether tlie employees in secondary industries have suffered from-child labour, sweated conditions, or reduced wages. The fact remains that t.he average wage paid in 1936-37 was £177 per annum, compared with £169 per annum in 1931-32, when this Government took office. I give the figures for what they are worth; they are comparative ancl therefore support the facts which I havo presented. On page 27 of the "" Blue Book,"" prepared by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), the following passage appearsPrimary and secondary industries arc interto cite the figures relating to the period dependent.

Why go back paid to them aggregated in hard cash to the Stone Age, and why charge this £2,100,000 less. The lessened purchasing power Government with something for which brought about by unemployment and low wages ir, was not responsible? This Government necessarily curtails internal sales and strikes a serious blow at primary producers. If those were the facts and the figures creased by £37,000,000 a year, and that were correct, the position would be as additional purchasing power is reflected stated, namely, that the wage fund ii.nl in the improved home market of the prideclined and that this Government's mary producers. policy was detrimental to the home market, which, of course, is the primary sition's book the following appears:producers' best market. But they are not correct, inasmuch as the honourable gentleman, in order to arrive at the reduction of the wage fund, has seen fit large remissions of taxation he does not mento go back to 1929-30. Let me give the tionposition when this Government took office and introduced its tariff policy. The wage fund was then £55,931,818, compared with the £93,000,000 that was paid in the year ended the 30th June last. That comparison is conclusive proof that the tariff policy of this Government has this Government is due entirely to the increased the consumptive power of the home market by more than £37,000,000. If , as the honorahle member has written, the home market suffered as the result of a fall of about £2,000,000 in factory wages, how much must it have benefited from the fact that since 1931-32 the wage fund has increased by £37,000,000 for last year. is Why AustraUa should Vote out the Lyons Government. the honourable member for Premantle has advanced as to why the people should vote Labour into power is based on wrong premises and the honourable member will have to advance better reasons than that before the primary producers will put this Government out of oflice. parable years? ber for Fremantle is endeavouring to charge this Government with maladministration and with the execution of a policy which has not been in the best interests of the primary producers.

It shows that the more with which the people are leftthe less that is taken in taxation-the better it is for the nation as a whole. I recognize, however, that just as there is an extraction beyond which no government should go, there an economic minimum below which no government should proceed. A government naturally has to obtain the wherewithal to carry on social services and fulfil other statutory obligations. I urge the continuation, of the policy of progressive reductions of taxation. The results achieved during the administration of this Government have amply demonstrated the wisdom of that policy and I regret that, because it is necessary to spend an additional amount on defence and otlier matters, the Treasury has not been able to budget for a further reduction this year. I am confident, however, that the expenditure of £11,500,000 on defence will increase the earning capacity of the community and consequently the total taxable income, thus making possible further reductions in the future. The Leader of the Opposition has also published in his blue book the statement that "" the amount per head of taxation is the highest in the history of the Comwould like to go.

Naturally, the amount per capita must increase if the taxable income of tbe community increases. bonorable member's time has expired. I have listened with great interest to tbe debate that has taken place to-night. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr conflict would not be possible without John Lawson) has delved into history in order to quote certain statements made by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). I shall therefore read what the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said in 1921. The Hobart Mercury reported that, speaking at the Launceston Labour conference, the right honourable gentleman declared that the capitalist system must go; that being left with more it was rotten. He also said that he stood for all the principles in the preambleo'f the Melbourne congress of unions, and tliat he wanted to go to parliament and to conference as a delegate with definite instructions as to how he was to vote. I quote these remarks of the right honeconomic maximum of tax orable gentleman in order to show that when one quotes history one needs to .bo is also careful that history cannot be quoted against oneself. I have been interested in the window dressing for the forthcoming elections that has been indulged in by Government members. I have been very much struck with the publicity given to this year's "" war budget."" The Labour party has definitely declared that it stands solidly for the defence of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has come out into the open and stated that, if returned to power at the next federal elections, his policy will be to take effective measures for the protection of Australia against foreign invasion. His idea is to have a properly equipped and efficient air force acting in co-operation with the navy and such land forces as are required for adequate defence. The Labour party has been criticized on the ground that it has not gone far enough. I do not know how far Government supporters first duty of a nation is to take adequate measures for its defence. I understand that at the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister committed Australia to something that he has not yet disclosed. I believe that Australia has been committed to participation in the terrible conflict that is about to take place in China. Doubtless plans have already been laid for the conscription of the manhood of this country and their despatch overseas.

I shall not consent to any mother's son or any woman's husband being sent out of this country against his will. I adopted that attitude from 1914 to 1918. Many of my friends who went overseas were also of the opinion that no Government had the right to compel men to leave Australia.

That laid down their lives in the belief that that horrible and deadly conflict was a war to end war; yet preparations are now being made for a gigantic struggle in China. tnember get that idea ? advisers. I understand that the Prime Minister is not in favour in London because he "" let the cat out of the bag"" and disturbed the minds of the people while the authorities were secretly endeavouring to give effect to their policy. It is not considered wise to arouse suspicion in the minds of the people during the progress of military preparations. I am well aware of what is intended. The chinson), who accused the Labour party of disloyalty because its members would not admit that they were Imperialists, will have an opportunity before long to give an exhibition of his patriotism at Shanghai. I would do what I could to send him over to that theatre of war. In the last war, Australia suffered tremendously in the loss of manhood as well as in the enormous expenditure in which it was involved. Homes were wrecked, and many parents died from worry and anxiety. Yet the Prime Minister, who, as a member of the Labour party, said that he would not ask men to leave Australia to fight in Flanders, France or Gallipoli, is. prepared to-day, after returning from the Imperial Conference, to commit this country to a war in the East, and to force its citizens to particiof war, but the Government proposes to pate in it. ber is allowing his imagination to run away with him. ten what I went through during the last war.

Let ns analyse the position, to see what the outcome is likely to be. The budget makes provision for the expenditure of £11:500,000 on preparations for another war. The attempt is being made to convince the people that an enemy is close at hand, but who the enemy is has not been disclosed by the Government. We should deal with our neighbours in a proper manner. Somo years ago a goodwill mission led by the present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, was sent to Japan, yet to-day the idea is being disseminated, that that nation has hostile intentions towards Australia. We have been told that it will bomb thc homes of our people. I fail to understand how the Government has arrived at that conclusion, because everything points to the fact that the next war will be fought in Asia. Millions of pounds of British capital are invested in that continent, and they are sacrosanct. In modern times, the investments of the wealthy classes are the principal causes call upon the young manhood of Australia to defend that money in foreign lands.

In my opinion, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) was correct when he said that lie would like to put in the front line all the politicians who advocate war. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) would be among the number sent to the front line, and he would be given an opportunity to display his courage in thc defence of this great Empire. I do not take exception to the remarks of ministerial supporters who fought in the Great War, because they speak with some authority, but I contend that other Government members, who did not strike a blow for their country, have no right at this juncture to adopt a critical ottitude. myself, the Assistant Minister for Commerce( Mr Thorby) has no decoration other than the Coronation Medal. I paid close attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr greater advantage to the country to feed Fadden) in reference to unemployment and the restoration of prosperity in Australia. ashamed of its inactivity, extending over three years, in respect of granting assistance to unemployed youths. At the last federal elections, promised that this unfortunate section would receive its first consideration, and ihe Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) announced that £400,000 would be made available for vocational training and associated matters. 'Up to date, the necessary legislation for this purpose has not been introduced. Instead of giving effect to its promise, the Govermnent granted the sum of £200,000 to the States with the instruction to spend the money upon unemployed youths. I suggested that the Government should give considerable financial assistance to the States to enable them to carry out a larger and more comprehensive scheme for the training of our boys and girls. assistance would amount to about 3d. a week! action that the Commonwealth Government is taking in respect of our unemployed youths is to prepare them to be gun-fodder in the next blood bath in the East. The Government is fully aware that these youths cannot be trained for vocations, because tradesmen cannot be made out of men who have reached their 25th year. As the result of the inertia of the Government, thousands of youths have been deprived of an equal opportunity with their more fortunate fellows to earn a decent living. The State governments have been saddled with increased indebtedness amounting to £S0,000,000, while the Commonwealth debt has been reduced by £11,000,000. I deduce from those figures that the Commonwealth Government has permitted the State governments to shoulder its responsibility. If this Government has available £11,500,000 for expenditure on war materials, it should be in a position to find millions for widows, orphans and the unemployed, and to assist the poorer classes to rear their children under better conditions than exist at the present time. From the national viewpoint, it is of and clothe Australian mothers than to spend millions upon preparations for war. The Government should be As the Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) has stated, the mothers of this country are the reservoirs from which the nation draws its manhood, but I ask honourable t.he Government members to consider how the Government is assisting the mothers. During the last twelve months 900 mothers died in childbirth, and, in addition to this maternal mortality, 2,000 babies died at birth. The Minister for Health said, "" I am alarmed at the figures in respect of infant and maternal mortality""; but honourable members will see the photograph of the right honourable gentleman in the capitalistic press in the act of kissing the babies of wealthy people. To this section, babies are born so infrequently that they become a novelty. I venture to assert, however, that the right honourable gentle-",54,Taxation Significanc E Of The Boasted Remissions

The Labour Government of Tasmania is devoting considerable attention to the encouragement of young men to learn to operate aeroplanes, and it has granted a bursary for aviation. Some time ago, application was made to the Assistant Minister for Defence to place an aeroplane at thc disposal of the Tasmanian authorities for the purpose of developing this scheme, but the honourable gentleman stated that, on the grounds of expense, the request could not be granted. I fail to understand how the Government expects to carry out the training of youths if it is not prepared to accede to practical propositions. The Labour party advocates the adequate defence of Australia, and after listening to the statement of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr merce, whicli also speaks of a setback to the Blackburn), who is probably the greatest pacifist in the country, that he was prepared to die for the defence of Australia in Australia, I do not consider that the peopio of England demand any groater sacrifice than that. The party to which I belong believes in thc defence of this country, but it is opposed to the policy of the present Government, which would send men overseas to participate in capitalist wars. It Las been claimed on behalf of the Government ""that the increased number into Australia from Great Britain is due to the Government's trade diversion policy. I cannot accept that statement, because I have before me figures which show clearly that the importation of British motor cars has increased in every British dominion. The following table shows the increases during 1937, compared with 1936:First quarter quarter 1936. Irish Free State Union of Soutli Africa 1,982 British India British Malaya Ceylon New Zealand Other British Total Percentage of increase;-2 6 per cent. The Government and its supporters deny that their trade policy has driven away from this country Japanese trade to the value of millions of pounds. I understand that Australia could find a big market in Japan for butter. exporting butter to Great Britain. Dairy Review of the 24th July last published the following article relating to this matter:SUPI'LIEHS. Thc Japanese Department of Agriculture and Forestry has become concerned at the large salesof margarine as butter, and is contemplating devising means to combat the growth of this practice which, at the present time, is impossible to prevenj; because of the absence.of qualified inspectors. This statement appears in the Monthly Trade Bulletin of the Department of ComJapanese butter industry, reported on by thc Australian Trade Commissioner in Japan. Climatic condition. ! in Japan are not favor1 able to the dairying industry, and cattle have to be stall-fed for several months in the year. A shortage of fodder this year in Hokkaido, the principal dairying province, has been attended with grave consequences. Another inimical factor has been thc inflationary boom through whicli the country bas been passing. There has been a demand by city dwellers for milk and for ice cream, and this has led to a movement of dairy cows from country districts to within city limits, and a consequent still further reduction in butter production. The twofold influence of natural scarcity and Tising dosts soon caused an increase of motor cars imported in the price of Japanese butter, and within six weeks the difference of 32 sen between thc retail prices of Hokkaido butter and imported Australin n and New Zealand butteT disappeared. This was brought about by an increase in the Hokkaido price from Y 1.08 (1/7 A.C.) to Y 1.30 (1/11 A.C.) per lb., and a reduction of imported huttcr from Y 1.40 (2/Oi A.C.) per lb., to Y 1.25-1.28 (1/10 A.C.) per lb.

Alwith, I strongly urge that a beginning though not specifically stated, the assumpshould be made immediately with the tion is that such pro rata share is fixed studio in Hobart, since a site has already on the total income, or tbe total expendibeen acquired for the purpose.

Thus, the real surplans and specifications had been preplus of income over genuine costs is pared, but as far as I am .aware no further £99,000. From 1930-31 to 1935-36, steps have been taken to proceed with the £75,000 has been deducted from the true work. One must expect things like this surpluses, totalling £499,000, leaving a to happen in a Parliament in which tbe Mr Mahoney. balance of £424,000 as the actual accumulated surplus in that period. A certain quantity of machinery may be required in all stations erected in the period under review are relay stations, the cost is not very serious, and would mostly be included in ordinary working expenses. The charges for interest and exchange on London loan money intended for new works in other postal branches do not appear to have any justification other than that this is an ordinary practice of the department, and has not been challenged. The total accumulated surplus of the wireless branch, even after deduction at £424,000, and with the surplus of 1936-37 will be greatly-increased.

Thc matter before this ruling was made, and I am sorry that I cannot see my way clear to arrange a departure from it in the case of the motor hirecar drivers of Hobart. Yoursf a it h f u l l y , A. J. McLACHLAX . I am sorry that the Government, cannot see its way clear to give to the hire-car drivers the relief that they seek. It is no answer to say that drivers of motor vehicles used for private purposes do not employ the wireless receiving sets on them for business purposes, for we well know that any driver of a private motor car can tune into the broadcast of Stock Exchange information and, if he wishes, pull up at the next, post office and purchase stocks or sbares by telephone, in consequence of information so received. I make another appeal to the Government to grant the request of the hire-car drivers for relief from this additional impost. I congratulate the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) on his brilliant defence of the financial policy of his Government. Everybody must realize that the Scullin Government saved Australia from disaster. ""We can well understand that th*» honourable member something in his political record to critileopard cannot change his spots. The honourable member was wide of the facts, The Labour party is not dominated by any section or any was carefully* considered executive. The honourable member then went on to say that the Labour party intended to inflate the currency of this country with a fiduciary note issue. That story has whiskers on it, and the people are not likely to be misled by it. The monetary policy of the Labour party has stood tbe test of time. The Commonwealth Bank is a great monument to it. I was glad that the Prime Minister, in delivering an address some weeks ago on the occasion of the opening of the Port Augusta to Port Pirie railway paid a tribute to that grand old man of the Labour party, Mr King O'Malley, who was responsible for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank and also for the financial arrangements Avhich made the building of the East-West railway possible without loading the taxpayers with a burden of interest. The method of financing that work through the Commonwealth note issue was sound in every respect. The Government, of course, sees the -writing on the wall and despairs of its political prospects. It is so fearful, in fact, that it is afraid 'to fix the date for the election. Honourable gentlemen opposite realize that the people of Australia do not want a war government. They want a government which will protect the interests of Australia in the best sense. They do not want conscription to be fastened on to Australia, nor do they desire that the young meu of this country should be sent abroad to fight on foreign shores. The Labour party is prepared to do everything possible to defend Australia against foreign invasion, and also to -preserve the peace of the world, but the war budget of this Government is not likely to commend itself to the general community. Of course we can understand that the young patriots among honourable members opposite who have recently been, in contact with imperialists on the other side of the world are very eager to lay down their lives for British imperialism on foreign soil. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson) no doubt wants to go abroad to fight. go overseas to fight. But I would not stood by their country at that time, and be agreeable to the spending of Is. of whose actions have been fully justified by Australian money on a foreign war. member would come with me if a war occurred. would do everything possible to defend Australia, but some honourable gentlemen opposite would undoubtedly belong to the "" B "" brigade. They would "" be hero "" at rhe beginnmng and they would "" be here at tbe end of a war. The honourable member for Macquarie would probably be one of them. However, we all love Australia. Many of us were born here, our loved ones live here, and all we possess is h«re. It is our duty to protect Australia against foreign invasion, and the Labour party would be willing to do so by every means in its power. the commencement of this debate, I have listened attentively to a number of speeches and have noticed that nearly every Opposition member who has spoken has tried to convince himself and the country that Labour will win the next flections. [Quorum formed.] I am confident, however, that their hopes will not he realized, for the electors will not place £15,500,000 a year, and salaries and penLabour on the treasury bench. It is well sometimes to recall what has happened in the past. I have a clear recollection of the then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) delivering his statement of accounts in 1931. He showed that the Commonwealth was nearly £11,000,000 to the bad, that the combined deficits of the Commonwealth and States amounted to over £36,000,000, and that the pace down hill was so fast that there was every prospect of thc amount increasing to over £40,000,000. As the result of the position iwhich was then reached, thc Premiers plan which necessitated some drastic emergency cuts in governmental expenditure was evolved. .Fortunately for Australia, the Lyons Government came into office, and immediately set about getting the ship of state into safe waters. It was tb on getting close to the rocks. Australia was, indeed, fortunate in having at the helm men of the calibre of the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and those associated with him. I am proud the results. member crying about? pointing out that Australia is in a much better position to-day than in 1931. By June, 1932, the Commonwealth Government was able to show a surplus of £1,750,000. surplus ? wisely, and that is why Australia's finances are in so sound a condition to-day. I do not think that any other country in tbe world is in a better position. By the end of the following year the accumulated surplus had grown to £3,500,000, and during the next three years it increased to £10,500,000, with a further increase of £1,275,000 at the 30th June, 1937. In the interim the State deficits with Commonwealth co-operation were reduced almost to vanishing point, and the Commonwealth debt was reduced by over £8,500,000.

In addition, the Commonwealth paid to the' States special grants totalling several million pounds for roads, unemployment relief, mining, forestry, health and assistance to primary producers. This expenditure amounted to the colossal sum of £55,000,000, of which £21,000,000 was expended in respect of primary production. Australia, therefore, is enjoying unexampled prosperity, and I challenge any honourable member to name any other country which is better situated economically to-day. I believe that this prosperity will continue if this Government is returned to office. Much useful work remains to be done, and I have no doubt that at the next elections the people of Australia will again give this Government a mandate to carry ou. Much has been said iu this debate in respect of defence, and various predictions have been made as to what may happen in the international sphere in the near future. I listened very carefully to the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence in respect of deliberations at the Imperial Conference. Australia that we should deal effectively with the problem of defence. Some honourable members contend that we sbould be concerned only with Australia's position, irrespective of our affiliations with other dominions. that the safety of our trade routes at all times is of vital importance to this conntry. To-day, unfortunately, the problem of defence practically overshadows everything else. In our case it is not only a matter of the defence of our own shores, but also the extent to whicli we can assist in the defence of the Empire as a whole. Because Australia is a member of the .British Commonwealth of Nations, we are proud of the example set by Great Britain in respect of disarmament. Undoubtedly, it has been sincere in its efforts in this respect, and has done working witb that object in view. everything in its power to bring about disarmament throughout the world. Unfortunately, circumstances have militated against those efforts with the result that Great Britain's example has not been followed by certain powers. On the contrary, international hostilities have become intensified, ancl the expenditure of many countries on armaments has reached colossal proportions. I believe that it is the policy of the Empire as a whole to strive for the maintenance of peace ancl to do all it can in this direction by the fullest co-operation with the rest of the countries of the world. That, indeed, is a worthy objective. However, the Empire to-day is face to face with stern realities. We find that many countries are arming to the teeth, whilst others are actually engaged in warfare. We are obliged, therefore, to take stock of thc world position in this respect. Undoubtedly, all sincere Australians hope that tbe world will enjoy a long ancl uninterrupted period of peace and prosperity. At any rate, tlie people in the electorate which I represent cherish that hope. We might well ask how this ideal can best be accomplished. To Australia as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations the security of the Empire is of primary importance. The Empire stands for individual freedom and peaceful living, and that ideal is dear to most people; it is a vital element of our nationhood. Australia, It is most important to however, must face stern realities. It may be many years before we are called upon to defend our shores, but in any event our safest policy is to prepare for such an eventuality. Having regard to the present international position, I am satisfied I contend, however, that the best policy for Australia ancl Great Britain is that Great Britain at least should be prepared at all times to meet whatever development may arise. I believe that this Government and the Government of Great Britain, in respect of their defence policies, are proceeding along the right lines, pending the restoration of normal conditions throughout the world. It is of the utmost importance to Australia that we should co-operate in this matter with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and this Government is I realize that we need money for the development of our latent resources. This development must, of necessity, take place if Ave are to occupy our rightful position as an important self-governing dominion of the British Empire. We all know that war means misery ancl desolation ancl that money made available for war purposes appears to be a dead loss. But Australia must be prepared to take its place in world affairs and to do this we must formulate an adequate defence scheme. I am aware that this will involve the expenditure of a large sum of money. Already there has been considerable expenditure on the three-year defence programme, and the provision for this year amounts to £11,500,000. proposes to raise portion of it in England. which I am in disagreement with the Government. £9,000,000 of the defence expenditure will be provided from revenue. feature of the Government's defence proposals, but I repeat that I regret its decision to raise portion of the amount required by loan in London. This is a matter which I shall discuss at a later stage. The policy which Australia should adopt is the aim and the ideal of the League of Nations, to secure as wide a measure of disarmament among the nations as possible. It is regrettable that the Government has found it necessary to incur heavy expenditure on defence, but we should look upon this matter as an insurance premium. Since every prudent citizen takes out an insurance policy against possible risks and contingencies, bow much greater is the need for nations, by the adoption of adequate defence measures, to ensure the safety of their citizens? How best may this be accomplished? first requirement is a contented people living under the best conditions which tlie country can afford. An essential feature of our defence programme sliould be the development of our air force and the encouragement of civil aviation for thc training of reserve pilots. Another important arm of defence is the navy, which should be strengthened to ensure the protection of our trade routes. During recent years there has been a gratifying development of Empire trade, in consequence of which it is important that, in time of trouble, our trade routes should be efficiently guarded to prevent any interference with tbe transport of foodstuffs or raw materials. Then there is the question of co-operation of supplies and the development of the Empire's resources for the manufacture of munitions, as well as the supply of raw materials, the objective being to make each component of the Empire as self-contained as possible. The manufacture of munitions is associated with the development of our secondary industries, the Government and is of major importance in any defence scheme. On this subject my views are, I think, well known to honourable members. member's opinion of the proposed Pacific pact ? to say on the subject at the appropriate time. Meanwhile, I suggest to the honourable member that he and his colleagues have enough troubles of their own over pacts-especiall y the Surtin-Lang pact and its probable effect on their chances at the forthcoming elections. I read the other day in the press that the Leader of the Opposition had said that if his party won the elections he would thank the people; if it lost, he would thank God. statements appearing in the press, and I assure the honourable member that I did not say that. statement. The honourable gentleman will have to blame his Labour friends; they will do anything. It is not my intention to discuss the Government's defence policy in all its Eor adequate defence the ramifications. My immediate purpose is to bring -under the notice of the Ministry the necessity for the development and coordination of key secondary industries which could be utilized, at short notice, for war purposes. This policy involves national economics. Under existing conditions the great majority of what may be regarded as key industries are located in New South Wales and Victoria. This development may be considered a good thing financially . for the two larger States, but it is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. No one can say that the present situation is all that could be desired.

216,Mr Price,"Then I withdraw theif it is in the best interests of Australia, from the defence point of view, for the great majority of these key industries to be iu tbe eastern States. The remedy is to adopt a long-range policy and endeavour to spread these important secondary key industries in other States. I hope that this course will be followed. The Prime Minister has already given some indication that he favours a policy of decentralization. There is an old saying that one should not basket, and that principle might very well be applied to our secondary industries. The better distribution of those industries would have a beneficial effect in many directions, particularly in regard to our defences. The time bas arrived when the Government should assist, by means of legislation, in bringing about a better distribution of our secondary industries. Great Britain is deliberately applying a policy of decentralization of industry with the object of relieving the distressed areas, and of reducing its vulnerability in the event of war. We in Australia may not be in the same danger from foreign attack as is Great Britain, but we, like England, have our unemployment problem. perity had returned. doubtedly improved, and I am very glad that so much progress has been made. to me.

There is a running fire of interjection. The interjections are not helpful, but have all one's eggs in one are intended merely to annoy. They must cease at once. Several millions of pounds were voted to the commissioners, who were specially precluded from giving direct assistance to private enterprise.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr from the service of the House did not Fordo) gave the number of days on which Parliament has sat since the Government was elected three years ago, and the Minister for Defence said that it is the quality of the legislation, and not the volume which has to be considered. If a workman in the Federal Capital Territory, Avhich is controlled by the Commonwealth Government, worked for only ten (lays a year-tba t is the number of days on which the Senate sat the year before last-and wanted to claim a full year's salary, he would be sacked on tbe eleventh day of his service. It is not my intention to deal at length with the general bungling of this Government in trying to control the operations of certain foreign intruders on the northern coast of this continent. The Government speaks of its courageous defence policy, but it has shown that it is afraid to act in an emergency. When it. does act. the action takes the form of an attack on defenceless women; and then it finds that it is in the wrong, and has to reverse its decision. I desire to deal' witli tbe defence policy be co-operating with Great Britain. It of the Labour party. What is the record of this "" dyed in the wool"" patriot from Macquarie?

We are told that it is tbe policy of tbe Government to co-operate with Great Britain. What does that really mean? I regard it as a meaningless statement. If Australians were to fight in this country they would is absolute nonsense to talk about keeping trade routes open, considering the few cruisers that we have. In a great war of the future, if there should be one, Great Britain might not have the powerful allies that it had before. Communication with Australia might be cut off, and in that event we should have to defend our own country. There is no doubt that the workers of Australia would defend their country to the last man. As tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has plainly shown, Australia can be defended with much less expenditure than the £11,500,000 which",63,Pajrs

Erom which direction is it likely to come? I should like the Minister for Defence to answer that question. He knows as well as I do, and so does the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr except in case of dire emergency, but E. F. Harrison), that there is no likelihood of an attack on Australia in the immediate future. Mr E. F. ILAUSZSON I do gentleman ought to know. He probably does,"" but is not at liberty to say so. Any country we had in mind as thinking of attacking Australia, would be engaged for six months in preparations for the attack, and our intelligence service is so weU informed that we would have a fortnight after the preparations had begun. Tbe establishment of a naval base at Singapore is a sound proposition. It would protect Australia should this country be threatened with invasion. The country which is said to have hostile intentions towards Australia will be kept fully occupied for many a year.

If a serious Avar threatened, there would be plenty of time to consult the people by means of a referendum. ""We have it on the authority of geographers that Australia is capable of carrying a population of at least 45,000,000 persons.

248,Mr A. Green,"Then the honorablotliey were trying .to find markets they were prevented from doing so. It can be readily understood that the democratic forces were either driven underground or forced out of the country or killed on account of their opinions. The intense fervour of the jingoists in Germany was brought about by the policy of the allies. It is very difficult for a country like Great Britain to make arrangements with a country whose political structure is so entirely different some activities of this kind, and as is that of Germany, but I believe that an understanding with the German people can be reached. I realize that the hate manifested towards Great Britain in Italy was because when Italy came into the Great War on the side of the allies, a promise was made that it would be granted territories in the event of the sucin the government of tbem. We must be cessful termination of the war. Italy, however, was fooled in regard to this matter. they were to get a slice of Albania and other large tracts of country, but they received nothing. In these circumstances, it is quite understandable that Italy an undeveloped country which England, Erance and Italy had previously agreed to divide up among themselves. These things are going on in secret diplomacy constantly. After all, we cannot take great credit for our past actions in this regard. Even Great Britain cannot sit down with folded arms and say: ""We have a tremendous Empire; any country that is worthwhile we have got to ourselves."" The saying is commonly current-""What we have got we will hold, and what we have not got we are after."" That is a dangerous policy to adopt to-day. Britain and Erance are holding colonies that are not being properly developed, while at the same time the scientists of Germany, which is hungry for colonies, are making rapid strides in the eradication of tropical diseases, which have prevented Great Britain and Erance from developing fully their overseas possessions. long. In this connection, I commend to honourable members the remarks of that great individualist, Herbert Spencer, on national bias. The British Empire has done a great deal; our people were early [16] in the field and obtained much of what they wanted, but Britain cannot be the only land-holding nation. Even tbe backward races are demanding self-government and the control of their own countries. To-day the great national aspirations of the Indian people are being voiced and fought for. A similar movement has succeeded in Egypt and in Palestine which Great Britain has tried to hold under mandate. But meddleendeavours to hold other countries for the benefit of Great Britain and not for the benefit of the native peoples, must come to an end. If there are countries that can be better administered by white men, we have to allow the people of Europe such as the Germans and other nations to share prepared to allow other nations to have a place in the sun. The Italians understood that To-day we hear rumours and threats of war. I have heard them ever since I can remember. At one time Russia was the euemy we feared. I remember when I served as a militiaman in Victoria, should attempt to seize Major-General Hutton would address the troops on. the 24th May and similar occasions, warning us to ""Look out for tlie Russians."" When about that time two submarine cables, forming the only connection with Australia and Great Britain, snapped, it was immediately thought that the Russians had cut the cables and that Australia would be invaded. The militiamen were then called out to their drill rooms to protect the homeland. In providing for the defence of this country, I would see that there were no slackersand that every able-bodied man-particularl y Both Great those bonorable members opposite who have been telling us what patriots they are-too k his place at the front. Let us consider the Government's defence proposals. It is proposed that we shall have eight squadrons, comprising 96 fighting plane3, to meet a possible invader equipped with 300 planes. The Labour party suggests that we should That will not be tolerated for have at least 300 planes, which would be the same number as could be brought against us by the only country that is likely to attempt an invasion; that is to say, 300 is the carryingcapacity of their plane-carrying vessels. According to recent figures supplied by tbe Defence Department, this air force would cost £7,500,000. It bas been said that tbe cost of providing new aeroplanes would be almost as great as purchasing new battleships, but that is not so. The Defence Department tells us that 300 planes could be maintained and replaced for £2,500,000 a year. personnel ? be more economical than expending £3,000,000 on a battleship or less oh a cruiser. The opinion of several admirals and vice-admirals of Great Britain, the United States of America and Germany is that in modern warfare capital ships and cruisers ave no longer effective. It is was in operation, the militia forces were well-known that those connected with the military arm of the defence forces claim that nine-tenths of the work of defence can be done by infantrymen, whilst naval men assert that most reliance should be placed on warships, and some representatives of the air force say that if we provide a sufficient number of fighting planes we shall be equal to any emergency. I believe that it is necessary to have as many cruisers as we possess today, but it seems to me that the proposals of the Labour party, if adopted, would meel all tbe defence requirements of Australia at one-third of the cost of the scheme that is proposed by the Minister for Defence. Australia should first declare that it stands for defence and not for aggression. We ought to make that quite clear. If Great Britain were attacked, we should be prepared to submit the matter to a referendum of the people. That would be far safer than joining h i . any brawl which might take place to determine whether Germany's former possessions in East Africa should be returned. I would not advocate that Australia should send men overseas to participate in a fight to settle that question. Honourable members opposite would shout for war, not because they want it, but purely for political purposes.

Any criticism from that quarter is a compliment. bered that when the Scullin Government abolished compulsory military training, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) and the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) continually harassed that Government by asserting that its policy was ineffective. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that in 1920, when the voluntary system a mere rabble. statement by referring to Hansard. The present Government has been in oflice for six years, ancl during that time neither the present Miniser for Trade and Customs nor the Minister for Defence, has advocated a return to the compulsory training system. There is a remarkable consensus of opinion amongst naval authorities that the clay of capital ships and cruisers is past. Among those who consider that we sbould rely for our defence mainly on aeroplanes, mines, submarines, and torpedoes, arc Rear-Admiral W. F. Fulham, wbo was in charge of tbe American Pacific squadron during tbe Great war; Rear-Admiral BradleyH . Fiske, another member of the navy of the United States of America; Admiral Sims, who was commander-in-chief of the American Elect during tbe Great war; Admiral Sir Percy Scott, Lord Eisher, and RearAdmirals S. S. Hall and Mark Kerr, of the Royal Navy, and Admiral Von Scheer, who commanded the German Fleet at tbe Battle of Jutland. RearAdmiral Fulham, in an article written by him some years ago on tbe passing of sea power, made tbe following remarkable statement:The wings of "" sea power"" have been clipped. New naval weapons have vastly strengthened tlie defence and greatly weakened the offence in overseaswarfare. Great armadas and armies cannot again cross the seas.

Cani t even forces, torpedoes and submarines, it can easily protect the lines of communication of our hold a maritime enemy 100 miles from its battle fleet, if the latter is required to fight shores. Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, of the Navy of the United States of America, saidA strong force of air planes supported by mines and submarines would alone suffice to defend the Phillipines from invasion. Fortifications were not needed. A defending fleet of battleships was quite unnecessary. I do not say that that is exactly my own opinion in regard to fortifications, for example, but, that gentleman is a greater authority on the subject than is any honourable member in this chamber. Admiral Sir Percy Scott, of the British Navy, in a letter to the London Times, saidFirst, that modern weapons have entirely revolutionized naval warfare. Second, that if we were at war with a country within striking distance of submarines, battleships on the high seas would be in great danger. Third, that if we went to war, we should probably lock up our ships in a safe harbour, and the enemy would do the same. Fourth, that no flout could be hidden from the airmen's eyes. F if t h , that submarines could deliver a deadly attack in broad daylight. Sixth, that battleships could not bombard an enemy's port if it is protected by submarines. Seventh, that the enemy submarines would come to our coast and destroy everything they coilld. Eighth, that tlie submarine bad driven the battleship from tbe ocean. Bear Admiral Fulham pointed out that those opinions by Admiral Sir Percy Scott were advanced some time ago, and before air forces were fully developed. He also stated:Admiral Sir John Fisher supported Admiral Scott. Ec declared that tbe dreadnought was doomed. "" Scrap tlie l o t ; the future fighting is in the a i r "" be claimed. And, these two admirals, Fisher and Scott, bad done more than any men iu the world to develop the dreadnought. Another authority of the British Navy, the coast of Germany during the Great Rear-Admiral S. S. Hall, said:We had a grand fleet, with a preponderance of nearly two to one over Germany alone, and an auxiliary navy of about live thousand vessels. American, French, Italian, and Japanese navies. We held the most favorable geographic position, for a naval war, that the atlas can furnish. And yet our main naval purpose-the protection of our trade-coul d not be carried out -These are tbe plain sad out of home waters? WiU the advent of aircraft make tbe position easier?

It is ten chances to one that it would be wiped out to the last bottom. Without a base, it would bo whittled away by thu air and submarine forces of the enemy, without ever meeting the enemy's grand fleet. As blockading by big ships has been shown to be impossible in the face of modern flotillas, it would appear that there is no use for the battleship wliere the bases aro far apart. Battle-fleets are only of use in certain geographic divisions, where the bases are not fax apart. They are of no use for wars in which the combatant countries are separated by thousands of miles of ocean. I do not desire to delay the House by dealing at much greater length with this subject, but shall content myself with calling their attention to the opinion of RearAdmiral von Scheer, who offered such stout resistance to tbe British Navy off War. He saidOnly recently experiments made in America have made it clear that a battleship may be sunk by air planes. Even though the chance W.e bad the assistance of tbe of such successes would be lessened in tjie case of ships under way, and though tlie factor of defence did not enter into theee experiments, it cannot be denied that the prospects are favorable to the air planesince an attacking fleet cannot remain in motion permanently. It requires rest for the engines, time for the taking on hoard of munitions, fuel and supplies. It must dock for repairs, lie at anchor, and it is then that tlie opportunity for air attack presents itself. Tlie danger involved in being struck by a 2,000 lb. bomb from the sky also exists in tbe mines and torpedoes which threaten tbe battleship.

T be in for m a t i o n is being honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) asked me whether I would make available to the House the information obtained to date in connection with the survey of iron ore deposits in Australia. On looking into the matter I find that tbe information at present available is so inconclusive that a wrong impression would be given to the general public if it were released at this stage. It is felt that it would be much better to wait until the general survey bas been completed before publication is made.

I am now in a position to inform thc honourable member that there is no statutory obligai iou upon the Munitions Supply Board to furnish an annual report, but it has been customary to do so for the information of Parliament. The recently published report was delayed ^through, inability of the very limited administrative staff of :lie Munitions Supply Board to prepare il for printing. During recent years, for reasons of economy, biennial reports have been printed, but it is intended to revert io annual reports. A certain amount of delay is inevitable owing to the necessity for audit of tbe accounts after tbe close of tbe financial year, but arrangements arc being made to publish the report at an earlier date in future.
