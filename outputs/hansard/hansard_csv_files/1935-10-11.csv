9,Mr Lane,"The suggestion of honorkind. In the Domain they persist in declaring that this Government is imperialistic in its outlook, and that it does nothing else but foster the great capitalistic system to the detriment of the workers of Australia. I have always claimed that the present Opposition is not, willing to give to the Commonwealth and never has been, the friend of the workers of this country. We have inherited our system of government from Britain, and it has proved ideal. Honourable members opposite constantly claim that this Government has the support of Communists. gentleman who makes such a statement can be regarded as being in the kindergarten stage of politics. this House, honourable members opposite claimed that Soviet Russia was tbe only country which had a scheme, for the rehabilitation of the workers. Now they attempt to make political capital out of the fact that to-day the British Government ancl the Commonwealth Government are receiving support from that country in the present crisis. Last night the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) gave a good description of Russia as it is to-day, warnhave to get it out of that war. The idea ing this Government against accepting its support. I wonder whether, the honourable member is aware of the fact that when Soviet agents were sent to Britain to try to sovietize the workers of Britain they were peremptorily ordered out of the country. That action on the part of Russia was repudiated also by representatives of the Labour party in Britain, who, I claim, would to-day repudiate the Lang party in this House as being unBritish and un-Australian in its attitude in this crisis. Statements made by honourable members opposite that the Commonwealth Government is in league with the Communists futed by a glance at the Crimes Act, through which this Government tells Communists, and members of any organization which seeks by armed force to change the present system of government, in this country, that they will be deported. In this crisis, the Communist? see a danger that dictatorships in certain countries may be further strengthened. They saw a similar danger when Mr J. T. Lang nailed the doors of the taxation office in Sydney and when mine riots occurred in New South Wales some years Mr Lame. ago. I have not the slightest doubt that the Communists see a parallel between the position which then existed in New South Wales, and the present crisis. YQuorum formed.} Any support which the Communists in Australia may be Government in the present' situation arises from their experience of the Lang group in Australian politics. That section of the Labour movement has betrayed every British instinct of justice, truth and peace. Its sole object is to lead the Any honourable people of Australia to believe that in the present crisis this Government will, at all costs, involve Australia in war. When I entered Treachery of that kind member must not apply the word "" treachery "" to other honourable members. for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) claimed that Mr S. M. Bruce, as Australia's representative in the League of Nations, has an open mandate, and that if M i . Bruce put Australia into a war in the present crisis, this Parliament would that this Government would repose iu the hands of any one man the right to say whether this country should or should not go to war is ridiculous, and honourable members who make such statements are beggared for arguments. It is to the advantage of Australia and in the interests of the peace of the world that Great Britain and Australia should stand side by side in facing this issue. It is clear that whatever Mussolini, or Italy, may do, Great Britain can be trusted to do the honourable and just thing by the nations of the world as a whole. In the past, it has acted as the protector of can be reweaker nations, and in future it will see that the rights of these nations are safeguarded. I venture to say, therefore, that Australia will not depart from the lead whicli the Mother Country has given to the world in the present crisis.

12,Honourable Member For Dalley ( Mr Rose,"way) in bis speech last night read a list of twenty nations, members of the League, claiming that all of these were insignificant and would not even be able to supply a single gun for any war that might eventuate. Much has been said by honourable members opposite with regard to the attitude of the League towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. Honourable members must be aware of the fact that Japan acted on that occasion to frustrate the efforts of Russia to sovietize China. Probably, Japan's in fluence will be to the benefit of China. The whole of that trouble arose because efforts were made to foist upon China the policies of bloodthirsty sovietism, policies which are supported by members of the Lang party in this House. terrible thing for any honourable member to say.

One honourable member said that the League has no power to enforce its decisions, but the League is composed of many nations, all of them possessing forces which may be used to uphold its decisions if the nations choose. Some honourable members opposite have professed to see sinister motives behind the actions of Great Britaini n this crisis, but surely they do not credit the League with any motive other than peace. Unfortunately, we know only too well that all this talk Mr Speaker, that is a is merely so much propaganda designed to undermine the prestige of Great Britain.

House for its courtesy, but in view of the length of time that the debate has now occupied, I do not propose to avail myself of the extension. should not have taken part in this debate but for repeated statements by Ministers that the Australian Labour party occupies an isolated position in connection with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Tbe Melbourne Herald, which made this Govprnment, reports as follows:The British Independent Labour party has adopted a resolution against sanctions, stating that such measures will mean war, not on behalf of the League, but between Italian and British imperialism. Suchn war is not worth tlie life of a single worker. That resolution of the Independent Labour party of Britain gives the He direct to the statements made by at least two or three Ministers regarding the attitude of the Australian Labour party. Italy claims . that it is making war against an uncivilized savage tribe of people, which is not fit to be a member of the League of Nations. The Sun, Sydney, yesterday published the following illuminating paragraph, attributed to : Dispute. the commander-in-chief of the southern McE.wcn, J. section of the Abyssinian army:Nock, H . K .

If the League were constituted as it should be, and as every right-thinking man hopes it eventually will be, there would be no war in Abyssinia. The workers of the world should be sufficiently organized to foi'Ge upon nations a policy of peace by -the adoption of a general strike against war. Surely everybody hopes that it will never be necessary for tbe League of Nations to apply sanctions against any aggressor. The time will come when thpre will be no aggressors. It has been suggested that the imposition of sanctions on Italy in the present dispute is not likely to lead other nations into the conflict. Just let me indicate from a report published yesterday in the Melbourne Herald, what the application of sanctions does meanTlie Geneva correspondent of the Daily Telegraph learns that the first Anglo-French plan for sanctions against Italy will be drafted on the following basis:(1) No foreign loans to Italy. (2) Restriction of certain Italian imports into foreign countries. (3) Restriction of export to Italy of material required for the manufacture of armaments. (4) Raising the arms embargo in respect of Abyssinia.",18,Setup

The last item in -that report indicates that steps aj'e to be taken to supply arms to Abyssinia. Apparently Italy has. already been supplied. This is necessary to ensure a first-class scrap. Austria and Hungary, have dissented from the imposition of sanctions upon Italy. Other nations may follow their load, and refuse to attempt to apply sanctions The honourable member for Barton referring to remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr armaments. Holloway), either deliberately, or unwittingly, made it appear that the honourable member was hostile to the League of Nations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports had merely repeated what the French delegates,are reported to have said at Geneva, namely, that France was not prepared to apply military sanctions-indeed , it is still doubtful whether that country will apply those military sanctions-and I endorse everything lie said. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that Soviet Russia will take part in the application of sanctions. The attitude of the Australian Labour party, as expressed by members of the Opposition in this House, has precedent in the views of the Independent Labour party of Great Britain aud in declarations previously made on behalf of Labour in other Australian Parliaments. been declared over and over again by responsible men that the row in Abyssinia is not worth the sacrifice of a single Australian life. Tlie only construction that can be placed on an answer given this morning by tbe Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) to a question asked by the Leader of the Opnosition ( Mr Our tin) is that Australia is committed willy-nilly to follow the lead of Britain. inadvisable for Australia to support Britain in the application of sanctions at this or any other time. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr armament foivessels i i i each category, ancl Ward) referred to the naval agreement reached between Great Britain and Germany, an agreement entered into without the approval of the League of Nations. I wish to direct attention to the fact that portion of this agreement dealing with submarines enables Germany's submarine strength to be equivalent to the total _ submarine tonnage of the navy of the "" Britisli Commonwealth of Nations. At present it has tentatively been agreed that the percentage of Germany's submarines to British shall be 45, but Germany has insisted on tlie right to increase that to 100 per cent. On page 511 of the Journal of ifoa Parliaments -of the Empire appears the following passage:On :18th of June a White Paper was issued containing the text of Notes exchanged bet«ecn the British Government and the Germanf Government regarding the limitation of naval Publication of the document followed conversations in London between representatives of tlie two governments. It was stated in the White; Paper that tlie primary purpose of the conversations had been R» prepare the way for tlie holding of a general conference on the .limitation of naval armaments. In a Note addressed to Herr von Kibbentrop the Foreign Secretary (Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare) announced the acceptance by the British Government of the German Government's proposal that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the members -oi tlie Britisli Commonwealth of. Nations should be in the proportion of 35: 100* "" The -British Government,"" the Note said, "" regard bins proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe tliat the agreement which they have now reached with the German Government, and which they regard as a permanent ancl definite agreement as from to-day between the two governments, It has will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of tlie world.' A PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP. It was explained that the ration of 35: 100 is to be a permanent relationship. 'Germany will adhere to it in all circumstances, e.g. the ration will not be affected by the construction of otlier Powers. If the general equilibrium of liaval armaments, as normally maintained iii the past, should be violently upset by any abnormal and exceptional construction by other Powers, the German Government reserve tlie right to invite the British Government to I believe that it would be examine the new situation thus created. The German Government favour, in the matter of limitation of naval armaments, that system which divides naval vessels into categories, lixfrig the maximum tonnage and/or allocates the tonnage to be allowed to each Power by categories of vessels. If no general treaty on naval limitation should be concluded, or if the future general treaty should not contain provision creating limitation by categories, the manner and degree in whicli the German Government will have the right to vary the 35 per cent, ratio in one or more categories will be a matter for settlement by agreement between the German Government and the British Government in tlie light of the naval situation then existing. In the matter ot submarines Germany, while not exceeding the ratio of 35: 100 in respect of total tonnage, is to have the right to poshave allowed of the dissection of the carsess a submarine tonnage equal to the total submarine tonnage possessed by the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The German Government, however, undertake that, except in the circumstances indicated in thu immediately following sentence, Germany's submarine tonnage shall not exceed 45 per cent, of the total of that possessed by the members of the Britisli Commonwealth of Nations. The German Government reserve the right, in the event of a situation arising which in their opinion makes it necessary for Germany to avail herself of her right to a percentage of there was no need to worry about it . submarine tonnage exceeding the 45 per cent, above mentioned, to give notice to this effect to the British Government, and agree that the matter shall be the subject of friendly discussion before the German Government exorcise that right. I suggest that Germany is competent to increase its submarine tonnage to a strength equal to that of tbe British Navy. Let us consider what was thought of the actions of governments, and what views were held in regard to submarine warfare, by those who had charge of .naval units in the last war. I believe that every honourable member, and every .right-thinking person, recognizes the hideous nature of such an attack as that made by submarines-on e of the vilest creations of science. In Memories, Lord Fisher publishes the following communication which he, as tbe Admiral of the British Fleet, sent to Von Tirpitz, Admiral of the German Fleet, on the 29th March, 1916:Dear old Tirps, We are both in the same boat! What a -time we've been colleagues, old boy! However, we did you in the eye over the battle cruisers, and I know you've said you'll never forgive me for it when bang went the Blueher and Von Spee and all his host! Cheer up, old chap! Say ""Resurgam""! You're the one German sailQr who understands war! Kill your enemy without being killed yourself. I don't blame you for the submarine business. I'd have done the same myself, only our idiots in England wouldn't believe it when not be accepted. I suggest that where .1 told 'em ! So long! Yours till hell freezes, .Apparently these gentlemen regard naval -warfare as a. sort of holiday, in which they expect to have rather a good time while it lasts. Yet we are told that it Mr Martens. is not the desire of certain governments to become involved in the present conflict! I suggest that if an agreement could have been reached which would case to the satisfaction of the t r in i ty in terested in it , there would have been no trouble in Abyssinia. The vested in terests of the capitalists of GreatB rita in and France prevented the making of such an agreement. Those individuals were not prepared to concede to It a l y the share of the carcase which it desired. Action was not taken to prevent war in Manchuria because, from their view-point, But when it was a case of a waterway being made available to* It a l y and with held from those then using it , they were not prepared to accept the word of the Dictator of It a l y that he would conserve the rights and interests of Great Britain and France, but were willing to supply munitions of war and other essentials to Abyssinia. A t the outbreak of the last war I held the view that it was being waged in order to make secure the in terests of capitalism in different countries. Similarly, I believe that the present conflict w ill be continued u n t i l those interests are secured in Abyssinia. It is not intended that either Mussolini, or any one else shall obtain a part of their pound of flesh. Tbey are not worrying about the settlement of Italy's surplus population. The journal from which I have already quoted says at page 514After reading to the House Part IV. of the Treaty the first Lord added: ""This means that Germany has agreed never again to resort to what was known during the war as unrestricted submarine warfare "". If the statements made in 1914 and during the years of the war by the supporters of lionorable members opposite and the press were true, there is no more justification for believing Germany now than there was then. Germany proved by its actions in the war that it3 word could vested interests are sufficiently great, there is every possibility that the same thing w ill occur again. Although not a member of the League of Nations, Germany is, to some extent, allied with it . Its dictator, Hitler, has undertaken that it w ill take no part in this dispute, but will remain strictly neutral. I venture the opinion that before long some question will arise that will cause honorment of world peace. It operates in the able members opposite to say "" How can one take the word of Hitler"" ? Very hard things have been said of that gentlethis Parliament to weaken its association man by honourable members opposite as well as by writers for the press which voices their views. I am not apologizing for Hitler. I consider that he is one of the most brutal men who has ever had charge of the affairs of a nation. I am not prepared to accept either his word or that of others who represent the vested interests of different countries, as this Government represents the vested interests of Australia. On the admission made by the Prime Minister this morning, this Government has become deeply involved in the present disturbance. I have read an extract from yesterday's Melbourne Herald to the effect that the Independent Labour party of Great Britain has stated that the scrap in Abyssinia neutral, but would an enemy so regard is not worth the loss of one British life. To that I would add that it is not worth the loss of one Australian life. It is not a war that concerns the workers of either this or any other country. It concerns the investment of capital by certain indithe last war? viduals. I believe that the attempt by certain oil interests a little while ago to of the 'Government on this subject; conclude an arrangement with the Emperor of Abyssinia was international in character. Capital is of such an international character that one who belongs to the inner group can "" work the oracle "" without appearing on the scene. I believe that the intention was to secure the control of certain oil wells in Abyssinia so as to take away the one thing which above all others Mussolini was seeking-supplies of oil for the Italian nation. \Quorum formed!} attitude in this matter is one not of neutrality but of entire support of the Going remarks would be made about how vernment and of opposition to the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley). It is indeed regrettable that all the nations of the world are not members of the League of Nations. The great purpose, and aim of that body would be simplified if such were the case. The League is more tbe safeguard of the small than of the other nations. It seeks to bring about peaceful understanding between nations in international disputes and also has the wider aim of the attainindustrial field, in the economic field, and in the field of international health. Were with the League it would weaken the purpose for which that institution stands. Although honourable members generally have declared themselves in favour of the objects of the League, in some cases they are not prepared to take the steps that are necessary for the maintenance of its affairs; in other words, they are ""ratting"" on ilic union to which they have pledged their adherence. I cannot understand their attitude. The State of Western Australia supports the League unequivocally and is prepared to stand by Great Britain to the hilt in any steps to maintain it. A declaration of neutrality is not possible to any unit of the British Eriipire. It might regard itself as it? Not at all. Do those who favour neutrality believe that they would be unmolested, because they had made that declaration? Did not we molest German nationals during [Quorum formed.] Those who disagree with the policy should try to consider Australia, as a member of the British Empire, in the position of Abyssinia. If a powerful nation attacked Australia and the other members of the British Empire said: "" We are not concerned in Australia's fight; we intend to remain neutral. We shall fight only if the war reaches our own shores"", what a hue and cry there would be from the very people here who are to-day saying that we should remain neutral! We should be deafened by speeches about the supposed solidarity of the Empire. MockAustralia was being punished by a foreign enemy without any protest from the other members of the Empire. To me, it is impossible to contemplate that Australia could remain neutral. Great Britain has done more than any other nation of the world to preserve peace. We must all admit that the League of Nations has been weak in certain respects and we may regret that it has not been stronger; but shall we help",19,Setup
20,"Mr Pkowse ""(Forrest) [12.10]","M yits weakness by remaining aloof'5 Shall we not rather be increasing its difficulties if we do anything whatever from giving their full assistance to it in this crisis? Certain honourable members have spoken about fiscal barriers as a contributing cause of war. We know that the economic conference at Geneva declared that the greatest cause of war was economic nationalism and the building of tariff barriers between one nation and another to prevent freedom of trade. Who are the parties in this House most guilty of the erection of high tariff barriers? Something has been said during the debate about Australia having an export trade with Italy to the value of about £3,000,000 per annum; but this trade is at the lowest ebb it has known for many years, solely because our insular attitude prevents reasonable reciprocity in trade with Italy. To maintain that insular nationalism we need the support of the other members of the British Empire. With a population of still considerably less than 7,000,000 we should be utterly unable to defend this vast continent if it were attacked. We should not, therefore, contemplate "" scabbing"" upon the League of -Nations or the other members of the British Empire. would be an entirely unreasonable attitude to adopt. We all approve of the ideals of the League of Nations and desire peace. The achievement of world peace is undoubtedly a great ideal. But can honourable members reasonably refuse to pay the price of -peace? Many of the speeches made during this debate have been quite inconsistent with tbe ideal of peace. It seems to me that there has been a regrettable degree of insincerity in the utterances of some honourable members. If we desire the League of .Nations to be effective, we must support it. We must not give its opponents any idea that we are weakening in our adherence TO it. Although for reasons of its own the United States of America has declined hitherto to associate itself with the League of Nations, it has, in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, independently declared in favour of sanctions, at least to the extent that it will prevent its people from exporting warlike materials for the use of either Italy or Abyssinia. I am of the opinion that the Mr Prowse. only honourable course open to us is to support the League to the utmost of our strength. The whole world has recognized to restrain our peoplt that Great Britain has been the biggest factor in the consolidation of the League of Nations. In that connection Britain has shown a sincerity that has never been questioned. There is infinitely more reason why we should follow the example of Great Britain in this connection than that of any other nation. Personally, I am prepared to support the Empire in all the efforts that it makes within the Covenant of the League of Nations to pireserve peace in this or any other dispute. I declare clearly that I am against war in any shape or form. That is' a logical conclusion that was forced upon me many years ago. It is true, and I confess it with humility and shame, that in the first week of the last war, I offered my services to Sir Charles Ryan, but he said to me, "" No , Maloney, it is not good enough.' We know that you are over 60 years of age. Even the Bulletin publishes your age every year."" I thought I was still able to bandage a wound or put a limb in splints; though I was That well aware that many much more able surgeons were available to perform the many major operations that would obviously be necessary in consequence of the war. However, my services were not accepted. I tried to fool my conscience by telling myself that I had offered my services with the object of alleviating human suffering; but I now realize that that was a subterfuge, and I am ashamed of it. I hate war, as I loathe the idea of hell. We know that during the last war, the leaders of various religious bodies in the Allied countries prayed that God would bless their bloodstained banners and bring them to victory, and that the leaders of the same religious bodies in the enemy countries were offering similar prayers for victory. Such hypocrisy speaks for itself. I do not believe that the leaders of the religious bodies of the world will misbehave themselves in that way if this dispute should become widespread. I have seen wrecked humanity return from many wars. I remember, for instance, the days of the Boer War. Sir",22,Fisher

Before he died, Sir John Madden wrote me a letter in which he expressed this regret. The government of that day did not keep its promise to the men whom it sent to the war. We know that, in the last war, the government of the day also made many promises to the men who went on active service. To an extent, those promises have been honoured, but not to anything like the full extent. Members of the medical profession, who have been required to examine returned soldiers, have refused to consider the condition of such men before their enlistment. How different has been the treatment accorded to its returned soldiers by the Government of the United States of America! In that country it is assumed that the men accepted for active service were inperfect health, and no question now arises as to whether disabilities which may have overtaken them since their return from the war are due to war service or not. In Australia many men were casually examined, and passed for active service under conditions which made it quite impossible for medical practitioners to ascertain whether they were in good health or not. The noise and bustle associated with the examination of some of the men who enlisted placed it beyond medical skill to tell whether the health of the men concerned was sound or not. It may be said, to the honour of some of the medical practitioners of Collinsstreet, Melbourne, that they offered their rooms to the government of the day for the purpose of making proper medical examinations of men who offered for active service; but their offer was not accepted. I have memories also of soldiers who returned from the wars of long ago. When I was a medical student at St. Mary's Hospital, I came into contact with a man who had been subjected to seventeen surgical operations. When we found that his bones would not mend and his wounds would not heal, we asked the British Government to provide him with am invalid chair; but, although he was one of the men present .at the famous Balaclava charge, and was receiving a pension of only 6d. a day, our request was refused. Had this man been a general, he might have been awarded a gift of £50,000, or even £100,000, but, because he was an under-dog, he got practically nothing. I am speaking for the under-dog. I must admit, however, that this Government is now taking steps to allow the re-examination of applicants for war pensions who,, because of the hitherto strict observance of the law, have not been able to obtain a re-consideration of their circumstances. We are members of the League of Nations, and have contributed about £60,000 a year to the maintenance of that great organization. I have wondered sometimes whether we have received value for the money so spent. No statesman has ever conceived greater ideals than those of the League of Nations. I have always regretted the timidityI am almost inclined to say cowardice -displaye d by the League when Japan stole portion of the territory of China. The Japanese are a lovable race, and I admire them for their many good qualities; but, unfortunately, they are dominated by their Mikado, whom they regard almost as a god. They are innately brave. In some parts of the pearl fisheries off the north coast of Australia, deeo-sea divers are unable to work more than a couple of hours a day. On one occasion a Japanese diver was brought to the surface dead, but within ten minutes another Japanese took his place. Like the Australian "" diggers,"" who wont "" over the top "" with a laugh, they have no fear of death. They make excellent soldiers, rivalling the Spartans of old. But the people of Japan, like those of Australia, have little voice in the conduct of public affairs. In Australia, no .referendum is held to decide whether the country shall go to war in the event of Britain being involved. I regret tliat the League of Nations took seventeen months to tell Japan that it was at fault in seizing the Chinese provinces. Men, women, and children by the thousand were blown to pieces, but seventeen months el.ipsed before the League protested, the excuse being that war had not been declared! ""Was the action of Japan any less murder because the engines of war were used against the Chinese? A valuable compendium issued by the Commonwealth Statistician's Department shows that three or four years ago Japan was Australia's second best customer, being second only to Great Britain, whilst China was seventh on the list. The last edition of that publication, however, indicates that China is now the third largest importer of Australian goods, and ranks next to Japan. China imports more of some commodities from Australia than does Japan. China is a peace-loving country, with a population of 450,000,000 compared .with Japan's 70,000,000. Dr. Sun Yat Sen was perhaps one of the greatest organizers the world had ever seen. In Government, he described a system of democracy which is far more advanced than that of Australia. I have to confess that the platform of the KuoMin-Tang is far ahead of that of the Labour party. I suppose that I am one of the few Australians who have had the privilege of meeting Dr. Sun Yat Sen. A man of striking appearance, he deeply impressed all whom he met. Fortunately for me, he spoke English fluently, and had studied medicine. It is interesting to know how he escaped death when in England. He was taken prisoner so that he might be sent back to China to have his head cut off. He became seriously ill, and a London specialist, who was called in, declared that he was in danger of his life. As he was being kept in prison against the laws of England, the London specialist induced tbe British Government to intervene, and the prisoner was released. taken back to China, those in charge of it would have been afraid of being beheaded. Dr. Sun Yat Sen returned to China, and was fortunately able to organize a successful revolution. When I spoke of the nineteen demands which Japan was cowardly enough to enforce upon China when the world was at war in 1914-18, he saidIf two of the demands were not withdrawn, concurs with the plan to enforce sancno doubt Japan could control China, and then Dr. Maloney. how easy would be the path to India! Japan would appeal to India, with its 350,000,000 inhabitants, and say, ""You are Asiatics. Adopt as your slogan, 'Asia for the Asiatics.' China, with its 450,000,000. led by 70,000,000 Japanese and assisted by 350,000,000 Indians could conquer the world. They could afford to lose 10,000,000 a year, and, if necessary, carry on the war indefinitely."" That, I believe, is the objective of Japanese war lords, and it is the reason why I regret that the League of Nations did not protest earlier than it did against Japan's intervention in China. In the case of Paraguay and Bolivia, terrible murder, referred to as war, was carried on for two years. Something was said about withholding supplies of ammunition from those nations, but the accursed ammunition makers, in their greed for money, were equal only to the oil trusts. When Germany threatened Austria, we must give Mussolini credit for the fact that it was his outspoken statement that his book, Three Forms of checked Germany He did what the League of Nations should have done. I have visited every country in Europe, except Russia, and after studying the views of the people, have come to the conclusion that Britain has very few friends on the Continent. Perhaps its only friend now is France. Italy was once its friend, but Italy will not be friendly with it again. I think it was more for the sake of Britain than any other country that Italy entered the last war, but it was not treated fairly in the division of the spoils. When the Attorney General( Mr Menzies) said that Britain might be forced to revert to the twopower standard, he was talking with hi3 tongue in his cheek. At one time the flag of England dominated the world, but that will not occur again. Never again will Britain be able to adopt a two-power standard. The oil combine in the United States of America is led by Rockefeller, If his dead body had been who is styled the king of oil. Sir Henri Deterding, who leads the British combine, is called the Napoleon of oil. These trusts are unscrupulous in their methods, and will not stop even at murder. Sitting suspended from. 1.2.J/5 to 2.15 p.mSydney newspapers during the luncheon adjournment, I find a report published in the Labor Daily to the effect that France tions against Italy, and that complete.",23,Fisher
22,Dr. Maloney,"Reading to-day'sagreement is believed to have been reached between M . Laval and Mr Eden regarding the first stage o i sanctions against Italy. These, it says, w ill be economic and financial in character. The report adds that the question of a naval blockade is to be left i u abeyance, thus supporting the contention of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) that France w ill not go to war. believe in economic sanctions as a means of maintaining peace, but I am sure that country will not be foolish enough to go to war. Australia is looked upon by every landhungry nation in the world as having too much territory. In fact, B r it a in is considered to have a greater share of the face of the globe than it is f a i r l y entitled to on the basis of European populations. The time might come, perhaps, not while men of my age are alive, but at a later date, when, through the League of Nations, land-hungry countries w ill ask tlie British confederation to disgorge some of its territory. "" The League of Nations acted foolishly, I think, when it offered and Australia accepted a mandate to control Antarctica, an area one-third the size of this continent. such a mandate was accepted by Australia provides an argument to land-hungry nations, that B r it a in controls an unfair share of territory. If I remember rightly, I was the only honourable member who opposed Australia's acceptance of that mandate, and I did so on the ground that it would excite further envy on the part of land-hungry nations. that it would have been better for us to have thanked the Leaguef o r the honour it did Australia by making such a request, and to have asked the League to hold that mandate itself for the benefit of the whole world. That would have been a splendid gesture on our part, hut, unfortunately, we followed course, for which, in the opinion of landhungry nations, we shall be looked upon as a greedy country. I believe that big oil interests are responsible for present day high politics in England. The operations of the world's two great oil combines are dealt with in Warf o r Oil. One of these is controlled by Rockefeller, who is called the "" K in g of O i l "" , and the other, a British combine, is controlled by SirH e n r i Deterding, who is known as the "" Napoleon of O i l . "" The author f this book ascribes the f a l l of 0 three Presidents of Mexico to the fight for oil in Mexico between these combines. The first of these presidents was Madero, who succeeded President Diaz, as vile as any monarch who ever susstained a throne, and under whose rule To a certain extent France may the people of Mexico had been reduced to the level of serfs. Madero was known as the Ohrist-fool, because he returned the land to the people, and thus became to the oil interests an obstacle to be removed. A t auy rate one oil combine started a rebellion which ended in bis assassination. Madero was succeeded by President Huerta, a full-blooded Indian, who participated in the revolution which brought about the downfall of his predecessor. In his turn Huerta was removed from office by a counter revolution started by the opposing oil interest. Then President Carranza assumed office. A great lover of his country he threatened that if the American oil combine did not stop interfering in Mexican affairs, he would ally with Germany and declare war against the United States of That America. Neither of the oil combines wanted such a thing to occur, so each kept quiet for the time being, but so soon as peace was established the two of them renewed their intrigues, and Carranza was removed from office. That, briefly, is the history of the activities of the oil interests in Mexico. I submitted One of the highest official posts which can be held by a man outside his own country is that of ambassador or Minister Plenipotentiary. I propose to show that not even men holding such high positions are free from the intrigues of oil interests. The right honourable Sir Arthu r Hardinge, in his book A. Diplomatist m the East, page 27S, makes a f u l l another confession of his experiences in this matter. He saysThe first important duty which confronted me a few months after mv arrival at Teheran was that of securing for* a British companv an important concession of Persian oil-fields Although oil was believed to exist in abundance on the shores of the Persian Gulf, its deposits had never been seriously developedKV ,« t uly Processor, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, believed-and his opinion was supported by a Persian-Armenian financier named Kitabji Khan-that it might not improbably be found in abundance in the Turco-Persian frontier region, which is traversed by the great pilgrim road from Teheran through Hainadan to Bagdad. Sir Henry Wolff accordingly wrote a letter of introduction, brought by a Mr Marriott, whom he recommended in it to my good offices, and who would, he went on to say, explain to me fully the character and objects of his mission. Its main end, which appeared to me well deserving of support, was to win the goodwill of the Persian Government by assigning shares in tlie proposed development of the rich oil fields believed to exist in Western Persia to Eome of its most influential Ministers, including the Grand Vizier himself. I accordingly nt once interviewed that statesman, and strongly urged that the concession, which had been already laid before him, and which, if I remember correctly, gave exclusive rights to dig for oil throughout Persia, except in the provinces bordering on Russia-Azerbaijan, Ghilan, Mazenderan and Khorassan-to an Australian mining magnate, a Mr D'Arcy, who was ready to finance the undertaking. The Grand Vizier declared himself prepared to fall in with the project, but he suggested that a letter-to be written by me, in the Persian language, embodying its main featuresshould be immediately drawn up for submission to the Russian Legation. Ho was awarethat M. Argyropulo could not read Persian, more especially in the written or ""shikaste"" character, which is illegible, owing to its peculiar abbreviations, even to scholars familiar with the printed language. He also knew from his own spies that the Russian Oriental secretary, M. Stritter, who alone could read it, was about to leave Zergendeh, the summer residence of the Russian Legation, for a short sporting excursion in the neighbouring hills. He therefore sent the letter to Zergendeh, where it lay several days untranslated, awaiting M. Stritter's return, and as no objection to the proposal contained in it was made by the Russia.u Minister, who could not read it, and never suspected the importance of its contents, all the Persian members of the Government supported the Grand Vizier's decision to sign the concession to Mr D'Arcy. M. Argyropulo was far from pleased when he learnt what had actually happened; but the Grand A'izier could not be blamed for the accidental and temporary absence of his Legation's Persian translator, and the Russian Minister accordingly adopted the sensible course of accepting the accomplished fact. Ho required, however, some compensation at the hands of the Persian Government, though he had to wait a little time for it. Thus the oil interests of GreatB r it a in did not hesitate, in order to achieve their ends, to make use of one of the highest British officials outside Britain. This shows to what extent the oil interests iviTT go. I am against war; I hate its very name,, for I have seen its horrors. I have traversed areas years after battles have Dr.. Maloney. been waged on them, and I ' have studied them closely. The more I ponder on this subject. I believe that war can only emanate from the devil-if there be such a thing. My sympathy goes out to Abyssinia in the present crisis as it would go out to a lower form of life in similar circumstances. I hope that war will not be declared. member has exhausted his time. [2.27] -Honorabl e members opposite have been unable to express more fervently than honourable members supporting the Government the desire that there should not be war or that Australia should not participate in hostilities should such result from the present crisis. So far this Government has taken no action whatever to involve the Commonwealth or to indicate that it is desirous of sending men or munitions overseas to participate in war. The rambling debate we have had on the Abyssinian situation has been made possible primarily by the submission of a motion for the printing of a paper containing a statement of the position as it appeared to the Government at the moment. Most of the statements which have been made from the other side have had no bearing on the situation, and it would probably have been better if the greater part of them had not been made.

Such circumstances have never yet arisen. Sanctions, admittedly day been imposed against Italy in the hope that they will be sufficient to restrict menace Abyssinia. to see the world plunged once more into terrible strife, but Britain's casewhatever it may be-'inevitably involves the Commonwealth. The menace of Italy in the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean, and the Red Sea, affects Australia as much as it affects Great Britain. theatre of war is almost half-way on the journey between the Commonwealth aud Britain, and just how great the Italian menace is in the present circumstances is shown by the fact that Italian submarines are patrolling the waters on the Australian side of Suez. Some honourable members have gone so far as to assert that Australia is not a member of the British Empire. during war, but in times of peace they are prepared to partake of all the good things which membership of the Empire makes possible. They Labour Councils of the League of Nations, are represented at meetings of those councils, and are prepared to authorize payments of money to ensure the continued existence of them.

These agreeAustralia's ments to which Australia, along with other nations, has affixed its signature provide the means for a hoped for curtailment of the Italian offensive against Abyssinia. Australia should play its part in Britain's efforts to preserve the peace of the world. Britain's preparedness to depend on the League of Nations to bring about peace is illustrated by its determinaHonorable tion to honour obligations, and the reductions of its military and naval forces. government Success, I trust, will come from Britain's great effort to lead the world into harmonious relations. Conscription' will never be [2.50] -The debate has covered a wide field from the League of Nations procedure to many other subjects, including imperial constitutional relations. I have no wish to repeat the many arguonly economic, have toments and points of view that have found expression in the last few days. The dispute has been dealt with in accordance that country's desire to with the League Covenant. Articles 11, I do not want 15 and 16 have been successively invoked. The main objective behind the procedure of the League is the creation of delay in order that among other things world opinion might be given time and opportunity to mobilize itself against the side that is pronounced the aggressor. TheI f any vindication of the League is necessary it is to be found in the unanimous vote of the Council and the practically unanimous vote of the Assembly in the last two or three days. I believe that most honourable members of this House believe that the future of the world depends largely on the success of the League. The unanimous vote of the Council and the practically unanimous vote of the They make these statements Assembly mean the practically unanimous vote of the. civilized countries of the world, numbering 50 or 60 countries. We are not called upon in this House to support the adjudicate between Italy and Abyssinia. That has been done already by the Council of the League of Nations, which was unanimous in its declaration of where the. guilt lies. The four main points, as I understand it, on which the question of guilt was decided, were whether the four principal obligations into which Italy had entered had or had not been broken. These were the 1906 Treaty,",27,Fisher
25,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer )by which Italy, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed the integrity of Abyssinia. The second was the entry by Abyssinia, sponsored by Italy, into the League in 1928, an act by which all States members of the League, and, one can assume, particularly the State which sponsored Abyssinia, guaranteed its territorial integrity. Then again by the Abyssinian Treaty of 1928, Italy guaranteed the territorial and other integrity of Abyssinia. The fourth point was article 12 of the Covenant under which all States members agreed not to go to war within three months of the report of the Council on the dispute. believe, were the four points on which Italy was declared the aggressor, apart from whether it had been technically the aggressor against Abyssinia within -the last, few weeks. Fortunately this House is not called upon to judge where the guilt lies. The evidence is not before the House. Council of the League which has pronounced its unanimous judgment. It has been asked in this House: As the League failed in the Manchurian dispute in which Japan was involved, and the procedure of the League was invoked only to a very limited extent in that dispute, why should the League so meticulously in this case invoke every possible measure of pressure on the alleged aggressor ? The Manchurian dispute was of a very different class. In the first place, Japan had been deeply involved in Manchurian affairs for many years before the recent dispute occurred. It was in virtual possession of Manchuria, or Manohukuo as it is now named. Japan supplied what was in effect the only real administrative machinery. -of sovereignty in respect of Manchuria was much less distinct than it is in the case of Abyssinia. He would have been a brave international lawyer who would have set out in clear terms the position regarding the sovereignty of Manchuria. -Japan's occupation and establishment of the Manchukuo republic were on a very -different footing to the present ItaloAbyssinian dispute, and I think there is -every justification for invoking all the League's procedure in this case. I do not propose to deal with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), that the countries that signed that pact renounced war as a means of national expression, because I think that the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies), in a speech that all sides of the House must have recognized as one of great restraint, reserve, clarity and strong argument, convinced members that the-Kellogg Pact is not inconsistent with adherence to the Covenants of the League, and the procedure of the League when an outbreak of hostilities occurs or is threatened. The Covenant of the League is, I believe, the greatest expression that the These, I world has ever seen of international law. It is the most all-embracing expression of international law that the world has ever witnessed. It is the embodiment of the Rule of Law, and like any other law, it is dependant, in the end, on force. Many things have been said about the failures of the LeagueA l l of it was before the in various disputes. It is almost a truism to remind some honourable members of the proposition that the League's strength is no more than the strength of the States which form its membership. The weaknesses of the League are merely the weaknesses. of the States, and its failures or alleged failures are those of the member States. The League of Nations is the embodiment of collective responsibility. It embraces a few big, powerful States and a large number of small, npn-poworful States. I have always had a certain amount of doubt whether the League in an extremity could provide solution of disputes between big States, particularly if hot blood is involved. That doubt is shared by many others. The League of Nations procedure, however, provides means for Furthermore the question stopping aggression by a powerful State against a small and undeveloped State. And we all hope that the League Covenant will secure that for the world. The majority of the League's members are small States. Australia is a small State, small in numbers but occupying a great area of land, and it should be very jealous of the principles of the League Covenant and of the privileges which League membership gives. Instead of trying to decry the League, Australia should be amongst the foremost of those countries whose endeavours are aimed at maintaining the prestige of the League. I believe that those countries that have riot the nerve to live up to the obligations of the party's platform when I claim imposed by membership of the League, do not deserve the security that the collective arrangements of the League would bring to them. Whatever the outcome of this unfortunate dispute may be, one thing seems to be clear-the Avhich compose the British Empire must by all the means at their disposal put their strength iiito the Empire. lieve personally, and it is also almost a truism that the British Empire is the biggest, single agency for peace in the world. We should do everything possible to cement the bonds of Empire, and make sure that they will not break at the slightest tension. There are not wanting people in this' community who are willing ancl ready to mount a public platform at any time of the day or night, and state in a round-sounding voice that they are Australians first, last and all the time, and do not wish to be dependent upon any other country, not even upon Great Britain. That is a cry which, among an unthinking audience, would always raise an unthinking cheer. Do these people actually believe that Australia could, of itself, maintain itself for any length of time? Do they realize what might happen to the enormous surplus ""of our primary production? Do they take into account the matter of defence? Do they believe that the 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 persons in Australia could defend this country unaided? What may be of even more importance, do they regard our diplomatic prestige as sufficient for the maintenance of our most cherished institution-tlie tralia policy? none of those three material counts could Australia maintain itself outside the British Empire. Neither the policy of a White Australia nor the physical defence of this country could be maintained in opposition to any one of a dozen hostile nations. The view of the Opposition generally is very definitely the short view. On the long view., Australia's future is cast within the British Empire for as many years ahead as we can see. The statement has been made from the opposite benches that Australia should never send one of its citizens to fight outside of this country. I assume that Mr Casey. I am not doing an injustice to that plank that it means what it says. The inference to be drawn from it is that Australia would not go to the assistance of any other part of the British Empirenot even New Zealand, Canada, or South countries Africa, let alone Singapore or the British colonies-if it were attacked or were in danger of being attacked. ThatI beis an entirely untenable view-point. Leaving out of consideration the British sentiment, and the fact that in the past we have been dependent for oiir very existence upon Great Britain and the rest of the Empire, and judging the matter on material grounds alone, it is impossible to hold the view that Australia should never send its citizens abroad to fight, and that whatever fighting had to be done should be done inside its shores. We know that the emblem of fascist Italy is a bundle of sticks, whicli, singly, could be broken, but which, when bound together, are unbreakable. It has always appealed to me that that emblem of fascist Italy might well have been adopted by the League of Nations, because it is inherently the emblem of collective security. It is a cruel irony that it should have become the emblem of the first great country to flout the League, and diminish its prestige. war which is confronting Australia at the present time raises the most important issue with which this Parliament has been concerned since 1914, and may White Ausinvolve the death of 'hundreds of I submit that on thousands of persons. It is our duty to decide whether Ave shall allow the Australian people to be faced with the possibility of sharing in the danger's associated with it. To-day's press contains Italy's reply to the suggestion that sanctions shall be imposed. There seems to be every possibility that the world as a Avhole is about to face what would be the worse war in history. |We must, therefore, consider the matter calmly and dispassionately, and not be misled by sentiment or emotionalism into the making of decisions, at whicli we would not otherwise arrive.",29,Fisher
26,Mr Baker (Griffith) [3.5],"Th eThe opinion, held on this side of the House is that any person or nation agreeing to the application of economic sanctions must necessarily he prepared to follow that decision-to its logical condo so because of his experience in matters clusion by agreeing, if necessary, to the imposition of military sanctions. That is the reason for the attitude which the Australian Labour party is adopting. disunity exists in the Australian Labour movement in regard to this matter. In movement which is called upon, to decide <ihe question-the 27 public representatives of the two sections of Labour in this Parliament-ther e is complete unanimity as to what action should be taken by Australia. On tbe other hand, if we are to believe that section of the press which is not favourably disposed towards the political opinions which we hold, until recently there was considerable lack of unity in the ranks of members of the Cabinet. The Vice-President of the Executive Council who backward in declaring himself when there has been the suggestion of a war in which' Australia might participate, rushed into publicity at the end of August last with a definitely considered, deliberate statement that one of the most unwise moves would be participation by Great Britain in this war. As a matterof fact that statement brought him into conflict with Professor Charteris. But the point with which we are concerned , and that which has caused 1 the Cabinet considerable anxiety, is that the man who has had the widest administrative experience of warfare, who was a war-time Prime Minister, and who left the party that had secured his introduction into politics because of the attitude he had adopted,, is the very member of the Cabinet who to-day definitely warns the Government party against being led into this war. It is particularly noticeable, and certainly not a coincidence, that its prevention. When sanctions are aptlie right honourable gentleman is practically the sole member of the Cabinet who has not spoken in this debate; he has carefully refrained from dealing with the matter, notwithstanding the fact that but a few short months ago he was stumping from one end of Australia to the other stressing the need for considerably greater preparations than were being made for national defence. At that time he adapted the role of an authority, and was perfectly entitled to of defence. The League of Nations was formed shortly after the last war for the purpose of endeavouring to bring about perpetual It has been claimed that peace; but it was formed on the understanding that the great nations of the world would necessarily be components of that section of the Labour it. Obviously it could not he a success if the great powers refrained from joining it. It is most unfortunate that the particular nation whose president was more responsible than any other individual for the formation of the League, was the first to break away from it. In cidentally, the main reason given for its abstention from participation in the activities of the League was that its voting strength in the Assembly was not any greater than tliat of Australia or any other British dominion. A t the present (Mi-. Hughes), time only four of the seven Great has never previously been Powers are members of the League. They are: Great Britain, France, Russia and Italy. Germany, the United States of America and Japan are not now members of it. One of those four powers is the power against which action in regard to sanctions is being taken; consequently, only three are left to enforce the decisions of the League. Great Britain alone is particularly anxious to give effect to the Covenant of the League. Prance has very tardily been brought to agree with certain proposals in regard to sanctions. Russia, as the honourable loway) has pointed out, has private motives for its agreement with participation in a conflict, should one take place. iWithout any attempt at warmongering, it must be realized that there is every probability that a conflict will take place, and that it is for us to consider what attitude will best tend towards plied, the nation which will be responsible for their application in the greatest degree is Great Britain. The Sydney Morn* ing Herald, which usually is regarded as one of the most sober of journals in such matters, points out to-day that already the French newspapers are predicting that a blockade' ef the Red Sea.",31,Fisher
27,Member For Melbourne Ports ( Mr Hol,"by Great Britain will be in operation within a few weeks. Great Britain is voluntarily allowing itself to be made to act as the policeman of the world. Italy has made it very clear in a statement in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald that she will adopt a definite attitude in respect of any nation which acts against its interests in consequence of any attempt to enforce sanctions. tions may be, the enforcement of sanctions by the League of Nations against one nation amounts to an act of war; and in this case it would be an act of war against a nation which is itself a member of the League. I direct particular attention to the following paragraph which appears in this morning's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald:Tlie Pome correspondent of The Times says that Tta.ly bitterly complains of the treatment world peace; otherwise it would have she has received from the League, and adds: "" The Powers now assembled at Geneva are solemnly warned; not only that economic measures are a two-edged weapon calculated to injifre the wielder of it at least as much as. if not more than, their object, but may quite easily signify the most tragic and the most terrible of wars, and consequently the irremediable end of the League of Nations."" That is exactly the position in which we find ourselves. Consequently, I contend that this Parliament should not allow the people of the Commonwealth to be involved in a war that might easily become the most tragic and terrible of all wars. It may be quite true that Italy is being forced to comply with the whims and wishes of one man who is, in fact, a megalomaniac with homicidal tendencies. This man has become intoxicated with power. This, surely, should be a warning to certain honourable gentlemen who are inclined to favour government by dictatorship. The natural corollary of such a system is that, sooner or later, the person holding the absolute power will make tbe people the victims of his own insensate desires. The League of Nations has had previous opportunities authority but has not accepted them. It took two years to intrude itself into the conflict between Paraguay and Bolivia, although both countries were members of it. A considerable period elapsed, also, before the League took an active part in the dispute between China ancl Japan, Mr Hat er. although at that time both those nations were connected with it. Japan seized four provinces from China, ancl recognized a form of government in the area involved that theLeague itself has so far declined to recognize; but no action was then taken to enforce either economic or military sanctions against Japan. When Germany suddenly decided to rearm in contravention of the provisions of However pacific our intenthe Peace Treaty, the League took no action to prevent it from doing so. We should, therefore, ask ourselves why there is this sudden enthusiasm to assert, the League's authority? It seems to me that the action of Great Britain in setting itself up as the world's policeman, has net been taken solely with humanitarian objects. Some other consideration is motivating Great Britain than the simple desire to assist the League to preserve taken similar action when earlier opportunities presented themselves for it to do so. It must be obvious to all thinking persons that for a considerable time a big scheme has been on foot to divide Africa among certain great powers. Italy, France, and England had, as a matter of fact, agreed to this policy: but Italy has to-day raced ahead of the other powers in this regard. I wish it to be understood that I am not arguing in favour of Mussolini, for I do not think that anything can be said in his favour. Nevertheless, the procedure' which Italy is now adopting to add Abyssinia to its territory is exactly similar to that which Great Britain itself adopted in years gone by to establish the Empire which now is so broad that, as some people are proud to say, the sun never sets on it. I know that certain parts of the Empire were secured to the British Crown by means of discovery; but perhaps even the accession of Australia to the Empire was ensured by means not altogether above suspicion. Italy is now to enforce its seeking to add Abyssinia to its possessions by a procedure that was regarded as quite proper a few generations ago. Perhaps the brutality of war was not so great in those times as it is to-day, but that is due solely to the fact that poison gas, military aeroplanes and mechanized engines of war had not then been invented. We must also realize that Mussolini is using conscript troops for the furtherance of his objectives. The soldiers being sent to Abyssinia from Italy, must either kill or be killed. These unfortunate men, numbering between 250,000 and 500,000, have been given no say whatever as to whether they will or will not go to Africa to slaughter the Abyssinians. An attempt is once more being made to promote Christianity by means of the gun and the bayonet, and to force upon uncivilized people a civilization which they may not be prepared to accept. Our high ethical and moral standards, as displayed by Italy's actions, may not. appeal to these people. of the story of a number of shipwrecked sailors who upon reaching an island saw a scaffold upon it and promptly said, ""Thank God, we have at last arrived at a civilized country "". It is deplorable that in such a crisis as we now face, the Commonwealth Government has no policy; or, if it can be said to have a policy, it is the policy of Great Britain, in the formation of which the Commonwealth Government has had no voice whatever. Not long ago, when the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) was asked to enunciate the policy of the Commonwen 1th in regard to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, he was guilty of evasion and equivocation; and it may be said that it was not until the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) made his speech on Wednesday night, that the people of Australia knew what was in the mind of the Government. The Attorney-General made it very clear to us that if Great Britain found itself at war, Australia would also be at war. That view is not acceptable to the Labour party. We believe that Australia has reached the status of a. nation, and that our 6,750,000 people should be allowed to decide fov themselves whether they will or will not become parties to a war. The decision should not depend upon the action of tbe Im perial Government. Our constitutional evolution during the last half century has been such that we have obtained greater and greater powers of self-government, until to-day, we regard ourselves as a. self-governing nation; but in reality how can it be said that we are self-governing if we are denied the right to determine the one matter which affects every home and touches every heart ? We should not be dealt with as dumb driven cattle and forced to follow Great Britain wherever it may lead us. Even in Great Britain itself, many leading newspapers are opposed to the policy of the Government; and in this country we know that many of our leading newspapers are opposed to the policy of this Government. More than that, the one Minister in this Government who might be regarded as the leading Minister for war, seems to show less enthusiasm than any of his colleagues for the view that Australia must participate in this conOne is reminded flict. Many leading constitutional authorities have set out the constitutional position of Australia aud the other dominions in a way that makes it clear beyond dispute that we have the right to determine our own course in a matter of this character. I direct the attention of honourable members to the following passage which appears in Leonard Le Marchant Minty's Constitutional Law of the British Empire:What active assistance a particular self governing dominion will be prepared to render tn thu Mother Country w ill depend entirely upon what provision is made by its legislature for voting supplies, etc. The Irish Free State Constitution Act i922, Article 49, provides: ""Save in the case of actual invasion the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eiran.ii) shall not be committed to active participation in any war without the assent of the Oireachtas "". There can be no doubt whatever about the meaning of those words. That citation is undoubtedly in accordance with the views that have been generally expressed following upon the evolutionary processes of constitutional procedure in recent years. It has been well recognized that each part of the Empire has the right to determine its own course in matters of this kind. Professor Berriedale Keith, in his book The Constitutional Law of the Britisli Dominions, saysThe dominions possess full control over their forces and even in war time, as is recognized by the Constitution of the Irish Free State, Article 49, it rests with their Parliaments to authorize their employment for purposes be3'ond self-defence. I may remind honourable members that Professor Berriedale Keith is one of the most notable authorities in the world on constitutional subjects-, and was, as a matter of fact, referred to withrespect by tbe Attorney-General. power before the Irish Free State was thought of. power has now been stated in statute form. It has been contended Lnthis. Pajdiasmeat that Australia does not enjoy this power. Apparently, the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) is the only member on the Government side who is aware of the actual position, but he has kept his knowledge on the matter well concealed. On page 427 of Professor Berriedale Keith's book is the following footnote:The doctrine was adopted in Canada in the Chanak incident on 18th September. .1922, and. Russia or some other nation. reiterated on tlie 1st March, 1923. It was in connection with the Chanak incident that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who was then Prime Minister, offered to send troops from Australia, without even consulting the Cabinet. The people of this country knew nothing about the proposal until it was announced that Australian troops would be despatched if a war should occur. Except that a discussion has taken place in this Parliament on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Australia is in a verysimilar position to that in which it found itself in connection with the Chanak incident. The Prime Minister of Canada and it would have involved the despatch of a the Leader of the Opposition in the much larger number of men. Canadian Parliament have declared that, whilst they are prepared to support the application of sanctions,, they will no^ situation that must arise if we go anv go so far as to agree to the sending of further in this matter.

The most pessimistic obviously have no doubt as to their constitutional position in this matter. They consider that their countries are entitled to participate in the application of economic, but not military, sanctions. They have no doubt that their attitude will not split the British Empire. At least they have the courage of their own convictions, and have not decided to wait, like the Commonwealth Government, until they hen'r the decision reached by the British Government. It is suggested that a general election will be held in Britain a month hence. It would be interesting to know if the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to follow the lead of Great Britain should a Labour government be returned to power, and attempt to induce Britain to embark upon a war to assist. be so foolish. would not be so foolish as to rush Britain into any war.. It may be contended that Australia would merely be required to send a quota of military, naval or air forces; but let us recall what happeji. in the last war. The then Prime Minister of Australia wired Great Britain, and promised 20,000 volunteers. That offer was accepted with great gratitude, yet eventually Australia sent 350,000 troop?.

The first report of the Grants Commisthe first report and provides grants based ou sion may be briefly summarized thus(i) It attempted in the first place to put a value on tlie various financial disabilities of the States which might justify grants-including disabilities from federation (e.g. the t a r if f) selves, ground for assistance: and whatever and inferior natural resources-bu t arrived at the conclusion that this method was impracticable. ( i i) It then approached the subject from the point of view of State budgets as reflecting the .sum total of all disabilities from which these States laboured. ( i i i ) The principle was adopted that tiic claimant States should receive grants which would make it possible for them to function with reasonable effort at a standard not appreciably below that of the other States. (iv) The average deficit of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland for 1932-33 was taken as the standard and after making up or down adjustments to bring the claimant States to somewhere near the average for social services, administration, taxation, &c., and also making some deductions for past mistakes, the commission finally recommended the following .grants for 1934-30 which were approved by Parliament:Amount. £ South Australia.. Western Australia Tasmania 2,400,00 0 The second report of the Grants Commission relating to grants for the year 1935-36 was received immediately prior to the budget, and has since been circulated to honoralbla members. In this report the commission has considerably developed its examination into the position of claimant States. It is a lengthy document, and shows that the commission has spared no pains in an endeavour to arrive at an equitable measurement of the assistance that should be rendered to claimant States. separate chapters to such matters as "" The Principles "" ; "" The Underlying Causes"" ; "" The Determination of Standards of Problems of Comparison""; "" Measurement of Relative Financial Position"" ; "" Recommendations "" ; and "" Observations."" There is also a section, -chapter 9, in which is contained a summary of the report. I recommend all honourable members to read the report, and particularly the summary in chapter 9. Some of the main features of the report (i) It adheres in effect to the principles of relative budget position so as to enable claimant States"" to function at a reasonable standard with an effort appropriate to their"" particular situations."" It adds that the adverse effects of federal policy are not, in themthe federal policy may be, a State has no claim for assistance if it is in a good financial position. ( i i) The simple average of Victoria and Queensland is taken as the normal standard upon which to calculate the grants. New South Wales is omitted because it has so many abnormal features in comparison with the other States. Last year New South Wales was included in the calculation of the normal deficit, and some of the other normal standards, excepting principally social services. In the case of South Australia and Western Australia certain deductions are made for past mistakes. The grants are calculated on the basis of State budget results for 1933-34. As honourable members are well aware the Government has been anxious for these special grants to he placed on a more permanent basis, and thus avoid the Increase over necessity for annual revision.
