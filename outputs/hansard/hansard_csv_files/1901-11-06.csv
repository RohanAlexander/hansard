25,Mr R. Edwards,"The Hon. Angusthe suggestion in the motion regarding the excise, us he had held the idea for a long time that if it was possible to encourage the small grower to .produce cane with white labour all that could be done oughfcto be done to bring that end about. Whilei t was pleasing to know that consideration on this head to the extent of 4s. per ton had been decided upon, he held that 6s. should be offered forthwith in order to offer greater inducement to the small men. The most difficult time 'would be in the opening years under the new order, and they should give these men as much as they possibly could to start straight away, to demonstrate whether it was possible to grow cane exclusively by white labour. He had no doubt at all that many men in this district-would Makeup the work and carry it out satisfactorily ; yes, and make money out of it. He thought there was everv possibility of both millers -and.growers in tliis dis"" trict doing very well under the"" conditions pro]wsed, that was, if the Federal Parliament gave then: 6s. per ton, and if they were honest that suggestion ought to go alongside the five years they were asking for as the term to run before recruiting was interfered with. It would be a great ad vantage to have it proved whether the work could be done successfully by white labour, and he bad no doubt the manufacturers would supplement the 6s. .named, by Is. or 2s. more .to encourage the production of sugar by white labour only. No one would be better pleased than he if the point could -be successfully-established, for they would all greatly prefer to see in tlieir midst a.number of white men settled with tlieir families, and enjoying the benefits of a prosperous industry. On the other hand they must not close their eyesfcothe fact that it was possible to legislate to prevent that. He could assure thein that he would to-morrow accept the whole responsibility of getting rid. of his Kanakas if he could be shown where he could get reliable men to take their place. He was quite convinced that if white men would only do it , they Gould do it, and if they offered (is. more -per ton for cane it would, be a .great ; inducement, and would lead to the matter being given a very fair trial, and he hoped the Commonwealth Parliament would approve of the suggestion in the motion. He was sure that every planter in the district -would be delighted to forward any such object-as would enable them to grow cane with white labor, and it was evident the people were prepared to make a sacrifice to achieve this end. He noticed by that day's Courier that Mr than the others. The-third day'finished off the E -B. Forrest, on being interviewed, made a statement that he ( MrG ibson) had said .in Melbourne that if £ 3 protection were given the Queensland planters they would be able to grow cane with white labour. "" He had never made any such statement, but on the contrary when he was in Melbourne he had fought for £5, but he did not say they would then be able to get rid of the Kanaka. As he had said before, white men could do the work all .right if they would only take it Anywhere; but he did not say they should do it , in fact he did not think they should be called upon to do it . 'But he had said iii Melbourne, and still maintained, that white men could do any work if they wore well paid. He hoped good would come of the motion, though he could not see any such promise at the present time. Mr li. Edwards. In my desire to supply honourable members with all possible information on this subject. I have gone to a .good deal of trouble, and amongst other things which I wish to lay before the House is bhe report of an interview with a man who has been accustomed to work on sugar plantations. The article is headed "" A Worker's Opinionthe Hardships of Cane-oufcting,"" and reads as follows :All classes of society have raised their voices against expelling the Kanaka from the sugar plantations of .Queensland. The 'mill-owner and the small farmer are quite agreed on this point, and now we give-the opinion of a working man who has worked in a mill, .and tried his hand in the field at cutting cane-and gave it up in three days. Mr G-. Harmseu was working in the Burnett district on a plantationncar'Bingera/theproperty of Mr Gibson. He was working inside the mill in the sugar and boiling rooms. It is looked on as easy work, and thewages run-from los.fco23s. a week, while men who have had.good experience at it get-up to'Sos. in higher positions. Some of the men desirous of 'making more money, and willing to try if it were possible to do the field work, asked to be put ou to cane-cutting. Thej' were put on to this work, and promised os. 6d. a ton, which is, of course, considerably more than the Kanaka.gets. It would also be impossible for this rate to be regularly paid, as the farmer only gets 10s. or Hs. a ton for his cane, and it is obvious he cannot pay half that away for cutting alone. But this was looked on as atrial, an experiment, and -Bingera -plantation, being a big one, was willing to see>if .a very high rate of wage 'would make the men stick 'to it. On the first day twelve men started. Harmsen cut two tons that day, while a Kanaka next him cut four, tlie average amount. A t the end of that day five men out of the twelve went to the .manager aud asked to be put back in the mill. They had had enough of cane-cutting. During the second day Harmsen cut one and a-half tons. Two .more men gave up that day. The third clay five men put in an appearance, and Harmsen cut one and a-quarter tons. It may be said that all through he cut rather more remaining men, and they all went back to work in the mill again. The heat is described as simply unbearable. The cane rose above their heads, and there was no wind to temper the burning rays of the sun, -which seemed to beat down with almost physical force on the men-working. To add to-this the ground swarmed'with auts and insects of all-descriptions. In spite of stockings and rags bound round the legs to.protect them, these pests climbed up'the men s-legs.aud bit most ; uumercifiiUj'. What with scratches and bites the workers' legs were soon covered with sores and little boils. .For three or -four days afterwards most of them suffered from the effects of the sun, with headaches and sore backs. In the morning a damp mist -would lie all over the ground, which shows the moist unpleasant atmosphero'the men had to work in.",17,Edwards
26,Up Earnestly. ( Mr Fullertoii,"Iu this district ?)The work has no ill-effects at all on the Kanaka. The Kanakas go shouting and laughing to their work in the morning, and in the evening one can hear them singing in their huts, or they go to tlieir church. The white men and the' Kanakas are on the best of terms, as any one mav see who goes into the plantation store and bears them chaffing each other. Up in the sugar district the white man realizes that he cannot possibly do the work of the Kanaka, and if it were-nob for the Kanaka doing it he (the white man) would lose his billet. It is not implied, as was said at the anti-Kanaka meeting tbe other night, that the w h i te man must confess himself the inferior of the Kanaka, because he cannot do the work of the Kanaka, Tbe .white man cannot do the work of a horse, but he does not look on himself as thab noble animal's inferior in consequence. And thab was the end of the experiment on the plantation in question with white men cutting -cane. They were strong, healthy men, eager to do the work if possible, so as to earn higher wages ; but it was n physical impossibility, and they gave it up because they feared serious consequences to their health if they persisted at it. It may be possible for a man who is accustomed to tropical beat to do some cane-cutting in the early morning and late afternoon : but these men are.quite sure that no man could do ib regularly. It would bake aboub 4.0 white men bo do the work of 20 Kanakas .at this rate. And the .main point is the absolute reliabilibv necessary in sugar work. A t a certain time the.gates of tlie mill are shut, aud all the cane must be iu the yard by then. How could bhis be done with white labour-a n uncertain Supply and constant sickness? On this plantation 300 Kanakas are employed during the season, and .150 white men. During the rest of the year no Kanakas are employed, but a good .many of the white-hands are permanent. Mr Harmsen states that all bhese 150 men are quite prepared to -say they could not do a week's work at cane-cutting. Every plantation gives work boa.number of white men,""ploughing, clearing, biu-uiug. &c., but the Kanaka is only used for bhe one purpose. Tliis is bhe ""experience of a man wbo is young and strong and willing to work ab anything he can make the best wages.at. It is his emphatic opinion bhab no white man can possibly do the work, and he for one, would sooner bake 10s. a week as odd man on a farm bhan try to cub cane, even at 5s.fid -a ton. T h a t was the experience of men who have a thorough knowledge of sugar The y -were strong, healthy young men, who were tempted w it h others to t r y what could be done in the way of cut-ting cane. .was an experiment,' b u t although they received nearly double the price which the planter'has any need to pay for Kanakas, the latter in this instance-did about double t h e work performed by the w h i te men, simply because they were acclimatised, and the heat, which was unbearable to the w h i te men, d i d not trouble them i u the least. deal of in for m a t i o n which is a t my disposal, because I realize t h a t honourable members are growing somewhat tired of this unpleasant subject. T h a t f a c t is made manifest by the v e i y f e w 'honourable members upon either side of the House -who have spoken .upon this question. Their silence is, It h in k , an evidence of their good sense, because there are not bwo honourable'members in this Chamber who understand even a l it t l e about Kanaka labour and the sugar in d u s t ry generally. I have here a letter w h i c h is headed"" An o t h e r Plea -for Time,"" and in .this connection I may add t h a t m y desire is to see a committee appointed to inquire in to the conditions surrounding the employmenb of Kanaka labour, and of bropical agriculture generallv. The writerof t h is letter saysSir,-Whil e there may be divided opinions upon the necessity for the employment of Kanakas in tropical Queensland, if bhe coast lands in bhe north are to be profitably worked, bhere can be no doubt iu the mind of any true Queenslander bhat one of our principal industries must not be assailed -without mature deliberation and the fullest inquiry, though the attack upon it be made by united Australia.

The haste . with which the Kanaka Bill has been brought before the Commonwealbh Parliament (nobhing has been done in any way bo deal with-le b alone to deport-the hordes of Chinese and obher aliens in bhe Commonwealbh) can only be interpreted as an attack on Queensland, and unless time is given within which the fullest information can be obtained to justify such legislation, ib is surely bhe duty of Queenslanders to use all constitutional means to oppose such an attack, and to demand justice for Queensland. honourable member suggesb bhat another growing. committee would do 1 MrR . EDWARDS I do nob suggest bhe appoinbment of a commibbee composed It of honourable members of this House. I should oppose any such proposal. Bubd u r in g my election campaign I advocated bhe appoinbmenb of a R o y a l commission, consisting of independenb men to inquire inbo bhe whole question of bhe sugar indusbry.

27,Mr Joseph Cook,"Whab does bhecommittee should be appointed consisting of two Supreme Court Judges, with one practical isugar planter to assist them in their investigations. Erom such a body, I think we should receive the best possible advice as to what course should be pursued in connection with the employment of Kanaka labour generally. able member's intention now 1 move that the B ill be referred to a select committee, with a view to obtaining such complete information as w ill enable honourable members to legislate more intelligently upon tliis matter, and to prevent the destruction of this immense industry, which is second to uo other industry within the Commonwealth. Possibly honourable members are familiar with the names of Young Brothers. I do not know the gentlemen save by repute. Eor a very long period they have resided near Bundaberg. They belong to a very fine class of men, and I should like, therefore, to place before honourable members a letter which was w r it t e n by them to MrP h i l p , the present Premier of Queensland. Bundaberg, 9fch October. cussing your very able protest against tbe proposed legislation of Federal Government, and wired you thanking yon for it . You have, we all felt, stated our case admirably. If the proposals now before Parliament are carried out, sugar-growing in Bundaberg will rapidly cease ; next season we shall not have labour to get in our crops. We unanimously thought more time necessary, and suggested six years' unrestricted recruiting as at present, without any limit as to total number in State, and that after agreements expired in nine years from now no deportation should be insisted on, until at any rate all Chinese, Japanese, Hindoos, & c , were also deported. peculiarly cruel and inhuman proposal, as many islanders who have been here fifteen to twenty years would, if they returned, be slaughtered by their savage friends. The Lochiel, just arrived, has two instances in point. They went as returns, and found that their tribe had been all slain, and, knowing the same fate would await them, recruited again and returned by same vessel ! We have two others married, with four children, the wife New Ireland, husband Solomon. For fifteen years they have been unable to go back, as they are afraid of losing their lives, whichever island they return to. These are only instances, but they show the danger to ' ' boys."" Other aliens in returning to their countries run no such danger, as they are a civilized people. W it h regard to the rebate on excise for cane grown with white labour, surely this is unconstitutional. It is similar to central mill case, which home authorities objected to. But if a rebate is legal, why do they not offer the f u l l rebate of 6s. at once to all those who grow entirely without black labour, instead of 4s. now, and 6s. after five j'ears ? The heaviest cost is incurred now, for fresh buildings, &c. In any case, no planter would willingly forfeit his island labour for 4s. or 6s. a ton cane; but small farmers might try it for 6s. per ton cane. It is a and of the sugar industry misnomer to call it a rebate, as the farmer has not paid the excise; it is really a bonus on cane grown with white labour only. Your presence in Melbourne will be of untold value to Queensland, if you can spare time. .Apologizing for inflicting such a long letter, and again thanking you for your action in favour of industry -Yours very truly, A. H . and E. YOUNG."" In Queensland, these people are well known to have taken a veiy great deal of interest in the welfare of the Kanakas in every sense of the word. They are highly respected. The manufacturers' letter to Mr Philp is as follows : Dear Sir ,-We beg to confirm our telegrams, as per enclosed. The meeting of the Bundaberg sugar manufacturers was most enthusiastic about tlie vigorous manner in which j'ou had protested against the unfair legislation foreshadowed by the Federal Parliament.

Still, with all its defects the Tariff Bill was completely overshadowed as an instrument of destruction by the Kanaka Bill. His firm did a considerable business with the north of Queensland, but since the provisions of the Kanaka Bill had become known amongst the people in tlie northern sugar districts, his representatives had furnished him with information of an exceedingly doleful character. His travellers informed him it was absolutely useless for them to go out amongst the sugar-growers on the northern rivers, because the people there had buttoned up tlieir pockets and declined to enter into transactions other than what were absolutely necessary to keep them going until such time as they knew for certain what was to be the fate of the Kanaka. In view of the increasing volume of business his firm had been working up, he was on the eve of launching out into more extensive operations in the north ; but as a consequence of the information lie had received, he felt compelled to stay his hand. Mr Barton's proposals on the Kanaka question had suddenly brought the north up with a round turn, and already his business in Brisbane was beginning to feel the effect of the depression that bad already set in amongst the people who formed the mainstay of Northern Queensland. He was satisfied from what he had heard from others that his firm was not singular in regard to its experience, but that most of the Brisbane houses were already affected by the rash proposals of the Federal Premier.

I wish to refer .now to another phase 'Of the subject, and it is not a very pleasant one. I shall quote a letter which is headed "" Kanakas and other aliens compared ""Sir,-On e exasperating excuse given by Mr Barton for his now famous Kanaka-Bill was hi s desi re to preserve the purity of the race.

It has been ably pointed out by you more than once how the Kanaka makes work for thousands of whites, and then when he goes home he does not take a cent with him ; all his earnings (and they are considerable) go to the storekeeper or shopman for goods to take home. Here, then, Ave see a limited number of Kanakas kept well in hand making work for thousands, and going a way at the end of theiv term as empty as they come, so far as money is concerned. I should like to ask those who cry about the ""danger to our women,"" &c., & c , if the annals of Kanaka crime can show anything to equal the Gatton tragedy or the atrocities of the Kelly gang, or even the frequent cases that come before our courts, of fathers who are so inhuman as to A'iolate their OAVU children ? There is abundant proof, then, that the morals of a "" Avhite Australia "" can be little harmed from contact with the Kanaka-rathe r the reverse, for the Kanaka as a savage and as a civilized being do not compare favourably--the balance is mostly in favour of the Siwage. But quite apart from the moral aspect comes the oft-repeated and not mi proven statement that the white man cannot do the Kanaka's work ; and failing a proper enquiry, then let Mr Barton have his way by all means. Let the Kanaka go, ruin the northern trade, aud all those-bot h capitalist and labourer-dependan t thereon, and what sliall we see ?

Reason will reign, and labour may chalk up another failure alongside the Co-operative Community fad, or the new Australia bubble, and similar children of ignorance who have only turned on their blind and discontented parents. Abovo all we should not commit ourselves by asking for an extension of time-for then we must admit, when the time expires, that we were wrong-unles s such extension of time be used to prove absolutely that our contention is wrong.

I have never met him, though I heard of him the other day when I was in Adelaide, and I have heard of him in Victoria. The following is a report of a lecture which he delivered at Horsham, Victoria, which appeared in the Age : The Rev. J. Thompson, Avho conducts the Christian mission to the Kanakas in the Isis district of North Queensland, in which State he has worked for the past fifteen years, lectured here last night. He expressed strong opposition to the Pacific Islanders Labour Bill, and said that it would simply mean the ruin of the sugar industry. The white man could not work in the fields, and the continuance of the coloured labour Avas an advantage from the working man's point of view. The Pacific labourers were Avell treated, and the mortality last year, amongst a population of 1,060 Kanakas, was only fourteen. There was not one half-caste Kanaka child in the district, nor had he seen one during his fifteen years' residence amongst them. It was stated d u r in g the debate t h a t the m o r t a l it y amongst Kanakas is something like 40 per 1,000. man says that, in the Isis district, of 1,060 Kanakas only fourteen died.

I should like to refer to what the Attorney-General said when he was on a visit to Queensland some time ago, because the Queensland people maintain that faith has not been kept with that State by more than one of the Federal Ministers. I have here an article headed "" The Interests at Stake,"" which reads as follows :The New Zealand Premier, when approached on bhe subject of federation, is said to have replied"" Do you think it is likely that we will go into federation when you don't know anything about us?"" Mr Seddon was pretty wide awake, but Queensland unfortunately was not, and is sorry for it . The article continuesFor better or for worse Queensland has become a partner in the Commonwealth, and a sharer in its destinies, but there still appears to be good reason for the fear that southern ignorance of the in the industry was about £5,000,000 ; machinery problems of the tropical north has not been dissialone representing a value of £1,000,000. In pated by the fraternal enthusiasm of federation, and may result in disaster to many of the most deserving pioneers, who have done battle with Nature under difficulties unknown to settlers in other parts of Australia. Many of the problems of Queensland are peculiar to the State, and when a newly-formed Federal Government threatens to interfere with the accepted policy of the State Government, which is directly responsible to the people, such interference can only be justified after fullest inquiry, and with the clearest knowvernment, under the Sugar Works Guarantee ledge of all the facts of the case. This sound principle was recognised by the Federal Attorney General (Honourable A. Deakin), who, in an address to the people of Queensland, said"" We must be-one in knowledge-knowledg e of each other. This trite remark impresses itself upon me particularly in regard to Queensland. Your vast territory, probably but imperfectly known to the bulk of your own people, possesses products and problems peculiar to itself, still less mastered by I would point out to your southern neighbours. My ignorance is shared by many others. Our southern conditions, though doubtless in many respects novel to you, are more likely to be comprehended by you than, your situation is to be grasped by us. One of the first tasks of the Commonwealth must be to make us better known to each other, and one of the many duties that still appeal to all. true federalists will be to remove misunderstandings, overcome local prejudices, and listen to the views of those who geographically remote from us have separate interests and aims. We must listen to the men who are carrying on the work, of settlement in the far north and the far west."" This is what the Attorney-General said, and it was this speech and others of a similar nature that induced Queensland to join the Federal Union. I maintain that faith has not been kept with Queensland, because it was promised that no industry would be interfered with until proper inquiries had been made. The article proceedsThe population of Queensland is distributed over such a wide area that, even amongst those who are engaged in different pursuits in the Southern districts and in the interior, there is much ignorance respecting the conditions of the sugar industry, and its relative value as a factor in the prosperity of the State. It is only natural that this ignorance should prevail to a still f reater degree amongst the people of the other tates, who have still vague notions respecting the industry, gained probably from reminiscences of "" Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and stories of American slavery rather than from the reading of plain statements of actual facts. To combat prejudice is a more difficult task than to dispel ignorance, but the endeavour, must now be made to accomplish both, results. It is alike in the interests of Queensland and of all Australia that the serious reflections thrown on those who are responsible for the present conditions of the sugar industry should be removed. Dealing first of all with the value of the industry, it was estimated by the Royal commission of 1889 that there were then 51,815 acres of land under sugar-cane. The capital then invested the year 1900, the area under cultivation had increased to .110,657 acres, distributed over the large coastal districts represented by such towns as Childers, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Bowen, Mackay, Cairns, and Port Douglas. Various estimates as to the amount of capital now invested in the industry have been given. The estimate of Mr Barton is £6,000,000 ; others have given the amount as high as £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. Apart from private capital, the Queensland GoAct, have made advances to twelve sugar-mills to the amount of £497,245 3s. od., and the total indebtedness, including interest up to the end of 1900, amounted to £542,742 4s. 7d.

45,Mr Speaker,,26,Edwards
46,Mr R. Edwards,"I shall confine myidea, however, is given both of the aggregate and relative importance of the industry by the annual amount of sugar produced, and its value. Taking in both coses the figures of the RegistrarGeneral, it appears that the total output for 1898 was 163,734 tons, for 1899 123;289 tons, and for 1900 only 92,554 tons. The prolonged drought is mainly responsible for the decrease of the lost two years. Taking* however, the whole three years, the average annual value of the crop is £1,328,449. As the population of Queensland is only about half-a-million, the average annual value of the sugar, industiy is £2'6s. per head. I want to impress upon honourable members the importance of the sugar in d u s t r y as compared w it h t h a t of other industries. The w r it e r proceedsThe importance of these figures will best be understood by comparing the relative value of the sugar industry to Queensland with the relative value of other great industries to the States in which they are the most essential to the general prosperity. New South Wales is justly proud of her mining industries. Her coal-fields alone give her an immense advantage over the other States. Being in proximity to the sea they have given the greater facilities for the shipping trade, and have given an impetus to manufactures of all kinds. Prosperous towns have sprung np in the neighbourhood of the coal mines, and make other industries possible by the new wealth which has been created and distributed. One can imagine the fiery indignation aroused if it were proposed to make coal mining impossible, and to allow sucb a district as thab of Newcastle to relapse into its primitive wilderness. The indignation would be intensified if it were further proposed to abandon every gold mine throughout the Stabe, or bo impose such restrictions as to render gold mining impossible. Yet the aggregate value of bhe whole of bhe coal industry of New South Wales is less than that of bhe sugar industry of Queensland. For the year 1899 it is estimated by CotjUan at £1,325,799, as against £1,328,449, the average aggregate value of the sugar produced in Queensland during each of the lasb three years, and about £3,000 more bhan the coal industry in New South Wales. But the population of New Soubh Wales is nearly three times as great as that of Queensland, so that, baking again bhe exact figures as given by Coghlan, bhe average value per head of bhe coal indusbry bo New Soubh Wales is only £0 97, as compared wibh bhe average value of £2 6 per head, which represenbs the wealth of the sugar industry distributed in the same way amongsb bhe population of Queensland. In obher words, the value of the sugar industry to Queensland is nearly three times as great as the value of the coal industry to New South Wales. If to the coal industry of bhe labber Sbate we add bhe gold mining, with ibs returns of £1,751,815 for bhe j'ear 1899, bhe equivalent value is still far from being reached, and, roughly speaking, it may be said bhat bo Queensland bhe value of bhe industry which is now threatened is as great as that of the fcoiul mining industry, with the exception of the silver mines in the far West, to New South Wales. The same method of comparison brings out some interesting results in bhe case of the other States. During recent years nothing has done more to enhance blie agricultural prosperity of Victoria than bhe development of. dairy farming, which has thus contributed very largely to the development of all other industries. It is in this way that primary production is more important to national progress than any manufacture which, simply gives added value to a product which has been received from another country. For the j'ear 1899 the total value of milk and its producbs, and of bhe return obtained from swine, tof ether with the total value of dairy produce, in 'ictoria, is. esbimabed by Coghlan at £2,491,000. On a population basis, this gives an average value of £2.14, which is considerably under bhe average value of sugar bo bhe Queensland populabion. If again we bake the total value of the Victorian wheat crop for the j'ear 1899-1900, as given at £2,031,800, we are brought to bhe same result that the loss of wheat-growing would cost less to Vicboria than the loss of the sugar indusbrj' would cosb bo Queensland. In bhe same way bhe comparison when applied to bhe case of South Australia shows that the equivalent loss of wheat growing to that Stabe is only about equal bo whab Queensland will suffer if the sugar industry of Queensland should be ruined by hasbj' legislation. Objection may of course be raised as to details in the application of such comparisons torespective Sbabes; but the general result will in no way be affected, even where further comparison would be still further advantageous bo Queensland. Can ib for a moment be imagined bhat either Mr Barton or bhe people of New South Wales would tolerate legislative interference wibh bhewhole mining indusbry of New Soubh Wales, because a few thousand Kanakas were employed to do a certain class of necessary work under Government regulations which made it impossible either that injury should be done to the Kanakas, or that they should engage in any class of labour acceptable to a white man ? It is necessary to drive bhe question home. Would New South Wales be contenb to lose all her mining industries, with the prospect of ruined towns and thousands of unemployed, merely to vindicate the principle that no black man of any race should be allowed to work under any conditions within bhe boundaries of bhe Commonwealth ? Would Victorian sbabesmen who are now supporting Mr Barton in making Queensland the vicarious sufferer in bhe endeavour to conciliate a small section of their Parliamentary supporters, be willing for the same purpose to make a similar sacrifice of the whole dairying or wheat-growing 'ndustiy of Victoria? It will, of course, be urged that Queensland is not asked bo make any sacrifice ; but on a matter of this kind the unanimous verdict of the sugar growers themselves, and of the responsible State Govermnent, is surely more valuable than that of outside politicians, who know nothing of bhe real condition of the industry. It is surely in ibself an injustice that the sugar-growers should find that whereas their own State Government was practical and conciliabory, that of the Commonwealth has become academic and intolerant. Further endeavour will be made to put the case of Queensland in the clearest possible light. Doubtless honourable members generally have received the same in for m a t i o n bearing upon this question as has been forwarded to me. But , inasmuch as the papers addressed to them have not been made use of, I am in d u t y bound to place the facts which they contain before the House. I should like honourable members to understand w h a t this industry has done for Queensland. M a n y t h r i v in g towns have grown up in northern Queensland which chiefly to the sugar industry. Such towns, for example, as Cliilders, Isis, Bundaberg, Mackay, Geraldton, and others owe t h e i r existence entirely to t h a t industry . If the sugar industry were destroyed those towns would die, and, as a result, a l l the other industries which have been established in them would suffer to such an extent t h a t they would inevitably succumb. The article continuesBefore dealing in detail with the question as to whether Kanaka labour is or is not necessary for the carrying on of the sugar industry, it is important that we should have a clear conception of the value of that industry to Queensland and of all that makes for its stability. Premier has asserted that the employment of Kanaka labour is in itself a wrong, and that in providing for its abolition he is only currying out the declared policy of Queensland for the last twenty years. We shall fully discuss these and similar contentions iu other articles; but even from Mr Barton's own stand-point, itiseasy to show that his present action has been hasty and inconsiderate, and in his determined energy to rectify what he assumes to be a wrong, he is likely to perpetrate another wrong of still greater proportions. that the Federal Government is acting the slightest heed being given to the protests of the Government of Queensland or of the sugar growers themselves, to whom, as Dr. Maxwell says, the questions debated in Parliament are questions of life and death. It is inopportune and impolitic-to grounds-that a great industry at the very time when Queensland is suffering from a series of reverses, which have retarded her progress and diminished her public revenue. The effects of the recent prolonged drought are still strongly felt in many districts. running at a heavy loss. The flocks and herds of the West have been decimated, and in the course of one year there has been a loss of over 5,000,000 sheep and 1,000,000 cattle. the number of sheep in the State has been reduced from 20,289,633 to 10,339,185, and the number of cattle from 6,192,759 to 4,078,191. It is a dangerous policy at any time to tamper with the pioneering industries of a young country, and ""when one great industry is suffering from natural causes, disaster may be the result of hasty interference with the conditions which the prosperity already been shown that the relative value of the sugar industry to Queensland is three times as great as the value of the coal-mining Mr E. Edwards. industiy to New South Wales. That, however, does not state the whole position. The whole industry is attended with conditions peculiar to it self. In the other States, and in Southern Queensland, where mixsd farming is possible, the settler has means of recovery where there is a failure in one crop. He has numerous resources in the disposal of his wool, sheep, cattle, maize, wheat, fruit, or dairy produce. Cane-growing on the other hand, is almost the sole resource of owe their existence 2,610 Queensland settlers, who have 110,637 acres under that crop. The area of the holdings, as well as climatic reasons, make it impossible that at a short notice these settlers should adapt themselves to new conditions or avail themselves of other pursuits. Their success or failure depends on the success or failure of the sugar industry itself. Mr Barton has raised the old suggestion that the extension of smaller areas for sugar cane would lead to greater production, and assist in the eradication of black labour without destroying the industiy. That is quite true, and the reduction of holdings, with a consequent diminution of black labour, are demonstrable facts. The other fact remains, however, that even now, when the area of holdings under the sugar cane crop has been reduced to an average of a little over 42 acres, the cane-growers insist that at present a minimum of Kanaka labour The Federal is still indispensable for the trashing and cutting of the cane. As will be shown, this is not merely the opinion of those who are engaged in the indusbry on a large scale, but of the small settlers whose interest it is bo dispense wibh all hired labour of whatever class. The special commissioner of the Courier, after a prolonged visit to the whole of the sugar districbs of Queensland, gave ib as an irrefubable conclusion that it was the almost unanimous opinion of sugar-growers, both in a large and small way, that to interfere precipitately with the present labour conditions To begin with, it is a self-evident fact would mean the destruction of the sugar indusbry without in bhis Sbabe. In no obher industiy in any part of Australia has the problem of closer settlement been so successfully solved, and solved under the most difficult conditions, as in the case of sugar-growing in Queensland. The men engaged in cane-growing are not the representamake the appeal on the lowest tives of a few large companies gaining wealth a serious blow should be struck at from the soil to be expended elsewhere, bub the sturdiest and most enterprising of small settlers, who have won success from the very teeth of difficulties which would have daunted less resolute men. In the case of the great majority of the 2,610 settlers engaged in cane-growing, it The Government railways have been may be said that their very livelihood, apart from their future success, is involved in the stability of the sugar industry. How readily that stability may be shaken is shown by Dr. In ten years Maxwell in his explanation that sugar-growing is very different to growing potatoes or maize. In the latter case, if labour is short and the farmer cannot produce 2,000 bushels of maize, then he can grow 1,000 bushels and find a market for it . But sugar is a manufactured article, and must be made where the cane is grown. If the mill requires 30,000 tons of cane to make it possible to regulate open up and pay running expenses, and only of other industries. It has 5,000 bons of cane are grown, bhen bhe mill is stopped jusb as effectively as though not one stick of cane is grown. To say that £6,000,000 or £10,000,000 Have been invested in the sugar industiy does not convey tlie full apprehension of would he involved in the ruin of that industry. There are now large and prosperous towns, scattered along the Queensland coast, whose very existence depends on the maintenance of the industry which has reclaimed some of the most fertile lands from the tropical wilderness, and made other industries possible. To give concrete examples. The town of Mackay may be regarded as the centre of the sugar industry, both by reason of its situation and relative importance. Within the municipality there is a population of '1,600 people, that of the district being about 13,200. Government buildings are represented by a post and telegraph office, court-house, Custom-house, two State schools, police barracks, and immigration barracks. There are in addition a railway and tramways. Four Australian banks have established important branches in the town, which has also numerous churches, and eighteen hotels. investment as a result of the belief in the stability of settlement in the district and the determination to make provision for present needs. Consider, therefore, how the ruin o£ the sugar industry would affect Mackay. During the last ten years, the exports from the town amounted in value to the sum of £2,788,231. Of this amount sugar alone represented no less than £2,524,47°, all the other exports put together only being of the value of £263,752, inclusive of £9,196 by products of sugar-molasse s £56, and rum £9,140. Take the sugar industry away from Mackay, and not only will the money invested in cane-growing and sugar-mills be absolutely lost, but all tlie money invested in other industries, and spent in building the town, and providing for its future will be rendered as profitless as if thrown into the sea. There is good reason for the consternation created at Bundaberg by the Kanaka Bill. Here is the ease of another important town which depends almost entirely on the sugar industry. The population of the town and district is about 17,000 whites, and 2,500 blacks. The Millaquin and Fairymeud refineries have been built in the district at considerable expense. A steel bridge across to South Bundaberg was opened last year, and cost £75,000. addition to past improvements, is now spending £100,000 in carrying out a scheme providing for a minimum depth of water in the river from the bar of 12 ft. at low tide, necessitating nearly four a great many w h it e people would have to miles of training walls. The importance of the sugar industry to Bundaberg is illustrated by the fact that in 1898-whic h as will be seen from figures already given, was an exceptionally good year-tli e value of the product shipped from the port wtis no less than £402,394. In addition to this there .was a large quantity of sugar sent away by rail. The only other exports for the same j'ear were gold, valued at £28,563, and tallow, hides, and sheepskins, to the value of £4,349. It should hardly be necessary to repeat the comparison in the case of other towns, such as Cliilders, Maryborough, Ingham, AJT , Geraldton, Cairns, and Port Douglas, all of which are mainly dependent upon the success of the sugar industry. Their aggregate population is 34,153, aud iu addition to them there are smaller centres which would be affected in the same way by * 20 K the loss of the staple trade in which the prosperity of every coastal town in Northern Queensland is involved. Every item of this kind must be taken into consideration when reckoning the cost of legislation which interferes with sugar growing in Queensland. The Government have made advances of over £500,000 to twelve sugar-mills, but they have also expended many millions sterling in improving the various ports along the coast, dredging and deepening the harbors and rivers, constructing breakwaters and railways, building schools, post-offices, and all other public buildings, which were rendered necessary by the expansion which was chiefly due to the development of tropical agriculture. In speaking of the relative value of the sugiir industry of Queensland, we must have regard not only to tbe facts just considered, but also to the loss of trade and the loss of profitable employment throughout the All this represents whole of the State as the result of the loss of the primary industry. It is estimated by Mr Mucnish, who speaks officially for the sugarfuture requirements, as well as for f rowers of the North, that the industry gives irect employment to 22,000 white men, of whom 13,500 are permanently employed, the additional 9,000 being employed during the crushing season. This, however, is far from being the only consideration. Take the case of the shipping trade. There is now a splendid steam-ship service along the coast, which makes possible not only the development of the sugar industry, but of the mining industry, and other industries both along the coast and in the interior, which is tapped at various ports. The A.US.N. Company, Howard Smith Company, the Adelaide Company, and the Collins line are all running steamers between Brisbane and Northern ports. It is safe to say, as Mr John Arthur has said in his address to the Chamber of Commerce, that the very life-blood of the shipping trade of these companies with No r t h ern Queensland is given by the sugar industry. An Honorable MEMBER -Do 9,000"" Kanakas accomplish that 1 MrR . EDWARDS I am not speaking of the Kanakas. I am endeavouring to show honourable members the extent of the The Harbour Board, in sugar industry. The Kanakas help to provide the whit e people w it h employment If a l l the Kanakas were deported to-morrow, leave Queensland because they would be deprived of their means of employment. The article continuesThe communication thus insured gathers tributary streams from other sources, and in turn gives back what has been received. For example, what shipping trade would be possible from the mining industry alone of such a centre as Charters Towers? It is true that the miners need supplies, but the return trade could be put in a steam launch. What again would be the value of the pastoral industry alone to the shipping trade of Northern Queensland ? A few trips each season would meet all requirements, and not even the addition of the meat trade would make a decent shipping trade profitable or possible. The establishment of large industrial centres in the sugar districts has, however, created an important trade which both gives and receives to the advantage of the whole of Queensland. One firm of iron workers at Maryborough, an establishment which now does work for every portion of the State, has during the last five years received work from the sugar industry to the value of £300,000. This foundry gives constant emploj'ment to between 600 and 700 men. The existence of the northern towns has also given markets for the products of Southern Queensland, and here again the shipping trade and the farming interests of the State have derived benefit. Mr Reid (Messrs. Hutton and Co.) has made the statement that the trade in dairy produce alone with the north is worth £300,000 per annum. Sugar thus means to Queensland the prosperity of the shipping trade, markets for farmers, avenues of employment for workers of all kinds, and business of every descripsubordinated his own opinion. I maintain tion. It is not an accretion which may easily be removed, but an essential part of the commercial life of the State. Even if it be only assumed that the industry is in danger, its importance is such as to call for deliberation, and the most honest investigation, before legislation is passed which may cause ruin which can never be undone. I have no doubt honourable members are large majority, accepted the manifesto familiar with the position of affairs in put before the country by the right honorQueensland in 1890. It has been pointed able gentleman. out more than once that in 1885 Sir Samuel Griffith, who was then Premier, passed a Bill through the Queensland Parliament limiting the employment of Kanaka labour then. to five years, and providing that none should be indentured after December, 1890.

The fact that Parliament was specially called at matter has attracted, if I may say so, worldan early period of the year, to legislate with to a view to relieving the sugar industry. with the fact. Queensland Parliament meets in June or July, but in 1892 it met on the 29th March, and Sir Samuel Griffith then placed before the House his manifesto, which was a change from the policy he had introduced a few years before. Sir Samuel Griffith did that in consequence of the necessities of the sugar industry, which had, in fact, almost collapsed. He recognised that something must be done if the industry was to be saved to Queensland, and under the circumstances he that Sir Samuel Griffith has not changed his opinion, but that he is still strongly in favour of a white Australia. He found, however, that the time had not arrived when the Kanakas could be done away with, and the result was that Parliament, without a division, or, at any rate, by a that statement; Sir Samuel Griffith saw he against him to go back on what he had believed in ; but such a step was necessary to Sir Samuel Griffith on that Parliament has been summoned so early intend to refer now especially to the question of introduction of coloured labour, on which manifesto to the people of Queensland.

The honourable gentleman says it is only lately we have found that out. Are there nny of us who can afford to throw stones at one another 1 I certainly do not claim to have been wiser than my generation for the last twenty years. Wc are all of us to blame more or less, and I think it is our business at the present time not to engage in recrimination with one another, but to help one another, and to help the country as best we can out of its difficulties I have pointed out the absolute necessity of looking to the increased productiveness of the land, and getting more people to settle upon it , ns the only certain means we can look to for getting over the S ave we in the colony at the present time ? We have the growing of wheat and mai^e. Maize is certainly not a very profitable crop at present, I understand; but wheat is profitable everywhere, and no doubt the cultivation of it w ill he largely increased in the future. But there are large areas of rich agricultural land in the colony that are not fit for growing wheat, and arc fit for growing sugar. We have had for some years a large sugar industry going on in the colony. A t present it is certainly not increasing ; indeed it is suffering under a very great depression-so great indeed that only three or four months ago it was the avowed intention of the owners of certain mills and land to withdraw from the industry-to save as much out of the wreck as they could, and then withdraw. It is of no use denying that. But if the sugar industry is doomed to disappear, what have we to take its place ? Nothing. Some of usI for one-hav e been struggling for years to induce white people to engage in that industry--takin g the place of the Kanakas whom they desired to displace. I have done my best, and what do we find ? How many amongst the unemployed persons in the community who are clamouring to go upon the land have been found willing to go to work upon the canefields at reasonable wages ? Not one of them. In one instance some men did go ; they wore said to have been sent by the unions. But there is very strong reason to believe that before these men went on to that plantation it was arranged that they should make the experiment a failure. That was the only experiment that was tried. It is a fact that those men who are clamouring for access to the land, and to keep out the Kanaka, have absolutely refused to do his work. Mr I!. Edwards.

Too much attention has been given to the black labour question. In fact, up to the time the honourable member for Mackay spoke, we heard very little more than that from any honourable member. But we must take a wider view of the subject to understand the remarks that have been made, especially those of the honourable member for Enoggera. I have riBen principally on account of the remarks made by that honourable member. I -want to direct attention to the wider'view that I take of the subject Early in the year it was apparent to the Ministry and to the whole colony that we were in a very miserable position. Business was bad; employment could not be got by men ; the smaller financial institntions were snaky; aud there was a want of confidence all round, not only of ourselves among ourselves, but of people at home whose opinions we are bound to value. The Government were not in a nice position, and I know that if we had simply studied our own comfort we should have been very glad to have been out of it. We were bound to recognise the position, and to face the causes of our condition with remedies, and that is what we have",31,Edwards

66,"Mr Speaker,","I think it is due to the honorattempted to do. We saw plainly that there was one very prominent point in whioh we had failed in past legislation, and that we had by our legislation hurt an industry that might have been prosperous now. That was the sugar industry in the north. We saw that plainly. It was plain to any man who went north. He had only to go to the towns to see the effect, not because there were starving blackfellows there, but because he would find starving white men in all the towns, although ho would of the towns having been much larger in past years. That can be seen from Brisbane right up to Cooktown. Then if ho went into the interior a little, and visited the plantations, he would find that what were formerly the scenes of industry now show a decaying industry, and an industry that is bound to go unless some means are adopted to keep it in existence. We had to face that position, and we did face it , and we came to the conclusion that the first thing to be done, the best remedy at tlie present time, was under proper restrictions to give them black labour again. We also faced the question that is Buch a stumbling-block to the honourable member for Enoggera and other honourable members, of "" What will the constituencies say ?"" It would have been an easy matter for a weak Ministry to say that they would throw the responsibility upon the constituencies by going to the country. But I ask honourable members to consider the state of affairs here for the last three months, and say whether we would not have put ourselves down as a lot of cowards if we had dissolved Parliament, and left the responsibility upon the country of finding a remedy for the wretchedness of the colony. We determined' to face the position, and. we are doing that now with the f u l l responsibility that we are quite prepared to go to the country when we see a manifestation that the country desires it. We believe that the country is with us in the policy enunciated by the Chief Secretary. When the Chief Secretary boldly enunciated that policy, the country at once sprang to it . Everyi m . portant centre in the colony rose and said that that was the proper policy to pursue. Take, for instance, the city of Brisbane. A t the last general election, when I took up the position that in order to let political matters go on we must let the black labour question be dead for the time, there were three daily papers in Brisbane, all of them opposed to black labour, whilst a fourth paper, edited by the honourable member for Enoggera himself, was also dead against it . Now, if we take those four papers as exponents of public opinion in the South-and I think wo may safely do that-everyon e of them, and more particularly that formerly edited by the honourable gentleman, is now in favour of black labour. Is not that an indication of tbe change that has taken place in public opinion in the colony ?' What better indication could we have than that ? I will take the honourable member to his own milk-andwater meetings. The honourable member has conscientiously attended to his duties to his constituency-becaus e I will give the honourable member the credit of being one of the most conscientious members in the Souse, sparing no pains io attending to the wants of his constituency, and performing whatever they may legitimately call upon him to do-and they would be a very bad lot to please if they quarrelled with him on account of his not working for their interests. That is why they actually stood him at his meetings at all. If he had been another member they would hr.ve quietly shunted him, and said, "" We have hud quite enough of y o u "" ; but they would not. Tliey want a member like the honourable member, who will perform the duties of a member well and conscientiously, and work hard for them. A t the same time they want a member to be of their see evident vestiges opinion. Tbey did not want to tell the honourable member so in plain words, but they did it in fact; and the honourable member knows as well as I do that he wil l have to change exactly as the Boomerang, the Courier, the Observer, and the Telegraph have changed before he has the slightest chance of getting back for Enoggora again. I have said that the position of a Minister at the present time is not a bed of roses. I admit that what we propose is against the opinion expressed at the last general election ; but having come to the conclusion that public opinion had changed, and knowing that we ourselves had changed, the first thing to do was to let the country know what we proposed to do. The Chief Secretary did that as soon as arrangements could be made, and we then made arrangements for the meeting of Parliament. That was a much bolder course than drivelling on, getting deeper in debt t ill the mouth of June, and then coming helplessly forward and saying, "" Wc did not get you into'this fix. The only thing is to have a dissolution."" We are prepared to fight it out, and do the best for the country, aud that is the whole object of the policy indicated in the speech. The first thing we want to remedy is the depression in the sugar industry. I am not going into the Kanaka question, but I will simply state as a fact that the introduction of Kanaka labour, or the mere promise of it, will give n great impulse to the colony at the present time.. If the honourable member for Enoggera studied public opinion he would see that the labouring classes, who are so much out of employment, are the men who have been converted. I admit that the labour leaders have not been converted. It will take a great deal to convert them, because they are not out of employment If the honourable gentleman takes the most legitimate means to find out what the labouring people think on the question, he will come to the conclusion bo which I have come-namely , that the more black men are employed on the sugar plantations the better it will be for all the industries in the towns, and in the country too. I speak for the towns from my own knowledge ; and with regard to the country, I refer to the meetings held there. Look at Mr Atkinson's speech at Gin Gin. He is one of the most sensible men I know, and his speech was moat eloquent. He said to the farmers, ""Look how well we lived while the sugar plantations were going on ! They were good customers. And look what a lot of poverty-stricken devils we are now!"" That was the gist of his sermon, and its truth is abundantly proved. If the honourable member will ascertain the opinions of such people,.he w ill find a better indication of public opinion than he can get from the Barcoo election. Public opinion must not be gauged by the Barcoo election on a question of this sort; and if he thinks we were deceived by the Barcoo election he is quite wrong. I had openly expressed my opinion that the Barcoo election would be lost, simply because the workers bad complete' control of the rolls. The policy they advocated was to insist on a continual rise in wages without the slightest consideration as to the ability of the employers to pay higher wages ; and we can scarcely fancy any candidate opposed to that policy, so successful for the time, inquiry we might be able to save the sugar being returned at present. A remedy will come in time, however; and the remedy will come, not by employers bringing down wages, but by employees being glad to be employed at wages which the employer can afford to pay. Until then it is likoly that the Barcoo will return memrecognise that the Government are utterly bers pledged entirely to the doctrines supported by Mr Ryan, whom I am glad to welcome here to-night. There is a good deal more here, hut I will not trespass any further on the time of the House. I only wish honourable members had read all the papers which have come to them regularly from Queensland, and to which I am inclined to think, they have not given much attention. I regret that the Prime Minister is not present, as I had intended to make an appeal to him to reconsider the request for a committee to inquire into the Kanaka question. I think tlie right honourable gentleman can afford to be generous. just. I think that the present action of the Commonwealth Government is unjust, uot only to the planters but to Queensland as a whole. I am not here to advocate the interests of any special class-no t even of the planters or of the working man -bu t I am speaking in the interest of the community as a whole. I have had many friends among the working classes for many years, and there are none of whom I think more than some working men with whom I am even now on the most friendly terms. I would appeal to the labour members from Queensland and the other States to look with some consideration upon the sugar industry. They can afford to be generous. They are an influential party in this House, and they have it within their power to force the Government to do anything they like. I should like them to make use of that great power to influence the Prime Minister to postpone this Bill until next session. No harm could be done, but I believe it would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. for the planter. a cruel thing for the planter. The Bill callous way in which some men make statewould be delayed for only a few months, ments that are entirely false. A great deal and no evil consequences need be feared. I have explained the position of the Kanaka in Queensland, and have pointed out that there is no moral danger connected w i th him, but by delay for the purposes of industry, and allow it to continue and prosper as it has done in the past. I appeal to the labour members to be generous, and to moke use of their greatpower, because I unable to take any other course than that they now propose-except with the consent of the labour party. Personally, I have nothing to say against that party, because during the time. I have been in the HouseI have received the utmost courtesy, consideration and assistance from them. I now ask them to think seriously before they allow this Bill to pass in its present form. A committee of enquiry ought to be appointed, and if the Government have a good cause they have nothing to fear from delay. I strongly urge the House to consent to the appointment of a select committee. I move That the Pacific Island Labourers Bill be referred to a select committee. ib is fitting that a Queensland representative should reply to the remarks mode by bhe honourable member for Oxley. This question of the retention of Kanakas on the Queensland plantations has killed many public men, and, from present appearances, I thing ib is likely to prove disastrous to many more. Ab bhe outset, I desire to say that I think it is due to the late MrW . H . Groom to characterize the abatement that he, in his later years, was in favour of Kanaka labour on the Queensland plantations, as an unmitigated'falsehood. not been stated here. journals that consider themselves reputable, and statements of this kind which have been made by those who are leading the movement in favour of retaining the Kanaka are dastardly and most detestable.' ment has not been made in this House.

Perhaps, however, it would be unwise to do that. I shall take the liberty of replying to the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley with regard to those who violated the pledges they made to the people in 1888. Sir Samuel Griffith and Sir Thomas Mcllwraith coalesced, and behind the backs of the people and without their authority, and against petitions and the resolutions of public meetings, demoralized the Queensland Parliament, and passed a law abolishing what had previously been done according to the express wishes of the electors. How did this coalition take place 1 Sir Thomas Mcllwraith said, in the statement just now read, that he was never in favour of doing away with the Kanakas, and he was too strong and bold a man to surrender his principles. In 1888, however, the year of the general election, in Queensland, he found the position so strong against him, and the electors so determined that there should be no further recruiting of Kanaka labour, that he was compelled to issue a manifesto in which he said that although he could not abandon his principles, he would promise that countenance the introduction of any further Kanaka labour. What happened ? He returned to power under this sacred pledge; he quarrelled with his colleagues, and coalesced with Sir Samuel Griffith, who had also pledged himself to the electors to oppose the introduction of coloured labour. I had the pleasure of hearing Sir Samuel Griffith in 1888 deliver a speech to tlie electors of Queensland, and I well remember that, when speaking on the black labour question, he warned the electors of Queensland that the question was not settled. He stated that the matter was not at an end, notwithstanding that he was then in favour of putting it aside, and of not introducing any more Kanaka labour. He knew what the position was, and he told the people so ; but in later years, after again becoming Premier in coalition with. Sir Thomas stances over which he hardly had control, he was almost compelled to repeal the Act lie had passed in 18S5. What can be said of a Government that acted contrary to its pledges to the people, and reversed the distinct verdict of the electors ? What would tlie people of Australia say if this Government did anything of the kind, and what would they be entitled to say of honourable members who took action that was capable of that construction ? They would regard them with scorn. We labour members asked the Government of Queensland to conduct themselves as honourable men, and to go to theelectors upon the question, but they did not do so. I would ask honourable members who have read the history of this movement, what were the causes of that great depression that has been so much spoken of? What were the causes of the small financial institutions being in trouble at that time % Many of the larger financial institutions were also in trouble, but the labour party could not be blamed for that. Is there an honourable member who would argue that, because the financial institutions were in difficulties-as they were throughout Australia, as in other parts of the world, we should submit to having undesirable labour thrust upon us in opposition to the verdict of the electors. That was the position when the coalition Government in 1892 reversed the policy of Queensland. It was during that session of that Parliament, which was the last he would not to be elected for a term of five years, that the Queensland Government reversed everything that had been done, presumably from a democratic point of view. They passed an electoral law which destroyed a third of the working men's votes. A t the general elections in 1S93, the electors of Queensland returned fifteen brand-new labour members to the Queensland Parliament, although one-third of the working men's votes had been destroyed in order to secure the return of a Conservative majority. Speaking from memory, the votes that were cast for the labour party numbered 27,000, as against 29,000 cast for the whole of the Ministerialists. In spite of the fact that we as a party polled nearly as large a number' of votes as all the Ministerialists put together, some people told us that the electors of Queensland had been converted; but the electors had never been converted Mcllwraith, through circuminto believing in black labour of any kind.. Nor do a majority of the electors of Queensland believe in the employment of Kanaka labour. Without dwelling too long upon this point, I should like to say that if the agitation which has been raised against the proposals of the Commonwealth ment is a popular one, the electors have an easy way of showing it. But what is the use of a society with 100 sub-societies tacked on to it, and governed practically by it, drafting a code of resolutions and Saying that they must all be passed uniformly ? Does that declare the public opinion of a Statet Yet that is what has has been done in this case. How many public meetings have been held at which resolutions have been passed against the policy of the Barton Government 1 In the Port an interesting report of a meeting which was held recently at Bowen. of that town called the meeting openly and read the telegram which he had received from the managers of the meeting which had previously been held in Brisbane. to say, it was proposed that the identical resolution submitted in Brisbane should be -Submitted to the meeting in Bowen. result would then be wired down as evidence of how uniformity the people were opposed to the policy of tbe Barton Government. Fortunately the mayor of Bowen was more open than were some others who had presided over similar gatherings. people the authority upon which he had called the meeting, and read out the resolution which was to be submitted. The result was that an amendment was moved iu favour of the policy, of the Barton Government. This was carried by such an overwhelming majority that the original question was never put. At Gympie a public meeting was held at which a resolution in support of the policy of the Federal Government was -unanimously carried. The same thing oc-curred at Maryborough. has been held at Bundaberg, which is the centre of the sugar industry, and a division -of the Wide Bay electorate, which I represent. This is one of the towns which, it is urged, will be destroyed if Kanaka labour be abolished. It is a very important town. I may here remind honourable members of the support which I received in Bundaberg when contesting the recent election against Mr Annear, who was entirely in favour of the appointment of a Royal commission to inquire into this matter, for the purpose of delaying its settlement. The polling in this town resulted in Mr Annear obtaining 387 votes, as against 768 which were Mr Fisher. cast in my favour. Why has not a public meeting been held in Bundaberg if the Governpolicy of the present Government is calculated to ruin it ? After Mr Philp, the 1 Premier of Queensland, had forwarded to the Prime Minister his remonstrating letter, which breathed out threats of a certain kind, and alleged that the electors of Queensland were up in arms against the Government proposcils, the following challenge appeared in the Brisbane Gou/rier. It is dated 21st October lastSir,-Will you kindly grant space in the columns of your journal for the insertion of the following :-In case there should be one person who Denison Times is to be found would be likely to be influenced by the statements in your journal, ""that the people of this State are The nmyor entirely with the Premier in his able protests to Mr Barton against the passage of the Kanaka Bill,"" and also to refute the statement that the people of Bnndaberg are anxious that Dr. Maxwell should be sent to Melbourne at this juncture, Strange we, the undersigned citizens of this important centre, strong in our faith that Bundaberg stands firmer than ever on the Kanaka question, her people having already, on two separate occasions during The the present year-namely , in March and Julygiven their emphatic and unmistakable verdict for a ""White Australia,"" and following the line of the leader of the Opposition-w e hereby invite and challenge Mv.

A t the same time it will be a bad day for Queensland, and indeed for any State in the Commonwealth, So far no meeting when it is governed entirely by the resolutions which may be passed by pettifogging public bodies. That, however, is by-the way. But, as against the resolutions which have been transmitted in opposition to the Bil l under discussion, I have received numerous resolutions from other public bodies and associations, which are entirely in favour of the Government policy. I have already told honourable members that in 1893 a majority of the votes polled in Queensland were recorded in favour of the abolition of Kanaka labour. The same thing occurred in 1896, although the election at that time was complicated with many issues, and for the first time in the",34,Edwards

The vote given upon that occasion . was one of which any party might reasonably be proud. Although great attempts have been made to show that the "" constitutional '' party-as some choose to call it-secure d a majority of the votes cast, any fair analysis of the figures will show that the verdict registered upon tbatoccasion,asat previous election, wasagainstthe employment of Kanaka labour. A similar verdict was recorded at the election held in 1899, although that election was complicated with other issues.

Our reply is that we have the worse and most iniquitous electoral laws prevailing throughout the Commonwealth. and a special polling booth is opened for him so that he may record them. 07 votes, but he can have 61. I have iu my hand a document relating to Queensland, called the "" Preliminary Statement of Census for the year 1901."" This census was taken on March 31st last, and was laid before both Houses of the Queensland Parliament. In this document the RegistrarGeneral, of that State says :Table No. 0 shows the total population in each district in a condensed form, and also the coloured population, similarly divided into minors and adults of each sex. The number of adult males in Queensland, exclusive of those on board vessels, was 158,972, and the number stated by the principal electoral registrar to be on the electoral rolls of this State at the same date was 09,082, which would indicate that 50,990 adult males were not registered on the rolls as being entitled to vote. This number would be still further increased by deducting from the 99,982 the number of persons whose names appear on more than one electoral roll, but to what extent it would be thus affected I am unable to learn. A large number of these adult males, beiug aliens or aborigines, would not be entitled to vote, except under a property qualification. Some of those included amongst the coloured population are on the roll, as Chinese, for instance, but the number is uncertain. As there are thus two factors of uncertain quantities, exact results are impossible ; but ib will be seen thab bhe total number of adult males who are aliens, aborigines, lunatics, prisoners, &o., was 24,075, to whioh may lie added about 1,000 for police magistrates, clerks of petty sessions, and members of the police force, or a total of 25,075, which would leave the number of other adult whibe males in bhis SbabeI am merely indicating not on the electoral rolls at approximately 32,000 persons. If there are 99,982 names on the plural voting roll, it is absolutely certain that there are 32,000 male persons who cannot get their names upon the roll. How is it possible to ascertain the verdict of the people of Queensland under such circumstances 1 What sort of a Government is it which retains an electoral law of this character ? Yet, when the representatives of Queensland come down here amongst people who enjoy a proper system of parliamentary representation, they are met with the statement that the Queensland Government is disappointed at the representation of that State. I am quite sure that when we came to Melbourne as labour members a very large number of the representatives of other States thought we were wild and incompetent, and totally unfit to be the representatives of the great State of Queensland. not think that the Federal Parliament was worse than it is 1 entered the State Parliament in 1893 I found that it was a great deal worse than I had anticipated it would be. Generally speaking, I have found that all Parliaments are a little worse than they might be. But the question which we are now discussing is one of national importance, and it is of little moment in my opinion-althoug h I come from the State of Queensland and love it quite as much as does any man-whethe r the non-settlement of this matter is injurious to the interests of that State or not, if it is injurious to the whole of Australia ? For that reason it has a national aspect, and it is from that stand-point that I propose to deal with it.

The challenge was not left a day unanswered. diate and everlasting reply of the labour party to questions of that kind has been, and, I hope, always will be, that so far as we are concerned we do not think Kanakas are profitable in Queensland or necessary for any industry, were necessary, there are evils inseparable from their being recruited and tlieir remaining in the countiy, which more than counterbalance any benefit gained from their presence. For that reason the labour party are entirely against tlie traffic ; and we take up the position at our own risk. We are told that two-thirds of the electors are against us. If that be so, what a stupid lot of politicians we must have been when, seeking our own aggrandizement, have been told by the press, we asked the electors to give us power to exclude Kanakas whenever we thought fit as members of the Federal Parliament. labour candidate, either for the House of Representatives asked for any terms at all. I always said that generous and liberal, and we have been generous and liberal. vengeful or bad we felt any feelings of resentment against those who fought us so hardly, we should have agreed to the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta for the immediate abolition of the traffic; but we did not do so. We intimated that we did not wish to deal with this question in any other but a fair way. I will say for the Government that, taking this Bill in conjunction with their fiscal proposals, they have dealt with tlie question in a statesmanlike way. One of the points winch was made during the elections by the distinguished and enlightened press we have heard so much about, was put forward in graphic language by a defeated the Senate, namely, Mr Fisher. Thynne, a very able man. That gentleman, after the labour candidates for the Senate had been announced, said that when he saw the character of the men who were being uomiuated to represent Queensland, he thought it his bounden duty to come forward and give the electors an opportunity of sending a fit man to the Federal Parliament. The defeat of that gentleman has not to me so much significance as his words. They are a proof of what I have seen indicated in Queensland for a long time. There is growing up in The immethat State, as in every State and country where servile labour is employed, a feeling that the well-to-do and the professional people are a superior class removed from every-day workers who make a country worth living in. If that feeling continues aud that, even if they to grow together with the interests -which control Kanaka or semi-civilized labour, sooner or later one part of this continent will be the scene of racial strife, which will be dangerous to the welfare of the Commonwealth. What happened when this great man, Mr Thynne, made the announcement to which I have referred % According to the other side, men like Mr Thynne were plunging in to save the reputation of the State; but Mr Thynne was handsomely as we defeated. Is that not a warning that the hearts and minds of the people of Queensland are in the right direction ? The report of no Royal commission can be equal to the Not a verdict just recently given by the people, when there was simply the one question to or for tlie Senate, be decided. The fiscal issue, in my opinion, did not turn twenty votes i u Queensland. we were prepared to be There was not one word of the fiscal issue, except, perhaps in the district represented Had we been reby the honourable member for Capricornia, where they have no Kanakas, and where the people are strongly free-trade. MrA . PATERSON -And where there is a strong labour party. which, I am sure, the honourable member would have found it difficult to succeed had he been in favour of Kanaka labour. This is not a matter for amusement. If the electors, who know the condition of affairs, are dead against the traffic, surely that is a good reason for its abolition. There are times, I admit, when a whole electorate, or a whole State, may go mad on a particular candidate for question ; but when we find that for twenty the Hon. A -J. years the liberals and radicals of Queensland have been fighting with tlie one object of",37,Edwards
84,Mr Fisher,"That is a district i nridding that State of coloured races, and especially with the object of stopping the traffic in Kanakas, we must admit that it was not a spasmodic effort to be moral when they sent a number of representatives to this House and to the Senate, pledged against the further recruiting of Kanaka labour. I have said that this Kanaka question has ruined the reputations of many public men. Immediately a public man, however eminent, has felt himself compelled to interfere with this question, or to depart in any way from the straight path, he has lost his position, and all this was an indication of what was coming to pass. I care nothing for the past history -of the traffic as a convincing factor in a debate like this. I should like here to quote from the Queensland Hwnsaird, and in every instance, or nearly so, the quotation shall be from the speeches of my opponents. On 17th July, MrA . Gibson, speaking in the Legislative Council of Queensland, saidOn a former occasion iu this CouncilI pointed out what I believed would be the advantages of federation, not only to this State, but to the whole of Australia. I do not know whether I have changed my mind much since I made those statements. I know that the sugar industry of Queensland commands a considerable amount of sympathy from people outside, as well as inside, Queensland. I know also that a good deal has been unnecessarily said concerning the position we occupy. I am also aware that the Prime Minister of the federated States of Australia made a very unfortunate statement when he declared that one of the planks of his policy would be the removal of the Kanaka at a very early date. AVhether he meant that or not I am sure I cannot say, but it is certain bhat he has taken some time to consider the determination that he expressed when making bis firsb declaration, t have still a very strong opinion that both he and the House of Representatives, and the Senate, will make hasbe slowly in doing anything likely bo injure such an important industry as bhe sugar industry is to Queensland and to Australia generally.

104,Mr Fisher,"I was going to quotelie something radically wrong for that condition of affairs to exist. We know that in every community there will be individuals who are impoverished by their own acts, but that is not the case here. Those people soy that they have been all over the country-to Maryborough, Bundaberg, and elsewhere-and they cannot get work ; they are starving. They are sleeping out these cold nights, with very little to eata lamentable state effect"" Our cup of joy is full, owing to the of affairs which should be thoroughly inquired into. Instead of appointing Royal commissions to inquire into this, that, and the other thing, it he will get shot, our cup will flow over."" is time we had a Royal commission to inquire into the causes which induce this condition of poverty. It appears from that statement that, although Queensland has had all the assistance it could have from Kanaka labour, and is being now governed and guided by a Ministiy which denounces the Federal Prime Minister, men travel from Bundaberg, Maryborough, and other places to Brisbane looking for work. Surely if the policy of employing Kanakas is a good one, this state of things would not exist 1 The facts are, however, that the men canuot get work because the Kanakas are employed in their place. One of our greatest difficulties in dealing with this question is to deal with it in a rational way, because of the taunts and jeers we have to submit to. In Queensland the white man is never free from the taunt, "" Why don't you compete with the Kanaka ? You say you don't believe in him."" The whip of the Philp Ministry made a challenge to any white man to go to a Northern Queensland plantation and compete there with a Kanaka picked out by the manager. up the money when the time came. am not concerned about it just now. I ask honourable members if the fact that a white person is physically incapable of greater effort than a coloured person is a proof of his inferiority. We have advanced a stage since it was believed that ability to club one's neighbour was a sign of superiority. Imagine the excruciating pain that a sensitive, delicate white man must feel when he is told that he is not to be compared with the Kanaka. The challenge I speak of was delivered in a speech made on the 30th July, and appears on page 203 of the Queensland .Hansard report. To show to what lengths people will go in denouncing those who take the side of the white labourer, I should like ton's addressThe other day we saw in a southern newspaper I think the Heralda letter written by Major Reay, in which he said he had been to the north, and was perfectly satisfied white men could do the work. Major Reay's experience was to go in the dead of winter for about an hour in a canefield. But I recollect hearing something about Mr Reay from a Melbourne man who was here the other day. This gentleman and some others sent a wire to Lord Kitchener to the following manner in which our colonists have distinguished themselves. If you will only put Reajwhere That is the utterance of a distinguished gentleman, who received his information from a Melbourne man. Is there any honourable member in this House who believes that there is another man in Melbourne who would make any such statement ? These are the kind of men we have to meet as opponents ""on this Kanaka question; and is it to be supposed that they will scruple to tell little stories to their own advantage? These are not matters of ancient history, but they are the utterances of our opponents, who are in the Queensland Parliament. vernment ""whip"" in Queensland. We hear a great deal about the distressing character of the work that has to be performed in the cane-fields, and we are told that white men cannot do this or that, or the other kind of work. It has been long contended that white men cannot work in the cane-fields ; but it is now being argued that white men cannot work in the mills. . If the political pressure were not so great they would not be able to work at any occupation in any part of Queensland. Here is a rather lengthy question and answer, which will show that we are not safe against the introduction of coloured labour into the millsMr Givens (Cairns) asked the Secretary of Agriculture1. Is it true that at the present time a gang of coloured labourers is being employed in the Mulgrave Central Sugar Mills, tending the cane carrier ? 2. Is not the employment of coloured labourers in Central Mills contrary to the spirit and intention of the Sugar Works Guarantee Acts? 3. Will he make representations to the directors of the Mulgrave Central Mill Company, to try aud induce them to discontinue the employment of coloured labourers in their mills ? The Secretary for Agriculture, Hon. D. H. Dalrymple (Mackay), replied1. No; but a gang of Hindoos, presumably from New South Wales, is emploj'ed in delivering cane to the carrier.

109,"Mr Fisher,","Mr J. Hamilton, the Gowhite labour was unobtainable, threw up his contract after nine days. The work was then carried on for a further period of nine days with Japanese and Hindoos, when a contract was arranged with Italians. This contract had to be cancelled after five days, as the Italians were unfor us to touch this question as lightly able to perform the work. The company then advertised in the Southern States for Europeans, and in the meantime are carrying on work with Hindoos. Although only 95 Europeans are required in the mill, the books show that during the past five weeks 194 Europeans have been employed. The rate of wages paid is 25s. per week, with board and lodgings. 2. I am advised by the Crown Solicitor, that the spirit and intention of the Act, as disclosed by its provisions, is simply one to give authority to the honourable the Treasurer, to advance money to owners of freehold in the State, for the establishment of sugar works, and to secure the repayment of such advances and interest thereon. 3. I have already recommended the directors of the Mulgrave Central Mill Company to employ white labour only in connection with their mill, and so far as the Government ore concerned, I am advised by the Crown Solicitor "" that the Treasurer is only mortgagee, and until default is made in paymemt of instalments due, he cannot legally interfere with the directors in the manageof that State in this Parliament. We do not ment of the business, or tbe employment of coloured labour under any of the provisions of the Act referred to."" I cite this case to show how far it is possible to depart from the spirit and intention of Parliament. Parliament in 1893, when the Sugar Works Guarantee Bill was introduced. an ambiguous clause in that Bill, and as we had found from previous experience that we must use exact language in dealing with those who were desirous of coloured labour, we introduced an amendment to exclude all coloured people from the mills that were being erected with State money. We"" stone-walled "" all night, with the result that early en the morning of the following day Sir Thomas Mcllwraith stated that whilst he was not prepared to make a special exception of mills erected with State money, he was entirely against the employment of coloured labour in these mills, and that if he found later on that coloured labour was employed in mills he would pass a measure dealing with the question and putting all mills on the same footing. such measure has, however, been passed, and coloured labour is creeping into the mills. I have a communication from my electorate, stating that one mill is now using coloured labour, and that as a consequence other mills are being unfairly competed with. Surely this is a question that is worthy of being mentioned, although it is not one of the matters that the Federal Mr Fisher. have touched. I entirely agree with the proposals of the Federal Government that the laws shall be administered by the States as far as possible. It is best as we can to say what shall be done, and allow the State authorities to carry out the law in the light of their own experience. They are mostly sympathetic with the planters, and will no doubt render them every possible help under the circumstances. We all of us desire to assist the planters, but we cannot depart from our principles. If we were to try and help everybody by giving up our principles, we should land ourselves in a state of chaos, and destroy all industry. The Kanaka is not essential to the success of the sugar industry, and I contend that he should be displaced by white labour at the earliest possible moment. I take exception to the statement made by the Premier of Queensland regarding the position of the representatives need that gentleman's help, and we know that we should not get his vote or any other vote that he could control. The labour members in this House were returned by I was in the Queensland very substantial majorities, and that fact in itself affords a sufficient answer to the stateThere was ments made by the Premier of Queensland. Regarding my own position, which was challenged by the honourable and learned member for Brisbane, I should like to tell employing him that neither Brisbane nor Oxley is the most important electorate in Queensland, because I have a larger number of electors in my own district. The number of votes polled in the Wide Bay electorate will speak for themselves. The details were given by the returning officer in a statement published in the Maryborough Chronicle of 10th April. The number of votes polled were as follow:-A t Bundaberg-Annear, 387 ; Fisher, 768. Burnett -Annear, 465 ; Fisher, 584. BurrumAnnear, 442; Fisher, 532. GympieAnnear, 1,009; Fisher, 1,246. Maryborough No Mr Annear's own district-Annear; 804 ; Fisher, 967. Musgrave-Annear, 370; Fisher, 282. Wide Bay-Annear, 390; Fisher, 460. In six of the seven electorates which comprise that federal division I had substantial majorities, and in one district only did my opponent secure a majority. Yet the honourable and learned member for Government Brisbane had the temerity to say that I represented only the diggers. election was a straight-out test, and at foundrya magnificent foundry, one of the best in Australia-wa s situated, I had a substantial majority. I also headed the poll at .Bundaberg, at Gympie, and at Burrum. These figures are only an indication of what occurred in other districts, but in order to have the whole of the details placed on record, I shall give the figures, which showed how the votes recorded for labour candidates compared with those polled in favour of all other candidates. votes recorded for labour numbered 2,201 ; aud those against labour, 4,003. Capricornia, the labour votes numbered 3,523, against 3,650. In Herbert, the labour votes were 3,350, against 3,133. Kennedy, the labour candidate polled 3,936 votes, against 2,325. In Maranoa, the labour votes numbered 2,926, against 2,609. I am quoting in each case the labour votes as against the votes recorded for all other candidates. I am putting matters in this way so that there can be no doubt as to the position of the labour candidates. In the Moreton district, 3,892 labour votes were polled, as against 2,682; in Oxley, 3,299 labour votes were polled, against 3,753; and in Wide Bay, 4,844 labour votes, -against 3,955. These figures give a total labour vote of 27,971, as against 26,110 anti-labour votes. I have left Darling Downs out of consideration, because no labour candidate stood for thatelectorate. A t the same time, we can claim that the late honoured representative of that electorate was against Kanaka labour; and if we add the senatorial proportion of votes given to Senator Higgs in that district, it will be found that the labour candidates polled 31,215 votes, whilst anti-labour candidates polled 28,834 ; or a majority in favour of labour of 2,381. majority against all the other candidates. But we also have here the honourable member for Capricornia, who is entirely in favour of the position which we take up. The return to this Parliament of such a large number of labour members from Queensland is a proof of the position which we hold in the esteem of the electors of that State. I come now to the larger question, with which I shall deal very briefly. As I have already pointed out, there is in Queensland a class of people which is in touch with a band of speculators resident outside of Australia. The For years past these people have been contending that the white race should not atMaryborough, where Walker's tempt to cultivate the soil of, or, indeed, to live in, a large part of Australia except as governors, and directors of semi-servile races. That aspect of the question has been forcibly put in London again and again. In Queensland the leading newspaper openly urges the same point. But whilst? this journal is pleading for delay by advocating the appointment of a Royal commission to inquire into the sugar industry, it has maintained that it will never be possible for the In Brisbane, the white race to develop the tropical portion of Australia. When a newspaper of such In standing adopts an attitude of that kind with the object of leading the average elector to suppose that it is opposed to the employIn ment of^ Kanaka labour, we should be treading on very dangerous ground if we listened to it . We are not afraid of the facts. A t the same time, I fear the result of delay in the settlement of this question. The speculators of whom I have spoken are a sleepless body, who are gaining wealth by the employment of this class of labour. Many of them are living comfortably in other countries. I ventured the prediction a short time ago that if the industry and the interests involved were three times as large as they are, civil war would result. A prominent politician in the northern State, in reply, said"" If the interests were three times as large as they are, you would not be able to deal with the industry."" Yet we are asked in circumstances of this sort to delay action. This question admits of no delay. It can be best dealt with now. We have told the world, by means of the Immigration Restriction Bill, that we do not desire the presence of coloured aliens here. I hope that we shall tell the world just as emphatically, by means of this Bill, not only that do we not need coloured labour That was the to develop our States, but that we deem it inadvisable to have it in our midst. I desire that we shall be able to proclaim to tlie world that the whole of Australia, and not a part of it, has been reserved for the use of the white man. If the northern tropical lands are not developed so speedily by the white race as they would be by Asiatics-and I admit that they will not be-w e shall at least have as a set-off against that disadvantage one race and one people who "" are equal in voting power, and who are ready and able in time of emergency to defend our shores. I do not admire those advocates of coloured labour who urge that Australians are equal to any men in the world when they go forth to fight tlie battles of the Empire, but who, when they are sent to earn a pittance of 4s. or 5s. a day in Queensland, say lhat they are inferior. Brisbane Gou/rier reports contains an insult to the white man. It is urged that he will work for two or three days and then get drunk ; that he cannot be relied upon. In my early days it was said that the white man could not be relied upon because a goldfield might break out, and he would leave his employment to tempt fortune upon the diggings. The truth is that the white man can never be relied upon if he is to receive only poor habitation conditions and 25s. a week. How can we expect men to"" forsake all the attractions of a city life for a wage of 25s. a week 1 12s. 6d. a week in Bundaberg at one time. question which has to be faced. I am of opinion that the proposals of the Government will be better for the whole of the planters than if no proposals had been made at all. Is there an honourable member in this House who would give protection to the sugar industry if it had to be carried on by coloured labour ? I do not believe that any Government -would be strong enough to force a protective Tariff through Parliament, if the employment of Kanakas in the sugar industry were to be continued. The policy of the Government is in the interests of the planters themselves. The other day sugar was £ 1 10s. a ton in London. Surely, if we are to go to the outside world for the cheapest labour, we cannot logically object to competing with every kind of labour. The taunt is sometimes used that so far it has not been proved that white labour can be successfully employed in the trashing of cane. My reply is that nearly 20 per cent, of the sugar growers grow their cane solely by white labour. The Kanaka labourer, our opponents declare, can do more work in the cane field than can the white man, and for less than half the wages. I have the greatest admiration for the man who will compete against the Kanaka. A t the earliest opportunity we should pass this j measure into law, so that the white workers ' who are prepared to cultivate cane by meaus I of white labour will be entitled to the rebate provided in the fiscal proposals of the Government. If I am taking a wrong step upon this question, I am taking it cheerfully. I have received no indication from my constituency, which practically produces half the sugar of Queensland, that Every other page of the this measure is an unpopular one, or will be injurious to that particular district. I have in my mind quotations which would be a complete set-off to those submitted by the honourable member for Oxley, but I shall not detain the House at this juncture by usingthem. Immediately the Tariff proposals were submitted, Mr Harrington, of Maryborough, an astute business man, stated that if they*were carried every portion of the land in the ""Wide Bay district which is capable of growing cane should be put under cultivation immediately. Surely that will be a benefit to that district. I ask honourable members where we shall find an inferior class of labour upon inferior land 1 I have never read or heard of it . It is upon the best lands of Queensland that we find the Kanaka, as it is on the best lands in other countries that we find servile labour. Such a class of labour cannot exist anywhere else. After the first fertility of the soil has departed, and the land has become impoverished, the white man has to go in and till it. Whetheri t be at Bundaberg, Mackay, Cairns, or further north, the same rule prevails. Only on the most fertile spots do we find the Kanakas employed, and is it the aim of the Government that the best lands shall be utilized by inferior labour ? I think that the action of the Government will be beneficial to Queensland. It will certainly be beneficial to Australia, and I am proud to have the honor of assisting in the passing of this measure. If the electors of Wide Bay think that I have made a mistake they will have an opportunity of saying so when the next election comes round. I am sure that if this Parliament discovers that an injustice has been done it will take steps to remedy it . I feel strongly that no interference on the part of Great Britain will be tolerated on this great question. I am ashamed of those in the State of Queensland who talk about appealing to the Colonialoffice. If they are going to appeal to the Colonial-office to frustrate the wish of this Parliament I shall oppose them very strongly. If there is to be an attempt to work up an agitation to show that Australians are an inferior class of people, who are to be",41,Edwards

I would not tolerate for one moment the interference of British statesmen in a matter in regard to which we are sure of our facts. fear of any interference. would not for one moment remain in a Parliament which tolerated any such interference. I would rather be hounded out of Parliament twenty times over. I shall always resist any encroachment upon the right of Australia to govern itself in its own way. coming from another State, I think I can approach this question in a dispassionate spirit-wit h a mind undisturbed by any of the details which very properly agitate the minds of the inhabitants of Queensland. Nowi t seems to me that the people who advocate the continuance of this traffic must be strangely oblivious of the teachings of history. Never yet has a servile race existed alongside a superior race without sooner or later resulting in the downfall of the civilization and institutions of that country. As a representative of a Western Australian constituency, it is right that I should give the reasons why I intend supporting this Bill. honourable member that the B ill is not before the House. appointment of a select committee. to the motion submitted by the honourable member for Oxley. I do not consider that the demand for a Royal commission or for any further inquiry into this question to be it legitimate or an honest demand. This traffic has gone on for very many years, and so long as I have been in Australia. I have heard it objected to. For over twenty years I have known of an agitation against the continuance of the importation of labourers from the Pacific Islands. In view of the fact that the Parliament of Queensland has legislated against the traffic, and at one time had actually resolved to stop it , and that the evils of this system have been generally recognised in the Statei n which the Kanakas are employed, nothing is likely to be gained by delaying our decision on the 20 F question. I have carefully read most of the literature on this subject, and I have not been able to ascertain'that we are likely to ascertain any further facts by delay. Neither do I find that the advocates of Pacific Islands labour agree as to the remedy. I find that Mr Philp, the Premier of Queensland, says one thing, and that the Chamber of Commerce of Mackay says another. Mr. Philp, in a letter to the Prime Minister, saysI have no fear either. I The Government of Queensland are convinced, from their intimate knowledge of the whole circumstances and conditions of the industiy, that, as stated in my telegram, a period of at least seven years of absolute non-interference with present conditions would be necessary to allow of such preparation as might avert disaster by giving a fair oppoi""tunity for progressive change with regard to the sources of labour supply. The Mackay Chamber of Commerce, a body representing the planters of that important centre, do not ask for seven years, but absolutely insist that coloured labour is necessary, and that without such labour the industry will be destroyed. Here is what the Chamber of Commerce saysThat the continued introduction of Polynesian labour into the State of Queensland, and the employment of the same in connection with the sugar industry, subject to the restrictions contained in the existing Queensland laws and regulations relative thereto, do not involve any social, moral, or other danger to the said State or to the Commonwealth of Australia. members at that meeting. have read is an assertion that this labour, The question is as to the not being dangerous to the moral condition of the Commonwealth, must be continued, I was about to refer and my view is borne out by the additional resolutions which this Chamber of Commerce adopted. I find also that the Premier of Queensland has taken up a most extraordinary position in regard to the action of the Commonwealth Parliament. Mr Philp seems to lay down the principle that before any legislation is taken in hand by this Parliament the Government of Queensland should be consulted. I shall read the extract in which Mr Philp asserts that principle. He saysIn a matter so vitally affecting the interests of this State, and regarding which the local legislation has been the result of long and careful consideration by a succession of Governments, it appears to' me to be a most extraordinary course of procedure that the Government of the Commonwealth should introduce fresh legislation, superseding entirely all our Acts on the subject with",44,Edwards

Now, I consider that the Tariff proposals of the Government are of a character that will affect Western Australia much more seriously than the legislation under discussion will affect the sugar industry of Queensland. of expecting this Parliament to consult the Government of Western Australia before undertaking such legislation. An argument of that kind is very ill-considered; and, coming from a gentleman of the standing of the Premier of Queensland, it shows that he must have a very weak case. But his weakness is further exemplified in the position he has taken up in regard to the representation of Queensland in this House. I was amazed when I read the telegraphic summary of his letter to the Prime Minister, and I took care to get the f u l l text. I find that the Premier of Queensland contends that because some of the representatives of that State hold extreme views in regard to socializing the means of production, therefore their opinions in reference to coloured labour should not be received with any consideration in this House. That seems a most extraordinary contention, but, in order that I may not do the Premier of Queensland an injustice, I shall read his exact words. They are as follows :It will no doubt be urged, and has, indeed, already been urged, that the voice of Queensland has been heard in the matter in the election or .her representatives in bhe Federal Parliamenb, bhe large majoriby of whom are pledged to bhe abolition of coloured labour, and perhaps bhis may have been regarded as rendering unnecessary any further expression of opinion from bhis Sbabe. In reply bo this contention, I beg bo observe bhab bhe gentlemen consbibubing bhe majoriby referred bo, bhough legibimabely elecbed, do not represent the various interests of their State. But if the honourable members represent the majority of the people, that should be sufficient for all practical purposes. the ""boodle"" crowd; that is it. Mr Mahon. Ib must be perfecbly well-known bo bhe Federal Government bhab bhe success of most of bhese gentlemen ab bhe late federal elections was bhe result of bhe solid vobe of one particular class, whoso abbibude in regard bo Pacific Island labour represents only one aspect of their opposition to Here is a most extraordinary statement:If the Federal Government are prepared to accept these gentlemen as being from tbe facb of bheir election the exponents of public opinion in Queensland, thej' musb also be prepared bo regard ib as the opinion of Queensland bhat capibal should be abolished, and that the State should assume the entire property in, and control of, the means But I would never dream of production. Ib is much bo be regretted that the various classes and interests of this Sbateare, so far as numbers are concerned, so inadequately represenbed in bhe Commonwealth Parliamenb, but ib will be still more lamentable if men to whom bhe prospecb of the disorganization of an industrj' can hardly appear bo be an unmixed evil, affording as ib mighb do an opportuniby of forwarding their own special economic views, should be regarded as representing the experience of bhe classes of citizens most entitled, from intimate practical knowledge, to be heard on all subjects relating bo the maintenance and development of the industries of the Sbabe. In other words, the Premier of Queensland wants this House to delay legislation, on the ground that the majority of the members representing that State hold extreme opinions in regard to subjects other than those on which they were returned to this Chamber. But every one of the honourable members for Queensland placed their views on tliis black-labour question before the electors, and told the people that they would do exactly what they are doing, if they were returned. I can see no force whatever in the contention that because these honourable members hold extreme views on some other points, this House should therefore disregard the opinions which they have expressed respecting this industry, and which the people of Queensland have endorsed. A t any rate, it is sufficient for me that the people of Queensland have sent these gentlemen into this House prepared to abolish the system of Kanaka labour, and I am content to accept the verdict of the people of that State, given in a legitimate way. If the Premier of Queensland thinks that the honourable members representing that State do not fully reflect public opinion there, why does he not do what is within his power, seeing that his Parliament is now in session, and take a referendum of the people on the question ?",45,Edwards

120,Mr Mahon,"Mr Philp continuesland have challenged the Government to go to the country. inexpensive way of ascertaining public opinion. Instead of demanding that legislation on this subject shall be delayed, the proper course would be to put the simple question to the people of Queensland"" Are you or are you not in favour of the continuance of Pacific Island labour 1"" As Mr Philp has not done this ; as, so far as I know, he does not propose to do it , I shall resist any attempt to delay the action of this Parliament. If the people of Australia have ever declared with complete unanimity for anything it has been for the extinction of tins system of semi-slavery; and I , for one, am here to loyally carry out the mandate of the people on this question. incumbent upon me to make a reply to a telegram read by tlie honourable member for Oxley, in which I am challenged to say whether I have been asked by a number of associations in my district to move for an extension of time in regard to the abolition of Kanaka labour, or for the appointment of a Royal commission. I admit that I have been asked by some 30 associations to take action of that kind, but those who made the request represent very few of my electors. Every one who has had experience of Chambers of Commerce, or of other organizations of that kind, knows how limited their influence is. They are not representative, the members paying a subscription and then being permitted to join, while a committee of perhaps half-a-dozen members is usually responsible for any recommendation thatthebodyitselfmaymake. Those whosent the request to me, opposed my election tooth and nail, aud I was returned, not by their influence, but despite it . During my candidature I made no secret, on the hustings and elsewhere, of my intention to oppose to the best of my ability any motion for the appointment of a Royal commission, and it was a piece of temerity, to say the least of it, for these associations to ask me to politiagainst the Bill-come s this telegramcally stultify myself by acting in direct opposition to my pledges to my electors. Another matter of which I should like to speak is a statement which has been made by Mr Cowley, an ex-Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He represents the State electorate of Herbert, and he said, in the Assembly a short time 20 F 2 ago, that I had not a majority in any of the sugar-growing districts, and, therefore, did not represent tlie cane-growers. The facts, however, are these : The federal electovate of Herbert comprises seven State electorates -on e of which is the State electorate of the same name-returnin g nine members to the State Assembly. Five of those electorates may be termed sugar-growing districts, and the returns show that I had an absolute majority in three of them, and a substantial majority in the other two. I commenced my electoral campaign on the 4th March, and as polling-day was on the 30th March, I had less than four weeks in which to travel over my large electorate. Consequently I could hold only three meetings in the Mackay district. In Mackay itself, I was beaten at the poll by a majority of twelve votes, whereas at a place outside Mackay, which my supporters told me was the stronghold of the black labour party, I obtained a majority. Possibly, if I had had time to go through the electorate, as I should have liked to do, I would have beaten my opponents still more badly. The honourable member for Oxley has read a number of telegrams and letters; and I have also a large pile of similar communications, of which I will read one or two, to show the tenor of the others. These are not fictitious telegrams, and they do not come from places like Billy-can Gully, Cow Flat, or Howling Dog; they are genuine telegrams from political organizations within my electorate. This telegram comes from HerbertonCentral Council, Woothakata Political and Labour Organization, send contratulations to Hon. E. Barton, Federal Premier, on prompt and reasonable terms of Pacific Island Labourers' Bill, and trust the Bill will speedily find a place in the statutes of the Commonwealth. Another telegram comes from CoolganaMembers of Coolgana Workers' Political Organization are thankful for your own and labour party's support of Kanaka Bill, trusting that with your influence it shall become law. Then from Mackay-the place where it has been made to appear there is a great outcry Mackay constituents cordially endorse Prime Minister's action regarding Kanaka legislation. Another telegram comes from CoenResolution unanimously passed, meeting workers' association, upholding Federal Premier's action re Kanaka Bill. I have other telegrams here to the same same effect, but I shall not weary the House",46,Edwards

122,Mr Mahon,Her e is a simple and,47,Edwards
123,Mr Bamford (Herbert),"I feel i tby reading them. They distinctly disprove the allegation of the honourable member for Oxley, that the opinions held in Queensland in regard to the Kanaka traffic are all of the same character. I say that they are not. sent are people who will be directly affected by the proposed legislation. The telegrams come, not from associations comprising two men and a boy, but from large organizations of workers representing the people who, it affected if the Bill passes. A number of local authorities have also sent messages, but they were not empowered to do so by those whom they represent, and had the people been consulted, the messages would not have been sent. A t Townsville, indeed, a large public meeting was called, at which the Municipal Council was censured for the action they had taken in sending a message. During tlie election I was opposed by two Ministers of the Crown, the Premier of Queensland, the representatives of Townsville, and the State representative of Herbert; but notwithstanding all the influence -political , commercial, and financial, which was brought to bear against me, the people in that part of Queensland were so impressed with the necessity of doing away with coloured labour at the earliest opportunity, that they sent me here to do what I could to bring, about its abolition. I am sure that the defeat of the motion is a forehas returned seven out of her nine gone conclusion, and therefore it would be a waste of time to discuss it longer. MrA . PATERSON (Capricornia) I have listened with prolonged and breathless astonishment to the arguments of the honourable member for Oxley. I do not think they have any reference to the B ill . The title of the Bill is "" An A ct to Provide for the Prohibition of the Introduction of Labourers from the Pacific Islands and for other Purposes,"" and I do not think that the member for Oxley gave any reason why it should not he passed. All his arguments, if they were arguments, were in support of the retention of the Kanaka for the benefit of the sugar planter. But what has the nation to do with the sugar planter more than with any other section of the community'' The objection to the Kanaka is on account of his colour. Australia has pronounced with clarion voice that colour shall not be introduced into our race, and I do not see how we can oppose that pronouncement.' Even if the Bill were referred to a Select Committee or to a Royal commission, that difliculty could not be got over, and the mass of evidence presented by tlie honourable member for Oxley could not be exceeded by the work The majority of those whom I repreof a body of that kind, even if it sat for six months. I feel certain that upon the' evidence submitted we cannot do otherwise than insist upon the prohibition of the Kanaka. I have every sympathy with the sugar-planter, because is said, will be prejudicially he has invested a great deal of money in his industry, though the amount has been very much exaggerated. For the past 20 years he has dined each day with the sword of this threatened legislation suspended over his head by a hair, and he is now finding his position uncomfortable, because it looks as though the sword will cut the hair, and he will be extinguished. But we have to consider the interests, not of the few but of the people at large. I do not think that it is necessary for us to prove that sugar-cane growing could be carried on without Kanakas. I take the position of tlie honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who said that even if the sugar industry had to be sacrificed, it would be better to lose it in order to insure the purity of the race. There has been a great deal of talk about public opinion in Queensland, but I assure honourable members that Queensland is almost unanimous upon this point. She representatives in this assembly pledged to the abolition of the Kanaka traffic. The desire to exclude coloured aliens generally was due to the fear that their introduction would have the effect of lowering wages, but in reference to Kanakas the feeling is different, and the motives are thoroughly unselfish. We desire to see the Kanaka excluded, not because we think he will compete with the white man, but because we desire to secure the purity of the race for ourselves and our children. We have three reports before us from Dr. Maxwell, who is an expert in this business, and I will read briefly what he says about the cane-growersI t is found that most of the large sugar-growing estates, which were originally in the hands of large planters, have been cut up into farms, and rented or sold to numerous cane-growers. Particularly in the case of the areas that are furnishing cane for the Government Central Mills, the growing is done by farmers, who have taken up and own or occupj' those lands. These facts place before us a situation that is almost uniqueand peculiar to Queensland. In other cane sugar growing countries the estates are in the hands of extensive owners or controlled by large corporations, which state carries with it the consequence that a miniinun number of white men are located on the land. In this colony the ownership or occupancy embraces a vast number of strong, responsible, and progressive white men, who are planted over all the sugar-growing areas. These men furnish the material which puts the mills into operation, and, as the mills depend wholly upon the field, it appears that the future of the sugar industry of the colony is very much in the hands of those numerous and small canegrowers. The principle of small ownership and occupancy is right and sound, and leading, as it does, to tbe dividing of the matters at stake amongst a maximum number of responsible men, it furnishes a broad and safe basis for the industry, and promotes development along lines that are agreeable and of value to the State. Tliis statement occurs in a report furnished by D r . M a x w e l l to the Queensland Government on the 13th January, 1900. Maxwel l gives some very good advice in connection w it h sugar-growing and the manufacture of sugar. As to the cultivat i on of the sugar cane, he says t h a t the solution of the difliculty lies in deep ploughing, and more of it , in manuring and in i r r i g a t i o n . A t the only sugar plantation,in my electorate I made an arrangement w it h the manager to t r y bone-dust as a manure, and in order to show m y sincerity, I gave him the bone-dust a t something less than cost price. very extraordinary results, which showed t h a t w it h the same amount of labour, a larger amount of sugar could be produced than under ordinary circumstances, and no doubt if irrigatio n were added to the judicious use of manures, permanent and certain success would be assured even in the worse seasons. D r . M a x w e l l saysThe further equipments of the mills generally so t h a t very nearly two-thirds would be preare such as to allow of moderately good work being done. The engine power of the mills is served, supposing t h a t the value of the unusually ample and good. Some of the newer labour were equal in both n o r t h and south. central mills are in a very good state of equipOther particulars are supplied in this rement. The more recent introductions into por t by D r . M a x w e l l as to the cost of food modern sugarhouses, however-suc h as superand clothing, b ut a l l these are of no pracheating and the latest mode of crystallization in movement-were not seen in the mills in Queenstica l value withou t returns showing the land. Superheating is at once strongly advised q u a n t i ty of sugar produced in each d is t r i c t. by us, and especially because of what is believed If we had these we should be able to come will bo its particular value in handling highly to some conclusion. D r . M a x w e l l closes diluted or gummed juices. Then he closes his report by sayingMore urgent than all alterations along mechanical lines is the introduction into the central and growing lands during the past decade, and the some other mills of a more thoroughly trained concurrent increase in the volume of sugar proand scientific system of management. The men duced, with the reduction in the number of in charge have executive ability, and thej' appealislanders emploj'ed, demonstrate the present able to get relatively good results from the tendency, and indicate that, under the current labour they command ; but they require training and aid iu those specific parts of manufacture which demand a thorough knowledge of the chemistry of sugar juices, and of the nature of the agents which aid in clarification. These statements are taken from the first report of D r . M a x w e l l furnished to the Government of Queensland in 1900. No w I shall refer to D r . Maxwell's report of this year to the PrimeM in is t e r of the Federal Government. In the letter which was sent from the Prime Minister to D r . M a x w e l l on, the 2 4 t h M a y of this year, it was statedMr Barton will be glad, with regard to the statistical information asked for, if returns can be so divided as to show the difference in the three separate sugar districts of Queensland mentioned in your report ; and also whether your information enables you to afford similar details with regard to New South Wales. I have looked carefully through this report, Dr. and I do not find any reply upon this most important point. We have separate returns for each district w it h regard to the mean temperatures, separate returns as to wages of the w h it e labourers and of the m ill hands, and as to the cost of the islanders, and we also have one r e t u r n as to the acreage of cane. There is not, however, any r e t u r n furnished as to the acreage of cane or the yield of sugar i u the different districts, so t h a t it is very difficul t to arrive at a proper estimate of what would be This manure was trie d w it h abandoned if it became necessary to give up any part of the sugar-growing industry. In the He r a l d report, however, there is a short paragraph that may give us some explanation. It relates to the number of Kanakas w o r k i ng in the northern and southern plantations. A t page 44 of the report, I find it stated t h a t the Kanaka labourers south of Mackay number 5,268, w h i l st north of Mackay there are 3,596 employed, his report by sayingThe increment of white settlers upon the sugaroperation of given natural laws, and particularly in certain latitudes, the Pacific Islander is a relatively declining factor in sugar production in Australia. If tlie Kanaka is a declining factor why should we make all this fuss about"" him 1 Our legislation will exclude the Japanese and Javanese and other coloured races, and it will be impossible to get any other coloured labour to supply the place of the Kanaka. Therefore the question of substituting labour for that of the Kanaka will have to be faced sooner or later, and I think that Australia demands that it should be solved at once. Nothing can be gained by delay, and the appointment of Royal commissions has proved to be exceedingly unsatisfactory in the past. In his third report, furnished to the present Premier of Queensland,Dr. Maxwell saysI had to reply to Mr Chataway that my experience in other countries, with my observation in this country, and the history of the labour experimentation in the State, forced me to conclude that if the industry should be made wholly dependent upon white labour, then sugar-growing north of Mackay must die out. It will not be instant, but I consider it certain. Again he saysI consider it certain that cane will not be grown solely by white labour north of Mackay to keep the mills in existence. Then he closes his report by sayingI trust, Mr Premier, that this brief statement of the policy of the Sugar department of the Government will inform you more effectively than a verbal opinion on the matters upon which you request my views. I shall, however, have to urge the most careful consideration of the Government, in the interest of the cane-farmers, if legislation should render cano-growing impracticable. We have 2,610 of these men, the backbone of their districts, and they must not be lost; yet the subjects which are matters of opinion aud of divisions in Parliaments are questions of life and death to those men in the fields. There is nothing said here about tlie life or death of the nation, and yet that is the most important question of all. I do not believe in these highly coloured reports in reference to the difficulty of getting white men to work in these northern cane fields. I have met cane-growers who have worked as far north as Cairns, and immediately before my election I met an old Scotchman who had five sons, and who had carried on cane-growing in the neighbourhood of Cairns. me that it was tlie worse day's work he ever did in his life when he sold out, because his sons were not satisfied to remain in the county, and if he had the money to buy Mr A. Paterson. his farm back again that would be the first thing he would do. I do not say that there will not be hardship inflicted upon the. planters by the passing of this Bill, but they have carried on their business under the threat of legislation to abolish Kanaka labour for many years past, and I do not think we should now consider them too much. The Government have gone far enough in giving them five years within which to make all their plans. Honourable members are inclined to poohpooh the idea that there is any feeling of excitement in Queensland over this question, but I had the utmost difliculty in pacifying the electors of my constituency when I stood out for a five years' term. They wanted the Kanakas abolished at once, and the most I could get them to consent to was an extension of three years. It was very difficult to get them to keep within bounds, even though I explained to them the magnitude and wide extent of the interests involved in the industry, and that the matter was not one to be decided offhand, but only after serious consideration. There is only one remarkable thing I have noticed in connection with the reports, and that is the shifting of the line beyond which sugar could not be grown except by the employment of black labour. The Queensland commission in 1889 dealt with this subject. One of the points was that sugar could be grown anywhere south of Townsville without the aid of black labour. They were very firm upon that point. There was nodivisionofopinionbetweenthem. In 1900 we find Dr. Maxwell stating in his report that sugar cannot be grown without the aid of black labour north of Mackay. Then we have the evidence of another expert, Mr C. Van de Velde. He saysIn the semi-tropical zone of Queensland, that is to say, from Bundaberg to the south, tlie climate is totally different. The mean temperature is lower and there is less moisture in the atmosphere, rendering it less oppressive and enervating. It is abundantly proved that in thab region white men can and will do the work on the plantations. There are there at the present time about 5,000 coloured men that can be replaced by white labourers. The whole situation can thus besurmmaiised as follows :-In the tropical zone of Queensland the industry must disappear with tbe blacks. In the semi-tropical He told zone coloured labour can be replaced by white at tlie Australian rate of wages provided that the Federal Customs Tariff shall sufficiently protect the industry. In New South Wales the industry under a system of protection, is entireh' carried on by whibe labour. And if the beeb sugar industry is to be introduced, for which there is urgent necessity, as I will endeavour to show, it will have to be done by white labour earning Australian wages. Further on he saysIf Australia desires the planters to replace gradually their coloured by white labourers, they should be given an interest in doing so, and the best adapted for their operations. I do not see inducement is to make, by a tax on the employment of coloured men, their labour slightly more expensive than that of white labour, we may be assured that under such conditions the evolution -will be completed within the shortest period, and the Kanaka traffic will die a natural death. That is just what the Government propose to do. The imposition of this countervailing duty will afford sufficient protection to the sugar industry to enable it to be carried on under natural conditions, and by the employment of our own race. It will be observed that the line beyond which it was stated that a white man could not work, was originally fixed at Townsville. Theni t was shifted to Mackay, and later on to Bundaberg. If a select committee is appointed to investigate this matter, I very much fear that the line may get down to the Tweed River. If the select committee is followed by a Royal commission, it will probably get into the middle of New South Wales. To my mind, the sooner this question is settled the better. One of the strong reasons which induced Queensland to enter the Federation was that the great bulk of her people thought that this black labour question would be quickly and finally settled. It is shown by these reports that not much more than a third of the sugar lauds-and very rich lands they are-woul d have to be abandoned, even on the assumption that the planters were right in their contention. But surely if we give the sugar growers an extension of time for five years, they will be able to raise sufficient money within that period to discover men of science who will provide them with machinery with which to overcome the difficulty of trashing. The trashing of the cane is the only real difliculty to be surmounted. But even if that difficulty does not disappear the sugar lands of Queensland will not run away. That State will not be any poorer because she does not grow sugar upon these particular lands. Queensland already grows the best maizeshe needs it, too, because last year she did not grow enough for her own consumption. If it is found that sugar cannot be grown in these northern latitudes, why should not the mills, plant, &c, be removed to the southern latitudes where it can be grown T Then we should have no necessity to import any sugar. In Englandi t is quite a common thing for manufactories-and ' indeed, for whole towns like that of Saltaireto be removed to the locality which is best that it would be difficult to adopt the same plan in connection with the sugar mills. I shall vote for the Bill, because it gives me all that I ask for. A t the commencement of my campaign I stated that I would support any Government which gave reasonable consideration to the sugar grower with the certain extinction of the Kanaka. I said that a five years' final extension, with legislation on the question immediately, was, I thought, a fair thing. member extend the time for recruiting, or the time for keeping the Kanakas in Queensland. the time at all. A good deal of mention has been made of the feelings of religious men upon this question. I am not going to despise or ridicule those feelings. They have to be taken into account. Amongst tlie sugar planters themselves there are men of the highest education and culture and Christian principles. There are benevolent and philanthropic individuals who are really good men, but they have been so accustomed to the employment of this servile labour, that they have come to believe there is no harm in it. The same remarkapplied to the owners of slaves in America. Some 60 years ago an uncle of mine nearly lost his life in the State of Carolina simply because he tried to teach the slaves to read. Yet these planters were men of education, who thought that there was no wrong in oppressing the poor despised black man. It is undesirable that this servile labour should be allowed in any civilized country, not only on account of the bad effect which it produces upon the men, but because of its bad effect upon the masters. If we have a race of men who are servile, we shall inevitably produce a race of arrogant tyrants, whose presence will be far more disgraceful to us thau is that of the blacks themselves. Several missionaries have spoken strongly in favour of the retention of Kanakas, because of the good influence that our teaching will have upon them. I want honourable members to note that, when their sons and",47,Edwards

Do they do that for the sake of their health 1 No. They do it to keep them from the black taint. It is' quite right that they should do so, and the Government merely propose to do the same thing. During my election campaign I was repeatedly confronted with an argument which I found somewhat difficult to answer. A distinguished Plymouth brother urged that it was most unchristianlike to talk of excluding the Kanaka; and in support of his contention he quoted the Biblical verse that GodHath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth. I replied that we did not object to the £3,500,000. I haveheard theestimate placed Kanaka's blood, but to the colour of his at £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, and even up to skin. I also reminded my friend that he £10,000,000 ; whereas the official statistics, had not quoted the whole of the verse, the taken from the Queensland Gazette, for the remainder beingAnd hath determined the times before appointed, machinery, plant, land, and premises is and the bounds of their habitation.

W it h regard to the plant employed, the Mackay Association in their pamphlet sayWe cannot conclude this communication without reminding you of the vast interests at stake in connection with the industry, and we feel assured that your delegate will not fail to impress this phase of the question most stronghy upon the conference.

That is the statement of the Mackay Sugar Association, and we see that 13,500 white workers are employed permanently, and 9,000 casually. I shall strongly support the Bill, which I hope will be carried. I have received telegrams from political opponents, as well as from friends, unanimously in favour of the Bill as submitted to the House. To these telegrams I replied that I did not think there would be the slightest difliculty so far as Queensland representatives were concerned, because I thought there would be seven solid for the Bill, but that all I was afraid of was that the Government might be shaken on the question, and take amendments into consideration. I think I represent Queensland feeling when I say that we are decidedly in favour of the Bill as it stands. are in the position which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne expressed last evening, when he said that we who represent other States than Queensland occupy a judicial position, and have to listen to both sides of the case. There is something to be said even for the delay which has been caused in debating the motion for referring the Bill to a select committee, in that it does give some answer to the complaints which may have been made that the House is prepared to assent to a measure without hearing what is to be said on both sides. Even if every member had already made up his mind, I would rather see the House spend more time on this question, so that we may hot be open to the charge of acting with undue haste. When I come to look at the question, there appears to me one point on which I have not heard sufficient in order to enable me to know whether I should be right in assenting to the proposal to discontinue the importation of Kanakas in five years. I would draw the attention of honourable members to Dr. Maxwell's report, in which he spoke of an instance taken from the extreme north, in the Cairns district, where there were 409 white labourers passed through the books in order to provide and maintain 88 hands required daily to keep the mill in operation for a season of 30 weeks. The honourable member who has just addressed the House has told us that in Kanakas employed; and if the instance I have quoted is to be taken as showing the proper proportion of white labourers that will have to be availableI believe white labour will be found more efficient than black, but I pass that point for the moment it will be necessary to have 15,000 or 16,000 white men employed for the 3,696 Kanakas. ber can only make that inference properly when he knows all the circumstances. would be the wages white men will work for; but I do not think wages come into this question. Another difficulty arises, as Dr. Maxwell shows in a preceding portion of the same report, when he saysConsequently it is apparent that much of the instability which is attributed to the loose unstable habits of the white transcient labourers, should be put down to the sheer inability to do given kinds of continuous work in those natural conditions. ber think it will take five whites to do the work of one black ? But in the district to which I am referring, there must be a supply of white labour in the proportion of four to one of what will be the continuous number of workmen. That has been shown over and over again, and it was admitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Portsi n his speech last night. and they will stick to this work. to the official returns, white men are not able, to stick to the work. the physical capacity of the honourable member for Maranoa, there would be no doubt on the point; but what we have to consider is whether ordinary labour is likely to be available for the work. Seeing that 16,000 labourers would be required in the northern portion of the country, and possibly 7,000 men in the southern portion, or 24,000 to make up the supply for the whole year, is it likely that that labour can be obtained within the time provided by this BiU ? labourers will not be retained all the year, or anything like that time.",52,Edwards

I need hardly say that I have no personal interest whatever in it. I come from a State where the conditions which have been alluded to do not prevail; but I am in full sympathy with all honourable members who urge the desirability of ceasing this traffic, and we in Tasmania are prepared to pay our share of what will be the considerable cost attaching to the abolition of the Kanakas. When the proposals of the Government come into f u l l force we shall be giving up about £1,000,000 a year, or £ 6 per ton on 170,000 tons of sugar for a great many years. I am prepared, on behalf of Tasmania, to pay my share of taxation which is going to support an industry under tlie special condition that white labour shall be employed. Buti t is very desirable that we should give f u l l consideration and not agree too hastily to &ny terms which may prove insufficient to enable the industry to continue. We are, I believe, enacting this measure with the desire to give an opportunity to Queensland. We do not desire to shut up any mills or destroy any enterprise in that State, and the question is whether we are giving sufficient time. I hope further attention will be given to the question I have raised as to whether the necessary labour can be obtained to overtake the necessities of the case. If that be so, I am prepared to yield any scruples I removed, I shall be prepared to vote either the time proposed. member for Capricornia said that he attached a veiy great deal of importance and weight to the concluding words of the text, the first portion of which had been previously quoted to the House. He said the concluding words were to the effect that God had determined the bounds of man's habitation, and that it appeared to hirn as being distinctly unconvincing that the tropics were the place for the black man. I think, on the contrary, that the concluding words distinctly show the strength and force of the quotation which has been made, because, undoubtedly, the bounds of This point has not been the employment of the black worker to-day are the low-lying areas within the tropics, where, as I have contended before and still contend, the white man cannot work without detriment to himself and to his race. I am sure that honourable members will agree that Australia as a whole has given its verdict that black alien labour must go, but the verdict has been given so emphatically that it should make this Assembly cautious in its action, so that vested interests may not be injuriously interfered with. Honourable members must admit that the honourable member for Oxley has brought evidence of the existence throughout 'Queensland of a strong feeling against the proposed Bill, and the representations which he has made deserve our careful and thoughtful consideration, since, although he quoted a large number of individual opinions, he also quoted opinions expressed by large representative bodies in all parts of Queensland.

It is all very well to say that we liave before us the array of testimony which was presented to the Parliament of Queensland, but, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, we have only the report prepared by a gentleman eminent in his profession, the general tenor of which is that, for the prosecution of the sugar industiy in the low-lying tropical districts of the continent, the black man is essential. its strength should give consideration to that report, and to the public opinion which has been voiced by the honourable member for Oxley. If there would be any serious delay in making the inquiry which the honourable member asks for, I should object to it ; but that could be avoided by requiring the select committee or commission to report within a certain time. I think that the chairman of tlie commission' should be a Judge of the Supreme Court, and that its members should comprise representatives of the labour party and of the other parties in the House. ber for Oxley asks for a select committee. will see his way to alter his motion to a request for the appointment of a commission. I see no reason why such a commission should not consist of honourable members of this House, with a Judge of the Supreme Court as chairman. There are members on each side of the Chamber who would be absolutely impartial, and anxious to see that all the evidence which would aid us in coming to a decision is brought before us. There need be no unnecessary delay, because the commission can be asked to report within a specified period, and its appointment would.take away all grounds for the bitterness and soreness which now unquestionably exist. It is for that reason that I support the motion, and add my voice to the appeal to the House to look at tlie matter from a judicial standpoint, and not to be carried away by the eager demand to have the matter settled immediately. The accomplishment of this reform is a thing which we all desire, but let us see that it is accomplished without the creation of ill-feeling, so that at the very beginning of our national life the large and important State of QueensThose whom the land, or a large number of its electors, may not feel embittered and regretful at having entered the union of the Commonwealth. the representatives of Queensland, there are but two members in this assembly who represent men engaged in the growing of sugar cane, the honourable member for Cowper and myself, and it may, therefore, not be out of place for me to occupy a few minutes in directing the attention of honourable members to the view of this subject taken by the white men Surely this Housei n engaged in the growing of sugar cane in the northern parts of New South Wales. You, Mr Speaker, ruled this afternoon, when the honourable member for Oxley was speaking, that the question under discussion was, not the objection of the people of Australia to Kanakas, but whether the House is in possession of such facts as enable it to decide upon this matter without further inquiry. Upon that aspect of the case, and upon it alone, I shall address a few remarks to you. I hope, too, to have a word or two to say with regard to the difficulty besetting the honourable and learned member for Tasmania, Mi-. Piesse. I had an opportunity, 25 years ago, to witness the advent of sugar cane growing on the northern rivers of New South Wales. A t that time the industry was i u its infancy on the Richmond, and subsequently a large mill was built on the Tweed. In those days, and for a decade or two afterwards, there was no talk of the climatic influences being such as to injuriously affect the white men working there. Year after year the white man did the work alone, and the industry worked by white labour seemed to be established upon a thriving basis. But, as time passed, black men made their appearance in driblets from Queensland and various parts of New South Wales, and apparently almost simultaneously with their coming arose the need for them. Now, it is no unusual thing to hear it said, in districts where previously there was no doubt that white men could do the work, that it is not possible to do without black labour. But all over the world when cheap and docile labour is obtainable, there is work for it to do. The moment that the farmer becomes",54,Edwards

I think the honourable member for Oxley will concede that point. their ground i u Queensland now, and they say that the white man cannot do the work at all. the contention, and the legislation which has been passed makes it fairly clear. The honourable member for Oxley will also concede that the climatic objections need not hold in regard to the operation of trashing, because the winter months, when white men can work well, can be chosen for it. Trashing is done most advantageously shortly before the cane cutting. according to the rainfall. the cutting-that , at least, is the right time to do it . begins in July, it stands to reason that the trashing can be done during the winter months. It is a moot point whether trashing is required at all. I do not desire to enter into the details of the question, but it appears to me to be a moot point whether there is any necessity to trash the cane, and, if it is clear that it can be done understand that dry rations do not include in the winter months, we can almost eliminate the question of trashing from our consideration in connection with the labour question. A good deal of the cane-cutting can also be done in the cooler weather, and, therefore, for all practical purposes, we can also eliminate a portion of the cane-cutting from our consideration when we are speaking of the capacity of white labour to do the principal work upon a sugar plantation. Therefore, the whole of the difficulty so far as trashing is concerned, and at least half the difficulty with regard to canecutting disappears. I should like to explain, for the information of honourable members who are representing southern districts, how the cane-cutting is done on the northern rivers in New South Wales. A number of men go to tlie northern rivers periodically year after year to cut cane. They are most of them men of veiy fine physique, and with considerable independence of spirit. It suits these men to work very hard and to put an immense strain upon their physical powers, which are great, so that in three or four months they may make a large wage, and afterwards have a comfortable time. This is the type of man of extremely good physique who make their appearance on the northern rivers during the cane-cutting season. These men work by contract, and I will now come to an essential point, so far as the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, is concerned. These men on the northern rivers have told me, and I give their statements for what they are worth on their own authority, that they would as soon work up at Cairns as on the Tweed River. It seemed ci remarkable statement, and I pressed them just as any other honourable member would press them upon the point, and this was their explanation: A considerable proportion of the cane land on the Tweed River, for instance, lies on a great basaltic tableland, broken here and there by sharp declivities, and here and there by It is done a little before rolling slopes. On these tablelands there are strewn a considerable number of boulders, As the cane-cutting and the cane-cutters tell me that the extra labour involved' in dealing with a ton of cane on these slopes and declivities and amongst these boulders takes more out of them than if they were dealing with a ton of cane at Cairns. On the Richmond and Tweed River the men make something like £ 2 to £ 3 per week with dry rations. I beef. never heard of dry rations before. tion at which I desire to arrive. The men working on the Richmond and Tweed rivers working by contract make from £ 2 10s. to £ 3 per week, and they also get a dry ration which is worth about 5s. a week. Therefore they earn about £ 3 per week all round. They tell me, further, that the only opportunities they have ever been given to cut cane in Northern Queensland has been at the rate of £ 1 5s. per week. If that be a fact that the planters of Northern Queensland have never offered the white man contract work which would enable him to make £ 3 per week-as much as they would make by working a thousand miles to the south-it simply shows that white labour has never had a chance in the north.

If the facts are as stated, the white man has not had a fair chance to work in Northern Queensland, and I look to some other honourable member to prove whether I have correctly stated the case or not, or for a reply. cane are handled by these men on the Richmond River for £3 a week 1 cane costs about Is. 6d. per ton, or about 30s. per acre. Then the price for cane cutting varies-accordin g to whether it has to be cut on the level banks of the river or on the table-lands, such as I have described -fro m Is. 9c1. to nearly 3s. per ton, or an average of say 2s. 6d. per ton. Therefore the whole cost of trashing aud cutting would be 4s per ton, and that is the total amount per ton that is at issue in connection with the labour question. That is to say, that giving the honourable member for Oxley the full benefit of his argument, there is only 4s. worth of work at issue in connection with each ton of cane. think there is half of that amount involved. Queensland at present sells her sugar, or most of it , in the open market. The production of sugar in Queensland is so great that she is able-wit h what comes fromNewSouth Wales-to almost supply the Australian markets. A t present she sells her sugar at about £ 8 or £ 9 per ton free on board. Following upon that we have to consider that the Queensland sugar industry is not in a wholesome condition to-day. I am sure that honourable members do not desire to mislead, but the utterances of some of them would cause the House to suppose the Queensland sugar industry is in a satisfactory condition, and that the action of the Federal Parliament in putting a stop to the employment of Kanaka labour will bring ruin on a prosperous industry. The position in Queensland is that a large number of people, acting together on the cooperative principle, have borrowed money from the Government to start mills, and in almost every instance the central mills have failed to meet their obligations. instances. failed to meet their obligations in a large number of instances. In addition to this, Under any circumin many parts of Queensland one can see evidences of abandoned mills connected with the sugar industry.

It carries on its operations in Fiji, in Queensland, and New South Wales, and also in New Zealand, and it is an extremely well-managed company, which is not dependent solely upon the success or otherwise of Queensland sugar production. What appears to me to be the crux of the situation is this. I have just explained the position of the Queensland sugar industiy. Because of the lowness of the price of sugar, and the fact that Queensland has to sell her sugar in the markets of the world, it is veiy doubtful whether there is any money in it .

Queensland produces approximately 120,000 tons of sugar per annum, and the amount of sugar required for Australia170,000 tons-is rather more than the combined production of New South Wales and Queensland. Although l a m a protectionist, I quite admit that when the local supply is less than the local demand, the producer of an article gets the full benefit of a protective duty that may be placed upon that article. This means that the Eederal Parliament is virtually making a present of £600,000 to the Queensland sugar planters in order to induce them to give up black labour. tection and to be allowed to [employ black labour as well. Federal Parliament will give them the right to the white man's market and the run of black labour too. As I say, £600,000 is proposed to be distributed annually amongst the sugar growers of Queensland, and I ask if that is not a fair thing for them?What does it mean ? By the way, honourable members may recollect that the Kanaka costs Queensland £300,000 a year in wages. We must also bear in*mind that that State makes 120,000 tons of sugar per annum. On the assumption that 10 tons of cane make 1 ton of sugar, Queensland must cut 1,200,000 tons of cane annually. If that were paid for, trashed, and cut at the New South Wales rate it would cost £240,000 per annum. But Queensland will, under the Government proposals, be annually £600,000 in advance of her present position. Therefore, if this legislation passes, she will have £840,000 to pay for the cutting of 1,200,000 tons of cane, and if she pays that amount of money for cutting and trashing it, she will be in just the same posiFor the reason that honourable members tion as she is now. What does that amount to? posals are too generous. passing of the Tariff, for the sake of argument, that the sugar planters of Queensland can give twice as much for cutting and trashing as do those of New South Wales. Let us suppose that the} can pay 8s. a ton for cutting and 7 trashing. Does the honourable member for Oxley tell me that if planters offered white men an opportunity of earning twice £ 3 a week for four months in the year, at Cairns, they would not be rushed with men ? That was the trouble with the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse. If the honourable member visited Mount Magnet, Bulong, and Broad Arrow, and saw the men working there, and if he realized that the planter of Queensland would be able to give the trasher and grower of cane work by which under the contract system he could earn £ 6 a week, and be in no worse position than he is to-day, he would see that there is not the slightest doubt that white labour can be successfully obtained in these branches of this industry. Indeed, it seems to me that the indictment would be from the farmers in other parts of the States. So magnificent are the opportunities, and so large the wage fund, that the I do not think the cry about the disturbance of labour would come rather from them than from the men who are given this splendid chance. consumption. into a discussion of that question now.

I have mentioned only a few of the points in the speeches of honourable members opposite that appear to me to be pregnant with meaning. I shall conclude by saying that I think the masses of Australia are doing -quite as much for the sugar industry, 1 and are paying as high a price for the abolition of black labour, as the Queensland sugar-grower had a right to expect. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I have no intention of detaining the House by making a long speech. As much has been said upon this subject as can reasonably be said. There is one point, however, which has received very little attention up to the present. I allude to the moral aspect of this question. The honourable member for Parramatta laid very great emphasis upon this phase of the subject. To-night we were told by the honourable member for Capricornia that in Queensland the sugar planters send their children to Englandi n order to have them educated, not because they cannot receive the necessary education in Australia, but in order to set them free from the contamination of black people. I desire to read to the House a very short extract in reference to this question from the address of the Bishop of Brisbane to the Synod in 1892. It is as follows :While I should be disposed to suspend my poses. The Bishop continuesjudgment if I found men of the strong sense and calibre, of Bishop Selwyn, with their long exwomen perience in the Islands, taking a distinctly "" boys,""toi.e., opposite view, yet, viewing the matter from employed.

I would rather churchmen, it is well that our white people accept tlie opinion of the Bishop of Brisbane, should have before them the good example in discharge of religious obligations which is set supported as he is by Bishop Selwyn, than them by their coloured brethren. In 1893 he wroteThe brave visit of the Bishop of Tasmania to the Melanesian mission field takes high rank among the events of the year that has gone. opinion 1 That he used his powers of observation and induction to some purpose is evident from the interesting account which he gave of his visitation tour, and the inference he drew from the facts before him. To myself, at least, his report is welcome reading, as it wholly confirms the view of the black labour question-almos t to its very illustration-whic h I ventured to put before j'ou last year. We approached the question, it may beremembered,not in the light of the changing phases of popular opinion or political necessity, or supposed rival interests, but in the fuller and truer light of that humanitarianism which we bave learned from the Incarnation, and it is also from this same point of view that the Bishop of Tasmania has supplied such strongly confirmatory evidence. My words were spoken as from Australian shores; he has viewed the question from the Islands themselves, and bis testimony is the more valuable because he entered upon his visitation tour with preconceived ideas of an opposite character. In order to be sure that he had not altered his opinion, I caused a letter to be written to him recently. In reply to that communication, he writes as follows, under date 24th July, 1901 :With reference to the particular point mentioned in your inquiry as to whether the presence of the ""boys"" involves immoral traffic in Japanese women, I can only say that so far as concerns the sugar plantations in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg and the Isis in this diocese, I am able to give a fiat contradiction to such charge. them.

You have my authority to deny it. Further, he only spent two hours in Bundaberg plantations. That message is signed by Mr Angus Gibson. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will himself have some explanation to make in connection with this matter. I believe that there is no difficulty about growing sugar in the Bundaberg district without black labour. But no amount of protection will assist growers in the north, because we cannot get white people to work there. get white peeple to work there, they would prove very expensive, and I am led to that opinion from my experience in the north. I am not now interested in the sugar industry, but I had the satisfaction of gaining my experience at the cost of some £20,000 in an endeavour to grow sugar a great many years ago. I say, without fear of being directly contradicted, that so far as the northern portions of Queensland are concerned, we cannot rely on white labour for growing sugar cane I am convinced amount mentioned by the last speaker were available for distribution in order to assist the grower, it would prove of no use, in consequence of the impossibility of getting labour. To grant a Royal commission would be doing something to assist Queensland at a time when the people of that State are extremely and justly irritated at the action taken by the Government. Had the people of Queensland known or anticipated, when the question of federation was under discussion, that such a B ill as that now before us would have been introduced, the vote in favour of federation would have been much less, even had it proved possible to carry an affirmative vote. I hope that further time will be given in the Bill, but if this question goes to the vote I shall be found in favour of the motion. The honourable member for Melbourne has If the told us very emphatically-and I suppose he speaks from experience, like the rest of us-that it is impossible for white men to do this work in the north of Queensland. The answer to that statement is simply that, so far as we have any knowledge at present, white men have never been tempted by a fitting wage to work in that part of the continent. Until a fitting wage is offered, which would tempt the Australian working men to go there, it cannot properly be said that white men cannot or will not do the work. White men decline to do the work under existing conditions for a mere pittance of 4s. or 5s. per day, which, so far as we have any evidence at present, is the utmost that has been offered. When men can get 7s. or 8s. a day further south, under altogether more favourableconditions, they would be foolish indeed if they \vent to work in tropical regions for a paltry 5s. Further, if 5s. per day is tlie extent Even supposing we could of the wages offered to white men in an industry which is protected with a duty of £ 5 or £ 6 per ton, it is a poor look-out for tlie encouragement of what we call our "" native industries."" I am inclined to think that a ""native industry,"" protected to the extent of £ 6 per ton, which can give a black man only 2s. 4d. per week, and a white man 5s. per day, is not woi'th much encouragement. I sympathize to the full with the vested interests which have grown up in the north of Queensland. Nobody can view with equanimity the prospect.",59,Edwards

But what we have to look at, as has been said by other speakers, is the purity and integrity of our race. We have to consider not only the present passing conditions, but what north Queensland and the whole continent will be in generations yet to come. mind in carrying out what is undoubtedly the mandate of Australia, uamely, that this country shall be kept ""white."" I have yet to learn that any fresh argument has been offered for departing from the position already taken up by the Government, or for reversing the decision unanimously arrived at last night. I listened very carefully to what the honourable member for Oxley had to say, and the many quotations he made use of simply amounted to the fact that there are people in Queensland who believe that black labour should be maintained. So far as I heard, the honourable member did not quote a single telegram which advocated a few more years' extension for black labour. All his correspondents desire inquiry. What for? For the purpose of trying to establish the fact that the sugar-growing industry must fail if black labour is not continued. ' It is not an extension of time that is sought; what is desired is to make black labour permanent. It is not so much the Kanaka that the advocates of coloured labour are thinking of. Every one knows that in the north of Queensland, and in the islands, the Kanaka is a diminishing quantity. He is decaying in his own home in consequence of the enormous deportation to this country, and this is recognised by the people of Queensland who want coloured labour permanently established, so that when the supply of Kanakas ceases the industry may be continued by means of other kinds of alien labour. On the other hand the people of Australia have unanimously determined that there shall be no black labour on this continent, but that it shall be abolished as rapidly and prudently as may be ; and the proposal is that the Government shall give a certain time within which this labour must cease. The honourable member for Oxley asks for a select committee of this House, and us that he does not want a select committee. question on the subject, he made it 20 a quite clear that he did not want a select committee, but a Royal commission composed of experts. If that is the honourable member's object, the motion is entirely out of place, and he ought not to be taking up the time of the Housei n asking for a select committee. It is the first time. I ever heard a man stand up in Parliament and say he did not want a select committee, and yet at We should keep this in the same time solemnly move that the matter under consideration be referred to such a body. It might have been proper for the Speaker to consider whether the honourable member should not be stopped from debating the matter under consideration. In any case it does seem strange that an honourable member should propose a select committee, and, in the course of his speech, make it quite clear that he does not want a select committee but some other kind of tribunal. order. The honourable member for Parramatta distinctly states that I asked for a Royal commission of experts. I never mentioned the word "" experts"" during the whole .of my speech, either last night otto-night. order. If the honourable member for Oxley desires to explain he may do so after the honourable member for Parramatta has spoken. honourable member for Oxley did not distinctly say, in reply to an interjection, that he would prefer a Judge to preside over the inquiry he proposed ? Surely that would not have been possible under the motion now before the House. on sugar. usually call on Judges to preside over select committees of Parliament; neither do we call in any other kind of expert assistance. The honourable member, above all things, made it clear that he did not want a select committee of this House. Moreover, I should not think many honourable members would be willing to sit on a committee after the remark of the honourable member to the effect that there are not at the same time tells more than two in the House who understand anything about this question. would be under the circumstances, to ask",60,Mceacharn I That If A Great Deal More Money Than The

I suppose that the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane are about the only two honourable members who, in the opinion of the former gentleman, know anything about this question. The honourable member tells us that we are ignorant of the very question which he asks us to inquire into. honourable members being good judges. May I remind the honourable member that, according to his own statement, we might very well judge this matter without any inquiry such as is proposed. We have looked into this question and searched all available records. We have investigated the figures presented, read Dr. Maxwell's reports, and also reports of various Royal commissions, and I really do not think that much fresh information can be gleaned unless we make a personal investigation on the spot. If the honourable member had seriously suggested that we should take a trip north there might have been some reason in his proposal. Buti f he means that we are to have an inquiry within the precincts of Parliament House, and to invite Dr. Maxwell to give evidence, I am afraid that gentleman could not tell us any more than he has already told us in his reports. If we are to call Mr Angus Gibson and other gentlemen who have from time to time given the Queensland Parliament the benefit of their knowledge,"" I am afraid they could not tell us anything more than we are now able to read in the Queensland Hansard. What, therefore, can be gained by any further investigation or delay ? I should be glad, indeed, if I thought we were not sufficiently well informed on the matter, to agree to further delay in order to enlighten our minds, but since nothing fresh can be gathered, we ought not to grant further postponement. The honourable member read us telegram after telegram, and article after article, but there was nothing fresh in all he »ead. We have read ourselves, time and again, of the possible displacement of some of the labour in Queensland in consequence ment were aware of that when they framed and introduced the measure, but we believe, rightly or wrongly, that the people of this continent have made up their minds that, notwithstanding what may happen to the sugar industry, this black labour must be removed. That is the position in which we stand. If the honourable member who asks for further delay could make it clear to us that we were not interpreting the real feelings of the people of the country there would be something in his proposal. But he does not touch that point at a l l ; nor do any of those who speak through the intermediary of the telegrams and reports which have been read. All that they say is that unless black labour is continued the industry must go down. We contend that the verdict of the people of the country is that if that is the price to be paid for the removal of black labour from the continent, great and serious as it may be, the price undoubtedly has to be paid. That is the verdict of the constituencies, and we are here to carry it out in the best and most prudent way possible. The honourable member for Richmond said that if we passed the duty on sugar proposed by the Government, Queensland would be very much better off than it is at present, even with the substitution of white for black labour. I think the honourable member succeeded in making it clear that there was a margin of this duty which could be safely struck off in committee. That is how the matter presented itself to my mind. When he referred to the additional sum of £600,000, which would accrue to the industry as the result of the duty, it struck me that that amount could be safely reduced when we got into committee. The honourable member must not shake his head, because he told the House very plainly that even with black labour banished from Queensland, and white labour substituted for it, the people interested in the sugar industry there would be in a very much better position than they are at the present time. I fail to see that we need to put them in any better position. Asi t is they are doing particularly well, if we have regard to the fact that the Colonial Sugar Company recently paid a 10 per cent, dividend.

So far as I am aware, I did not say one word as to the condition of the -Kanakas in Queensland in my speeoh of a few weeks ago. My remarks related to the moral effect of this traffic upon the Kanaka in his own home. That, I think, is the most serious -part of the question. Missionaries who go to these men tell us that the traffic demoralizes the homes of the Kanakas in their own islands. .It breakB up their family life. It causes them to become nomadic in their habits. It creates the-greatest possible feuds and jealousies on the islands, -which lead^ often to conflict and death. We ore told', too that in some instances -disease has decimated .the villages, and that this disease is the result of the traffic in the North of Queensland. "" It is the moral aspect of the question so far as it affects the Kanakas in their own homes that I refer to more -particularly, and -it seems to me to be a far more serious one than that relating to tbeir condition in -North Queensland, I do not -know what the position is in North Queenlond. I have heard that it is -bod, but in the consideration of tbe moral aspect of the question I rely upon that which is told me by the men who have seen the Kanaka in his own home, and who speak of the serious consequences which arise there as the result of this traffic. Until the honourable member is able to give us rebutting evidence concerning the -influence of the traffic upon the Kanaka in his own home life I shall continue to say that in.my judgment this is a most immoral traffic, which should be stopped at once in the interests of the Kanaka himself and in the interests of the integrity of the islands from whence he comes. learn that the depopulation of those islands is to be regarded as a light matter. To my mind it is .a very serious thing. We have .been told of the way in which many of -these islanders are kidnapped and ""brought -away from their own islands under every kind of pretence-by methods which are not honest and upright, That; again, I think is a 20 o 2 The honourable member's most serious aspect of the moral question it clear that we involved in this traffic. An industry which perforce has to depend upon the kidnapping Then we were treated by of these people napping of these islanders is a matter of ancient history. not. I am told that it goes on now just as from the point of view of it used to do. Any system which depends upon such a condition of affairs should not be tolerated by the Parliament of this country. I hope,.and I believe, that the resources of science, and the enterprise and energy and initiative of the people will be available to meet the condition of things which may be brought about by the displacement of the Kanaka in the sugar industry. I cannot believe that the £7,000,000 of money invested in it will be dropped quietly even if the Kanaka is dropped. I am of opinion that the sugar' growers of Queensland have too much pluck and enterprise to permit such a thing to happen. If we continue to allow this cheap labour, however, they will continue assuredly to take advantage of it . What does it meant According to Dr. Maxwell's own statement, the substitution of white for block labour represents only, at the most, a difference of 6 per oent. upon the capital invested. We ore told that a very small proportion of the sugar produced in Queensland is grown north of Mackay. Dr. Maxwell makes it clear that to the south of Mackay; and even so far as the districts around Mackay are concerned, there will be no difficulty even if the planters are confined to the employment of white labour. It is only to the north of Mackay that any difficulty will arise, and I do' not believe that the resources of science, ay applied to cane cutting, cane growing, and the tending of the cane, have reached their utmost point of development. It is notorious that the planters do not possess a machine which will cut or even trash their cane. The inventions relating to the sugarindustry are not nearly so forward as are I have yet to those which have to do with the reaping -and garnering of our grain crops. Suroly with all tliis field of invention open to them the taskof making up the difference of 6 per cent., represented by the substitution of white for black labour, should not be insuperable.

195,The Honourable Member And The Mr Joseph Cook,"I am told it iahim to go up to Queensland and cut sugar cano, he will go there just as readily as he travels to other parts of the world where the climatic conditions are as bad. Miners go to New Guinea, Klondike, and. other parts of tbe world in which there are extremes of climate. All that is required is that there shall be a sufficient inducement. It seems to me to be a pity that with a duty of £ 5 or £ 6 a ton on sugar there is not available for distribution among the labour employed in the industry in Queensland a sum sufficient to induce white workers to wend their steps thitherwards. It is clear that this traffic has to go regardless of what the consequences to Queensland may be. The only hope is that the displacements will be as few as possible, and that the difficulties will be got over speedily. we shall settle down to a condition of things in which this menace will be removed for ever, and we shall have what we are all striving for : a clear straight future before us with respect to the integrity of our raoe, and the industrial conditions under which we live. make a personal explanation in regard to one or two telegrams, bearing on my visit to North Queensland, whioh have been read 1 The first telegram to which. I wish to make reference is one from the Honourable Angus Gibson, a gentleman whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Bundaberg. I stated lost night that he had said that so far as he, as well as others in the district of Bundaberg were concerned, the Kanaka could be dispensed with, especially if an adequate duty was imposed upon sugar. I have hero Mr Gibson's remarks as reported by the commissioner of the Herald, who accompanied me on that occasion. The writer saysMr Gibson is an honoured member of the Queensland Legislative Council, and a man held iu high estimation by all who know him. Block labour suits him as well as his neighbour, but he is one of the few men of his class who view the future with equanimity, and he declines to admit that Bugar growing is wholly dependent upon the Kanaka. Mr Gibson went further than that. He assured us that, so far as Bundaberg was concerned, there could be no doubt about the matter. He said that in the northern districts there would be some difficulties at first, but if time were allowed, and compensation given in the way of a duty of a differential character, he believed the difficulties could be overcome. The same honourable gentleman has stated that I was only in Bundaberg for two hours. I reached Bundaberg at 8 o'clock in the evening, and I spent something like 21 hours there. that the. honourable member spent only two hours on the Bundaberg plantations Mr Young, assured me that if I had remained there for two months, I could not have witnessed more than I . did during my stay. They showed me the Kanaka at work, and at his meals. They told me of the conditions of the Kanaka's life ; of his religious services, and his mode of living. As I said last evening, I was assured by the Government officials, the planters, and mill Then managers at Cairns, on tbe Herbert River, at Bundaberg, and, in fact, wherever we called, that if we stayed there for six months we could not learn more in regard to this traffic. They gave us all the information on tlie subject that they could. The pamphlet which I hold in my hand has been quoted time after time in this House, and generally commended. Unless the information that we gained was of the fullest character, how could a pamphlet of this kind have been produced, containing as it does official documents and statements) I affirm that owing to the facilities offered to us by the Government, and by the sugar planters, we were enabled to gain, all the information that was necessary, and that we saw and heard quite enough to convince us that, looking at the question in its moral aspect, it was necessary to get rid of the Kanaka. The honourable member for Melbourne stated that I had made most damaging statements during this debate, and then he confessed that he had not heard my speech. Melbourne said that the honourable member had made the most definite statements. for Melbourne .said that he had not heard the whole of the honourable member's speech. hear the whole of it, because he stated that he did not hear the quotation I read from the Church Commonwealth newspaper, in which the opinions of Canon Pyke upon the moral aspect of the Kanaka question were given.

I will quote his wordsThe writer has lived in North Queensland many years, and has personally studied this question from its alphabet. He affirms deliberately that the Cairns incident is a reduction to the lowest common denominator of the facts concerning every sugar district in the State. The alien races come here from social and moral conditions essentially different from our own. Their customs, their instincts, their laws of thought and life have been developed under circumstances which cannot be compared with those existing here. They cannot understand us, nor readily adapt themselves to our ideas.

That is the opinion of a gentleman who hoa been resident in the district, and wbo has worked in all parts of it: He knows all about the mission to the Kanakas, and the lives the Kanakas lead; and surely his statement is worthy of at any rate as much consideration as that of the visiting bishop connected with the Brisbane episcopate. I con assure honourable members that I was speaking within the mark in every statement. I made with reference to the morality of the Kanaka, and his general environment and conditions of life'; and I am quite certain that if honourable members could visit Northern Queensland, they would bear out every statement. I have mode. bane) -It is not congenial to me to have to speak again on this Kanaka question after having addressed the House during the debate on the second reading of the Bill. AlthoughI made my remarks as brief as possible on that occasion, and omitted very important matters from my speech, I do not intend to introduce now anything that I then left out. The honourable member for Parramatta closed his speech by stating that the resources of science would doubtless in due time obviate the necessity for employing Kanakas, or any other form of black labour. The observation reminded me very much of the speech of the leader of the Opposition at Toowoomba. The righthonorablcgentleman said that as we had developed a certain breed of men in the different parts of Australia-upo n the plains and in the bush, in the scrubs and in the forests, and in the Saharas of the west, so should we in due time develop a breed of men who would bo fit to work in connection with the sugar industry in tropical Australia. I put these two statements in juxtaposition. about the statement of the leader of the Opposition, but the honourable momber is misquoting my statement. have no doubt about the resources of science. I believe that we shall be cutting cane by electricity and trashing by machinery, but we cannot wait for the growth of the special breed of Con the moral life of any community labourers whom it may take any time from fifteen to 40 years to produce in order to carry on the sugar industry. The honourable member for Richmond observed that he did not want to go into the future, but wished to cut off the Kanaka at onceto guillotine him. The honourable member reminded me of on old writer who was rather severe on both sexes when he said that man lived upon the future and woman upon the post. The honourable member for Richmond says that he does not want to look to the future, and if that old writer, to whom I refer, were alive, he would probably want to inquire into the sex of the honourable member. I now desire to say a few words that I omitted to say when I spoke on the previous occasion in connection with this Bill. I charge the men who wish to extinguish the Polynesian labour traffic and to put a stop to the employment of Kanakas in Queensland, and in other parts"" of Australia, with entirely ignoring the most important consideration in connection with this great question, and that is the large number of white people who will lose their employment and their bread and butter if the Kanaka goes. protest from those people ? I have no end of protests from them. I charge those honourable members who are trying to do away with the Kanaka with conspiring under the cloak of the parrot cry of a white Australia to attack capital, to destroy the credit of the great financial in stitutions of Queensland, and to obliterate all the results of the wholesome pluck and enterprise of Australians in the tropical parts of Queensland.

I unhesitatingly say that Kanaka labour should not be done away with within a shorter time than ten years from the present. accepted, an inquiry should be made by a Royal commission, whose time for bringing up a report should, as the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested, be limited. Let us have an inquiry made by honourable members, representing the southern Stales, who have shown such a want of knowledge upon this subject. Let us dispel the ignorance that is hanging not only over this Chamber, but over the public outside. I am now going to say something which is perfectly premeditated, and that is that if, as the result of such an inquiry as I have indicated, the commission recommend that the Kanaka should go within six months, I shall accept their decision and support it most cordially. If the commission come to that conclusion I shall stand by the result of their inquiry, and vote for the deportationof these Kanakas to their homes at once. It is, however, unworthy of the first House of this Commonwealth' Parliament that they should attack capital under the cover of the cry for a white Australia; that they, should cruelly throttle one ot the finest industries in Australia. For years .and years, as far back as the sixties, Queensland has been selling her land under the old 1868 Act, and under the Sugar and Coffeo Lands Act, and has been encouraging men to come from all parts of Australia and from ofchor parts o i the world, andto enter upon the occupation of sugar and coffee growing. Provision was made upon the statute book for facilities to enable these men to take up land; and to bring coolies down to work their plantations. There was no stint of coolies in the first instance, but the Kanaka was preferred afterwards because he was nearer So the matter has gone on. The Kanaka has never been regarded as a permanent institution, but he has been looked upon as necessary for the purpose, of carrying out all the lower classes of work, such as draining swamps, and that sort of thing, which, white men could not do. The honourable member for Maranoa, who hasreferred to his work in connection with railway construction in Northern Queensland, must know that we had a large percentage of white men stricken down by fever and other diseases in connection with the construction of the Rockhampton AVestern Railway. But if that proposition is not had to put on extra medical men. Tlie same thing occurred between Dalby and Roma. . The turning up of the soil in that locality in railway making does not conduce to the health of white men. same. They did; and died. to murder the Kanaka ? Kanaka is not murdered. It is the change of life which carries him off. The Kanaka dies at a higher rate in his own islands than he does upon the mainland. He is delighted to come to the continent, in order that he may acquire the habits of the white man, which he imitates very closely. There is not a Kanaka in Queensland who dresses less stylishly than.does the honourable member for Maranoa. The Kanaka would not accept a cast-off coat from the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Oxley, or myself. He buys his clothes direct from the shop He does not take one penny out of the country. Only tlie other day I noticed that one steamer leaving for China hod a couple of thousand sovereigns on board, whilst another took 12,000 sovereigns and a third 6,000. The Minister for Trade and Customs' was' eloquently persuasive a few days since in impressing on honourable members that it is a desirable thing to retain our money in the country.

Harrington, chairman of directors, saidIf with that boon they could only obtain from the Federal I'arliament a fair and reasonable settlement of the labour conditions for the sugar growers, the outlook generally should be good. I feel Shareholders must bear in mind that sugar machinery had always formed a large item in the business of this company. Some few months ago the Johnstone River Central Mill Company Limited accepted the tender of Walker's Limited for Why cannot we postpone this the supply and erection of their mill on the Johnstone, subject to the Amended Sugar Works Guarantee Act (passed by Queensland last session) meeting with the approval of the Home Government. The approval, as they were trade not merely dull, but aware, having been withheld, the contract could not be proceeded with, and therefore an expenditure of approximately £50,000 had been lost to the white workers of Queensland, to say nothing of the disappointment and money losses sustained by the cane farmers on the Johnstone River. He goes on to say that nobody ever dreamed that the Kanaka traffic would be disconIt was agreed concurrently tinued within a less period than ten years. The prospect of this Bill becoming law has led to the cancellation of other contracts. Quite £100,000 worth of white worker's Does labour has passed away like a mist before the rising sun. What does Dr. Maxwell say 1 It seems to me that his letter of Oth October has been denied a fair and generous consideration by some honourable members of this Chamber. I will read a portion of it . It is addressed to the Premier of Queensland. Dr. Maxwell saysSir,-I haA'e the honour to receive your letter of the 4th instant, requesting my views ""upon the Pacific Islanders Bill now before the Federal Parliament"" ; and further requesting me to "" furnish you with an unreserved opinion upon the great importance of the sugar industiy, and upon the probable effect of such a measure, if passed, upon the industry."" The text of the Bill was set forth in the official telegram recalling me measure, with its present provisions, if it is passed, I am persuaded it will paralyze the industry. The Prime Minister says that the policy of the Government is revenue with incidental protection, and no destruction of industries. What does Dr. Maxwell say ?I am persuaded that it will paralyze the industiy.

Dr. Maxtion of the cane-growers are depending upon the banks and other financial sources to aid them in producing and harvesting their crops, and in the permanent development of their farms. This aid will stop, and in many cases at once. I could have told honourable members that before I came back from Brisbane, four or five weeks ago. I found at Bundaberg and elsewhere that the financial nutrition to every one engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland has been frozen. Sugar is not grown soutli of Bundaberg to any extent. The honourable member for Richmond spoke of the cane plantations upon the New South Wales rivers. But one might just as well compare Gippsland with Wagga Wagga, or Hay or Deniliquin, as compare the southern districts of Queensland and northern New South Wales with Cairns or the Johnstone River. them as the same. classes them according to the rainfall, and the rainfall is very different in those places. In one district the rainfall was 6£ feet for the year, while in other places the rainfall is only 6£ inches. Dr. Maxwell continuedMy relations with the grower on the one hand, and with money institutions, who seek my opinions, cause me to be painfully well aware of the situation, and of what must happen, if given action is taken. A further effect will be that the industry must stop from want of labour to make and harvest future crops if the time provisions of the Bill are enforced. 1 never read that letter until this evening ; but my election campaign shows that I considered a period of time was necessary, and that I would be prepared to close the ports at the end of that time against blpck labour, just as heartily, enthusiastically, and loyally, as any honourable member. sugar industry then 1 time were given it would enable the sugar growers to look round, and perhaps to get that breed of white labourer to whom the leader of the Opposition has referred. The men who receive £ 2 10s. or £ 3 a, week on the Clarence River, do not work only eight hours a day. Anyone who has been an employer knows that contract labour means the exertion of muscle and brain to the uttermost. These men are up at daylight, and after a spell in the middle of the day work well further on in his report s a y s Putting the matter briefly, and assuming that it will be enacted that the Pacific Islander must go, then in those districts which may survive the abolition of such labour, ten years is the minimum of time within which it will be found possible to adjust the industry to the proposed new conditions, and provide labour for its continuance. I never met Dr. Maxwell until the other day, but here on the 5th October he writes words which really formed the text on which I fought the battle of my election. I never wanted to come into this Parliament, but I thought that the experience of a man who had been 39 years in the countiy would be valuable in many respects. I am a commercial man by training and instinct, and I say unhesitatingly that to move in the direction proposed, without further inquiry, would be destructive of the best interests of Queensland, and would be a blot upon the reputation of the Commonwealth for many a day. The honourable member for Wide Bay charged me with having the temerity to say that he represented only the diggers. Isi t possible that that honourable member can think that I did not know intimately that part of the countiy before he was born, or, at any rate, before he came to this country ? I wish the 1 labour party to understand that I represent labour at least as much as they do. Wage-earners sent me into this Parliament, and they were not the white men sparsely distributed over the coastal regions. Isi t not the fact that the bulk of the votes received by the honourable members for Maranoa and Kennedy were from wage earners in the west ? There is no more splendid type of men than the men in the west; but there are very few whites in the tropical jungles of the sugar districts on the east coast. The fight was fought on the old prejudices created when the squatters took blacks by the hundred, or certainly by the score, to the western districts to erect fences, shepherd sheep, and do work which the white men had hitherto done.

I believe in fighting the battle again, if it be a good, wholesome battle. I am sorry to find that it is necessary for me in the Commonwealth Parliament to defend men from the old country, Victoria, and New South Wales, who have put their millions into this industry, which it is proposed to destroy without giving breathing time. As was well said by a newspaper the other day -What are ten years, or twenty years, in the life of a nation 1 It is possible to kill a tree either quickly or slowly. If we desire to kill a tree slowly we girdle it-whic h is a little more expensive, than ring-barking. When a tree is ring-barked, it seems as though Nature had her revenge by causing a rapid undergrowth, which proves more expensive by far to remove than if the tree hod been girdled in the first instance. Under the process of girdling, a tree may take two or three years to die; but, in dying, it does not hurt its neighbour whioh is required to give shelter to cattle or sheep. I believe trees have much sympathy from each other, and that when one is injudiciously killed, the others die from the change of climate which is caused thereby. There are men in this Chamber who have no more sympathy with the labour, with the solvency and enterprise of those men and those dependent on them, than they have with the granite pillars which grace the entrance to this chamber. Why is it thatthero is such a dearth of knowledge 1 Why do men not cultivate a knowledge of commerce, of the laws of the money market, and the operations of banking, which is the blessing of the world ? I remember that when the tutor to the late Duke of Edinburgh wrote a book about money many years ago, I was startled by the statement that there is not enough money in the world to serve the exchange of Now York. And neither there is ; credit is more precious than gold. orable member is wandering from the subject. I want to show that gold is labour, and that every sovereign husbanded by the working man, when in the prime of. life, is so much labour saved. As to climate, I find that many well-bred horses taken from the Darling Downs die in the north of Queensland; and wil] it be said that that is a proper place for white men where good horses cannot live 1 live for ever. But 60 per cent, of the horses die within the first few months. anybody to be in. That is what the honourable member's argument means, if it means anything at all. It has been said that the incidence of the Tariff will benefit white sugar-growers; but here we read that the Bundaberg planters would not be able to do without Kanaka labour even with a bonus of 4s. per ton on cane. That is my reply on the question of bonuses. Then there was a meeting of the Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce. Mr l i . E -GHOOM -Ho w many were present at that meeting % If the honourable member fathers the resolution, he is responsible for it . will also read an extract from a speech by the late honoured father of the honourable member. As to the Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce, we read that they arrived at the following resolution:That in the opinion of this Chamber, it is undesirable to pass any legislation dealing with the question of Kanaka labour until the receipt of report from a Royal commission duly appointed by the Federal Legislature for the purpose of making an exhaustive inquiry into the subject. I have copies of similar resolutions passed, I think, by all the Chambers of Commerce in Queensland, but I shall not take up the time of the House by reading them. I . desire, however, to quote from an article published by the Brisbane Courier of 10th ultimo, in which it saysI t must not surprise the Southern States that there should be extravagant allusions to armed resistance.

If the honourable member means by that expression that the Government have knuckled down to the labour party, I should like to point out that, whenever a big question has arisen, the labour party have either been divided, or they have voted in a solid body against the Government. That does not look as if the Government had knuckled down in any way to. the labour party.

AVe know that there is no man in Australia who takes a greater pride in his native land than does the Prime Minister. house-tops, so to speak, that the black man must go. There can be no doubt about that. In proposing the policy which is now before Parliament, he is fulfilling only the pledges which he has made to the people from time to time. But the honourable and learned member for Brisbane goes further. He says that the leader of the Opposition told the people of Queensland that the solution of the trouble was that we should wait until we could breed a type of men capable of performing the arduous work, now discharged by the Kanaka. ber stone-Availing? Let us come to a division. me rightly, the leader of the Opposition is the only honourable member who has proclaimed himself to be in accord with the proposal made to-night by the honourable member for Oxley. I shall wait Avith interest the casting of his A-ote, for I believe that he told the people of Queensland that there must be some further inquiry before he could make up his mind. Consequently I can quite understand why he takes such an interest in this matter. honourable and learned member's vote.

Those of us who do The honourable not understand this question have to depend to a great extent upon Avhat Ave are told by honourable members Avho have had some experience of the industry, and by men who have read what has been written by the great authorities on this subject. I ha\'e read with a great deal of pleasure I have seen very the very able report presented to the Prime Minister by Dr. Maxwell. I haA'e read also some of the able articles written on this subject by men who are deeply interested in it, and some of those published by the newspapers, which"" take great care to ascertain what are the rights of the question. I have here a paragraph from the Brisbane Goivrier. I presume that very few honourable members Avould go so far as to say that the Courier would write of this question in any way other than what it believed to be true, and I confess that paragraphs such as these, as AA'ell as Dr. Maxwell's report, influence me in the A'ote I am about to give. The paraHe has proclaimed from the graph is as follows:No Government dare re-open the black labour question, even in the attempt to save a doomed industry. The present GoA'ernment are pledged to the hilt to haA'e no more to do Avith coloured labour, and political teigiA'ersation of so black a kind as would be implied in the adoption of the recommendation of a majority of the commission is not possible ; honour Avould not permit it, an all but unanimous people would not suffer it.

The honourable and learned member for Brisbane said that if the Kanakas were abolished the capitalists would be ruined and financial institutions would be broken down. AVe always hear that cry whenever a monopoly is being attacked, but very few men in this House will dare to resist the mandate of the people at the last election that the Kanaka must go. AAe are told that it is not the wish of 7 Queensland that the Kanaka should go. Probably the honourable and learned member for Brisbane knows better than I do what the public sentiment is in Queensland, but I cannot ignore the result of the election for Darling Downs, when Mr Bell, who had the ful l force of the Queensland Government behind him in opposition to the Bill now before us, was defeated by a large majority by the honourable member now sitting for that electorate. The only conclusion I can draw from this and other circumstances is that Queensland has spoken most emphatically on this question, and has declared that the Kanaka must go. But for the strong evidence I have in front of me, I should hesitate, after the terrible picshould be any further delay in artures painted'by thehonorablememberforOxley and tlie honourable member for Brisbane, to take any extreme course, because I recognise that, in great matters of this kind it is sometimes well to make haste slowly. On the other hand, this is not altogether a Queensland matter, but is one which affects men iu all the other States of Australia, and if there is one question upon which we should rise above provincial considerations, it is that of the purity of the race. These Kanakas are a menace to the people of Australia., and as it has been pretty clearly proved that the white man can do the plantation work, coloured labour should be dispensed with. The one consideration underlying the whole question is that of pounds, shillings, and pence. The white man will not work for the same wages as the black man, and as a consequence the white man has gone without work, and all the employment has been given to the black man. I have had a little experience with labourers, aud I have never seen a black man who could work better than a white man. All the white man requires is to be paid for his labour, and he can do anything, and it is all moonshine to say that we cannot cope with this plantation If we wait a year, labour question until a different type of man can be bred for tlie work. I think that very fair compensation will be afforded to the men who have invested their money in this industry, by the proposals of the Government in connection with the sugar duty. Honourable members would not so calmly have accepted the proposal to impose a high duty on sugar if it had not been for their desire to deal considerately with the sugar planters. AVe realize that some hardship must be inflicted upon the planters, and we are desirous of offering them fair'' and generous consideration, so as to soften the blow to them as far as possible. I feel that the hardships will only be temporary, and that the change now contemplated will not be attended with any of the dire results indicated by the honourable member for Brisbane. Erom what I have seen on the northern rivers, I feel sure that there is plenty of country there upon which sugar can be cultivated by means of white labour, and there is no necessity to despair as to the future of the sugar industiy. I am quite sure it will prosper and grow under the system of employing white labour, and I cannot see why there riving at a settlement of the question. The honourable member for Brisbane said that very few honourable members knew anything about this question, and, if that be true, I ask what would be the use of referring this matter to a select committee composed of honourable members who are uninformed. It is preferable to thresh the whole matter out in the House, so that we may have the benefit of the united wisdom of the representatives of the people here, and do our best in the interests of those who have their money invested in the industry, and at the same time meet the demand of the people for a white Australia. It has been stated that there is a strong feeling of bitterness in Queensland in connection with this matter, and that if Queensland had known what this Government were going to propose, they would not have joined the Federation. These statements and the talk about sending a delegation to the home Government are all moonshine. It is idle to say that the majority of the people in Queensland are in",71,Edwards The Y Would Get Of Legislation Of This Character The Govern
240,Mr R. Edwakds,AV e do not want a,72,Edwards The Y Would Get Of Legislation Of This Character The Govern
241,Mr Chapman,"favour of retaining the Kanaka, and it is also ridiculous to pretend that the home Government is in any better position to deal with the Kanaka question than is this Commonwealth Parliament. I have no hesitation as to the way in which I shall vote upon this subject. I listened with care and with pleasure to the speeches of the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane, but I would point out to them that they are fighting for a dying cause, for something whioh the people of Australia have said must go. The people may not have considered the cost, but it is for us to do that. Whatever the cost, however, the people have decided that the Kanaka must go. If we are to retain the sugar industry, it must be carried on by means of white labour. If it came to a question of having to decide between retaining the Kanaka and losing the sugar industry, I am quite sure that the large majority of the people would be in favour of sweeping the industry out of existence rather than of prolonging it by means of black labour. have waited until this stage of the debate before speaking, as I recognised that it would be only right to hear what the representatives of Queensland had to say before expressing any opinion. I must say that owing to lack of information on the whole subject of black labour I was almost inclined to vote for the motion of the honourable member for Oxley. ber may expect what he likes, but I will not do as some honourable members have done, and vote against ray stated convictions. thing we have done. cause it takes so much to make some people ashamed. When the honourable member makes a remark that is not called for, he must expect to be paid back in his own coin. For the information of honourable members-excludin g the honourable member for Maranoa, who possibly does not desire to be enlightenedI might say that I have all along had a strong objection to Kanaka labourinQueensland. Ihold the same opinion to-day-that this labour, apart from the question of black labour generally, ought to be abandoned, and as far as I am concerned, I should prefer to see it abandoned at a date even earlier than is provided for in the measure before us. I have had some opportunities of knowing the injury that is being done to the island populations by this traffic, and I hold that if we are decimating the islands, or hastening in any way the natural reduction of their populations, we are incurring a responsibility -which the profits that ma}' be made in any industry will not justify us in incurring. Under these circumstances, I have no doubt whatever as to how I should vote on the Kanaka question pure and simple, but there are considerations beyond that, as the representatives of Queensland have admitted. I think that the Government have not taken sufficient pains to lay before us information such as they ought to have obtained ; firstly, as to whether white men can carry on tropical agriculture ; secondly, whether, if they can, they will do it ; and thirdly, whether, if they can and will do it, they ought to be allowed to do it . The reason I raise the question as to whether white men ought to be allowed to do this work, is this: We know that the white men who have been engaged in plantation work in the Southern States of the American Union and in other hot parts of the world have deteriorated physically and mentally. Worki n the sugar plantations has produced people whom we do not wish to see produced in this continent. Whilst we naturally object to the reduction of the standard of our civilization by an intermixture with the coloured races, we have also reason to object strongly to the reduction of their physical standard by allowing them to perform work in tropical latitudes to which they may not be equal. If it can be shown that white men can do this work without deterioration, and that they are willing to do it, we shall have every reason for prohibiting the introduction of any class of coloured labour into our northern areas. But if it can be shown that white men are not able or willing to undertake this work, or that they should not be allowed to do it, the further question arises-is there good reason for not admitting any coloured labour at all on conditions of temporary employment and return, under the control of the Government? The Government being responsible for the interests of the whole of the continent, and for the future policy of the Commonwealth, and having been asked to take over a large area containingmany millions of acres of",72,Edwards The Y Would Get Of Legislation Of This Character The Govern

246,Mr Thomson,"No, perhaps not, betropical land, should have given firm and decided answers to these questions. Holding the views which I had previously expressed, I could well have voted against the motion, and have taken the more popular course without further troubling the House on desire to conceal my views in any way, and therefore I have taken this opportunity to place them before honourable members. If this had been the only opportunity for getting the question of coloured labour in the north definitely settled, and of conceding to the Queensland Government what it asks, namely, inquiry, I might have been inclined to vote with the honourable member for Oxley. This Bill provides for the cessation of a traffic which, under no conditions, if my opinion of the wrong done is correct, ought to be continued. I do not say that the wrong has been done in Queensland. I am quite willing to accept the assurance that tlie traffic is properly regulated there, but there is a wrong being done to the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands. We are affecting their lives, disturbing with their customs and habits, and giving them nothing steadj or permanent in return. r We are sending back to these islands disease which, in many cases, is decimating the population. No country, and especially no British country, which has set for itself a high standard in dealing with these semicivilized nations, has a right to continue that traffic for the mere purpose of gain. But, as I have already said, there may be, even though this measure passes, if Queensland desires it, an opportunity for ful l inquiry into the whole question. That is to say, a commission such as the honourable member for Oxley wishes, could ascertain whether, and in what way, our tropical agricultural areas may be used, and could do so in the light of all the views of our people, of their determination that there shall be no deterioration in our white population, of their desire to exclude any admixture, and to prevent the reduction of our white labourers to the level of the dark races. Such an inquiry could be made and a decision arrived at by this House when the report came before it . That can be done independently of the Kanaka question altogether. might take, it could be done. I should vote for such a proposal, but I shall vote against this motion for the reason that it is purely a Kanaka question, and I should not be justified in the light of my own knowledge in supporting a continuance of that traffic. External Affairs) I do not wish to say more than one or two words. I have not been able to discover that the necessity which the mover of this motion has put forward for further inquiry, really exists. My belief is that there is before this Parliament a more complete body of facts than has ever been before the Parliament of Queensland when it has been asked to deal with this, question. In addition to all that has been before that Parliament, a report has been obtained, since it legislated, from tlie expert employed by the Government of that State,. .Dr. Maxwella man of very great ability and research. He has also made a report at our special instance, and with the leave of tlie Government in whose employ he is. Opinions will, and must, differ on such a subject as this. I have formed my own opinion, with the natural balance, interfering an anxious desire to be just and fair. I give those who differ from me credit for the same desire, and for the same anxious eagerness not to do anythingthat is wrong for want of the necessary knowledge. I have tried to make myself possessed of that necessary knowledge. It is utterly untrue, as suggested in a section of the press, that at the recent Premiers' Conference I professed to know all that was to be known upon the subject. All that I said at any stage of the proceedings was that there was a large body of information before this Parliament, and a larger body than, was ever before any other Parliament that had to deal with the question. I was never so presumptuous as to say that I possess any special knowledge on the subject. I cannot admit the claim that, before legislating upon great questions like this, it is an absolute necessity that every honourable member should visit the district or State concerned. If that were admitted, legislation would be impossible, and Parliament would become a mockery. That is not the spirit in which to approach this subject. It is not right to say that legislation should not take place until Parliament, in the personnel of its members, has visited every district concerned, or, on the other hand, to urge, where large bodies of facts have been",73,Edwards The Y Would Get Of Legislation Of This Character The Govern
