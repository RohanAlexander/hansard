No payment has yet been made to any of the States for property transferred by them to the Commonwealth Government, but eventually the Protector will be paid for in exactly the same way as the Custom-houses, post-offices, and other property taken over from the States. CASE OF CAPTAINSTRACHA N. Mr F. E. M c LEAN from the Prime Minister if, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, he has become aware of the circumstances connected with the alleged unlawful imprisonment, in November last, of a citizen of this Commonwealth named Captain John Strachan, who, I understand, is a justice of the peace in the State of New South Wales, and alleges that he was unlawfully imprisoned and his ship illegally seized by the authorities of the British North Borneo Company1 I also wish to know if the Government have made any representations about the case to the Imperial Government, with a view to having Captain Strachan's statement thoroughly investigated, so tliat the rights and liberties of Australian and British traders whose business may take them into the British North Borneo Company's territory may be properly protected ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON become aware that Captain Strachan, who has complained to the secretary to my Department, has a grievance against the authorities of the British North Borneo Company, and I have initiated correspondence with the Colonial-office on the subject. I cannot at this moment call to mind whether it is of a confidential nature, though I will ascertain between now and to-morrow. I may say that I lost no time in inquiring into the representations made, and I understand that since I did so the authorities of the British North Borneo Company have given to the Government of New South Wales an account of the occurrence which is very much at variance with that of Captain Strachan. Of course, I do not presume to say, at this moment, which is right. Sir EDMUNDBARTON intimate to the House that, at an early date, I shall, in Committee of Ways and Means, move a resolution, which, if .carried, will be followed by a Bill, to provide for the giving of a customs preference upon certain goods imported to Australia from the territory of Papua, or British New Guinea. This action, however, will be dependent upon the House making some progress with the Papua Bill. I wish to know asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Whether the Po3tmaster-General is aware that very grave discontent exists among the sorting staff' of the General Post-office, Sydney, in consequence of the men's payment for overtime having been stopped for extra work, once a week, on the arrival of the English mails. 2. Whether it is a fact that the sorting staff for the twenty years prior to Federation received payment for this extra duty. 3. Whether the Postmaster-General is aware that those employed on the sorting staff have to come on duty at eleven o'clock a.m. on English mail days instead of at the usual hour of three p.m., with the consequence that they have to bear the extra cost of obtaining their meals in town without any corresponding recompense from the Department. i . Whether it is not a fact that the members of the Brisbane General Post-office staff receive 10s. per month for similar work in sorting the English mails which arrive there. 5. If so, what is the reason for the favorable discrimination shown to the Brisbane staff ? the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The Postmaster-General is not aware that any grave discontent exists among the sorting staff of the General Post-office, Sydney. He is aware that payments for overtime, which were made up to the 31st December last, have been discontinued since that date pending a general decision in connection with the payments for overtime in the Postmaster-General's Department by the Public Service Commissioner, with whom all decisions as to overtime now rest. The whole question of the payment of overtime to these officers has for years been in an unsatisfactory state, some of the men being paid for the work while others were not, and an effort is now being made to bring about an equitable adjustment of the working hours, whereby every sorter will be paid for the overtime he works. 2. The Postmaster-General is not aware of the period prior to Federation during which overtime was paid for, but he has been informed that whatever payments wen made prior to Federation for extra duty were continued until the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth came into operation on the 1st January last. 3. The Postmaster-General is not aware of the I wish to exact hours at which the sorting staff have to come on duty, or that they have been at any disadvantage in connection with obtaining their meals.",12,Adelaide Tuesday I N The Legislative Coun

We are now asked, however, to make a very radical departure from that arrangement. We are asked to increase our annual contribution, aud. henceforth it is to be devoted, not to the maintenance of an Australian Auxil iary Squadron, bu t wholly to the maintenance of the British Squadron. This contemplates a very radical departure from the arrangement previously made with the old country, and therefore it requires very careful consideration. It has been recommended to us for several reasons, one being that we are not in a position at the present time to establish an efficient squadsirable that we should arrange for some protection by contributing towards the maintenance of a British squadron upon our coasts. We are further informed that by adopting this course we shall secure adequate protection at much less cost than would otherwise be involved. It has also been stated that it is not the amount of our contribution that appeals so strongly to the British naval authorities as the moral effect which the agreement would have by indicating the extent to which we are prepared to assist in maintaining the general interests of the Empire. It has been strongly urged also that the agreement would afford an indication of our loyalty, and that if we were imbued with proper affection for the Empire, we should have no hesitation in approving of it . We have I have been also been told that if we do hot see our way to approve of the agreement, a doubt may be cast upon our loyalty. So far as the financial aspect of the matter is concerned, I believe that the agreement has very much to recommend it, and that it would secure to us a considerable advantage at very small cost. I think, however, that we should be unwise if we confined our attention entirely to money considerations, and that we should fully consider the probable effect of the agreement upon Australia, and particularly upon our relationship with the mother country. The more closely I examine this question, and endeavour to weigh the future possibilities involved, the more am I led to the conclusion that there are elements of danger in the proposal of such a character that we should be wise not to commit ourselves to it . It has been asserted that our best means of defence will be land forces, and that naval defence need not enter into our consideration. I entirely dissent from that view, and upon this point I am at variance with the honourable member for Bland. We are in a position somewhat similar to that occupied by the mother country. We are an island continent, and' any attack directed at us must come from over-sea, and from one of the great powers. It would not be wise for us to wait until our enemy effects a landing within our territory before we assumed defensive operations. As soon as danger threatens us we should be prepared to meet it as far from",13,Overtime Postal Officials

20,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"During theour shores as possible, and make only the last stand upon our own territory. If I am correct in this assumption, it follows that we naval forces of that power in the eastern must adopt some means of naval defence. To this extent the Government are on solid ground, and it is with respect to the particular character of the provision to be made that I am in disagreement with them. So far as home defences are concerned, we should not create a large body of men specially assigned to the duty of defence. In other words, we should, not establish a large standing army under conditions similar to those in the old world, but we should properly equip our people with the necessary arms, and give them such training as would be compatible with their following their ordinary avocations. such facilities for training as would enable our citizens to be readily organized as defence forces. Having regard to the fact that the main part of our population is located on our coasts, we should provide efficient harbour ' defences. We should also arrange for the protection as far as possible of our large and increasing commerce. We may be subject to attack from an enemy, but only after a declaration of war with the old country. No power could specially single us out for attack without reckoning upon having to face the sea forces of tlie Empire as well as such opposition as might be offered by us. We have to consider that we are remote, from the Great Powers of the old world. It is true that we are near to China and Japan, and that the possibilities of trouble from those countries have been presented to us during this debate -; but from present indications the danger that threatens us from that quarter is not nearly so great, or so serious as that which may be apprehended from the more distant parts of the world. The dangers we have to contemplate from ' eastern countries are associated not so much with warfare as with those fevils against which we have endeavoured to provide by means of legislation to restrict immigration. A t present it is hardly likely that we shall have' to count upon any open aggression on the part of China or Japan. The latter country has been prompted by consideration for her own interests to enter into a friendly alliance with Great Britain, and, no doubt, this will continue for some time, and will relieve us of the likelihood of attack from that quarter. An attack might be made upon us by Bussia, and in such an event Great Britain might, be compelled to so concentrate her forces that she could deliver an effective attack upon the seas. Present indications point to the fact that the Admiralty authorities recognise this possibility, and are making preparations to meet it ; and I am not sure that they do not look upon the proposal which they have submitted to our Government under the agreement as one of the means to this end. In the next place, we have to consider the relationship which has been maintained between the Empire and Australia up to the present time. A t the outset we were completely under the tutelage of Great Britain1 Both our naval and our land forces were completely under the control of DowningWe should afford street, and even the civil service was managed from that centre. Our experience of that control was not favourable, and we do not wish to see it restored. Thanks to the great politicians who have controlled the destinies of these States in the past, the British authorities have gradually been induced to recognise the unwisdom of centralized control of that character, and have bestosved upon us the complete measure of self-government that we possess at the present time. They withdrew their military forces, and imposed upon us the obligation of providing for our internal military defence, and for the defence of our coast-line, at the same time giving us the benefit of the general protection which their fleet affords in maintaining the naval dominance of the Empire. The wisdom of that departure from old methods has been fully recognised by British politicians aud by naval defence experts. Some years ago, when the need for supplying us with some system of naval defence in addition to our harbour and internal defences, came prominently before these States, an agreement was entered into with the mother country under which an Australian Auxiliary Squadron was located within Australian waters. The squadron was not part and parcel of the British fleet. Its presence did not imply a reduction of that section of the British fleet which was stationed in Australian seas. It merely formed an addition to that squadron. The different States contributed to the cost of its maintenance in a certain ratio, and the agreement was terminable within a certain period upon a ""specified notice. That arrangement has continued in operation up t ill the present time. Now it is proposed to make a complete, and radical departure.?rom the relationship which has existed between the States and the mother country during the past 30 years. The new arrangement involves a complete change from the terms of the existing agreement in respect Of the Australian Squadron. asked to dispense with that and to substitute a section of the British fleet, pure and simple. tenance of that fleet, the Australian people are asked to contribute during the next ten years the sum of £2,000,000. my mind that proposal involves such a radical departure from the understanding which has hitherto existed, that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland is thoroughly justified. way in which the taxpayers of the Commonwealth can be afforded an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon this matter is by the adoption of his amendment, which simply means postponing the consideration of this agreement for a period of six months. Within tliat time a general election must take place. Irrespective of whether or not the Government see fit to dissolve this House, under the provisions of the Constitution an election must be held to fill the vacancies caused bj' the retirement of certain senators. That will afford an opportunity of securing an expression of public opinion upon the matter, and if the Government so desire they can ascertain the will of the people in this connection at a very little additional'cost by means of a referendum. If no general election were imminent, and if the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland necessitated willing into existence order to ascertain the popular will, there might be some objection to the course which he proposes. But in view of the facts as they exist, no reasonable grounds can be urged for any such objection. Government do not suggest that tlie present position is so critical, that war is so imminent, as to render it absolutely necessary in the interests of the Australian people and of like to remind those who entertain that the Empire that this agreement should be immediately ratified. If any such conditions exist, the Ministry should take us into their confidence and inform us of the facts. But so far as we are able to judge, the position is lio more acute or threatening now than it was some years ago. Indeed, the probability is that nothing in the nature of Mr Brown. a large European war ""will occur within our time. We can therefore view this matter from a peace stand-point. I do not think it is necessary to consider the extent to which the ratification of this agreement will our loyalty"" to the Empire. We have Auxiliary been told that the proposed subsidy is Under its provisions we are a nominal contribution, which is intended squadron, to have a moral effect. I am of opinion that neither the British Empire, nor the For the mainnations which may view it with feelings of enmity, require any such demonstration on our part. We have recently given expresTo sion to our loyalty and to the unity of the Empirei n connection with the SouthA f r i can war. Our action in that respect has had a moral effect upon the nations of the world, such as a mere monetary contribuThe only tion of £200,000, or even £2,000,000, to the Imperial Navy, could not possibly have had. It proved that our allegiance to Britain meant something more than could be expressed by any such contribution. It demonstrated that, we are prepared to give not only of our wealth for the purpose of maintaining the supremacy of the Empire, but of the best fighting material that we can produce. Our contribution to the success of British arms in South Africa cannot be questioned. Therefore, those nations which we are told will be influenced by this nominal subsidy have already received an intimation that within Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, Britain possesses fighting material of a character that money cannot purchase. The point was raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn; the other night in the course of his very thoughtful and learned address, that the new agreement was objecexpensive machinery in tionable upon the ground that itimposed taxation without giving us any representation. An endeavour has been made to minimize the effect of his suggestion by declaring that the proposed'subsidy does not come within Surely the that category, and that because in a Bill of this nature we approve of the agreement, the case could not be considered as one of taxation without representation. I should view that the corollary of the principle of taxation with representation is that the taxation levied should be under the control of those who authorize it , In other words, the people of Australia, who are called upon to contribute this money, should have a controlling voice in its expenditure. The proposed agreement, however, makes no provision for any such control. It simply binds us to provide a certain sum of money annually, and to place it at the disposal of the British Admiralty authorities, who are at liberty to spend it as they think fit. Probably they will expend it to the best possible advantage, but the fact remains that when once we commit ourselves to the agreement, we shall have to provide the subsidy without being able to exercise any control over its expenditure. Therefore I contend that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, was on substantial ground when he urged his pointed objection to the ratification of the agreement. Irrespective of how wisely the subsidy may be expended, if those who provide it can exercise no control over its disbursement, they have a just grievance. Consequently I think that instead of the contribution assisting to cement the ties which bind the Commonwealth to the motherland, it will probably prove a source of friction. It is because I am strongly disposed to view it in that light that I think it would be unwise to adopt it at the present time. There is another point which is worthy of consideration. We have to remember that the peoples of the old world have been engaged for some time in perfecting their means of defence, in improving the implements of destruction to be used in times of war, and that in this way they have incurred enormous expenditure. The expenditure is one that does not tend to develop the latent resources or the wealth of those countries. It can be regarded only as a means of insurance or protection against agression from outside forces, and it has to. be borne in times of peace as well as in times of war. Many of the nations of the old world consider that their security is not to be insured merely by means of a citizen soldiery, for they do not know when they may find it necessary to call out their forces against discontented sections of their own people. For this reason they feel it absolutely necessary for the maintenance of good government that they should .have means of defence dissociated as far as possible from the general life of the people. Those conditions, however, do not prevail here, nor are they imminent in Great Britain. These old-world communities are being called upon to bear a burden in the shape of military expenditure that is becoming almost intolerable, and it is apparent that it cannot continue at the present rate for any considerable length of time. On the other hand, whilst Great Britain has not allied herself with other nations so as to become almost part and parcel of them-whils t practically she stands alone-sh e has not until recently committed herself to anything like a corresponding expenditure. I fear, however, that the wise policy which Great Britain has adopted in refraining from overloading her people with an enormous expenditure of this kind is gradual]}' being departed from I am afraid that she is gradually falling into the general ruck, and adopting a system similar to that which is crushing the very life's blood out of many other nations of the old world. The leader of the Opposition has already placed this phase of the question very forcibly before the House; but I think it is of such importance that it is well worth repeating. In 1870 Great Britain's total expenditure upon naval defenceamounted to £9,500,000. A t that time the outlook was very much more unpromising than it is at present, and invited a greater expenditure in this direction than the present state of affairs in the old world appears to call for. In 1897, however, Great Britain's naval expenditure had increased to £22,000,000. Within recent years, and particularly during the dominance of the present Imperialistic Conservative Government, it has gone on increasing by leaps and bounds, and last year it reached the total of £35,000,000. Thus since 1870 Great Britain's expenditure on naval defence has increased by £25,500,000. The proposed expenditure on naval defence for the current year is £39,000,000, or a total increase of something like £29,500,000 since 1870. The same remarkable growth of expenditure is to be found in connection with the British Army. In 1S70 the expenditure on the army amounted to £14,500,000, but last year it totalled £35,000,000, showing an increase of £20,500,000, as compared with the outlay during the year 1870. The total expenditure on the army and navy in 1870 was £24,000,000, whilst in 1903 it amounted to £70,000,000, or an increase of £46,000,000. These figures show the way in which the various Governments of Great Britain, and particularly the present I m perialistic Conservative Government, have been drawn into an enormous military expenditure, similar to that of other nations of the old world in times of peace. Some of the leading minds in Great Britain consider that this is a retrograde step. are being imposed upon the productive communities of the mother land which are wholly unnecessary, and which are gradually becoming intolerable. Indeed, it is thought that if this expenditure goes on increasing at the present rate, it will ultimately reduce Great Britain to the position of other large powers in the old world, where a large expenditure on defence is entailed, not simply to resist aggression, but to maintain law and order. When this question was submitted to the Conference of Premiers in London, the Prime Minister of Australia, as well as the Premiers of New Zealand and Cape Colony, accepted the new Imperialistic views of the British Government, and decided to ask their respective Parliaments to agree to this contribution. Minister of Canada, however, refused to commit the people of that important dependency to a policy of this kind. I know that it has been alleged, during the course of this debate, that one reason for his action was the doubtful loyalty of a section of the people of the Dominion. But, apart from what has been stated during this debate, my reading does not lead me to suppose that there is any very considerable feeling of disloyalty in the Dominion. We have to remember that when Great Britain was in trouble in South Africa, Canada came to her assistance just as loyally and nobly as did the ultra-loyalists of Australia. ments of danger rather than of strength. that such a feeling exists in Canada. able member. I doubt very much whether there is any real ground for the suggestion. I believe that Great ""Britain has, in the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier, as true a friend as she has in the Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Edmund Barton. Sir Wilfred Laurier refused to enter into this compact because, in his own words, he objected to Canada"" being drawn into the vortex of militarism."" The leader of the Opposition has referred to the enormous expenditure which Great Britain has incurred on her military defences within the last few years, and that fact amply bears out the contention that the present British Government, supported by the conservative party in that country, are legislating in a direction that threatensto create in tlie motherland the condition of militarism that obtains upon the Continent. It indicates that Great Britain is gradually They hold that burdens drifting into the position which Sir Wilfred Laurier describes as the "" vortex of militarism."" I regret that the Prime Minister did not view this question from the standpoint adopted by the Prime Minister of Canada; and that we have now before usan invitation which, if accepted, may tend to draw us into that vortex. If it does, then it will be one of the elements tliat will weaken the bonds that bind us to Great Britain. Instead of being a means of consolidating and building up the great British Einpire, it will be one of the means of its disintegration and ultimate destruction. We have no voice in the management of theaffairs of Great Britain. We may very much question the wisdom of this largely increased expenditure on non productive The Prime agencies, but that is a matter for the sole consideration of the statesmen of Great Britain and the people of that land. But when it comes to a question of whether we should contribute to that enormous expenditure, it is for us to consider whether we should commit our people to it . I believe that those who oppose this proposal, who desire to take up the stand that was adopted by Sir Wilfred Laurier, instead of being the enemies of the Empire, as some would have our critics in the motherland to} believe, are really its true friends, inasmuch as they are endeavouring to resist a policy that has within it eleI believe that it would -be very much better if this money were spent upon an Auxiliary Australian Squadron. That would remove a great deal of the criticism which can be aimed at the proposed agreement, would maintain a much better understanding, and would minimize the friction which is bound to arise between Australia and the mother country. Once we admit that we are in duty bound to contribute to the naval defence of the Empire, and that our contribution must be at the disposal of the British Government to spend as they think. proper, the question will arise-What is a fair contribution for us to make ? No one would contend that £200,000 a year would be anything like a fair contribution under the circumstances. We have been told that it amounts to something like Is. per head of our population, whereas tlie contribution of the British taxpayers is something like",14,Barton
21,Mr Pisher,It is hardly fair to suggest,18,Barton
22,Mr Brown,"I agree with the honor17s. 6d. per head. There is a wide differ| ence between the two contributions, and, no doubt, efforts will be made in the future to lessen it . According to a letter which appears in to-day's Age, written by Senator Matheson, who has recently returned from. England, it is generally accepted there, as the result of some minutes or statements of the Minister for Defence, that our contribution should amount to something like £5,000,000 per annum. That feeling is one which will grow, and pressure will continually be brought to bear upon us to cause us to contribute proportionately with the English taxpayer. But such a contribution would impose a burden upon this community which would be detrimental to the development of our countiy, and a cause of untold friction in our relations with the. motherland. ' It is because the proposal presents itself to me in that light, and will, if agreed to, have the result of weakening rather than of strengthening the union between Australia and Great Britain; because it will have the effect of causing us to enter capital, the construction of a trans-continenupon large non-productive expenditure which is not warranted in time of peace, and will drag us into the vortex of old-world methods and conditions, that I oppose it . Our policy should be to increase the wealth of our own community, and to make the taxation of our people as light as possible, giving them at the same time' the best return possible for the revenue levied from them. The honourable and learned member for In d i made a very eloquent address last night in support of the agreement, and justified it upon the ground that within recent years a complete departure has been made by the nations of the world in regard to international conditions, as' the outcome of a great increase in their trade. He told us that these new developments were on the lines of what he termed a new Imperialism. It is not so long since I heard him speak of the advantages of a new protection, which we found to be not very different from the old protection. Similarly, I think the new Imperialism which he speaks of has something of the old leaven in it, and that upon examination it will be found to be. the old Imperialism over again. I do not wish for Imperialism of that description. TheI m perialism which I desire will keep the various parts of the British Empire together, while giving their scattered populations complete rights of self government, and the sole controlof their expenditure. The proposed agreement, however, takes from our people the control of their expenditure to, at least, the amount of £2,000,000. It contains a proposal which, to my mind, is the thin edge of the wedge, which, once inserted, will do a great deal of mischief. Therefore I shall oppose the ratification of the agreement, and support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, which has been moved to give an opportunity for the taxpayers of the country, who are so vitally concerned, since they have to find the money which is being voted, to express their views upon the matter. not occupy the attention of honourable members for more than a few minutes, as it is not my intention to make lengthy extracts from musty-volumes. When I remember the many important projects for the expenditure of the people's money-the establishment of a High Court and an Inter-State Commission, the foundation of a Eederal tal railway, and others-al l of which I view with considerable alarm, as increasing the future responsibilities of the Commonwealth, I regard the proposal now before the House as one which tends in the direction of economy, while, at the same time, it provides for the security and safety of our people. When Lord Salisbury was approached by one of the magnates of England to use his influence in the distribution of honors to some of his friends, he said, "" My dear sir, I doubt if there is sufficient skilly to go round."" In my humble opinion, there will not be sufficient financial skilly to carry out' all the ambitious Commonwealth projects which are now in the air. It does not seem to me.that the question of patriotism should be imported into this debate. The people of England are well aware of the patriotism of the people of these southern lands. They know that the sons of Australia will march shoulder to shoulder when the old country needs assistance from them, and our consciousness of our own loyalty should be -sufficient for us. I think the agreement should be treated merely, from the commercial and business point of view. In my opinion, it is a thoroughly business like and common-sense arrangement, and reflects great credit upon the administration of the day, and particularly upon the Prime Minister. A great deal has been said",18,Barton
23,Mr Hartnoll (Tasmania),"I shallabout the provision which allows the fleet to be removed from Australian waters, and some honourable members appear to think that under such an arrangement Australian interests would be insufficiently protected. To my mind, however, this clause of the arrangement is a very proper one.. The supremacy of England at the beginning of the nineteenth century was decided in the Bay of Trafalgar, not on the waters of the English Channel, and I sincerely hope that future naval engagements will take place, not in Port Phillip, or upon the Australian coast, but in the China seas, or in some distant part of the world. Sir the better for us if that happens. I hope that we shall never hear the guns fired. better for Australia if these .engagements take place at a distance from her coast, but I havo no doubt that when that time comes the supremacy of the old land will be maintained by her fleets as it has been maintained in times gone by. Honourable members are, perhaps, not aware of the extraordinary amount of secret information which is collected dav by day for,the information of the Admiralty. The movements of every armed vessel, whether it be Russian, Japanese, French, German, or of any other country, are known to the British Admiralty. Models are kept of every war vessel afloat, and these models are moved daily in accordance with information received, so that it can at any time be seen at a glance where the fleets of the world are situated. Seeing that the British authorities have this information at their command, there cannot be any doubt that, in the event of a collision between England and any European or Asiatic power, they should have' the control of the war vessels in these waters. Isi t not better that the First Lord of the Admiralty should have a voice in deciding where the various vessels shall be placed rather than that some one in Melbourne or Sydney should control the movements of the Australian Squadron? Viewing the matter all round, I regard the agreement entered into by .the Prime Minister in London as highly satisfactory, and I therefore have very much pleasure in giving it my hearty support. I believe that it will have the effect of strengthening the ties between the old country and the people of Australia. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -This question has been discussed at such great length, and so many authorities have been quoted on both sides, that I feel there is really nothing to be added. I shall therefore content myself with explaining as briefly as possible the principal reasons that have induced me to support the Bill. In the first place, one does not need to be a naval expert to know that a fleet-is essential to the defence of a country which is surrounded by sea, and which can be attacked only by a force from oversea. Therefore upon that question there is no difference of opinion. We are all agreed that a navy it appears to me that the real question at issue is narrowed down to whether we shall It will be infinitely now procure an Australian Navy or avail ourselves of the very favorable offer made by Great Britain under the proposed agreement. I cannot see that the two proposals are so antagonistic as some honourable members imagine. For my own part, I am strongly in favour of the establishment of an Australian Navy, and I look forward to that as the final. goal towards which we should Work. An Australian-owned. Navy would be more in keeping with the dignity and independence of Australia, and would be better calculated to inspire our young men with a love for the service of the sea. I think, moreover, that it would enable us to render more effective aid to the Empire in time of stress or danger than we could possibly render by means of a mere subsidy. But the question we are now considering is whether we should establish a navy at present. I .do not think tliat the time is very opportune for undertaking such a work. In the first place, we know that the Commonwealth has suffered from extremely hard times during the last few years. We have incurred losses through drought to the extent of many millions-to the value of many navies-and we know also that this is a time of very rapid changes in connection with naval construction and equipment. Ships that are considered suitable to-day may be utterly discarded ten years hence, and we must not forget that in recent years there has been no great naval engagement to test the quality of modern warships, and that the greatest uncertainty exists with regard to the effectiveness of naval armaments. It appears to me that the wisest thing we can possibly do-and I think we are very fortunate to",19,Barton
24,' Mr Hartnoll,"have the opportunity-is to enter into the proposed agreement. We shall thus provide for the defence of Australia for the next few years, during which time probably a great deal of light may be thrown upon naval questions that are at present shrouded in uncertainty. In France the object seems to be to construct a navy to fight not upon the surface, but under water. The changes now taking place are very radical and very rapid, and to construct a navy at great cost at present would be to enter upon an undertaking of very doubtful utility. We do not know how soon our ships might become obsolete. There is nothing in the agreement to prevent our commencing the construction of an Australian Navy during the currency of the agreement. Some honourable members seem to think that we should be binding ourselves for all time to an arrangement on the lines of this agree-, ment; but there is nothing to commit us beyond ten years. I should certainly have preferred an agreement for a shorter term, for, say, five or six years, because we should waters. For the reason I have stated, I shall then be able to commence the construction of an Australian Navy at an earlier date, if we found it desirable to do so. If , on the other hand, we preferred to wait a little longer, we should very probably have no difficulty in securing a renewal of the arrangement for a few years. I do not know whether the Prime Minister regards it as possible to shorten the term of the agreement. If that can be done, I should prefer it, because it would leave our hands free at an earlier date ; but whether that can take a part during the. recent war in South be done or not, I intend to support the Bill. A great deal of adverse criticism has been directed to the provision which enables the Australian Squadron to be sent into waters other than our own. It appears to me that that is a useful and prudent stipulation to -make. I have no fear that the authorities of the Admiralty would remove the Australian Squadron under circumstances which would expose Australia to danger. I am quite satisfied that they would pay due regard to our safety. If the squadron could be removed from Australian waters only with our consent, does any one who is acquainted with Australian sentiment imagine that our consent would be withheld if it were asked for? When we' found the mother country engaged in hostilities in China we did not hesitate to send our ships to her assistance; and I am perfectly sure that we should, if necessary, do the same again. We know that effective defence does not always consist in allowing an enemy to choose his own time and place of attack. It is sometimes very much more prudent for a defence forcewhether a land force or a naval force-to assume the aggressive, and to attack the enemy where a blow can be struck with the most effect. We must remember that the arrangement for the -removal of our squadron is a reciprocal one. If Australia were threatened with an invasion in great force, we should -have the China and East Indian squadrons sent down here to assist our defence vessals. Therefore I think the provision a wise one, which will not be availed of against the interests of Australia. We can trust the Imperial authorities to keep faith with us in that respect. I am sure that the squadron would be removed only when it was in the interests of the Empire, and of Australia as a portion of the Empire, that it should be sent to some place outside of. Australian support the Bill, expressing the hope that the Government will, if they consider it practicable, shorten the term of the agreement by some three or four years. honourable member must have listened with pleasure to the debate on this important question-importan t not alone because of the relation in which we stand to the Empire, of which we form a part, and in whose affairs we showed our readiness to Africa, but also from the point of view of the protection of our immediate interests in Australia. The. object of the Bill is to provide, not only for the protection of our shores, but also to enable us to prevent an enemy from destroying or preying upon our commerce. A great deal of our commerce passes towards China, and the East Indies, and if honourable members will look at the map, they will see that the China Sea is not very far distant from the northern part of Australia. Consequently, our commerce might be subject to attacks by cruisers within an area that would be beyond the scope of operations of a purely Australian squadron. I desire to specially refer to our real financial possibilities which have apparently escaped the attention of honourable members. We are very young as a Commonwealth, and yet some honourable 'members are ready to rush",20,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
25,Mr E. Solomon (Fremantle),"Everyinto all sorts of expense and to saddle us with a huge debt. A t present, the public debt of Australia is divided amongst the various States, but before long it may be necessary for the Conimonwealth, with the consent of the whole of the StatesI am sorry that that change cannot be brought about otherwise-to take over these debts. Coghlan, in The Seven Colonies of Australasia, 1901-2, says :No feature of Australasian finance is so astonishI t is generally realized that our naval deing as to the growth of the public indebtedness, and this fact has formed the gravamen of the many indictments which have been urged against the States during recent years. The debts have undoubtedly grown at a much more rapid pace than the population ; but as the States were in an entirely undeveloped state, wheu public borrowing first came into favour, the more rapid growth of their indebtedness, as compared with the population, was in a sense the corollary of tlie position taken up by the various Governmentsthat the State should reserve to itselE the construction of railways and similar undertakings which in other countries are prosecuted by private enterprise. Even with this explanation, however, the figures in ""the following statement are sufficiently striking:New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia... Western Australia Tasmania Commonwealth ... New Zealand Australasia The Queensland figures are exclusive of £1,079,750 for Savings Bank Inscribed Stock. The amounts for the year 1901-2 represent both funded and unfunded debt. In round figures the increase for the States of the Commonwealth, from 1861 to 1871, was 19 millions ; from 1871 to 1881, 36 millions; from 1881 to 1891, 89 millions; aud from 1891 to 1901-2, 60 millions ; or for the whole of Australasia, from 186.1 to 1871, 27 millions; from 187.1 to 1881, 57 millions ; from 1881 to 189.1, 98 millions ; and from 1891 to 1901-2, 75 millions. In the face of these facts, it is seriously suggested by opponents of this Bill that we should establish an Australian Navy. have been told that the annual cost of its maintenance would represent £500,000, and that the purchase of the necessary ships would involve an expenditure of £2,500,000. Surely, in the light of these facts, our first obligation is to make an earnest endeavour to place our finances upon a sound footing, especially as we are all aware that, so far, Federation exists only in its infancy, and that there is a great deal to do to place us Mr E. Solomon. on a firm footing. This necessity stares us in the face as a necessary corollary in the carrying out of works in accordance with the Constitution. I rose merely to express these views in order to justify my vote in favour of the Bill. think that any honourable member doubts that Australian sentiment is in favour of the establishment of an Australian Navy. fence, in common with our other lines of defence, should be eventually under Australian control But, at the present juncture, we are faced with a condition of things which renders it impossible for us to embark upon this undertaking, which I maintain would best relieve the Empire ©f the burden of defending the Commonwealth which undoubtedly attaches to it . I claim that we can best aid the taxpayer of Great Britain by adequately providing for our own defence. That that work can be immediately undertaken by the initiation of an Australian Navy is open to very serious question. 1901-2.

I believe that it is not only practicable, but that in the near future it will be necessary for Australia to relieve the Empire of the burden which at present it is called upon to bear, by establishing an efficient system of local defence, not only upon land, but also upon the sea. I have gone to some trouble to analyze the estimates which have been submitted regarding the cost of the maintenance of an Australian Navy, and, in my opinion, they are extravagant to a tremendous degree. In this connection we must always recollect that the whole of the coast We line of Australia-a t any rate at the present time-nee d not necessarily be defended. It is only the great centres which have to fear attack from a swift cruiser, or even from a letter-of-marque vessel, which require to be protected. * It is inconceivable that for the purpose of acquiring territory any of the European powers would endeavour to land upon Australian shores an army sufficient to conquer this country. What we have to",21,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
26,Mr Salmon (Laanecoorie),"I do notfear is the destruction of our shipping, and a descent upon our centres of population, which, unfortunately for Australia, are situated on our coast. In order to defend these we must have an efficient land force, proper fortresses, and also a first line tering inventive genius. We have in the of defence in the shape of a naval force. The last named can be obtained only by assenting to the agreement which we are now asked to accept. It has been said by one honourable member that no defence policy has been initiated by the Commonwealth. But I would point out that a defence policy was brought forward. It was purely a military policy, and in my opinion was also purely an Imperial policy. It was formulated by the General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth forces. It was not a policy which recommended itself to the people of Australia, and I feel sure that if it were again brought forward it would not commend itself to the good sense of this House. In my judgment the time will, not arrive for the establishment of a complete Australian Navy until we can provide all the necessary munitions of war build our own ships. If we bestow proper attention upon the development of the natural resources of our country, and utilize the enormous iron deposits which are at our command and only await development, the time is not far distant when we shall be able to accomplish what so many honourable members desire. By assisting Our iron and steel industries we shall become self-contained in this regard ber think that the present policy of the Government tends in that direction? must have completely misunderstood the. trend of my remarks. announced that I hope to see an Australian Navy established. I believe that the. recognition of initial difficulties will undoubtedly pave the way to an adequate protection of our coasts by our own ships, manned by our own men, and all the necessary material in which will have been manufactured by ourselves. It has been proved by one example that we are not behind the rest of the world in inventive genius, and it must be admitted that development in naval warfare is very largely in the direcopportunities for drill and instruction in tion of invention. The Power which can command the greatest inventive genius will in the future undoubtedly control tlie seas. Those countries which bend their energies in the direction of securing the safety of their commerce upon the great ocean highways, will most rapidly attain their object by fosBrennan torpedo, which was invented in Australia by an Australian, an earnest that the Commouwealth will probably be able to keep pace with other parts of the world in this respect. The arguments which have been used regarding the value of the services rendered for the proposed subsidy ought never to have been introduced into this debate. We cannot for a moment take up the position that we are obtaining from the Imperial Government f u l l value for the money that we are asked to pay. I hold that the services rendered cannot be measured by a money value. It has been estimated by some experts that an annual contribution of £200,000 would provide us with an adequate protection. But seeing that the proposed scheme is a part of the Imperial defence policy, we cannot take Australia, which forms one within our own borders, and factor, out of the sum, and expect to arrive at a correct result. ""Under other conditions-if we were undertaking the protection of our coasts and of our commercewe should be able to arrive at an accurate estimate of the expenditure that would be involved. But I would point out that the proposed subsidy of £200,000 will secure for us so many advantages that we cannot possibly gauge the f u l l value that we receive. I sincerely trust that the Government will take immediate steps to lay the foundations of an Australian Navy. We can begin, for example, to train our men in naval tactics. Those honourable members who have had opportunities of seeing Australians afloat, who have been on I have already board one of our floating batteries, and have witnessed the way in which our men, as the result of only a few hours' training in twelve months, fall into their places, perform the complicated work of manoeuvring a vessel, and fire at floating and moving targets, must admit that they possess all the characteristics of the British race-characteristic s which have proved such a potent factor in establishing its naval supremacy. We should therefore demand that these men shall be afforded the working of vessels, and in using the guns which are mounted upon them. We",22,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
27,Mr Fowler,Does the honourable mem,23,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
28,Mr Salmon,"The honourable membercan best assist the Einpire by preparing to take upon ourselves a portion of the burden of our own defence. I recognise that a burden would still rest upon the Empire in respect of the Commonwealth, because we have only to imagine the possibility of an invasion of Australia,' to realize that British would immediately come to our assistance if that course, were considered to be necessary. It would not be considered to be part of our duty to make any monetary for such a service. Great Britain, recognising as she does that the strength of the whole Empire depends upon the integrity of each individual atom of it-that w e must preT serve this country for the British racewould readily expend the last sovereign that she possessed, in order to prevent us from being torn from her against our will. In these circumstances we have nothing to fear, and I say that there will always be placed upon the shoulders of the British taxpayer a burden of which he does not desire us to relieve him. I very much regret that the question of loyalty has been introduced into this debate.. I do not believe thatitredoundstothecredit that he should be so particularly careful to express his loyalty on every possible occasion. My own opinion is tliat the loyalty of the Australian is deep down in his heart, although not so far down that it cannot make itself evident at the very moment that it is required. I think that if these protests of loyalty, which are so frequently made, are not in bad taste, they, at any rate, are calculated to give some cause for suspicion, and"" to give, perhaps, some colour to the statement that we are not so sound on this question as we would have the other portions of the Empire to believe. opinion there is absolutely no anti-British feeling in Australia, and those friends of the British Empire who are striving by their writings and' speeches to show their intense loyalty, are not doing good service to the cause of the Empire by the frequency with which they resort to this practice. The bonds which bind us should be invisible ones. thing in the nature of chains which clank every time that we move. We desire rather that they should be as silken threads which readily accommodate themselves to every movement, and which at the same time are strong enough to bear any strain that may be placed upon them. honourable member for Canobolas said that Mr Salmon. this agreement would be a cause of friction and weakness. I believe that the friction which would arise, and the weakness which might ensue from it, would result rather from the method of dealing with the agreement than from the arrangement itself. If forces we were to approach this matter from the true Australian stand-point, recognising that closely interwoven with it are interests which are great British interests, we payment should be able to consider it with very much less friction, and, indeed, with added strength. I do not wish to detain the House, but as I am strongly of opinion that it is necessary for Australia, as an integral portion of the Empire, to take her own part and her own share in its defence, I felt that I should not give my vote for this agreement without advancing my reasons for doing so, and without expressing the hope that this will not be looked upon as being in any way the final settlement of the naval defence policy of Australia. I ' trust that we shall have, within the near future, evidence of a desire on the part of the Government to carry out what I believe is of the Australian the true desire of the Australian people--the efficient arming of the people of the Commonwealth, both on sea and on land, against a possible invader. worth) I think that in all these matters of Imperial and almost international concernwith which this Commonwealth Parliament has to deal, the utmost latitude should be given to legitimate debate. These debates will probably hereafter furnish the historian with a great deal of information in relation to the evolutionary processes through which we must move towards our In my destiny of the future. A t the same time. I feel that, as we have entered upon the third week of this debate, and in view of the fact that many able speeches have been delivered, it would be well for me to make my remarks as brief as possible. I propose simply to deal with one or two salient points which seem to me to be at the base of the whole question, and, probably, They should not be anyin doing so I shall inadvertently repeat views that have already been better expressed. I must confess at the outset that I find it very difficult to place myself in the mental attitude of those who are opposed to this proposal. I should like to ask, in the first place, whether we can afford The a navy. The absolute answer to that question is that we Cannot. It is all very well",23,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
29,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"for those honourable members who do not analyze the public accounts of Australia, and for those who say that we can make good any deficiency by resorting to land and income taxes, to talk about an Australian Navy. But those who understand our finances, who know where our enormous Customs revenue goes, who remember the interest that we have to pay upon our debt, and who recognise that we have a vast expenditure extending over a large territory, with only a comparatively small population, must know that, at this early stage of our development, it would be madness to think of creating anything like a navy sufficient to guard the 8,000 miles of Australian coast. Let us look at this matter in a common sense way. I do not intend to deal with the question of our relations with the mother country. But what position are we in at the present time ? As the honourable member for Fremantle has so wisely inferred, in bringing about the federation of Australia we have practically completed an enormous national task. We have an enormous expenditure to face, and we are passing through difficulties of a local character which must confront us for years to come. But here is a proposal-no t a proposal that has been forced upon us, but one that is the result of a council, in which each party was absolutely free-to bridge over, at any rate, the intervening period. Why should we object to have this bridge? Some honourable members imagine that the acceptance of this agreement would be practically to put chains upon our every action in the future. Is there anything in it, however, to show that we are proposing to enter into a hard-and-fast arrangement for all time to come ? What are the two chief points of the agreement? In the first place, it is an arrangement to extend over a period of only ten years. Within eight years we shall be able to review the whole position ; and we shall have absolute freedom of action in regard to our future course. Then again, let us look at the details of this agreement. If the Admiralty intended to allow no local atmosphere to surround our forces, to give us no opportunity of training our own men upon special ships, if they said to us"" For good or for ill you will have no word to say ; you must simply carry out this agreement, and look upon the ships to be provided under it as a branch of the Royal Navy, without any regard to your local sympathies,"" we might perhaps be justified in saying"" This proposal is enveloped in suspicion."" But the British Admiralty do not wish to create a system in these waters which would obstruct the formation of an independent Australian Navy. The very opposite is the fact. If I were in tlie position of those honourable members who desire to see an Australian NavyI should not be able to conceive of a more convenient*bridge than this to carry us towards the creation of a future Australian Navy. What will be the position at the end of the ten years' period? During the currency of this agreement we shall have three ships manned entirely by Australian seamen. We shall have every opportunity to train Australian seamen. We shall have a generous arrangement by which, if we choose, men who are specially paid and employed on certain terras of service, will be enabled the moment that the ten years' period elapses to become part and parcel of an Australian Navy. What could be more generous? What could be more above suspicion? Could there be an easier way of moving forward in our present financial position than by the acceptance of this agreement ? The leader of the Opposition struck the only weak point in the armour of the agreement when he pointed out that under the existing arrangement, the British Government guaranteed that the strength of the British fleet in these waters apart from the vessels of the Auxiliary Squadron -shoul d not be decreased. I do not place much weight upon that fact. I believe that the Admiralty will be just as anxious as we could possibly be to strengthen thenposition in Australian waters. Sydney, with its harbour, with its means of repairing ships of war, and with its coal, occupies such a magnificent position, that, in the nature of things, the Admiralty must keep a large number of these vessels in that centre. A t that point the vessels of the squadron will be within three weeks of the China sea, and I think that, considering the past and we can only -reason from our experiences of the past -the Admiralty may be trusted in this matter. If we were going to pay an enormous subsidy or anything equal in proportion to the cost of this squadron, we might talk to the Admiralty about the retention of a certain number of vessels on this station. But in view of the fact that they propose to double the present strength of the fleet in these waters, and that the conmatter. It is-nonsense to speak of the printribution of £200,000 per annum will not represent 1 percent, of the annual expenditure on the British Navy, I think that during this period in our early Commonwealth life, at all events, it would be preposterous for us to dictate to the Imperial authorities. Surely, in view of the fact that Great Britain has allowed us the fullest local autonomny, Sind has given -us this Commonwealth with a freedom and generosity unknown in the history of the colonial policy of other Empires, we can be in a trustful mood ? There has been nothing to create suspicion in any act of the British Govern-, ment towards this country. Laissez /aire is the phrase which practically describes what has been the attitude of the Ministry and Parliament of Great Britain towards this country during the last 50 years. Every sensible man invariably judges of the future by the experience of the past. If any honourable member could give us an instance of anything in the nature of a tyrannical action, or of anything like suspicion on the part of the British Government with regard to us, then he might perhaps be fearful of the present proposal. But we are asked to enter into a partnership. I hold that the one point upon which the union of this Empire must depend is that of defence. agreement constitutes a partnership. essentially a partnership, inasmuch as, so more. I have read several of the speeches far as the conditions allow, we are to which have been delivered by honourable receive every consideration in regard to members, and it seems to me that the the presence of these vessels in our own question has been thrashed out very effecwaters. cept that of control. two masters. childish to talk about control in the present our position in regard to the foundation of state of affairs. If we could furnish a navy the Commonwealth, we should recollect that which would efficiently defend the coasts of the process of evolution in connection with Australia, and would be sufficiently strong. our relations with the British Empire to co-operate with the navy of Englandi n should be very slow, aud I consider other parts of the world, we should, of that this period of ten years will be of great course, expect to be given some kind of conadvantage to us in giving us leisure to control in regard to it . But this is not a case sider the whole question of exterior lines of of that kind. This is a case in which, as a defence. I do not,' of course, intend to common-sense, business arrangement, we commit myself at the present time as to the practically give to the other partners in the advisability of establishing an Australian concern the complete control of the whole Navy, but I strongly hold the opinion that ciples of the British Constitution in this connection. British people are not such fools as to carry logic to an absurdity in dealing with practical questions of this kind. This is a case to be dealt with by special means. We are getting a bargain which the most quick-witted Yankee would say is the best in the world. This is not an occasion to argue upon either our relations to the Empire or the advisability of establishing an Australian Navy. Those matters can take care of themselves for the present: we have as practical men another subject for our immediate consideration. An objection has been raised to the proposal on the ground that the British authorities will have power to remove the fleet from Australian waters, but, if there is anything in the Blue Book which has been placed in our hands with which every British subject can agree, it is the statement that when we go to war our navy cannot act on the defensive. When we go to war it will be the business of our ships to seek out and destroy the enemy's vessels. fence could there be than that ? As wiis said a short time ago, if we can fight the battles of the Empire in the China seas, and crush the enemy at three week's steambetter than having the guns firing at our It is very doors. I do not intend to say much tively.

In naval matters, above all others, there must be one governing authority. It may be that Australia, in view of the erratic movements of war-ships in times of trouble, may desire' to establish a naval force of quick gun-boats to act as scouts, and to patrol its coasts. of such a force will not affect the worldwide defence of British commerce. If the security of Australian commerce may be obtained by a battle off Newfoundland, the confinement of the war vessels of the Empire to particular waters in times of war would be incompatible with the best lines of defence. I give my unqualified approval to the proposed agreement. I believe that the British Government have acted most generously and magnanimously to us in regard to it . The agreement is to last for only ten years, and in that period, after other serious Commonwealth business has been transacted, we shall have time to fully consider the question of external defence. When we do so, the relations of Australia to the Empire, and man) questions connected 7 with trade, commerce, and defence generally, will have to be discussed, but public opinion on the subject will have been enlightened by the fructification of the discussions which are now taking place here and elsewhere, and we shall thus be better able to deal with the great questions connected with our destiny as an integral part of the Empire. I hope, however, that we shall never lose the protection of the British Navy, and tlie right to call ourselves British citizens. Mr V. L . SOLOMON (South Australia.) -Afte r the longdiscussionupon this subject, I feel almost ashamed to ask honourable members ro listen to the few remarks which I have to make upon it ; but the question is of so much importance to Australia that I do not wish to give a silent vote. The matter involves, to some extent, our financial position, but, to a greater extent, our relations with the mother country. I intend to give my cordial support to the agreement. I feel that it is not a question into the coninformation as to what is occurring in other sideration of which party politics should be introduced, because it is of far too great moment to thedestinies of Australia. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, who gave us a very well-considered address upon the subject, expressing his views in regard to it very tersely, said that our naval defence fell under three heads-ou r coastal defence, our harbour defence, and. the defence of our commerce upon the seas. In my opinion, he dealt with the question more practically than any other honourable member has done. I listened to his speech with a great deal of pleasure, and I feel tliat he placed before the House, in perhaps a better way than I could have done, what are also But the establishment my ideas upon the subject. To object that the squadron to which we are to contribute £200,000 a year is to be liable to be called away from Australian waters at any moment may be a very good argument for those who oppose the ratification of the agreement, but 1 should like to put it again to honourable members that the supremacy of Great Britain upon the oceans of the world so closely affects our interests tliat, whether the squadron were under the control of tlie Admiralty or under our own control, the position would be the same. If it were under our own control, we should be only too ready in time of need to send it to the assistance of the mother country in other parts of the world. There were one or two points in the speech of the honourable and learned member for Corinella which struck me as particularly worthy of consideration. The honourable gentleman referred to our need for harbour defence, and I should like, therefore, to take advantage of this occasion to draw attention to the defenceless position of Port Darwin and Roebuck Bay, where the cables connecting us with other parts of the world land. In recent times, Thursday Island and Albany have been placed in the category of portswhich must be defended, not at the cost of the States to which they belong, but at the cost of the Commonwealth. But while those places are now well fortified, the two places to which I have referred remain two of the most vulnerable points in Australia. ber should also include Fremantle. MrV . L . SOLOMON I am sure that the Minister for Defence will agree with me that all these vulnerable points should be defended. We have to depend for our parts of the world, and as to the movements of the navies of foreign powers, upon the cables which are landed at Port Darwin and Roebuck Bay.",26,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
37,Sir John Eorrust,"The honourable memThere is also the Pacific cable. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Not only are the landing places of our cables at the mercy of foreign cruisers, but detachments from -such vessels could easily be landed to cut our telegraph lines. This is a matter which should receive the fullest consideration when the defence of our coast line is under discussion. I do not wish to go beyond the limits of the question before the House, but I think that this matter is sufficiently important to justify me in directing attention to it . The financial position of Australia is such that we can scarcely consider the question of establishing a navy of our own, and I think we should do much better at present to enter into an agreement such as that proposed. I cannot join forces with those who are willing to hamper our finances by incurring the enormous liability that would be involved in the creation of a navy, and therefore I intend to support the Bill. Mr P. E. M c LEAN (Lang) I quite agree with honourable members who have recently spoken that the debate has now been prolonged to such an extent that any lengthy speeches at this stage would be quite unjustifiable. A t the same time. I should like to say a few words in justification of the vote I intend to give in support of the measure. In the first place, the proposed agreement appears to me to come under our consideration in the natural order of events. It was only to be expected that the inauguration of the Commonwealth would lead to a reconsideration of the existing agreement with regard to the maintenance of an Imperial Squadron -in Australian waters, and that some further provision would be made for the defence of Australia by means of a naval force. The proposal was not sprung upon us, nor is it extraordinary in character. If the professions of Australians in regard to their loyalty to the Empire mean anything, they should convey that we are prepared to contribute liberally towards the support of the defences which are necessary to our very existence. We have already enjoyed the advantages of a very satisfactory arrangement with the mother country, so far as expense is concerned, but it appears to me that control which is to be exercised over the the proposed new agreement can also be defended upon the grounds of public economy. However we may feel with regard to the necessity of ultimately establishing an COOK -Not exclusively. Australian Navy, we must admit that at present we are utterly unable to seriously entertain such an idea. The initial expense of such a huge undertaking removes it from the range of practical consideration at present. Therefore, we are bound to make some temporary arrangement which will enable us to tide over a reasonable period, during which we can gain experience and strengthen our finances. A great deal has been said about starting with what has been called the nucleus of an Australian Navy, as if, forsooth, some two or three small ships of war, which would be utterly .useless in the event of an attempted invasion, could form the nucleus of our future navy. To my mind, not only would such a so-called nucleus .be absolutely useless, but it would be degrading to the very lowest degree for us to enter upon such a policy. The true nucleus of an Australian Navy will be found in the training of Australia's sons for naval duty, and the proposed agreement makes very wide provision forsuch a training, so that Our youths may be capable of manning our own ships of war when we are strong enough to incur the necessary expense. The arrangement proposed is very satisfactory from a business stand-point, and it contains nothing that would prevent us at any future time even at an early date-fro m considering what may be necessary in the way of coastal defences. If we are financially strong enough to incur the expense of purchasing coastal defence vessels for ourselves, there is absolutely nothing in the agreement to prevent us from entering upon such a project. If , however, we undertook any such work at present, we should force upon the people of Australia a policy for which, apart altogether from the question of expense, they are not ready. We have made no preparations, and we have had no time to think out any naval policy, and while we are preparing and are training our men for the work to be done in the future, we must enter into a temporary arrangement. The scheme set forth in the proposed agreement is the best that could possibly be suggested at this stage. I do not see any force in the argument used against the Bill on account of the Imperial movements of the squadron. It has always appeared to me that in majtters of defence we must stand or fall with the Empire. England's wars must be our wars, and her",27,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
38,Mr Joseph,"troubles must be our troubles, just as her glories are our glories. Our connection with the Empire may involve us in danger or difficulty at any time, and our interests are one with those of the mother country in those respects. Therefore the control of the ships of war that are large enough to be capable of doing service in waters beyond our own must be in the hands of the Imperial naval authorities. This provision does not in any way affect our right to defend our own coasts, and there is no reason why we should not in the near future take into serious consideration the desirableness of establishing,-! small we are perfectly familial"". They are, as has navy of our own. I believe that it is our duty to defend ourselves, and to contribute to some extent towards the defence of the Empire. It is not reasonable to expect the Imperial Government to defend Australian interests for all time without any contribution from us. ""We have been contributing upon a meagre scale for some years past towards, the maintenance of an Australian Squadron, and it is now proposed to increase that contributionI will not say to a reasonable extent-bu t to a proportion that is commensurate with our financial ability at the moment. In view of the provisions of the Constitution which limit our financial powers, we are not in a position to incur any serious expense in connection with naval defence at the present time ; but what we are able to do we are bound to do, and therefore I most heartily support the Bill. Sir EDMUNDBART ON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I am glad that the time has now ' arrived at which I can make a few remarks and bring this debate to a close. In occupying honourable members' attention for a short period, I hope that I shall not be guilty of any of that repetition which became so necessary when I was endeavouring to thoroughly explain the nature of the agreement submitted for the approval of the House. I shall deal with some of the principle objections to the provisions of that agreement, and particularly with those which appear to have been put forward as fundamental objections. It has been urged that this agreement will have the effect, for instance, of tying the hands of Parliament, and of fettering the actions of this Commonwealth for ten yearsindeed that argument has been pressed again and again, even to the extent of the assertion that this is an instance of taxation without representation. I think, with all respect to those honourable memberswho have used this argument, that nothing could be further from the fact, if one looks at the matter in that reasonable manner in which we are expected to view political principles and their effects. This agreement no more contemplates tying the hands of Parliament, or imposing taxation without representation, than would an agreement for the payment of a subsidy to a cable company, or to a steamship company for the maintenance of a mail service, for a period of ten years. W it h agreements of this nature been remarked, our own voluntary acts, and it is not to be supposed for one moment that the parliaments which have been responsible for them, intended to impose taxation without representation. If an attempt be made to show that such agreements involve taxation without representation, then it is tantamount to arguing that these free communities have been for the last 50 years engaged in bartering away their birth right. Is not the major portion of the objection which has been raised to the proposed new agreement due almost wholly to . that alarm which new departuresand this is a new departure to some extent create, arousing, as they do, those conservative instincts which are latent in nearly all of us. I have known minutes . and State papers to be written from time to time by the ""most liberal and democratic of Ministers who have regarded new proposals as dangerous innovations, simply because they were new. These cases have afforded proof of the existence of that little patch of conservatism which is within all of us, and which ' we cannot eradicate. Perhapsi t would be better if we could do so, but I must be allowed to say that if it does not carry us beyond a certain length perhaps a little of it may sometimes be a good thing. It has been objected that the agreement will have theeffect of obliterating the naval forces already established in Australian waters by the Australian Governments. I have not put forward any arguments that would show that it was the intention of the Government to ask Parliament-and Parliament alone could do such a thing-to obliterate the forces necessary for our coastal and harbour defence. gentleman said, distinctly, that all our war",28,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
39,Mr Watson,"The right honorablevessels except, perhaps, the Gerbenis, would have to go. Sir EDMUNDBARTON say that. WhatI said was that we were considering a proposal to that effect. When, however, we came to open up the whole matter and deliberately consider it from end to end, I asked my honourable colleague, the Minister for Defence, to write a minute on the subject. When he had done so, I came to the conclusion, and I think all the members of the Cabinet were agreed, that it was not desirable to obliterate the whole of the local naval defences. Later on I shall give the reasons in support of this view, and also indicate my strong concurrence in it . The agreement itself and the Bill by which we are seeking to enforce it, and to make the necessary financial arrangements, can have absolutely no effect upon any provision that we may make in tliat regard. It has been pointed out during the course of the debate, that the Colonial Naval DefenceA c t of 1S65-a n Imperial Act-doe s make provision by which the colonies are empowered to raise colonial branches of the Royal Naval Reserve, and also to maintain ships and crews of their own. I am not aware that that Act has been repealed. I believe that it is still in force. Not many minutes ago I had an opportunity of perusing a copy of it , and to my mind it is clear that we are entitled to maintain the sole control of such measures of coastal and harbour defence as this Parliament may choose to specify, or adopt upon the motion of the Government. I may say further, that not only am I sure that this Bill does not affect any liberty which is given to us under that statutea liberty which I fancy we should possess under the terms of our Constitution if that Act were non-existent-bu t lest there should be any misapprehension upon the subject, I am perfectly prepared to accept an amendment which will make it clear that our autonomy in that respect is not interfered with by this agreement or any provision in it. That, however, does not affect the principles upon which I put forward this agreement for acceptance. If , in order that there may be no misapprehension in the minds of those who might otherwise be opponents of the agreement, I am in favor of declaring upon the face of the statute enforcing it, that we are free to make and maintain such provisions for our harbour and coastal defences as we may choose to adopt, it certainly cannot do any harm either to the Act or to the agreement. In deed I am not sure that it will affect the I did not operation of the statute in any way. But lest any apprehension should be created, although such a provision might amount only to a legislative placard, it might be a wise placard, and I am prepared to accept it. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN We had the power all the time under the old agreement. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I think so. I believe that we had it under the Constitution, but.if not, we had it under the Colonial Naval Defence Act. Another point which was taken as a fundamental objection to this agreement was one upon which the honourable and learned member for Northern Mel-bourne laid great stress. He quoted from a State paper the utterances of Lord Selborne, which I cited so extensively in my opening speech. He mentioned the passage which begins with the wordsThe reason why we have eliminated the word "" defence"" from ithis paper, and in which he saysIn tlie foregoing remarks the word "" defence"" is omitted. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne took this point: That inasmuch as the word "" defence"" was omitted-inasmuc h as the provision instituted by this agreement was aggressive and not in the colloquial sense "" defensive,"" ' it was unconstitutional, because it did not come within the term "" defence of the Commonwealth."" That is an argument which I should consider to be valid, if it were also valid to say that when a burglar is attack ing the house of your neighbour, you are not helping to defend yourself if you lent him your gun to shoot the burglar. The most effective defence frequently takes the form of aggression. The man who is insulted is doing no more than what is defensive if he knocks the aggressor down, because the insult is aggressive. In time of war there can be no nice calculatoin as to whether a step taken or an action fought is offensive or aggressive. Buti f two men are to fight, the one who uses nothing but his guard will assuredly get the worse of the encounter. ' Senator WILKS -On e needs to ""get his blow in first."" that is self-defence, not only according to the noble art itself, but also as the term is understood in every liberal sense. The",29,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
40,Sir Edmund Barton,"Yes, andhonorable and learned member has threat-ened to raise the question of the unconstitutionality of this agreement in the lawcourts, because of what was said by Lord Selbourne in a paper, which was of course -designed to show that what is done in naval warfare is, for defence purposes, best -done when it assumes the form of attack. If , after this agreement has come into statutory force, he desires to show that our action -or the agreement which justifies it, is beyond the defence provisions of our Constitution, I .shall welcome the opportunity to prove that he is mistaken. A t any rate, I am quite prepared to take the risk. I can assume that risk with an absolutely light heart, and I recommend honourable members to be equally light-hearted in accepting it . Another -objection which has been urged, is that this -agreement is proposed, not merely for the purpose of obtaining £200,000 a year in ' addition to the £34,000,000-whic h is the very large sum annually voted on the Naval Estimates of Great Britain-bu t as part of a-policy, which is intended to enable the Imperial authorities to gain control of our -expenditure upon the fleet stationed-in Australian waters, without allowing us, as a self governing part of the Empire, any voice in its disbursement. I hold that the people of the Commonwealth are fully represented in this House and in another. It is for them, through their representatives, to accept or reject a proposal of this kind. If we choose to agree to this monetary provision for the purpose of insuring a better defence of our shores, there is nothing to prevent our .doing so, and there can be no higher exercise of the functions committed to our charge than to vote public money for purposes of defence. 'To suggest that this is part of some deep laid scheme to inveigle us into a spider's web, that there is an intention on the part ' of the Commissioners of the Admiralty to lay a trap for us, and to hold this poor, young struggling Commonwealth, so to speak, by the legs, notwithstanding all its -efforts to free itself for its own defence, besigned to her in perpetual presence, but an tokens a condition of mind which, if the .gentleman who used the expression were not my friend, I should be inclined to consider almost morbid. vellian in the proposal. Machiavellian intention on the part of the Admiralty. Their idea is that all parts of the Empire should participate in its naval defence, not from any swollen notions of Imperialism, not for the purpose of defending one part of the Empire more effectively than another, but with the object of protecting the trade and interests of the whole, paying due regard to the. fact that without a trade, and without its political influence, we could describe that Empire by a cipher. During the course of the debate Captain Mahan has been referred to, and a passage from one of his works has been quoted as showing that because he thought San Francisco should be a fortified base, he was therefore in favour of detached local defences. PerhapsI may be permitted to read something from an article by Captain Mahan, which appeared in the July number of the Rationed Review of last year. This passage is the more interesting when one considers that it was written about the very time that this agreement was being entered into. He starts with a generalization of the relative naval power of the nations of Europe in the German 'Ocean or North Sea, the English Channel, and the Mediterranean. Then he carries his reasoning into the waters eastward of Suez, thusIn the Eastern seas, Australia and China mark the extremities of two long lines, the junction of which is near India. Let us say for the sake of specificness, Ceylon. They are offshoots of one branch, the root of which under present conditions is the English Channel, and the trunk, the Mediterranean. He adds that I t is the nature of extremities to be exposed, and it appears to him That the waters from Suez eastwards should be regarded as a military whole virtually connected with the system to the westward, but liable to temporary interruption at the Canal, against which, precaution must be had. In the nature of things there must be a big detachment east of Suez, but it is not China nor yet Australia that is by position the permanent -strategic centre of the Eastern seas, but rather a point which approximately equidistant from both is also equidistant from the Mediterranean and the East. What Australia needs is not her petty fraction of the Imperial Navy, a squadron asorganization of naval force which constitutes a firm grasp of the universal situation. Thus danger is.kept remote; but if it should approach, there is insured within reaching distance an adequate force to repel it betimes. The essence of the matter is that local security does not necessarily nor usually depend upon the constant local presence of a protector ship or squadron, but general dispositions. Local safety is not always found in local precaution. Speaking of harbour defence, he goes on to say-and this is a passage which may be",30,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
41,Mr Wilks,There is nothing Machia,31,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And
42,' Sir Edmund Barton,"There is noread in connection with the possibility of an attack upon these shoresShips in motion, like birds on the wing, are not easily hit; and it hus been demonstrated that fleets of ships can without disabling loss, pass by guns before which they could not lie. The obstruction of channels by torpedoes is therefore necessary, and, further, to prevent a blockade or bombardment, the aggressive torpedo boat is also requisite. Those are the words of Captain Mahan, both on the general question of the proper unity of control, and upon that of local defence. Honourable members will now recall what I said towards the close of my speech in moving the second reading of this Bill. I reminded them that we had decided not to dispense with the local defences which now exist, and which are maintained at an expenditure of £43,000 a year, but that we intended to ask Parliament to agree to rearming-the Cerberus, and to maintain upon the Estimates the Protector, Gayundah, and Palu/mah for another twelve months from the beginning of the present financial year. we propose to make provision for upon the purpose of which is concentration.

I am not above confessing that fortifications. and then the combined coastal and harbour defences. Afterwards 'we come to the movable army, which has. nothing to do with the garrisoning of forts. It is compatible with a just scheme of defence to provide for cruisers and battleships, if need be, as well as other mobile forces, to act as part of a combined navyto use that power of concentration which, when properly employed against a foe, has always been the root of the naval defence of England and of this Empire. It has been pointed out that Great Britain does not entirely dispense with coastal defence, and certainly she has many vessels that fall outside the first rank, but might be used in that way. In the same way a self governing colony may, if it chooses, make some provision for the defence of its harbors by means of land fortifications, torpedo boats, or even floating forts like the Cerberus. As she grows richer she may also make provision for the defence of her harbors by means of cruisers of heavy armament, able to strike effectively within a short distance of their base, but money for both those branches of defence I do not think so. That brings me to the point whether it is better to provide mosteffectually for the first line of defence, or for The Governthat which only Comes into play when the is the mobile navy of the Empire.

What would be easier than to arrange that so far as the pay on board the vessels is concerned the Admiralty rates shall be given all round, and that in the case of the colonial men the colonial Governments shall be allowed to make good the difference. That difference might be made good by any of the known forms of payment, or by placing the requisite sum in a savings bank to the credit of each of the men. I think that the Australian and New Zealand Governments might be allowed to pay the difference that will accrue to those who are of Australian or New Zealand citizenship, not on board' ship but on shore, the Admiralty rates being paid all round on board. of some of the South African contingents. be nothing easier, and if we made provision for the payments to be made in this way we should not affect any term of the agreement. I shall endeavour to see that it is done. Payments made in that way may be deducted from the sum which otherwise we should pay by way of. maintenance, and be placed to our credit agaiust the £200,000. That is a way by which the invidiousness complained of may be avoided, and avoided all the more easily when it is considered 4 that, although the Australians and New Zealanders who serve in these ships are to receive higher rates of pay than the men of the British navy, Jack will be comforted by the reflection that at the end of his term of service he will be entitled to draw a pension, whereas the provision which we are making does not carry with it that advantage. I should like now to refer to one or two other objections which have been urged against the arrangement. been said that the Government are opposed to the establishment of an Australian Navy at any time. I do not think that that is a correct interpretation of our intentions, any more than it would be right to say that the agreement and the speech which I made in defence of it are not part of our policy, and that there should be some definite statement of our future intentions in regard to this matter. I made a statement in my opening speech which may be taken as an earnest of the design of the Government to give strong and favorable consideration to 6 T2 the local arm of defence; But there is more than that to consider. So far as the policy of having an Australian Navy of cruisers upon the coast is concerned, the fact that we have made the agreement subject to determination upon notice at the end of eight years, which will be somewhere about the time when the financial provisions of the Constitution will be subject to revision, is an indication of what we mean. We do not wish to try to bind Parliament as to its future action in the matter. Let me not be misconceived in this respect. I shall always retain the opinion that the firstline of defence is the most useful and effective we can have, and one which we should support in preference to any other, if we had to make a choice. But any action -we take in this matter must be subject to the opinions of those who come after us. Since one Parliament cannot bind its successor, it will be open to our successors to take action at the termination of this agreement, or when notice is given to terminate it . ment does not imply any future policy. Sir EDMUNDBARTON It merely implies the determination not to affect the future policy of the Commonwealth. I do not know that I shall be here then, because none of us can say where we shall be in eight years' time, but if I am here I think I shall still be found defending the contention that the combination and concentration of the fleets of the Empire under unity 'of control is our best line of defence. If we had only one line of defence, that would be the best we could have, although, fortunately, we are not shut down to one line of defence, and can therefore make provision for contingencies which the success of the first line of defence will make highly improbable.

58,Sir Edmund Barton,"No. Wethe attitude of the Government has arisen from the fact that when a reduction was made in the defence Estimates, the naval forces were subjected to more Severe retrenchment than any honourable member anticipated. Sir aware, no one has been dismissed ; at any rate, no one in Victoria. out of the views of Parliament in regard to retrenchment in our defence expenditure has been an extremely difficult work, but, so far as .our defence afloat is concernedI cannot speak of it as naval defence, because the Cerberus is not a sea-going vessel-ade quate provision will be made for the efficiency of the vessels retained. If it should be the wish of Parliament to increase our floating defence by strengthening it , and making it capable of aggression, by the use of torpedo gun-boats, or other similar means, I shall be very pleased, and I shall be encouraged in my future efforts in that direction. 'The honourable member for Bland has moved, as an amendment, that the Bill be read a second time this day six months. course, is a complete change from the policy of the agreement. It is an assertion, if I interpret the honourable member's speech aright, that we have no authority to enter into or to ratify this agreement, that it is ourbounden duty to wait until the constituencies have expressed an opinion upon it, and. that the Government are censurable for having brought it forward. The honourable member suggests that we as a Parliament should stay our hands until the electors have 'declared their will on the subject, and that if they are opposed to the arrangement the Government should go out of office. I am content to deal with the amendment in that light, and I should be content to so deal with it even if I thought it would be carried. But I am bound to say, in answer to the honourable member's argument, that it is no part of our political principles to say that an elected Parliament is tied down, when important measures are brought before it, to the settlement of questions which have been the issue of a general election. an accepted principle of parliamentary Government, while members are representatives and not merely delegates. If we were to regard ourselves as delegates, and were to say"" We cannot vote upon this to measure or upon that; because we have no instructions from our constituents,"" to what a miserable position should we reduce ourselves ! Isi t to be supposed that the public take that niggard view of our powers and opportunities ? I protest against such a notion. It is not in accordance with any JOHN FORREST -S o far as I am principle which I have had the good fortune to learn in connection with politics. If there is a distinct issue before the constituencies at a general election, and a mandate is given by them in regard to it, it is essential, of course, that Parliament should carry out that mandate. But honourable members are elected not merely for the carrying out of the mandates of the electors, but also to deal with those large matters of public policy which, if each of them were made the'subject of reference to the constituencies, so much time would be consumed in that way that. there would be none left for their discussion and decision by Parliament. £>Q^Q rG i i d 8* continual elections. I do not think that it That, of is in accordance with the principles of parliamentary government that the constituencies should be disturbed, whether by general elections or by referenda, for the decision of an issue perhaps every few months. They decide at the general elections upon our fitness for Parliament, and our competency to entertain large projects such as this. It must have been widely known throughout the Commonwealth at the time of the last general elections that the existing naval agreement, which was entered into in 1S89, and had ten years to run, subject to notice being given of the wish to discontinue it , might be discontinued at any time. It must have been patent to the people that notice could at any time be given of the wish to terminate the agreement, and that two years thereafter a new agreement could be entered upon. But is it to be supposed that the people thought that when Parliament chose to bring the existing agreement to an end, and to substitute another for it, there would be a general election or a special referendum That can never be upon the subject 1 It is absurd to say that the peoplewish to be appealed to at all times and in all seasons in connection with these matters.

Therefore it does not behove us to run timorously and tremblingly to their feet, and say"" This is something new.' W ill you let us deal with it ?"" That is not the purpose of parliamentary representation. But I would venture to say something more on the' subject. I could have welcomed nothing better, as a matter of political tactics, than the opporwith squadrons upon other stations, without tunity to take this Bill to the country, and to say to the people"" Here is an issue for you. If you endorse our action with regard to the Bill, you-confirm us in power; but if you dissent from it we must go out of office."" an overwhelming majority on such an issue! my honourable friend is correct in that statement. courage on our part, because we should know the certainty that we had. We should have a good thing, and could accept it with the proper degree of thankfulness. I think I need occupy no further time in arguing against the amendment. Objections have been taken to the agreement which are merely subsidiary to objections which I have already answered. We have been told that in bringing forward this agreement we are doing an injury to the budding Australian nation. I wish to make no appeal to the past, but if I am doing an injury to the budding Australian nation I am quite unconscious of the fact. It is entirely contrary to so much of the history of Australia as I think I have had a part in the making of. The idea of injuring the buddingflowerof national life would to me appear to be the greatest treachery I could commit, and would render the past, upon which I hope to stand or fall, utterly useless. I cannot be seriously accused of anything of the sort. If any honourable member thinks that the effect of ratifying the agreement will be to destroy the budding aspirations of Australian nationhood, he has, of course, the liberty of his opinions, and I cannot quarrel with h i m ; but if it is said that it is my deliberate intention to inflict such an injury I think I must be absolved from the desire to participate in any such act. Theni t is said that the fleet will not be available in time of war for tlie defence of Australia.. What is the idea underlying that statement ? It is not proposed to send the fleet to China or to the East Indies when there is no enemy there, nor is it proposed to detain it there when there is an enemy here. The idea is that the ships shall go where the enemy is-to the post of danger. The concentration of our forces at the post of danger, and the overcoming of that danger, is a first, and, if all goes well, the final step towards our safety. How, then, can it be supposed that we are leaving ourselves defenceless when we send our fleet to combine vvhich combination they would be in danger of being overwhelmed, but by the means of which the enemy could be overcome ? The overwhelming at a distance of the forces of the Empire would expose us to attacks which our own provision for coastal and harbour defence, be they never so large, would not be able to resist. How can it be then, that by taking the first step There would be no lack of commensurate with the danger -which is threatening, and the step best adapted to secure our safety, we shall leave ourselves defenceless? An argument of that kind requires . no further reply, and if I have occupied time in answering it, it is because I consider the matter of great and vital importance. I ask the attention of honourable members to the fact that, if we know and understand the history of Australia, whose people made no complaint about being left defenceless when they sent their sons in thousands to South Africa, and had nothing to say about taxation and representation when they allowed their precious blood to be spilt to prevent the disintegration of the Empire, we can safely assume they will be the first to Say that they seek no greater security than can be obtained by the combined policy of the Empire, and, in tlie next place, that the Government are taking the best step to obtain that security. I have now come to the end of the remarks which I intended to make, and I trust that I have not wearied honourable members. I feel strongly and deeply upon this matter, not because of the possession of swollen ideas of Imperialism, because that is a gibe to which no action of my life exposes me, but because I believe in giving to Ciesar that which is Caesar's. I believe in giving, not to the Caesar of I m perialism, but to the Caesar of self-government ; in giving unimpaired to.each part of the Empire its proper powers of self-government. We do that under the present policy of the Colonial Department, which' is explicit and strong in that direction, and we thus secure an attitude to",36,Edmund Bahton I T Will Be All Is Essential To The Defence Of Australia And

If we lend ourselves too much to measures which savour of disintegration, or teach our people to trend that way, we shall have ourselves to thank if, in detaching ourselves from the Empire, in the end we weaken the home of our children. It is because that is the last contingency to which I wish to expose Australia, and because I hope that it may be as distant as the day of doom, that I ask honourable members to vote for this Bill.

65,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"to leave the whole. of our defence to the 'British Navy. I suggest, therefore, that we should declare upon the face of the Bill that it is merely of a tentative and experimental character. I would point out that this agreement, in its present form, will continue indefinitely, as will be abundantly clear by reference to Article 10. A t the expiration of ten years it will still be operative, and it is not necessary for the question to be again brought before Parliament. I know that there are several honourable members who think that this matter should be reconsidered, in the light of future circumstances, within ten years. The adoption of my proposal would compel the Government to reconsider it within that period. I therefore move-' That the following proviso be added :"" Provided that it be modified by the contracting parties, so as to limit its term to ten years, unless the parties consent to its continuance."" I repeat that if we do nothing, the agreement in its present form will continue indefinitely, whereas, if my amendment be carried, it will terminate at the end of ten years, unless the high contracting parties enter into some fresh arrangement. I merely propose to compel Parliament to reconsider the matter within ten years. Of course, if I moved to amend the schedule in that direction it would be in order, but it would be inconvenient, and the Prime Minister would at once say that I desired to amend an agreement upon one side without the other party to it having been consulted. It is perfectly within the power of this Parliament to say that it is willing to accept the agreement with a slight modification. Such a procedure would not be unlike that which was adopted in connection with our Constitution. That instrument of government was ratified by the Australian people, but the Imperial authorities afterwards said, "" We will accept it if it is modified in certain respects."" If it was not unreasonable for the Imperial Government to insist upon a modification of a matter which was purely Australian, it is surely pot unreasonable for us. to demand a modification of this agreement. glad if the honourable, and learned member for Northern Melbourne will temporarily withdraw his proposal to enable me to submit a prior amendment. a : Amendment, by leave; withdrawn. That the following words be added :"" Subject to the following alteration : that the squadron shall not be removed from beyond the limits of the Australian station without the consent of the Governor General in Council."" I shall not occupy the attention of the Committee at any length, because the opinions of honourable members have already been freely expressed. alteration when New Zealand is a party to the agreement t the Imperial and New Zealand authorities to agree to ? alter something else, and there will be no finality. which we have to consider. We have to consider what is best in the interests of Australia. In asking honourable members to accept this amendment, I am simply requesting them to agree to the insertion in this agreement of a power that is contained in the agreement of 1887. Under that agreement the squadron cannot be removed fromAustralian waters .without the consent of the Governments concerned, and now that we have become aunited people, I think that the.Federal Government should have at least as strong a voice in regard to this question as had the six separate States. The Prime Minister, as well as the Minister for Defence, have asked us to consider this agreement as a purely business transaction, and, regarding it in that light, I think it would be wise for the Federal Government to have some control over the movements of the squadron to be provided. If , in the opinion of the Federal Government, it became necessary for the squadron to join forces with the British fleet in some other part of the world, I am sure that no obstacle would be placed in the way of the adoption of that course. The Admiralty has not always been correct, so far as colonial matters are concerned. We know tliat a mistake was made in connection with the annexation of New Guinea.

I am not prepared to say that it is not within the power of the Committee to alter any B ill which is placed before it, however wrong or awkward that alteration might be. But, as the preamble to this B ill recites, the agreement is between His Majesty's Government, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the colony of New Zealand; and inasmuch as it has been made, subject, of course, to It seems to me the approval of this House, by three distinct parties, it would be far more convenient, if the Committee really wishes to vary it, to do so by an amendment in the Bill itself, indicating the conditions governing the acceptance of the proposal. It would be desirable for the Committee to express its view as to a variation of the agreement, by amending that part of the Bill which speaks for this House. It would be better to look upon this, schedule as a document which should stand as agreed to at the Conference. Sir EDMUNDBARTON It might had unnecessarily delayed what I have to say upon this question of amendment if I did not speak at once. I am bound, to state that I do not think it would be either right or courteous to make an amendment of this kind, which would be in fact an amendment of an agreement to which there are two other parties. I cannot for myself accept any such amendment. I cannot accept this B ill with any such amendment in it.

That, however, can best be done by rejecting a Bill of this kind. It can be better and more fairly done by striking out the second clause, because to amend the schedule would be to say the contrary of what is set forth in that clause. ceases to be the agreement for all the practical purposes for which I made it . It would appear from the amendment that the Bill was not ratifying the agreement actually made, but something else. I cannot accept . that position ; I cannot accept the B ill with such an amendment. I wish the Committee to be quite clear as to my attitude, because sometimes one is not understood to be acting here on his responsibility as a Minister unless he expressly says so. make this statement, acting on my responsibility as a Minister, and fully alive to every consequence that it may entail. Article2 reads as follows:The base of this force shall be the ports of Australia and New Zealand, and their sphere of operations shall be the waters of the Australian, China, and East Indian stations, as defined in the propose to repeat in detail the arguments attached schedules, where the Admiralty believe they can most effectively act against hostile vessels which threaten the trade or interests of Australia and New Zealand. No change in this arrangement shall be made without the consent of tbe Governments of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand; and nothing in the agreement shall be taken to mean that the naval force herein named shall be the only force used in Australasian waters should the necessity arise for a larger force. It will be apparent that the amendment would effect an alteration in that agreement just as much as if it were an amendment of the schedule. effect that the sphere of operations of the squadron shall be the waters of the Australian station. The primary reason for removing the squadron from the waters of the Australian station, if it ever were removed, would be because the Admiralty, with its. superior means of information, had come to the conclusion that the trade and interests of Australia and New Zealand would be better protected by the fleet striking a blow at the enemy in some other part of the.world than by its remaining on our coasts. Honourable members want other terms 1 propose to substitute for the judgment of the Admiralty an authority which, strong as is my belief in the efficiency of our Constitution, I must acknowledge cannot possess the information which is secured by the Naval Intelligence Department for the Admiralty. Among the -experts who were present at the consultations which preceded the drawing up of this agreement was the British Director of NavalI n telligence, who. was as strong in his belief in the policy of Article2 as If the schedule be amended it any one who attended; while among other experts who were present was not only Lord Selborne, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Admiralty, Mr Arnold Poster, who has given a great deal of consideration to naval affairs, but also the senior naval Lord of the Admiralty, who is looked upon as one of the highest authorities upon naval matters. If the amendment were carried, the policy laid down in Article2 would be defeated, and I those who listened to what I had to say in moving the second reading of the Bill, and in speaking again in reply, cannot fail to know that I consider that article a vital part of the agreement. The united control of the British fleets is its cardinal principle, and to defeat that principle would be to defeat the agreement inits mostessential point. Idonot which I have already used, because if I have not made the position clear I despair of doing so; but I wish to put the importance of the amendment strongly and clearly before honourable members, so that they may see for what reasons, and prompted by what motives, I regard it as vital to the Bill. All the Bill does is to ratify the agreement, to provide funds for carrying it into effect, and to declare that the agreement does not disturb or interfere with existing arrangements for local defence, or limit the It says in authority of this Parliament to make additions to them. But if the amendment is carried, it will radically alter the agreement, and the effect of making such an alteration in an agreement to which there are three parties can only be to destroy it altogether. The agreement was made, of course, subject to the approval of Parliament, and Parliament can say that it does not approve of it .

82,Mr Watson,"Cannot we say that weSir EDMUNDBARTON that the amendment is out of order, though it might be contended that it is so. If anyone is 'of that opinion, I ask him not to invoke the decision of the Chairman upon the point, because I wish the matter to be fought out on its merits. That is the only manly way of dealing with the question. out on its merits if the Government make it a party question ? consent to put aside my sense of Ministerial responsibility, even to please my honourable friend. When speaking in reply, I pointed out to honourable members who stated that the matter was nob one to be dealt with in a party spirit, that, however honourable members might treat it, nothing could divest me of my Ministerial responsibility in regard to matters connected with it in which I thought that responsibility involved. This is such a matter. Buti n saying that my Ministerial responsibility is involved, I am far from making a threat. I am conscious, however, that if a vote were taken against the Government which we felt bound to accept as a defeat involving our Ministerial responsibility, our supporters would say"" Why did you not tell us beforehand that you considered the matter a party question ?"" On the other hand, I know that whenever Ministerial responsibility is mentioned in a debate, a section of honourable members is always ready to cry out that the House is being threatened. Nothing is further from my thoughts than the wish to threaten honourable members, but it is the duty of a Government on critical occasions to make their position absolutely clear. I am only communicating to the Committee my sense of my responsibility in this matter, but I leave honourable members to take what course they think fit in regard to it . Any man who thinks that the reasons for voting for the amendment are stronger than those which cause him to support the Government, is absolved by. that conviction from his party ties, but the more open and straightforward course would be to refuse straight out to ratify the agreement. It is natural to some honourable members, however, to consider that amendments which they wish to make are not of vital importance to the principles of a Bill. Some honourable members, during the discussion on the second reading, spoke of their intention to move amendments with I do not say a view to prevent the fleet from being removed from the Australian waters with* out the consent of the Commonwealth Government; but it is incumbent upon me to repeat that I consider that thecarrying of such an amendment would absolutely destroy the agreement. If it seems good to honourable members to voteHow can it be fought straightforwardly for the rejection of theagreement, I cannot complain, and I would sooner 3ee it dealt with in that way thandefeated by an amendment which I regard as destructive of one of its vital principles ment had discovered a flaw in the agreement 1.

The estimated cost of maintenance was £91,000, and, therefore, the total contribution to be paid by Australia and New Zealand amounted to £126,000. £854,000, instead of £700,000, as estimated, and the maintenance involved an annual expenditure of £120,000, instead of £91,000 j but a bargain was a bargain, and an agreement was an agreement, and the Admiralty kept their compact. cent, contribution for interest and sinking fund upon £854,000 represented an annual charge of £47,000, and the maintenance amounting to £120,000, made a total annual outlay of £ 1 6 7 , 0 0 0 ; but, notment of its chief value. On principle, I am withstanding this, the total annual contribution of Australia and New Zealand to the Admiralty was restricted to £.126,000, and the ImperialGovernment paid the other £41,000. Under the proposed new agreement, the estimated annual cost of the squadron will be £480,000, but I have every reason to believe that that amount will be considerably exceeded. The contribution of Australia and New Zealand is, however, restricted to £240,000, and the Admiralty will pay the other £240,000, together with any further. expense that may be involved if the estimate of annual cost should be exceeded. I wish honourable members to dismiss from their minds the consideration of any expense in excess of the present estimate which may be involved in carrying out the agreement. The whole p6int is that, under the present agreement, Australia and New Zealand pay an amount calculated upon the whole of the cost of maintenance, whereas under the proposed agreement we shall pay a contribution calculated upon only one-half that cost, whilst the Admiralty will pay the remainder. Consequently an amendment to take away control from the Admiralty, and vest it in Australia and"" New Zealand, would be entirely out of harmony with that principle in the agreement. an Imperial Squadron was to be kept here, apart altogether from the vessels forming the Auxiliary Squadron. under the proposed agreement it is provided thatThe Nothing in the agreement shall be taken to mean that the naval force'herein named should be the only force used in Australasian waters, should the necessity arise for a greater force. I admit that that is not the same as having Imperial vessels stationed here apart from the Australian Squadron; but, on the other hand, the cardinal difference between the The vessels actually cost two agreements is not affected by my honourable friend's interjection. The cardinal dif ference is that under the present agreement we pay a contribution calculated upon the whole cost of maintenance of the Auxiliary Squadron, whereas under the proposed The5 per agreement our contribution is calculated upon half the cost of maintenance. An amendment which would deprive the A d miralty of direct control of the Australian Squadron would rob the agreeopposed to the amendment, and I think it would be unfair if it could take effect under the Bill, considering that the Admiralty are to pay half of the cost of maintenance. It is not to be expected that a fresh agreement, allowing of a divided control, would be consented to if the contribution of the Admiralty were increased from practically nothing to one-half of the cost of maintenance. I think that some honourable members who have spoken upon the subject of tying the fleet down to Australian waters, have perhaps overlooked the important consideration, that under the old agreement we were assessed at the whole of that cost, whereas under this agreement we are assessed at only half the cost. However that may be, I wish to reiterate that I consider myself personally, and as a Minister, bound to ask the Committee to accept or reject this agreement. If it is rejected, I shall regard the action of the Committee as an intimation to me that, although I acted under the responsibility of a Ministeri n what I conceived to be the best interests of Australia, my intervention resulted in something distasteful to honourable members. I should therefore-as I think any other Minister would feel myself constrained to accept an intimation of that kind, however sugar-coated the pill might be, as one to me that I had not correctly gauged the feeling of honourable",42,Pairs

I could not conceive of anything further from my thoughts than to make this declaration with any view to threaten the House. Honourable members will be free to vote as they like. I am not one to crack the stockwhip,' but I am making this declaration so that honourable members may know from me what my position is. It might be possible if the agreement is destroyed-and this amendment would destroy it-to conclude another agreement, but so far as I am concerned I should be obliged not to take part in any negotiations to that end. The amendment would not only be fatal to the Bill, but it would compel me to consider my own position. though I do not attribute any such intention to the honourable member who moved the amendment, I agree with the Prime Minister that it would prove fatal to the Bill. The proposal runs absolutely counter to the whole principle of the agreement. The old agreement, under which the whole of the cost of maintaining the Auxilliary Squadron was paid by Australia and New Zealand, provided that the squadron should not be removed from Australian waters without the consent of the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. That agreement was most unsatisfactoiy, and the Prime Minister was forced . to agree to the adoption of a new scheme Under which a British fleet, under, direct control of the Admiralty, would be stationed in Australian waters under such conditions that Australia would be called upon' to contribute only half the estimated annual cost. If we sought to assume the Sole command of the squadron in times of emergency, we should be asking for something which was never contemplated by the agreement, and something which we have no right to claim considering the smaiiness of our contribution, against a joint control of an important portion of the British Navy, and I could not support an amendment which aims at exercising control, not only over the proposed vessels of the Australian Squadron, but over any additional war-ships which might be stationed in Australian waters. The agreement provides for a minimum number of vessels in this squadron. It declares that the naval force upon the Australian station shall consist of not less than eleven vessels. But future exigencies may require considerably more than that number of warships to assemble upon the Australian station. Under such circumstances, what would be the position ? If half the vessels of the British fleet were stationed in Commonwealth waters, we could, if the amendment were adopted, prevent them from being removed elsewhere. in an emergency is not a vessel under this agreement. particular force. tive force. objections which are urged, I hold that if future circumstances required the permanent increase of the fleet on the Australian station under this amendment its movements would be restricted. were found necessary to permanently double the fleet upon the Australian station.

Objection has been urged against giving the Admiralty f u l l control over this fleet, on the ground that its decisions and actions are not always wise. We have failed yet to create an institution that is always wise. In support of that argument, it has been pointed out that only a portion of New Guinea was annexed by Great Britain when Australia desired the annexaI am absolutely tion of the whole. But I would point out that the Admiralty authorities had nothing to do with the matter. Who made the mistake ? The political authorities in Great Britain!

We should, however, act always within the limits mentioned by the honourable and learned member for -West Sydney-withi n the limits of a sane Imperialism, as against the hysterical notions which seem to have been forced upon some of us of late. But, in view of our circumstances at the present time, I do not think that we are called upon to do more than to assist the Empire by providing for the security of Australia, and by making the naval bases here impregnable, so that they may be of assistance to the British fleet in general. As to the particular advocacy of this feature by the head of the Naval Intelligence Department, I am mminded of a fact which has quite.recently been, put forward by the British Navy League, that out of a total of some £13,000 per annum, voted onlast year's Estimates for the Intelligence Department of the Navy, only some £4,000 was actually used for the actual maintenanceof thelntelligence branch. If the Admiral at the head of the Intelligence Department has only as many officers to rely upon as an expenditure of £4,000 per annum can secure, I do not see that greater reliance can be placed upon his opinion than upon that of any other highly placed naval expert. Sir attaches also undertake intelligence duty. the annual meeting of the Navy League, made it a strong point against the Admiralty administration that so little was spent upon the Intelligence Department; and it would seem a ridiculous thing that only £4000 should be expended in obtaining intelligence for the control of a navy whose annual maintenance costs £34,000,000. The Prime Minister says that those who propose to alter the agreement ought to vote against it altogether. I was prepared to object to the Bill rather than approve of an agreement which differs so materially from anything to which our people are accustomed, but I think it is quite proper for those who do not care to go so far as that to say what they are prepared to accept in lieu of the agreement as it stands. How is it possible for us to indicate to the In those circumstances Imperial authorities what we are willing to accept unless some such specific motion as this is moved 1 I think it is only a proper thing that we should clearly indicate how far we are prepared to go, and those who voted for the second reading, but desired to have the agreement altered in some particulars, are quite consistent in voting for' such an amendment as this. The Prime Minister proceeded to say that the amendment is an unfair one in view of the fact that the basis of the agreement is that we shall pay only one half of the cost of maintaining the squadron. He fails, however, to appreciate the force of the fact to which the right honourable member for East Sydney was the first to draw attention, that under the existing agreement, while we pay the full cost of maintaining the vessels of the Auxiliary Squadron, which is supposed to be a peculiar creation for Australian needs, the Imperial authorities are bound to maintain certain other vessels at their own cost so long as the agreement continues. vessels in the Auxiliary Squadron and the Imperial fleet under the present agreement does not equal the number of vessels which we shall have here under the proposed agreement. matter. Seeing -that the fact is as I have stated, it does not seem to me that we are now asking too much, especially as our contribution is henceforth to be doubled. I am surprised at the construction which the I regard as one of the most clear-headed men in the Chamber, desires to place upon the proposed agreement. He has stated that if the amendment is carried its effect will be that all the war vessels in Australian waters will be subject to the conditions which the honourable and learned member for Illawarra wishes to impose. nently stationed here-not vessels coming here at a time of crisis. Neither, of course, could it affect vessels coming here with relief crews, or for some other temporary purpose.

Personally, I do not fear anything from such an interpretation. The honourable member for North Sydney further said that the present squadron has proved ineffective, but I should like him to specify in what particular it has been ineffective.

There is one other point to which I should like to refer. It has been said that no British Admiral worth his salt would hesitate to break any agreement if in his judgment the necessities of the situation warranted him in doing so. If it were merely a matter of going a few miles beyond the limits of the station, it is probable that any British or Australian Admiral would break an agreement to that extent to meet or to pursue the enemy's ships ; but an Admiral would be less likely to take the fleet away on small provocation if the agreement contained an express prohibition against his taking it away at all. Without such a prohibition, it is more than likely that upon the slightest indication of trouble in the China seas, the whole squadron would be taken away, and our coasts would be left defenceless. Althoughi t is probable that the Admiral of the English Channel fleet would take his ships beyond the boundaries of his station to It is a reflection upon the pursue an enemy, I think, from what I have read, and from what I know of the opinion of naval experts upon the subject, that the English people would never deliberately consent to the Channelfleetbeing made available as a general thing for service elsewhere. enemy sailed up the Thames, the British fleet was at home. that there was any British fleet in existence at that time..

Captain Mahan has in several instances stated that in connection with any policy of concentration, or combination of forces, there is always the possibility of the enemy detaching single cruisers or cruisers in pairs his supporters. I have all through felt that to attack the coasts of the power from which the defending ships have been withdrawn. It is not likely that England would denude her coasts of ships, and I do not think it is likely that the people of Australia would consent to our being left defenceless. I regret very much that the Prime Minister saw f it to enter into an agreement of this kind, especially one embracing a provision such as that contained in Article 2. When he was going to London he assured us that he would enter into no agreement which would commit us, but that its terms would be subject. to the approval of Parliament. He has now, however, taken up such an attitude, that it is impossible for us to give free expression to our opinion. agree with the honourable member for Bland with reference to the attitude taken up on this occasion by the Prime Minister. I confess that it gave me a violent shock of surprise. I admit that the exhibition was one to which we are not accustomed, but none the less, it was the right attitude and gave one a fleeting glimpse of the true spirit of parliamentary government. Although the Opposition are pictured both in these States and in the mother country as a party, and their leader as an individual, always on the look-out for an opportunity of displacing the Government, the fact remains, and will I hope stand to the credit of the party, that when matters of national concern come before this House, we rise above the ordinary instincts of an Opposition. When the division took place this evening, the members of the Opposition voted almost solidly with the Government and saved them from, overwhelming defeat, and, apparently, inspired by tlie additional strength which we gave him on the Government Benches for a few moments, the Prime Minister spoke outlike a man. It is safe to put your footdown when you have the Opposition behind your back. I may say that it also affordsus pleasure to reflect that by the patriotic attitude which we assumed upon this question we enabled a number of loyal Government supporters to listen^ for once to the dictates of their conscience and voteagainst the Government.. Thus have we been able to afford the public a fleeting glimpse of courage on the part of the Prime Minister, and an equally fleeting glimpse of conscientiousness on the part of this agreement is one which has a great deal of make-believe about it , that there has been a considerable amount of cleverness shown in disguising the real nature of the transaction, and that the people of Australia were undoubtedly led to believe that the agreement was in no sense the departure which it really is. Under the other agreement we had the protection of the. British Navy, under an arrangement entered into at theinvitation of the Imperial Government. Thirty years ago we were asked by the I m perial authorities to undertake our land defences, whilst they would undertake to provide our sea defences. As time went on we were asked to establish an Australian Squadron-not to Contribute to the support of-ihe British Navyi n these seas. We were told that the British Navyi n these seas would be kept up at its former strength, and that the Imperial Government would give us an Auxiliary Australian Squadron which would be something altogether apart from the British Navy. The agreement was framed in those terms, and a provision was inserted that the vessels of the Australian Squadron should not be removed from the waters of the station except with the consent of the Australian and New Zealand Governments in those days the consent of six separate Executives was involved. Now we are told that the ships provided .for under that agreement were of no use-that they were unsuitable for the purpose. Well, all I have to say is that, although I am conscious of a number of thesematters, I. feel bound to meet this issue in a broad spirit. My feeling of obligation to the mother country is so profound, my sense of the generosity with which that Imperial power refrains from pressing its claims upon us, and leaves us absolutely",49,Malcolm Mceachabn Th E Naval Honourable Member For North Sydney Whom

No doubt the object of this bit of paper, the primary motive of the agreement from the stand-point of the mother country-min d I do not at all say that it may not be a good one ; personally I do not think it is, but the Imperial authorities may have good reasons for their judgment;-bh e objecb is, I think, to bake off the aspect of an Australian agreement for an Australian naval 'force, and to substitute an Australian partnership in bhe British Navy bhe whole world over. Thab is bhe objecb which, I think, underlies the agreement. It is not the £200,000 provided for under the agreement that the Lords of the Admiralty want; £200,000 would be spent every moment of the day in the Admiralty by a stroke of the pen. It <was not that consideration that led bo bhe proposal submitted to the Conference, and to the frantic efforts made bo susbain it . I bhink that ib is consistent with a feeling of absolube loyalty to the mother country and in the interests of the mother country ibself to set myself strongly against any attempt to substitute for the independent action of bhese self-governing Sbabes an admission to share in the active management of the British Empire. I think that the idea is utberly ridiculous in itself and that any attempt to carry it out would be fraught with failure. It is in a spirit of absolute loyalty, and in the interests of the Empire itself, that I view with the greatest dislike the attempts made by Hysterical and. weak-kneed politicians in the mother country to find relief from the growing burden, which some of them at last regard as becoming too great. They will not by these artificial methods gain the strength they need. We cannot search the history of the world without noticing the marvellous magnanimity which has caused the Imperial power to ask us to contribute so small an amount, and to sign such an agreement. Let those who talk so loudly about duty to the mother country, just imagine what our position would be in the French or German Empire. The benefits we derive not only from the protection of our trade on the seas, but from the mother land all through, are such that I cannot oppose this agreement. BecauseI disagree with some of its aspects I am accused of inconsistency. It is, however, perfectly consistent with a man's objections to certain features in a proposal thab he should adopt it, not because he believes in every detail, but because he accepts its broad spirit. It was the recogr nition of our profound obligations to bhe mobher country which led the two parties in this Chamber to unite in a contribution which will nob render one bibhe of what we owe bo bhe mobher counbry. glad indeed bhat the Prime Minister and the honourable member for North Sydney have absolved me from any inbenbion bo desbroy bhe Bill. In moving the amendment I was acbuabed by a desire merely bo give effecb bo bhe view I have always held in connection wibh the control that should be exercised over the vessels stationed in Ausbralian waters.

Every day business men enber into arrangements subject bo certain conditions being fulfilled, and when I voted for the second reading of the Bill, I was under the distinct impression that we should have full power of amendment in Committee. The Prime Minister was ready enough to accept the amendment of the 'honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and I do not see why we should nob alber bhe agreemenb as we may bhink fib. I was surprised bo hear bhe consbrucbion bhab bhe honourable member for North Sydney abbempbed to place upon the first article of bhe agreemenb.

That is not the object of the .amendment, and I do not think it would fairly bear tliat construction. against England, such a catastrophe might It is perfectly clear that under, the agreement as it stands it would be possible to remove the vessels forming the Australian Squadron into China or East Indian waters, and leave us absolutely defenceless. object to' the removal of the Australian Squadron in order that it may act against a hostile fleet 1 for North Sydney argued that if the whole British Navy were despatched to Australian waters, it could not be removed under this amendment without the consent of the Commonwealth Government. drew from that position when I was speaking. member's pardon. I did not hear him withdraw. In view of a possible combination on the part of some of the great Powers against the mother country we are entitled to control the movements of the fleet for which we pay. In speaking upon this matter, I went further than most honourable members, because not only am I prepared to sanction the payment of the proposed subsidy, but I believe that in addition we should have an Australian Navy purely for the purposes of coastal defence. If the agreement be adopted in its present form, the establishment of such a navy will be a very long way off indeed. The principal reason why the States entered into the Federation was that we might establish a proper system of defence for Australia. The Prime Minister and some others seem to think that when they have paid £200,000 to England in the form of an annual naval subsidy, they have done all that is necessary in this connection. I am convinced that in this matter they misinterpret Australian sentiment. If it were put to a referendum, I am satisfied that the electors of the Commonwealth would not hesitate to sanction the expenditure of £500,000 to establish a navy to protect their own interests. Only the other evening, the honourable member for Richmond drew a vivid picture of a probable Chinese invasion of Australia. That is a contingency which was often depicted by the greatest statesman Australia has ever hadI refer to the late Sir Henry Parkes. He was never tired of talking of a probable invasion by the Chinese. In case of a combination of the great Powers easily happen, unless we had a proper system of naval defence. The amendment embodies my views upon this matter, and I am glad that honourable members acquit me of being'actuated by any party spirit. the amendment submitted is intended to ascertain whether the consent of the Governor General in Council is required before the ships upon the Australian station are removable from its waters. I am bound to confess that there is a good deal of force in the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra. To my mind his proposal does not interfere with the power of the Admiralty in any way whatever. It merely insists that the local authorities shall be consulted. Seeing that I beg the honourable we are paying a portion of the' taxation that is levied for the naval defence of the Empire, have we not a right to be consulted ? Ought we not to be considered before England engages in any war 1 learned member suggest that the consent of the Governor General, of the Commonwealth Government, and of the New Zealand authorities, should be required before the fleet can be removed from Australian waters t tained a similar provision to that embodied in the amendment, and the naval authorities had then to deal with six States Governments, instead of one central Government, as they have now. If this fleet is to be removable at any time without the Australian Government being consulted, we shall be denied the only opportunity we have of expressing our opinion upon the action of English statesmen in plunging the Empire into a war of which we may not approve. If the Government had demanded even a larger subsidy, I might have considered their proposal. No European power could land in Australia a hostile force which would be strong enough to successfully invade it. The Boer war has conclusively proved that. It has shown that the numerical strength of the attacking force",51,Malcolm Mceachabn Th E Naval Honourable Member For North Sydney Whom

What is to become of our Inter-State trade if the fleet is removed beyond the waters of the Australian station ? We have been told that our only danger is from raiding cruisers, which may evade the British ships and do damage to our coastal cities. If the British fleet were away, the whole of our Inter-State trade would be at the mercy of such vessels. I voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, and .against the second reading, in order to negative the agreement; but now that we find that we cannot do that, I think that our next best course is to try and improve it, and I think that the amendment now before' the Committee will have that effect.

The publication of the. right honourable and learned gentleman's remarks might spread that imputation broadcast throughout .the.country,and I repudiate such a suggestion. think I have as much right to "" stonewall "" this measure as has the Prime Minister, who has levelled against me the imputation that I wish to destroy the agreement, whereas, as a matter of fact,. I intend to vote against the amendment, and to support the Bill right through, even at the risk of being accused of adopting a "" yes-no"" attitude in regard to it have liked to see some of the articles of the agreement differently worded. As1 pointed out the other night, I object to the drafting of Article 2. There is nothing in it to prevent a case like this occurring :' A short time ago the mother country ceded part of Samoa to a foreign power. There is hardly a man in Australia who did not take strong exception to that action, and but for the difficulties in which the Empire was then involved, there would have been active protests on the subject from many parts of the continent. Similar action may be taken in regard to other islands of the Pacific, and we may then see the fleet which we are subsidizing ordered away, ostensibly to protectour interests, but really to police a transaction to which we are strongly opposed. That ought not to be possible under an agreement signed by the Prime Minister on behalf of Australia. But although I should like to see the terms of Article2 modified, I do not feel called upon, in view of the declaration of the Prime Minister that he will accept no amendment affecting the agreement, to take the responsibility of voting against it . AlthoughI think the agreement would have been an infinitely better one if Article2 had been differently drafted, I consider it, on the wholei a good bargain for Australia, and I throw upon the shoulders of the Prime Minister the responsibility for all its defects. I again strongly protest against the deliberate "" stone-walling "" to which the Prime Minister has been resorting in regard to this measure. I have seen many Ministers conducting Bills through Parliament, but I have never known a Minister to rise and reply to almost every speaker.. The Course adopted by the Prime Minister is not calculated to expedite the transaction of business. fore addressing myself to the amendment, to say that I think the honourable member for Kennedy has used words which are perhaps unfortunate. I am not now speaking of his references to myself, but to his statement that the Government Whip had been threatening honourable members with a dissolution.. I have consulted several honourable members since that statement was made, and I have not been able to obtain any confirmation of it . I do not think it should be allowed to pass unchallenged. It would convey an entirely I acknowledge that I should erroneous idea of public life and leave an improper impression as to the motives which actuate honourable members in speaking and acting with regard to a measure of this kind. The inevitable effect of the amendment will be to destroy the. B ill . The professional experience of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra should tell him, as our own cemmon sense does, that if we. alter the proposed agreement the whole of the Bill must fall to the ground; therefore honourable members who voted for the second reading would really be reversing theirvotes by supporting the amendment. Suppose that the Australian Squadron was cruising some distance from our shores and that the Admiral conceived it necessary to move perhaps some thousands of miles in a north-easterly direction. Suppose that instead of proceeding at once, as he would naturally feel impelled to do, in view of the advices which he had received, he were required by the terms of the naval agreement to come back to Australian ports in order to communicate with the Federal Government, and lay before them the contents of the confidential despatches which he had received from the Admiralty with a view to obtain their consent to the removal of the squadron beyond Australian waters. After proceeding thus far it would be necessary for him to go over to New Zealand, and repeat the process gone through here in order to obtain the consent of the New Zealand Government. By the time all this was completed the enemy wouldj no doubt, have either escaped or have worked the damage that it was the Admiral's object to prevent. "" Then the British Squadron, under this treble-headed command, would sail over the seas to do nothing, or worse than, nothing. If we are going to enter into any bargain at all in regard to naval defence, we must consent to",57,Malcolm Mceachabn Th E Naval Honourable Member For North Sydney Whom
232,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),I,58,Malcolm Mceachabn Th E Naval Honourable Member For North Sydney Whom
233,Mr Isaacs (Indi),"I .should like, be the control of the squadron being under one head. It is impossible to conceive of any effective action being taken under a divided' control. Leb us show the world that we are quibe content to place confidence in the British Government and the BritishA d miralty. I am sure that if the honourable and learned member for Illawarra looks into the matter he will find that his suggestion is not practicable. The second article of the agreement provides that the Australian Squadron is to remain in Australian waters except when it is necessary to'meet hostile vessels wherever Australian and New Zealand trade and interests are imperilled. What is there wrong about that ? a vital difference of opinion as to what were our interests 1 that? whether wo are to have any voice in the matter. could debate with the British Admiral the instructions which he has received from the Admiralty. How could we expect him to bring the whole of his squadron into Melbourne or Sydney or some other port, in order that he might lay bare the whole of his instructions to the members of the Federal Government, and thus enable them to justify to Parliament their action in consenting to the removal of the squadron from our shores. The whole proposition .seems absolutely absurd. We have to accept the agreement or reject it . tend to vote against the amendment, although I took a very strong stand against the Bill itself. If this amendment is carried the whole principle of the measure will go to the wall, and, in a matter involving great national issues, I do not care to follow methods which might savour of party tactics. I know that any idea of that kind is entirely foreign to the honourable and learned member for Illawarra. It is ridiculous to expect that the Imperial Government would accept the agreement if it were amended in substance. The agreement asks us to affirm the great principle of the concentration of three fleets within the sphere of operation mentioned in Article II . As a matter of fact our contribution of £200,000 a year would not represent more than one-twelfth of the total cost of maintaining the Australian, China, and East Indian'Squadrons. According to the information at our command, the cost of the three squadrons, exclusive of the 5 per cent, interest charged on the capital cost of the China Squadron, would amount to £2,250,000. desire us to affirm the principle that it is our duty to contribute to the cost of the naval defence of the Empire. point is, however, that we cannot reasonably seek to interfere with the control of the squadron on the strength of a contribution of a paltry one-twelfth towards the total cost of the three squadrons which may there not be be called upon to operate in Australian waters. Any suph amendment of the agreement.would amount practically to the rejection of the Bill. New Zealand must be considered in this matter; but the amendment COOK -The question is provides for the consent of only the Commonwealth Government to the removal of the fleet from Australian waters. As a matter of fact, I cannot conceive how we New Zealand takes an entirely different view of the matter. She has consented to allow the two vessels which are allotted to her to be removed from New Zealand waters ' without, her consent, and if we seek to exercise control over the whole squadron, .New Zealand will inevitably withdraw from the arrangement. AlthoughI may vote against the Bill even on the third reading, I think that we should regard the agreement in the light of a treaty which must be accepted or rejected in its entirety, and which cannot be varied. amended our Constitution 1 back to the people of Australia for technical adoption, after it was-agreed to in England. It was not cast into the crucible of Parliamentary debate, nor was it sent back to Australia for further discussion as to its terms. The Imperial authorities trusted to our good sense to adopt in to to the Bill as it had been agreed to by them. Mr E.' E.' McLEAN (Lang) I think it is a pity tliat the Prime Minister imported into this debate the question whether honourable members were favorable to separation or not.

243,Mr Higgins,"That was said sixteenthoroughly satisfied that the opponents of this particular agreement are actuated by a sense of what they conceive to be their public duty. It is unfair to import into a discussion of this character imputations of disloyalty, or indeed, any element which is likely to create discord. can all agree with the concluding utterances of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. A t the same time, more than one honourable member has leaned in the direction of stirring up party strife on the one side, and disloyal feeling on the other. That, however, has no reference to the Bill which is under consideration. Upon this occasion I intend to follow the example of Mr Chamberlain, who, in dealing with a measure to which he was entirely opposed, used every weapon that he could possibly employ to kill it . I am against this measure, and every principle which it'contains. It is bad for Australia to begin its national career by a surrender of rights which the States' had acquired from the Imperial Parliament. To me it is astonishing that the Prime Minister should have entered into such an agreement. Of course, the monetary consideration is as nothing compared with the value of the services to be rendered. My great point is that the Commonwealth has parted with its right to deal with this question as an Australian one. The honourable member for Lang declared that sixteen years ago, when the Australian States imposed a condition regarding the retention of the Auxiliary Squadroni n Australian waters, there was no Federation in existence. Yet now that the States have entered into Federation, he is prepared to surrender rights which they previously enjoyed. Does he contend that that is a move in the right direction 1 If it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of protecting Australian and Imperial interests that the control of the British and Australian fleets shall be placed entirely in the hands of the Admiralty authorities, the case should be proved up to the hilt. So far it has not been proved. A t the present time there is no great war imminent, but undoubtedly there is an Imperialistic tendency permeating the whole of the British-speaking races. Why should this agreement be ratified before the Australian people have been consulted upon it? I am disposed to fight it line by line, So that they may have an opportunity of saying whether or not they desire it. I venture to say that British people who are not prepared to contribute funds to defend their own honour are unworthy of any defence. Australians have frequently been twitted with a tendency to lean upon others, and there is some measure of truth in that skit. What does this agreement mean? It further exemplifies the justice of that accusation. We are to be content to lean upon the mother country, and to deprive our own people of that initiative which springs from independence by surrendering the entire control of the proposed fleet to the Imperial Government. In the future, what will the Commonwealth Executive say ? They will urge that they are not allowed to niake even a suggestion regarding the movements of the fleet. Is there a single honourable member who is bold enough to assert that there are not men in Australia who are as capable of great ideas and great heroism as are those of the United Kingdom? The statement made that Australia will never contain any person who is fit to direct a naval squadron is a reflection upon the ability Of our people. For these reasons, but chiefly because this agreement involves a radical departure from the existing order of things, I feel that those who are opposed to its principles should fight it line by line, even at the risk of a dissolution, so that the people may be given an early opportunity of declaring whether they favour the establishment of an Australian Navy, or the Bill submitted by the Prime Minister. glad that the honourable and learned member for Illawarra protested against the imputation that those who were supporting his amendment were disloyal. The Prime Minister inquired whether those who favoured the amendment were prepared to ally themselves with such support. Whatever may have been the purpose which the honourable member for Kennedy had in view in supporting Federation, it does not necessarily follow that because he favoured the union he desired to see the separation of Australia from the mother country. I would remind the Prime Minister of the company which he kept when he was fighting for Federation. A t that time he was engaged in endeavouring to secure the consent of a doubtf u l majority in New South Wales, and also in making herculean efforts to bring Queensland into the union. I believe that",60,Malcolm Mceachabn Th E Naval Honourable Member For North Sydney Whom

245,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I am verythe honourable member for Kennedy lent him considerable assistance in changing the trend of public opinion in Queensland in regard to Federation. apparently welcomed the support that he received from the honourable member on that occasion, and if that support was good enough for the Prime during the Federal' campaign, I do not know why he should question the present time. has taken place on this clause strongly emphasizes the wisdom of the agreement made in 18S7. The purpose of this amendment is practically to continue the provisions of that agreement.. That arrangement has existed for fifteen years, and during that time none of the calamities and difficulties which the honourable and learned member for Indi professes to believe would follow the adoption of this amendment have occurred. I believe that those who entered into the agreement of 1887 were desirous of providing for the defence of Australia. the Auxiliary Squadron was created under the control to a certain extent of the British Admiralty. that we should keep in view when dealing with this pi'oposal. The trade of Australia is of infinitely greater importance tlie people of this country than it is to the rest of the Empire. trade of the Commonwealth is not more than one-fifth of that of the whole of the Empire, so that while one of' the greatest disasters that we could suffer would be for us to be cut off from the Empire and be subject to a power alien to us, such an occurrence would not be of anything like the same vital consequence to the rest of the Empire. These are matters which 'should receive our consideration when we are dealing with questions of this kind. I find, according to Coghlan's Seven Colonies for 1901-2, that the total extra trade of Australia amounts to something like £80,000,000, while the Inter State £63,000,000, or a total of £143,000,000. The whole of that trade requires this special protection. of the Australian Commonwealth with the United Kingdom represents only something like £62,000,000 out of that total. I stated in the early part of the debate seems to be the 'general opinion of the military experts qualified to speak in regard to old-world complications. Mr Brown. Britain went to war with another great power our danger would be, not from any invasion, but from isolated attacks on our The Prime Minister port"",. A kind of guerilla warfare would, no doubt, be carried on to strike a fatal blow, if possible, at Great Britain's commerce. I have a pamphlet, by a naval expert, Lieutenant Minister Fearnley, which deals with this very question. He emphasizes very strongly the it at point that our danger is to be anticipated The debate which from attacks of the kind I have mentioned, and that we should seek to combat it by. providing special methods of naval defence. He tells us that during the Russo-Turkish war, when there was a possibility of Great Britain ranging herself on the side of Turkey, a movement was made by Russia to counteract any such hostile tendency by striking at our trade and commerce, and four large vessels were purchased and manned as commerce destroyers. The writer goes on to say that the movement initiated at that time is still maintained specially as part of Russia's aggressive policy, and That is why that at the present time her commerce destroyers consist of sixteen large vessels, of from 2,700 to 12,000 tons burthen, fitted And that is the point with every modern appliance necessary for their purpose. The writer also points out that during the trouble to which occurred between Great Britain and France, in connection with the Fashoda I'believe that the dispute, a number of leading French newspapers urged that the best policy which France could adopt would be to secure a fleet of these destroyers. Other large powers, according to Lieutenant Fearnley, have, masked boats of this description, which, at a. given signal, would be converted from the harmless traders which they appear to be into active. instruments of warfare, and would be able to"" strike a severe blow at British commerce. That being so, the question which we have to consider, apart from the concentration of war-ships at a. particular point, is the precautions which are necessary to be taken in order to protrade represents ' another tect our commerce along our coasts, and to guard, as far as possible, our oversea trade. It has been said that this agreement, inOn the other hand, the trade stead of operating against the establishment of an Australian Navy, will assist in that direction. But what promise""What has been given of the adoption of such a policy by the Government? As the result of the discussion on the Estimates, submitted to us for the years 1901-2 and If Great 1902-3 considerable reductions were ordered to be made in the naval and military expenditure. The Government had to provide for a-decreased expenditure on both branches of the forces, but the honourable member for Cowper has shown that while the reductions so far as the naval defences were concerned represented something like 34 per cent, they amounted to only something like 14 per cent, in the case of the .military forces. This fact indicates that in carrying out the mandate of the House that the vote should be reduced the Government .sacrificed the small naval forces which had been initiated by the States and retained -the military forces practically on the footing upon which they existed. Judging from this, their policy has been in the' direction of giving every attention to the military forces, and allowing the naval forces to be .handed over to the control of the British Government. Is that the kind of policy we were promised in pre-federation days? We reasons why we should federate, was that we 'should thereby bring about a more effective .system of naval and military defence. We find, however, that the Government have practically handed over the navy-.whic h should be the most important branch'of our defences^-to the British Government. If that Government is. best qualified to deal with our naval defence, why should it .not also arrange for our military defence 1 Why should not the Commonwealth Government, in the name of economy, and at the shrine of Kyabram, abolish the Department of Defence, translate the worthy 'Minister in charge of that Department to 'some other sphere, and hand over the whole control of the naval and military defences '-of the Commonwealth to the British Go""vernmont t If it is possible to secure the -efficiency which the advocates of this scheme claim will result from it , is it not reasonable to suppose that a similar result may -be secured by dealing with our military -defences in a like mannerJ I do not believe, however, that a proposal of this kind affecting either our naval or military forces would > be in the interests of the Commonwealth, or -in the interests of that union with ""the ' mother country which we desire to see maintained. As the amendment is in the direction of maintaining the control which was wisely provided for in the original agreement, I will support it. The experience of the past .fourteen years has not shown any objections to it, and I see no reason to anticipate the creation of any friction in the future. If it were intended that our relations with Great Britain should be altered, and that Australia should, in the matter of defence, be merely a joint in the lion's tail, the Prime Minister would be on safe ground in insisting upon our acceptance of the letter of the agreement; but if Australian .is to work in harmony with Great Britaini n the defence and control of our common interests, I think that we shall do well to adopt the amendment.
