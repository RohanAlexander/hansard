MrJ . H . CATTS Mri Speaker member objecting? MrJ . H . CATTS -Yes. I wish to understand the position before the question is put. I desire to know whether, if leave be granted, honourable members w ill be precluded from making any remarks on the subjects dealt with in the statement of tlie Prime Minister? The right honourable gentleman had an opportunity to make his statement on the Address-inReply; and it would appear that he is taking this opportunity, and in such a way, that no other honourable members w ill be able to discuss the questions he deals w it h ; and unless we have some opportunity of discussing the matter I object. the House that the Prime Minister have leave to make a statement? Leave granted. ister and Attorney-General) [ 3 . 1 0 ] The statement. I wish to make amounts to a .mere capitulation of facts, and w ill be very brief. all to address myself to the sugar question The entered into an agreement with the State of Queensland-the main points of which are perfectly well known to this House and the country-uude r which the Commonwealth has to take from Queensland all sugar produced within that State at a price of £ 2 1 per ton, 94 per cent, titre. The agreement is for a term of twelve months, and postulates certain fixed conditions obtaining during its currency. They are that the price shall'be £ 2 1 per ton, that the wages, and conditions of labour shall be as prescribed by the t r i bunal which gave its award before the agreement: was entered into, and that refined sugar shall be sold to the public at 3£d. per l b . The honourable member for In d i mentioned yesterday the effect of the agreement upon manufacturers, especially manufacturers for export. I wish to announce that the Government have I made an arrangement which will enable manufacturers for export to obtain sugar at the same price as they paid last year; so that their position in that respect'is I s it the pleasure in no wise altered. Honourable members know that the practice in regard to export has been to grant a rebate equivalent to the amount) of the import duty. That, however, was varied during recent years, the rebate being fixed at an arbitrary I s the honourable amount of £ 4 , which was the mean of the import duties spread over foreign sugar, plus"" home-grown sugar used for export purposes. It is ou this basis tihe preseni arrangement has beeu made. Jam manufacturers therefore will enter upon the forthcoming season in exactly the same position as they occupied last year. I shall explain later precisely how this will affect the Commonwealth in relation to its agreement with Queensland. I desire now to make a statement witb regard to the wool clip. As honourable members know, the greater part of last season's wool clip was sold to the British Governmeut at a flat rate of 15£d. per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profit, if any, I s it the pleasure of on such of the wool as was sold for other than military purposes. Thatt arrangement has been satisfactory, and although I am not in a position now to announce definitely how much money will be returned to the pastoralists, I wish to announce, in order to remove a misapprehension that is in the minds of many .wool-growers, that 10 per cent, will be I desire first of paid on a day to be fixed next month. In regard to the new season's clip, honourable Conunonwealth has members who have given the matter any thought musb have realized that unless we had succeeded in financing the next clip Australia would have been faced with a position of financial chaos, if not disaster, and that the disposal of the clip has been a matter of very serious concern to the Government. I am glad to be able to announce thafc the Government have now completed arrangements with the British Governmenb under which the latter will take the whole of the Australian merino and cross-bred clip at the same price and upon the same conditions as last'season's clip. I think the pastoralists of the Commonwealth are to be congratulated on thafc arrangement. There is one other matter of the utmost possible importance to which I wish to",13,Ministeria L Statement

5,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nrefer, and I can deal with it only in the broadest possible outline. I refer to the position of the Commonwealth in regard to the export of its products overseas. Honourable members are aware that Germany is relying for victory in this war upon its submarine campaign, and it is idle to deny tire gravity of the position arising therefrom. The losses of vessels are very great, and are not limited even by the sufficiently startling'returns which we read each week. The campaign has other effects than the sending of vessels to the bottom of the ocean, amongst others, it deters a very large percentage of neutral tonnage from venturing out of port. The effects of the submarine campaign upon this country are most serious. shall mention but one instance, which, if the people will consider ifc, will bring home to them, perhaps, better than anything else can do, what war means to the economic and industrial welfare of this country. One of the terms of the contract made between the Commonwealth and the British Government was that the latter should move 600,000 tons of wheat per month from Australia. During the month of June, not one bushel of wheat was shipped from this country to Britain. WereI to speak for hours, it would be impossible to conjure up a picture more striking than is limned by this bald statement, viewed in its proper perspective. The need for shipping grows with each passing day. Our products are heaping up here in Australia because of the damming of the channels along* which they formerly found their way to market. of our being able to ship a not insignificant quantity by way of America. The Government is endeavouring to marshal its resources for the transport of wheat, flour, and such other products as are now permitted to enter Great Britain for shipment to the western -coast of America, to be taken thence overland to the Atlantic, and so to Great Britain. We hope in that way to make much better use of our shipping,' as each vessel will have a shorter mileage to steam per ton of produce carried, and the utility of the fleet at our disposal will be very substantially increased. will relieve the position only to a relatively small degree, and the realization of the. fact has compelled the, Government to attack the problem of ship[5]-2 building in deadly earnest. We know that even under the most favorable conditions the quantity of shipping that can be constructed in Australia will be but a small part of what is needed to transport our products. But we believe that with the hearty co-operation of labour, and the adoption of those methods by which alone modern industry can succeed, we may within a reasonable time add materially to the tonnage at our disposal. The result of a conference with the representatives of fifty-two branches of organized labour interested in this project has been most gratifying. We have been met in a spirit which leaves nothing to be desired. I The Government asked, as a basis for the establishment of shipbuilding, guarantees for (1) the continuity of industrial operations, (2) the dilution of labour, and (3) the adoption of piece-work under certain conditions. After long discussions, affording ample opportunity for careful consideration of the position, after the remission of questions to the unions, and the making of further explanations, so that each particular rjoint was hammered out in detail, the conferenceyesterday carried the following resolution:That this conference, after hearing the Prime Minister's reply to the reports and decisions of the unions on the questions submitted, and while respecting the unions' decisions thereon, is strongly of the opinion that the best interests of the unions concerned would be served by adopting the proposals of the Government. The conference has now disbanded. The delegates are returning to their unions, deHappily, there is a prospect termined to recommend the adoption of the proposals of the Government, and in anticipation of their recommendation being accepted, we shall take all steps necessary for the immediate launching of the enterprise. The acceptance by the unions of the proposals of the Government will, however, be a condition precedent, lacking which nothing will be done. The material that will be used in the building of the ships will, with very few exceptions, be produced and manufactured in this country, so that the industry will be purely Australian. I do not wish to create the This, however, impression that this is the only or the final solution of the question. The Government realizes that upon the maintenance of a steady stream of products to Great Britain must for many months depend the safety of that country, and will exhaust every means at its disposal to insure an adequate supply of tonnage. The British Ministers, living in the very maelstrom of war, are doing their best, notwithstanding the avalanche of criticism directed against them by men who have not their tremendous responsibilities. They have shown a strong desire to help Australia, and a keen sense of appreciation of our efforts to co-operate with them. By the purchase of our wool clip, our financial and industrial situation has been enormously relieved. The financial position of the Commonwealth would have bordered upon the impossible without the £40,000,000 that has been paid by the British Government for our wool. As far as I can see, however, there is no solution of the difficulty of exporting beef and mutton. There is a solution -thoug h it may not be altogether satisfactory-for the difficulty of the fruit-growers. The local market will consume a fair quantity of the fresh fruit 1 produced, and there is a possibility of preserving the rest. But we can hardly hope to find refrigerated tonnage for our normal quantity of export meat, while our cool storage depots are already full to the brim. The contract that we made with the British Government for the export of rabbits is thus brought, temporarily, at all events, to an end. We cannot put' any more meat into cold storage, and what is now there will be taken out so slowly that the pastoralists must for some time maintain their flocks and herds upon the hoof. The wool having been sold, I do not know that the growers of sheep need be cast down by the prospect, though the situation of the cattle men is, of course, different. Insulated tonnage is scarce at the best of times, and has now become as rare as diamonds. It may be that the compulsory increase of our flocks and herds will prove to be of very great advantage to Australia. There is accumulated in this country cargo sufficient for fifteen refrigerated steamers steamers, and the number of vessels available to lift it is to that almost as a mole hill to Mount Everest. These facts illustrate our dependence on the Empire for our economic, financial, and national existence, and, at the same time, go to show better than anything else how Australia can help to win the war. They show, too, Mr Hughes. how helpless Australia is by herself to do anything, even to exist. There are things about which we may not speak, dangers grave beyond the power of words to express, but these things. about which we can speak show clearly what .the war means to us, and how necessary it is that all sorts and conditions of men in Australia, employers and employees, rich and poor alike, should adjust themselves to their present environment, so that each man may do his duty. The honourable member for Corangamite asked me if there is any chance of getting cheese away. My slumbers are disturbed nightly by just such questions as that. Is there any chance for exporting wine, eucalyptus, mutton, and many other things? I can only repeat that while the number'of genera] cargo-carrying steamers is severely limited, the number of those possessing insulated space has come down almost to zero. WhatI have said is not to be regarded by the pastoralists or others as the final and irrevocable determination of the problem. It is a statement of the present position, which is growing worse every day. America is making heroic efforts, as Great Britain has been doing all along, to meet with construction of shipping the destruction of the Hun. Buti t requires no specialized knowledge to understand that it is easier to destroy than to build up, and that those engaged in the work of destruction start with a tremendous advantage in their favour. And the situation must grow gradually worse. We can only face the position with resolution, do what is possible to ease it , and pray that on sea and on land our Eorces may soon press home their attack and snatch victory from the palsied hands of the foe. Another matter to which I wish to refer relates to the question of the storage of those products which we are not able to transport oversea. In normal seasons, and 548 general cargo during the month of July all' the wool stores are empty. The position to-day is quite different. There are hundreds of thousands of bales of wool now in the stores, and next month the new clip will begin to trickle in, and from then on the new storehouses which we have secured will become full, and more than full, of the new wool. This problem, however, is a comparatively minor one when compared with the problem that faces us with regard to wheat. more urgent and difficult. By next February, unless there is an outlet found other than those we can see now, we shall have 6,000,000.tons of wheat in Australia. TomorrowI am to meet the State Premiers in order to finally arrange the details of a wheat storage scheme. I hope that the matter will be settled to-morrow, so that a system of silage construction may be begun without delay. It is a matter of extreme urgency, and should not be delayed in any circumstances. I have not had an opportunity of diseussing with the Tasmanian representatives the proposition for drying apples, but the Government have called a conference of fruit-growers, which will meet during this month, with a view to organizing the frui t industry on such a basis as will enable it to dispose of its product to the best possible advantage during 'the coming season. The conference will consider the possibilities of marketing fresh fruit throughout Australia. We shall endeavour by judicious organization to get every fruit-grower the best possible price for his product of fresh fruit by preventing irregular competition between one grower and another and the cutting of one another's throat. deavour will also be made to deal with such fruit as cannot be so marketed by drying, canning, and by jam making. In this connection I was very pleased to be able to announce, as I did at the beginning of my speech, that arrangements have been made whereby sugar can be obtained at such a price as will enable the manufacturers in this country to compete with those in other countries in the matter of export trade. Later: State Premiers to-morrow, I do not wish to have it said that the House did not have an opportunity of considering the matter of silo storage. I , therefore, suggest that it direct its attention to the question, in order that I may be armed with the best advice and counsel when I meet the Premiers, and so that I may get the job settled. have anything of a useful nature to say in connection with any of the matters upon which I have touched, I hope they That is much will take this opportunity to say it, so that the Government may have the fullest advice on these matters. business before the House. Does the Prime Minister desire to get the leave of the House to make a further statement? suggest that the Prime Minister should move a motion, which the House might discuss. Mr J. H . CATTS I understand that this matter is open to discussion or to objection. MT. SPEAKER -The matter is no» open to discussion without a question before the Chair. There is no motion before the House. Mr J. H . CATTS I object to this procedure. It is apparent that the Government have no 'business to go on with. move ""That the statement be printed,"" the matter is open for debate. Mr J. H .

During the financial year 1916-1917, to which these Estimates relate, we had a number of Supply Bills. asked the House to deal with such measures during the twelve months, and ©very penny of expenditure for which these Estimates provide has already been >voted. That being so, although honourable members may avail themselves of this opportunity to discuss any question of importance relating to these Estimates, I would remind them that they have had such an opportunity on at least four or five different occasions during the financial year, when Supply Rills have been submitted. On this occasion, as on many has the Treasurer to readjust! adjustments to make. The whole of the revenue and expenditure has been dealt with, and th© moneys have all been spent with the f u l l authority of Parliament. Interim financial statements having reference to the year just closed were put beIs that not required by the Standfore honourable members on the 6th March, 14th June, and l l t h inst. TheN o .

We are supThree different Treasurers have posed to be the custodians of the public purse. mates of a previous Government. with any particular Government in this case, but I hold that, as custodians of the public purse, we certainly ought to have some control over the expenditure of the Commonwealth.

In that case they were submitted in good time. The Estimates for the financial year beginning on 1st July, 1907, were submitted en Sth August, 1907; those for 1908 on the 14th October, 1908; those for 1909 on the 12th August of that year; those for 1910 on the 7th September of that year; those for 3911 on 26th October of that year; and the Estimates for 1912 on 1st August, 1912. The Estimates for the financial year beginning 1st July, 1913, were not dealt with until 2nd October of that year; and those for 3914 were dealt with on 3rd December-whe n practically six months of the year to which they related had expired. The Estimates for the year beginning 1st July, 1915, were dealt with on 9th May, 1916, or only a month before the expiration of the financial year; while the Estimates for 1916-17 are being dealt with to-night, after the financial year to which they relate has actually closed. The whole of the expenditure for which they provide has been made without Parliament being afforded an opportunity to discuss it. It may be said that this delay was in consequence of the war tical situation. have been a political situation extending over the last three years. the matter right. I agree with the honourable member's view.' Treasurer will make an effort in the direction I have indicated, but I am going to enter my protest lest he should be tempted to continue this very objectionable practice. Since the outbreak of war in 1914, there might have been some with the Defence' Estimates. We have been passing through abnormal times, so far as Defence expenditure is concerned; butwill any one say that the war is any justification for the failure of the House to deal with the Estimates of the ordinary Departments ? Such a contention cannot be substantiated. The Finance Comexperts in connection with this very matter, and has been told by them that the ideal system would be to deal with the Estimates in the first month of the year to which they relate. Under that system, Supply Bills would be unnecessary. These, experts told us that heads of Departments should be required to supply draft Esti-. mates to the Treasurer not later than April in each year, so as to afford him opportunity to cub down where necessary, and to make whab alterations are required between then and the end of June. If that practice were followed, there would be no need for Supply Bills, which, under the present system, are put before us every two or three months, and serve only to delay the transaction of public business. They also add materially to our printing bill. In these days, when ib ia necessary to economize, I know of no place where economy could be practised with better results than in this very House. It is unfair that millions of pounds of public money should be expended without members of Parliament having a chance to make their voices heard as to what reductions should be made, and as to whether or not the votes asked for should be granted. I shall not take up 'the time of the Committee in dealing with this subject further, but I felt that I should be failing in my duty if I permitted these Estimates to be passed as a whole without entering my protest. If the Treasurer does nofc alter this state of affairs, he may expect to come in for some very severe criticism at the hands of honourable members on both sides.

This was the result of what I shall not call a trick, but a piece of legerdemain, which no doubt honourable members opposite thought very brilliant. The idea was to put the Ministry in a difficulty in consequeuce of their having no legislation to submit; and it was simply a well-conceived piece of very transparent conjuring. The Government very naturally thought that when the Address-in-Reply was before us honourable members opposite would have the courage to say in the House what they had been telling the people outside. them has had that courage or stood up to say one word against the Government or their policy; their sole idea was, by this little ruse, to put the Government in a -difficulty before the public. TheM in istry was perfectly justified in assuming thab tlie Labour party would, as it always has done, waste three or four weeks in criticising the Governmenb of the day. NowI suppose honourable members opposite imagine that they will be able to say to the people in the parks on Sunday, . "" See what the Government have done; we have brought them to a pass in which they have no business to put before us."" As a member of some years' standing, I think the Government were justified in assuming that the Labour party were going to waste time, as they have wasted it in previous sessions, over the Addressin-Reply. Last night the Leader of the Opposition took occasion to charge me, as I have been charged for the last fifteen years, with not attending Parliament as regularly as he does himself. There is this distinction between the honourable gentleman and myself-that I live in another State and have occupations of other kinds than Parliament, whereas he has lived at the Seat has made a profession of politics, and has nothing else to think about. That is my answer to the honourable member. I challenge him to compare my attendance for many years with that of any Labour member from any State but Victoria. It ill-becomes the honourable member, who is supposed to set an example in courtesy as well as in politics, to the This afternoon we members of his own party, to harp on an old song of this sort which has really nothing in ifc, and only casts. reflection on himself, seeing that he lives within a couple of miles of Parliament House, and has made a business of politics for all these years. I repeat that I consider that the Government would be perfectly justified if they were to move the adjournment of the House for a fortnight. The measures they have intimated their intention to place before us, including one connected wibh shipbuilding, and another with repatriation, represent schemes that require a great deal of thought on the part of Ministers, and are open to much honest and candid criticism in the House.

If the honourable member really feels very sore, I should not mind apologizing for what I said, but I do not think that he was justified in the remarks he made as to the members of the-Labour party playing billiards and bowls. I think that my record will bear inspection, not only for regular attendance here, but for attendance in the Chamber during the whole of the sittings. Ifc is well known that the honourable member is the worse offender in this regard, and cares more about earning f a t fees at the Law Courts than he does about his parliamentary attendance.

The Estimates are kept back as long as possible, and generally about the last week in the session there is an all-night sitting, and honourable members are told that if they do not pass the Estimates and send them to the Senate before the next day the Senate will adjourn, and the public servants will not be able to get their money.

First of all, I wish to reply to the 'flattering remarks made by the honourable member for Parkes. charged honourable members with playing billiards and bowls. He ought to have added that sometimes honourable members are seen in the bar. This is the first time that I have ever heard any honourable member speak of his fellow members in that fashion, and the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes reflect no credit upon him. A billiard table has a straight cushion, without any indentation to accommodate big stomachs; that is why he does not play billiards. And he cannot play bowls because he has not seen his feet for years. The remarks of the honourable member were not warranted. always thought that he conducted his politics on a higher plane than such personalities, and I believe that he w ill apologize for what he has said. The Estimates for 1916-17, like all others, are supposed to be a true reflection of the expenditure by the Government. As a matter of fact, they are not. We were told that the expenditure by the British Government on behalf of the Commonwealth for the maintenance and equipment of our troops at the Front was about £33,000,000, of which we had repaid £24,000,000 still owing. recently I made a statement that the Commonwealth owed the British Government on this account. £50,000,000 or £60,000,000. Sir that statement was correct. honourable gentleman most emphatically that he cannot prove correct his statement thab the Commonwealth owes only £23,500,000, to the British Government. The position of Australia in. regard to the Forces sent abroad is different from that of Canada. Canadian Government places its troops on the transport u n t i l their return, the British Government pays the whole of the expenditure. Australia, on the other hand, enlists, trains, equips, and transI propose to say a few words ports troops to the Old' Country, maintains them there and at. the Front, and for every article used, and every bullet and shell fired, the Australian people have to pay. We have been told that the cost ot maintaining the soldier abroad is approximately 6s. a day. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to fche South African War, in which the The honourable gentleman British Government maintained in the field about 250,000 men. The whole of the manufacturing resources of fche Mother Country were utilized at high pressure to produce commodities for the troops in Africa,and the greatest mercantile marine in the world was hard pressed, at a time when there were no enemy ships abroad, to transport those commodities. Yet when I asked the Assistant Ministerf o r Defence whafc percentage of the material and equipment used by our troops was manufactured in Australia, he answered, "" A l m o s t the whole of it . "" It is impossible for that I statement to be correct. We have sent from Australia as many men as the British Government had in South Africa during the Boer War. And"" we know that there is not enough khaki manufactured in Australia to keep one division supplied. Britain manage to keep 2,000,000 men in France?

The delay this yeaT has been due largely to the political circumstances which brought about the last election. It iB often a difficult matter for Ministers to obtain Estimates from the Departments, and the preparation of Estimates is sometimes delayed because -urgent political business is being pushed on by a Government for party purposes. delay ? gest a remedy. Nothing much is to be gained by continual growling. What we need is a way out of the difficulty. Members know that now and again the consideration of Estimates w ill be held up for perhaps two days, merely to wrin g a promise from a Government, and that after such a "" stone w a l l "" millions have been voted in a few minutes. What is the use of holding up our hands in holy horror at the delay on the present occasion? Those who support a Government naturally support its Estimates, while an OpThere is position naturally debates every item in them, in order to delay public business. That is part of the political game, which is as old as the hills, and which, I suppose, w ill be continued in the future. Personally, I cannot see that anything is to be gained by holding up Estimates, except for the purpose of getting information regarding any particular item that may be challenged. This Government is The States should not pledged to do all it can to secure economical administration in the interests of the war, and I believe that Ministers in The Commonwealtb should tend to f u l f i l their promises. I remember an occasion on which a group of members supporting a State Government went to Ministers ancl said, "" Y o u must reduce your Estimates to a certain sum, or we shall not support you."" A Government (Hindmarsh) will take more notice of action like that than of anything else. It is useless to complain about delay in the submission of Estimates if members are not prepared to take any practical step to secure reform. For twenty-five years Mr Joseph Hume, in the House of Comm'ons, did noNo doubt, the honourable thing but challenge the Estimates of the Government; but Mr John Bright, who sat beside him, said that it was a useless waste of time. He was of the opinion that it was only by bringing pressure to bear directly on a Government that ref o r m could be secured. It is for those who support a Government to see that the administration of affairs is sound and economical. I do not say that any demonstration is required at the present time. My object is to expose the humbug of the system of complaining ineffectually. In my opinion, the country ^does not suffer much from delay in the consideration of Estimates, though it does suffer when a party pledged to economy does not see that the Government gives effect to its policy. The responsibility is on the Ministerial supporters, rather than on the Government.

Another parliamentary humbug is for members to urge a Government to exercise economy in administration, and then to ask for increased expenditure on some particular object which they favour. The inconsistency of such action is obvious. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated in his constituency that we owe the British Government something like £60,000,000 on account of war expenditure. In saying that, the honourable member was talking of something about which he had no knowledge, and might as well have named £200,000,000, or any other sum It is generally believed that we are indebted to the Old Countryi n this connection for from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000; but it must be a difficult matter for the Home authorities to furnish precise information regarding our indebtedness at any particular time. However, I agree with those who say that we should have information from them on this subject as soon as it can be obtained. MrJ . H .

Let the House give me the benefit of its opinions on the subject, so that I may have something to go on .with when I meet the Conference to-morrow."" Was there ever a more abject confession of the emptiness of the Government's professions than is to be found in the situation which is now before us! The Prime Minister, by leave of the House, made a statement in regard to the sale of wheat, and other questions. He did not read from any paper; but, in his dilemma, it occurred to him that such statements were often read, and that he might move in this case' that the paper be printed. In that way, he thought it would be possible to have a discussion which would extend over a few hours. ing from what he did when he was on the other side. Mr J. H . CATTS -The PrimeM in ister's ingenuity and resource must be very poor indeed if mere force of habit can alone help him out of such a difficulty. The farmers of Australia should carefully note that the Government had no business to put before the House to-day; that they suspended the sitting for three [6] or four hours because they had not one shred of business to put before honourable members, and that there was on the business-paper, in the name of a private member, a notice of motion dealing with the immense wastage of wheat which is now going on and the enormous losses being inflicted upon the farmers, as is shown by the Farmers and Settlers Association orable member is now anticipating a motion on the business-paper. to the mice. Mr J. H . CATTS -That interjection able member for Calare. We know that the daily newspapers will not expose the hyprocrisy of the Government's "" winthe-war ' ' policy. They are owned by the capitalists who provided the money for the Government's party campaign at the last elections, and they will shield the Government all the time.' They will hide these facts, and go on excusing the Let us have a disshortcomings of this Administration. They do that day after day. But we have in the galleries some few people who have witnessed the spectacle of this so called "" Win-the-war "" Government meeting the House without an item of business to put before it. I rose only to put this fact pointedly before those members of the public who are able to listen to me and to those who read Hansard. My desire was to let them know that this Government not only refuse to deal with important matters affecting the farmers of this country, but that, after all their talk of winning the war, after all their flapping of the flag and their resort to patriotic shibboleths, they have not one proposition to submit for winning the war or for helping those who are fighting our battles at the Front,.or the dependants they have left behind them. orable members required any proof of the hollowness of the Opposition cry, they have had it in the speech to which we have just listened. It is evident that the trick which they sought to play this afternoon has been countered to some extent by the' introduction of these Estimates. No one knows better than does the honourable member for Cook that, although the expenditure for which these Estimates provide has been dealt with by",27,Honourable Members Hear Hear

89,Mr Poynton (Grey) [9.8],"If honway of Supply Bills, it is necessary that the Estimates-in-chief should be passed, and that they should be followed up by an Appropriation Bill. It matters not whether such business be done now or six months hence; the fact remains that it must be done, and the Government are to be commended for introducing these Estimates to occupy our attention while they finalize their proposals. I invite honourable members to consider the hypocrisy of the cry of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. It was only yesterday that the Governor General's Speech outlining the work of the session was submitted to us, and I bave repeatedly known the debate in this House on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to extend over several weeks. The honourable member for Cook had something to say regarding the question of repatriation. I have a very vivid recollection of the honourable member's departure for Canada some time ago. He went away, and left to his mates in the party the work of dealing with repatriation. That being so, the less he says as to his anxiety to transact such business the better. Some question has been raised as to who prepared these Estimates. As a matter of fact, three different Treasurers have had something to do with them. were brought down in the first place by the honourable member for Capricornia. Later on I had a share in the handling of them for three months, and subse* quently the present) Treasurer came into office, and took them over. When I took office as Treasurer I foresaw that there was likely to be a shortage in the returns for the financial year which closed on 30th June last, and that we should not be able to make ends meet, save by the -exercise of rigid economy and the free use of the pruning knife. When a Treasurer leaves office before his Estimates have been dealt with, it is somewhat dimcult for him to ascertain the degree of retrenchment for which he has been responsible. But when I vacated the TreasuryI was careful to ask the Secretary, Mr Collins, to furnish me with a return showing the reductions made in the Estimates while I was there. I have all the details of the reductions made by me, but it is sufficient for me to inform the Committee that I reduced the Estimates to the extent of £2,150,000, and this notwithstanding that I increased by £200,000 Mr Poynton. the amount provided for pensions, and made provision for an expenditure of £750,000 in connection with repatriation. Shortly put, these Estimates haye been reduced to the extent of something like £3,000,000 since they were originally introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia. I find that, although the financial year nominally closed with a surplus of £1,678,000, there was actually a deficit of over £1,300,000, since we brought forward £3',000,000 from the previous year. Let me now refer to some of the taxation which was imposed while I was in office. The Income Tax Bill, although mutilated to some extent by the Senate, has been responsible for a fair increase in revenue, the returns from that source jumping from £3,900,000 to £5,600,000. Then, again, the revenue from probate duties rose from £626,000 to over £1,000,000 last year. The loss of revenue has occurred chiefly in"" connection with Customs and to a small extent in connection with Excise. The falling-off in Customs revenue during the' financial year was largely attributable to the submarine campaign. If ships cannot come here, there must necessarily be a fallingoff of Customs revenue. Some honourable members have complained that the enThey tertainments tax has not realized as much as was anticipated. The responsibility for that fact, however, rests with the House itself. The schedule to the Bill providing for the tax was ruthlessly cut down by honourable members. They were not even satisfied with the exemption of 3d. and 6d. tickets, but practically extended the exemption up to tickets of Is. each. As the result of their action considerable revenue has been lost, many of the cheaper picture shows having reduced their charge from Is. to 9d. .so as to avoid the tax. It is interesting to note the amount that we have received in taxation, the bulk of which has been imposed for war purposes. The income tax represents over £5,000,000; the land tax over £2,000,000; the probate duties over £l,000-,000; and the amusement tax over £110,000. This return from the amusement tax is only for a half year, so that iti may be doubled in order to show the total revenue. These figures all taken together represent a total of about £9,025,000. We have now to briefly look at the commitments for the war for last year. In round figures our war loans represent £80,000,000 was raised in Australia, and the balance in England. debtedness bhe interest amounts to £5,850,000, and a 1 per cent, sinking f u n d means another £1,300,000. war pensions for this year will amount to about £1,000,000, and repatriation to £750,000. indebtedness which must be met by taxation, and what I desire to show is that our direct taxation up to the present has met our commitments in connection with the war. The figures I have just mentioned total about £8,900,000, and our direct taxation amounts to £9,025,000. whole of the land tax revenue ? shown that we came out on the wrong side of the ledger by £1,223,000. I had, however, provided for a war profits tax, which, on the best estimates I could obtain, £1,500,000 in the two years 1914 and 1915. Government to pass a War Profits TaxationB ill , because I felt that otherwise we should come out on the wrong side. Besides, it is nob fair to those who have to pay the tax to delay the measure, for it means that we shall have to come down on them for three years' taxation, which will be all the more difficult for them to meet. I have heard, several people complain of the amount spent on the war, and it was quite common to hear it said during bhe elections that we had "" done enough."" In this connection, it is interesting to know what is the charge on the people of the Old Country as compared with the charge on the people of Australia. Quite recently it was announced in a speech by Mr Bonar Law that Great Britain is spending £213,000,000 per month, and this, with population of 50,000,000, means 2s. 9d. per head for every man, woman and child. In Australia our expenditure is £4,500,000 per month, or £147,942 per day, which, spread over a population of 5,000,000, works out at 7d. per head, as against 2s. 9d. at Home. In other words, England is spending, in order to win. the war, four and three-quarter times as much per head as we are in Australia. lent to the Allies? £130,000,000, of which. occasion I referred to our commitments for the'future, which will have to be met On this inby very heavy taxation. Last year, at any rate, the whole of our public works were constructed out of revenue, repreThe senting an amount, of about £4,714,000 up to the 30th June, 1917. In the previous year £2,000,000 was spent on public In these figures we have works out of loan, but last year the whole expenditure was out of revenue. Last year we spent for war purposes out of revenue £8,400,000, so that there is a good margin to work upon if necessary. It is quite evident to me thab it will be impossible to carry on our public works out of revenue, and all works, except those the of the most urgent character, will have to be closed down. There is one phase of the war, and of the financial position in . Australia, that is truly remarkable. Prior to the war in 1914, the accumulated deposits in the savings banks of Australia amounted to something like would have produced about £84,000,000, whereas about two months ago, as shown from figures supplied by Before the elections I urged the the Commonwealth Bank, they stood at about £100,000,000, showing an increase of over £16,000,000. Then the deposits in the Associated Banks in 1914 were £163,000,1)00, whereas the latest figures show that they now stand at £183,843,000. These increases amount to about £36,000,000, and show the savings of the people during the period of the war, notwithstanding the fact that we have withdrawn from the savings of the people some £80,000,000 ""on loan. For war purposes defrayed from loan money there is something over £20,000,000 lying to our credit in the Commonwealth Bank, and if I mistake not, there is about £22,000,000 due to the Imperial Government for what they have done for our troops at the Front. In this connection I understand ' that the Treasurer has made an arrange£7,000,000 per day, or ment to pay so much per month. I desire, however, to refer to the haphazard methods adopted in the past for arriving at an estimate of our indebtedness to the Imperial Government; and a little in cident that came under my notice throws some light on the matter. When I went to the Treasury, I noticed in my predecessor's statement an item of £1,900,000 which was said to be the amount due to the Imperial Government for moneys expended on our Forces up to the 30th June, 1916. I could not get any data to satisfy",28,Honourable Members Hear Hear

93,Mr Poynton,"Yes. On a previousme, and I cabled to London, Avith the result that I found that the indebtedness, instead of being £1,900,000, was £8,500,000. This, I think, bears out what I say as to the haphazard, lax way of estimating the expenditure on the other side. In my opinion,' there ought to be a bigger effort made to repay this amount to the Imperial Government, who, I am sure, are doing this work very willingly. quoted represents the accumulations from the beginning of the war. another accumulation which may place us in a false position. Already the accumulation is estimated at £22,000,000, and there is a further estimated accumulation for deferred pay, which is not referred to in any of the figures given to us by the Treasurer. any rate, it will represent a good many more millions. It is well for us to undermodities overseas. Throughout the Comstand exactly what the financial position is, and I suggest that, instead of keeping the £20,000,000 lying in the bank. and earning no interest, it would be much sounder finance to reduce the Imperial, debt. There is much that I should like to say in regard to what England is doing in connection with the war, but I do not wish to occupy further time. will have to be stringent economy in Australia in regard to public works and other expenditure, and there must also be heavy taxation. The complaints that have been made against the Government this afternoon about ithe non-introduction of legislation are, in my opinion, unreasonable. Much of this legislation is of a very technical character and requires the very closest scrutiny; and I believe that when the measures for repatriation and other purposes are introduced they -will commend themselves to honourable members.. In one respect the Government is not doing all that is possible to win the war. It is evident, from the statement made by the Prime Minister to-day, that Australia is in a serious position in regard to the shipment of frozen meat, rabbits, wheat, butter, and other commodities, and it seems to me that the Government have not done as much as they could have done to utilize some of the large steamers engaged in the coastal trade. We are all anxious to make sacrifices to assist the Old Country and to feed our Allies, but we are allowing to continue on the coast large steameTS such as the Canberra and the Katoomba, some of them of 8,000 and 9,000 tons, when smaller steamers could handle the coastal trade, thus freeing the bigger vessels for the transport of our products to the Old Country. shipping on the coast to-day. enough; but if we are to make sacrifices to win the war, surely the shipping companies should make sacrifices too. enough shipping to carry coal to keep the railways going. ships that could be utilized to carry commonwealth vast quantities of commodities are stored, waiting for bottoms to transport them to the Old Country. member will find that the Department of the Navy has been investigating this matter. will not occupy a year in investigating I feel confident that there it. Both the local producer and the consumer abroad are in a bad position, and it is the duty of the Government to make the best possible use of every steamer on the coast.. I understand that New Zealand has almost depleted its coast of shipping by sending all the larger ships overseas with produce. There are at least seven or eight steamers on the Australian coast which could be utilized for that purpose. spare another steamer. sunk we should have to spare them.

117,Mr Richard Foster (Wakefield),"his best,. ing States of the Commonwealth have determined to enter upon the bulk handling of wheat, and in order to protect tbeir wheat in the immediate future they intend to construct silos that will be capable of utilization in connection with . the State nearly enough iron to cover the new scheme. I have no word to say against bulk handling for those three States which have resolved to adopt that system, but on behalf of the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia, and also on behalf of the South Australian farming interests, I assure the Committee that 90 per cent, of the farmers of that State are absolutely opposed to bulk handling. Therefore, if the provision of silos, for the better protection of wheat in the near future, is to be approved by the Conference to-morrow, the South Australian farmers desire to be exempted from such an arrangement. I know that the Vaughan Government included bulk handling in its policy, and that up t ill the time of the last Conference South Australia joined with the other three wheat-growing Statesi n advocating tbe provision pf silos. But this scheme, supported by the Vaughan Government, was defeated in the South Australian Parliament, and it is the opinion of the Farmers and Settlers Association, after taking voluminous evidence, that 90 per cent, of the South Australian farmers are opposed to bulk handling, and, therefore, to the provision of silos for the protection of their wheat.' consideration the labour difficulties ? considered labour and every other phase of the question, and whilst bulk handling might be appropriate for Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, in which States the bulk, if not the entire, shipping is done at two or three ports, it is not appropriate for South Australia, which has ports at intervals of 10 or 12 miles all along its coast line. We have no desire to condemn bulk handling, so far as it applies to the other three States. For many reasons the bulk handling of wheat is not desired in South Australia. I therefore ask the Treasurer to putl this proposition before the Prime Minister. Ib is not usual to provide silo accommodation for more than one-third of a normal crop. But if w e ' in South Australia are allowed to erect mice-proof grain sheds instead of silos, we can, for Three of the wheat-growwhafc ifc would cost to provide silos for one-third of the crop, adequately and? effectively protect the whole crop. I hope that consideration will be given to that matter afc the Conference fo-morrow. There is in f h e various station yards of the sheds that are needed. sheds be made mice-proof ? ing round them fences of galvanized plaint iron, 2 or 3 feet high. There are a few such sheds now in South Australia in which wheat is in splendid condition, and the amount saved by keeping it in that condition would more than pay the cost of the sheds. wish to say something regarding the'position outlined by the Prime Minister this afternoon. He told us that something like548 general cargo steamers are needed f o l if t the general cargo now stored in Australia, and about fifteen insulated ships fco take away the vast amount of produce now in cool storage here. During the electoral campaign every Ministeralist promised his constituents to do all in his power to maintain the industries of Australia, and to see that every pound of wealth which it was possible to produce would be obtained, and the same promise is given in the Governor General's Speech. To-morrow a conference is to be held to devise means for saving the wheat crop, * and a huge sum is to be spent to that end. The cosfc of reconditioning the wheat fchis year, and the loss already sustained, would altogether pay for the erection of sufficient silos to hold the whole of next season's harvest. But while the Government is willing to make provision for the protection of the wheat, it is doing nothing to help those interested in butter, rabbits, and other perishable produce that has to be kept in cool storage. The Prime Minister airily told the pastoralists and graziers that they would be all right, because they could keep their produce on the hoof. But those to whom I referred are not in that position. And the Prime Minister has not said that he will do anything for them. The rabbiting industry is now a very large one. In 1908 about 7.000,000 pairs of rabbits, worth £336,000, were exported; in 1914-15 the exportation was about 10,000,000 pairs, worth £531,000; and in 1915-16, 11,000,000 pairs were exported, worth",32,Honourable Members Hear Hear
