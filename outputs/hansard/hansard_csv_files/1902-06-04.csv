0,"Use Of I&Eprcsentattbes. And Read Prayers. To Behalf Of The Honourable And Learned Member For Parkes. I T Will Be Within The Knowledge Of Honourable Members ; That Last Thursday Night A Letter, Signed I By Mr E. W. O'sullivan, Secretary For Public Works, New South Wales, And Pub","lished in tbe current issue of the Melbourne Herald, was read by the honourable member for Maranoa. That letter reflected strongly upon the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and in his opinion, and, I think, in the opinion of other honourable members, went beyond the bounds of reasonable criticism. I will now, with the permission of the House, read a letter which the honourable and learned member for Parkes has since addressed to the Honourable. E. W . O'Sullivan, and tlie hitter's reply, which contains an ample apology for his indiscretion. The letters are published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 3rd June. They are as follow :The Honourable E. W. O'Sullivan, M.L.A., Minister for Public Works Dear Sir,-In your letter to the Melbourne Evm'mji Herald of yesterday, ou the subject of my administration of the Public Works department of New South Wales, you hare thought fit to make a number of statements in regard to my actions in the capacity of Minister. Many of those statements in regard to railways and other works carried out under me come within the category of "" fair comment,"" to which 1 cannot object, though I may hereafter have occasion to refer to them. But there are', in the same letter, three references to the purchase of Darling Island, to which I shall now draw your attention. You state:That"" Mr Bruce Smith was the Minister for Public Works who bought Darling Island at a cost of £130,000."" That ""-that transaction has cost the country over £30,000, so much money thrown away by Mr Bruce Smith to oblige ""his friends ou the syndicate."" . That"" Mr Bruce Smith has inflicted a loss of £57,000 per year, to say nothing of £50,000odd we have lost on the Darling Island transaction, owing to. his tender regard for the position of the syndicate referred to.""

Mr O'Sullivan writes :Sir,-When a man has discovered that lie has made a mistake, the wisest and most manly course is to admit it. A few days ago I stated in a letter to your journal that Mr Bruce Smith, M.H.JR-., when Minister for Works in this State, had purchased Barling Island in order to oblige a syndicate of his friends. By this .remark I meant nothing more than that Mr Bruce Smith hud made an error of judgment in making the purchase. It seems, however, that my words have been interpreted to indicate something altogether foreign to the character of Mr Bruce Smith. I have no hesitation, therefore, in withdrawing the statement unconditionally, and expressing my regret for having caused misconception and annoyance by the use of the words referred to. I am convinced that this is the right course to take, because a perusal of the papers, Ac., in connection with the case showB that Mr Bruce Smith was acting ih the public interest when the purchase of Darling Island was made by the Government of which he ( Mr Bruce Smith) was a member -Yours, 4c, (Signed) E.

With regard to military displays on the return of troops from South Africa, the Commonwealth has incurred no expenditure, an arrangement having been made by Sir John Forrest that in the case of State contingents-i.e. , contingents raised prior to transfer-n o expenditure should be taken over by the Commonwealth Government: and all arrangements for the reception of members of such contingents have been accordingly made by the State Governments.

The matter, however, was not formally discussed at that conference. No person has been suggested or recommended officially or otherwise for the position. During his visit to Victoria, about two months ago, Mr Leake, the Premier of Western Australia, and, I believe, also Mr Kingsmill, the Minister of Railways of that State, referred in conversation, in a general way, to the services that such an officer might render in regard to small items of expenditure. The question was also dealt with at the recent Premiers' conference in Sydney, and a resolution was carried there and forwarded to the Government. I cannot' say that the Government yet consider that an appointment is necessary, the duties of such an officer having been only very generally < indicated.",16,Military Clothing

The States of Australia have carry out defence works <' already borrowed £220,000,000, and the interest tax upon the people in respect of this enormous sum, which already assumes sufficiently large proportions to be a large loan in itself, is crushing our producing and commercial industrial resources. These loans will have to be repaid eventually, and the Commonwealth will be making a very grave mistake if it attempts to float any loans, whether internally or externally. I only regret that I did not know this motion was coming on to-day, so that I might have had the facts and figures ready. It might be said that this protest should have been entered when a motion was submitted in favour of the introduction of an Inscribed Stock Bill, but as the Commonwealth has the right under the Constitution to take over certain inscribed stock, such a Bill may be necessary and read a first time. for that purpose.

I understand that the practice of this State is to float a Loan Bill, and afterwards to pass special bills appropriating the moneys. In the B ill for the inscription of stock provision is made for the adoption of the Victorian practice rather than that of some of the other States. For instance, in South Australia the Bill relating to a loan is also the Bill which specifies the objects or appropriates the money. It seems to me that before we have assented to the Victorian practice we are asked to act upon it .

It seems to me, however, that tlie very amount which it is suggested we should borrow is a sufficient indication that no necessity exists for raising the proposed loan.

A t the present time, however, we cannot be regarded as committing ourselves to anything. agreement with those who protest against the initiation of a system of borrowing until the absolute necessity for so doing has been proved, and I do not think that such necessity is likely to be made out upon the present occasion.

I think that they are, beyond all doubt. I do not mean to suggest that a loan is necessary now, because we have no details before us, but in carrying on the transferred departments, there is no doubt that we must raise loans.

It is a Loan AppliMrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I rise to address the committee a second time, because of the declaration of the acting leader of the Opposition that any honourable member who opposes the principle of borrowing should declare himself now, or for ever afterwards hold his peace. I do not desire to hold my peace for ever, especially upon this question. I simply wish to reiterate that I intend to oppose the flotation of loans. As the honourable member for Bland, who is the leader of the democratic party, has stated, we are entitled, under the Braddon blot, to retain one-quarter of the receipts from Customs. Now, as the Commonwealth will have a surplus of over £700,000, why should we not utilize £500,000 of it instead of borrowing and being compelled to pay brokerage 1 If the Commonwealth is to continue the bogus system of finance which has been carried on by the States, let it borrow £5,000,000 or £6.000,000 and do something with it . To commence borrowing small amounts is very bad business for the Government to embark upon. If we borrow money, and have to pay big interest upon it , a protest will go up against the Commonwealth, which will be heard all over Australia. People will declare that we are simply perpetuating the old rotten system of finance that was carried on in America until the resumption laws were adopted there, and a proper method of finance was initiated. For a few years the Bank of England held that its system was perfect, but after a few Americans had forged some millions of pounds' worth of notes, people began to see that it was by no means perfect. shall proceed very slowly in the matter of borrowing. The experience of the States ought to constitute a sufficient warning to us, as to how we should proceed with this business. Speaking of Victoria, I may say that the Government have not the same control of loan moneys as they havs of revenue. Somehow or other it gets into the hands of officials, who squander it almost as they please. In this connection I may mention that Victoria has repaid in interest to the lenders more than tlie total amount of their loans.

I merely desire to express my views upon this matter at this early stage of the proceedings. Question resolved i u the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. and read a first time. In CommitteeConsideration resumed from 3rd June (vide page 13229). Division 130 (Central Staff), £5,360. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Tasmania) -In asking the attention of honourable members to the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's department, I desire to offer a few observations. Of the total Estimates of £4,300,000 for the year, £2,300,000 seems a large sum to ask for the department of the Postmaster General. This, however, is a reproductive department; and the total expenditure in the various States during the last financial year was within £47,000 of the sum now asked for. The increase arises from several causes, but largely from the fact that all the officers transferred to the Commonwealth have received the increments to which they are entitled under the various resolutions, regulations, or Statutes of the States. The Victorian public servants who have been transferred have had their salaries written up in accordance with the Victorian A ct Act. Sir PHILIPFYSH I am informed that the increments have been allowed under the latest regulations. Act of 27th December, 1900? Sir PHILIPFYSH I am informed by the Postmaster-General that the salaries of the transferred officers have been increased to the sums to which they would have been entitled had they remained State officers. In the case of New South WalesI find that, in this connection, the Estimates have been loaded to the extent of £16,000. Then a large expenditure is necessary in order to meet the seriously increased cost of the inland mails. The sum involved under tliat heading is about £10,700, and the increase has arisen in think that £10,400 will cover all the extra consequence of the higher contracts cost? rendered necessary by the drought and the advanced cost of fodder. There are other increases which vary in connection with the different States. Some States have heretofore charged against the department all the expenditure which could possibly be charged, while other States have not taken that course. We have now appearing on tlie Estimates the exchange oh money orders as between the various States, and also the cost of water and sewerage services. The Attorney-General has already explained that certain portions of claims made by municipalities for services rendered must be paid for by the Commonwealth, and this has swollen the Estimates to the extent of £4,400. The cost of extra officers I mean officials in the various head offices, and postmasters and postmistresses amounts to £16,400. This item is accounted for by the increasei n the number of officers from 12,000 to 12,400 in the current year, and it may be presumed that the department will continue to grow. No doubt demands for extended telegraph communication and new post-offices will be made from time to time, and although the department is intended to be reproductive, tlie aim of Ministers is not to make it reproductive in the same sense as is the English Postal department, the administration of which results in an annual profit of £2,000,000 to £3,000,000. The desire of the Commonwealth Government is to extend the services of the department as the increased revenue will permit of it-no t too fast, but when the increased revenue is almost equal to the expenditure incurred.. These items I have mentioned come to more than the £47,000 extra expenditure, but the total is reduced by contingencies and non-recurrent votes, which, however, are less during the current year than they were in tlie .State departments in the previous 3-ear. We may presume that £47,000 roughly represents the increase of the Estimates for the closing year. When the Estimates for next year are before us, I am afraid tlie Treasurer will find it necessary to increase the vote for the inland mails, owing to further difficulties which have arisen with the contractors, who contend that they cannot carry on the services for the amounts stipulated.

There is a danger, too, that, with central administration, the requirements of some of the States may be dealt with without a clear .and adequate knowledge of their conditions. There can be, for instance, no comparison in postal matters between the conditions of States like New South Wales and Victoria, And any so-called economy, but real parsimony, which would interfere with the invaluable network of communication which is extended over the sparsely populated districts of the former State would be most insane folly. Therefore in the Postal department, must retain the central for certain purposes, we must also depend largely upon local I have had a great deal of trouble in dealing with many small matters which have been brought before me by constituents, and it seems to me very foolish that we should have to refer to the -central administration matters. to tlie administration in each of the States, where there is probably a very able permanent head. There is a danger that under a system of extreme sufficient power and authority may not be given to those permanent heads to deal with matters of a local character. I know that there must be great difficulty in the initiation of a new administration, every consideration should therefore be shown to the Government. plaint has been made by the people of New South Wales that certain drastic economy which has been introduced has led to the closingof post-offices which had become almost necessary to the trading public. I daresay that under State administration there was a great deal of extravagance, and possibly in some cases, offices overlapped each other. Then, too, it has happened that the positions of offices have occasionally been badly chosen, so that, office might serve if properly the closing of either of two offices would create inconvenience. stance, there is a post-office at the bottom of King-street, Sydney, and there was another at the corner of Sussex and Druitt streets. The latter office was closed, although it was situated in the very heart of the produce centre of Sydney, and the people of the neighbourhood are therefore compelled to go a considerable distance to get to the Sir William Mr AfUlan. nearest post-office available to them. No doubt a mistake was made in the first choosing of a site for a post-office in the district; but it does not follow that, because two offices are too many, a district is not seriously inconvencienced by the closing of either of them. That case proves the difficulty of administering a department from the central office, unless that office is assisted by a large amount of local knowledge. In my opinion, the department should be administered very largely by the permanent heads in each State. administration are done under the advice of the officers who have been administering the departadministration. ment in the various States for years past. petty-fogging were deputations about the matter to which I refer, and about other matters, but the representations made seem to have had very little effect, because of the importance of the in regard to such central office.

As a business man, I centralization' believe in every tub being on its own bottom, but I think the community as a whole would be willing to make up any deficiency which might be caused by increasing the communication with distant and parts of Australia. No doubt the department may ultimately be made to pay But the comits way, although the adoption of penny postage, which may sooner or later become a popular cry, may make the time a far distant one.

69,Mr Hughes,"There is no question asand at some offices the letter carrier does not receive such leave at all, I have to inform you that this department is not aware of such cases, and it will be necessary for you to furnish instances in which the leave mentioned is not regularly received, &c., before the matter can receive consideration. Unless the Government intend to continue tbe present practice, and to establish a record in this matter, as they have done in many others, some attention should be given to the representations immediately. One of the effects of the centralization of the postal administration has been to increase the amount of .red tape to a most irritating extent. The head office of the postal administration is just across the road from Parliament House, and one would imagine that nothing would be more simple than to transmit a communication from one side of the road to the other ; but'nothing is more difficult. One could communicate -with ex-President Kruger or with the K in g of the Cannibal Islands with as much ease as with the head of the Postal department. Any one can see the head of the departi ment, but it is quite a different matter to secure satisfaction. Either the central con| trol should be complete and efficient, or the decision of local matters should be left to the local authorities. .For instance, what can Mr Scott or anybody else in the | head office know at one and the same time about local affairs in New South Wales and Western Australia? If letter-carrier No. 112 in Western Australia wants a day'sleave, what can Mr Scott know about the circumstances of the case ? Yet he affects to know everything about it . Sir able member say that a letter-carrier in Western Australia has to apply to the Secretary of the Postal department for a day's leave'( secure it from the local authorities, if one may judge from the list I have read. It is, apparently, necessary, when a man in Western Australia wants a day's leave, to write over to Mr Scott, who has to communicate with Perth, and then some reply has to be sent back again ; and so the thing goes on. This would be all very well in a comic opera, but it has no place in a public department such as the Post-office, in which we might reasonably expect to find business methods followed. As the result of a | deputation which waited upon me some ' little time ago, I wrote to the department asking that residential accommodation should be provided for the postmaster at Ultimo, Sydney, who has a large and populous district to attend to, and who also acts as electoral registrar. When he goes away at a reasonable hour at night, no one is left to carry on his electoral work, and it would be of great advantage to the residents if he were permitted to live on the premises. Another matter which was brought before me, also as the result of a deputation, was the fact that the people in Chippendale, a large and growing district, require a post-office. Owing to the department requiring the post-office to be placed in one part of the district, and tlie residents desiring that it should be fixed in another, the department have been content to do nothing. I do not wish to unduly hurry the department, but as it is eighteen months ago since the matter was first mentioned, and the claims of the residents to a post-office are well recognised, I hope the Minister will very soon take action. In the Post-office department there are many cases of gross injustice, in which men of mature age are receiving only £ 7 0 or £S0 a year. Asi t is provided iu the Public Service Act that such men shall receive at least £11.0 per year, I should like to know when it is proposed to give effect to the Act. The department have so far made no move in this direction. I understand that those who are entitled to increased pay have to satisfy the Public Service Commissioner of that fact, and some action should be taken immediately by the dehas full power, and is taking up his duties very rapid 1}'. machinery for complying with the requirements of the Act should be set in motion at-once, or else the Public ServiceA ct will become mildewed with age before these unfortunate public servants receive any increase of pay. propose to discuss the administration of the Post-office in regard to any of the States except Western Australia, because I recognise that it is necessary, in the face of the great change in management, to make allowances for many delays and disappointments.

73,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I do notinvestigate the condition of affairs in the Post and Telegraph department of Western Australia. They must have heard that that service does not give satisfaction to the outside public, whilst producing grave discontent to the officials themselves. ' I could understand a department being conducted in such a way as to satisfy either the public or the officials. But when a department pleases neither the public nor the unfortunate officials it is prima, facie evidence that something is very wrong with the head of it. J. do not think that Ministers can be ignorant of the fact that the head of the department in Western Australia-if my information is correct-ha s been practically insubordinate to his own Minister and has actually refused to carry out his instructions. For example, his Minister instructed him not to transfer officers to out stations without the approval of the head office in Melbourne, and yet he continues to transfer officials. by the Postmaster-General1 was rectified, but another has not yet been remedied. I know of a young man who, after spending about five years at Coolgardie, and enduring all the hardships of the early days there, has been transferred to A God-forsaken place like Eucla, where he never sees a soul from year's end to vear's end. He can obtain no satisfaction. The Government should have instituted an investigation into the affairs of this department in Western Australia, such as I urged them to undertake months ago. I am satisfied that if justice were done,'the man at the head of the Postal department in Perth would have been suspended long since. I feel sure that if Ministers were not overburdened with work that result would have followed before now. This is no new matter. The officer at the head of the department iu Perth is. accustomed to rule with all the authority of a despot. He will not consider the convenience of the public, nor the services and sufferings of the unfortunate employees. When I mentioned a few nights since that the condition of the department was so bad that it had resulted in a strike of telegraph operators at Coolgardie, the Treasurer suggested that that must have been a Jong time ago. But although that strike took place as far back as 1S95, the dissucceeded in getting away with nearly satisfaction of the employees to-day is almost as serious as it was then, and the same aggravated reasons exist for it. When that strike was being settled this gentleman gave a solemn imdertaking to the employees who took part in it that none of them would suffer if they returned to work. His manner of keeping that promise was to scatter the unfortunate operators over the whole of Western Australia. One was sent up to the north-west coast, and others to outlying stations in remote places, the result being that every one of them sufferer] for the part which they took in the strike. To show the autocratic nature of this gentleman, and the way in which he has been accustomed to rule the department, I will read extracts from the report of a B-oyal commission composed of five .Members of Parliament which sat in 1897. I shall read some recommendations of that commission, which took most voluminous evidence. Despite the fact that those recommendations were made and supported by a considerable majority in the State Parliament, a great many of the reforms urged in the report were never adopted until the Western Australian I believe that one case representatives came to this House. Some of them have since been carried out as the result of questions which I put to the Minister. The Royal commission to which I refer gave all the witnesses to understand that they were at liberty to communicate with the Chairman without in any way prejudicing their position in the service. But what happened? Only two men who were adverse to the policy and methods of the department gave evidence before that commission, aud one of them was almost immediately dismissed upon a trumped-up charge; whilst the other, who held a very good position in the Perth office, was shortly afterwards transferred to < Coolgardie. Up till that time the latter had received the highest increases of anv man in the department, but since then he has received the lowest increments, simply because he gave evidence in opposition to the system which is carried on by the Perth Deputy Postmaster-General. I would further point out that during the administration of this gentleman the department lost by one embezzler in Coolgardie nearly £8,000. What is to be thought of a department which is managed in such a way that a junior employee can continue embezzling money year after year until he has £8,000 before the department discovers his defalcations.",25,George Turner Does The Honor Partment To Facilitate The Change

75,Mr Mahon,"done there? honourable gentleman to ask the postal officials that question. I believe that there -was some system of auditing the accounts, but it is evident that it must have been a very loose one. Postmaster-General at Perth had had experience of the Bertoli frauds in Coolgardie, yet owing to the fact that he would not supply proper safe accommodation in the head office at Perth the paymaster there actually lost nearly £1,000. He went out to lunch, leaving the money in his office. While he was absent, some person who knew his habits, and had provided himself with a key, slipped in and extracted £932. said that the condition of this department is bad. mony of an officer of the department who knew a good deal about its inside working. Writing to ine some time ago, of the period from 1895 upwards, he saysTo say that the administration in those days was bad, .is putting it mildly. There was no check on telegraphic receipts, so that a dishonest postmaster could pocket whatever he liked. In 18117, Bertoli, an officer at Coolgardie, on a small salary, embezzled £8,000 of the department's cash. The fraud was discovered by chance and not-by an examination. Bertoli's extravagant expenditure was the talk of Coolgardie, out it never occurred to his superiors to inrounds himself with officers who are either quire where the money came from. Had the eastern system of accounts prevailed, his peculations would have been discovered almost instantly. The rottenness of his alleged system was made known to Mr Sholl by an officer named Stewart, who had been in the department in New South VVales. At the very time that Bertoli was stealing the funds, Stewart warned Sholl against allowing large sums to stand to the credit of tlie postmaster at Coolgardie and other gold-fields towns, where embezzlements also occurred. Though Stewart had a failing, he was an able man. His advice was continually sought by Sholl in preference to that ot the inspectors. The disorganization of the department impelled him to the use of strong language, aud Mr Sholl, who received his reports direct, actually withheld them from the record room, and consequently from the Minister. One instance of the system then prevailing is worthy of mention. Up to the end of 1S!)7, if a person, say, at Perth, applied for high salary for some time afterwards. One a money order at Kalgoorlie for 5s., the cash would be enclosed with the departmental advice list and sen t on to Kalgoorlie. Thus thousands of pounds sterling were always floating about, and as the population was also floating, a great deal of the cash must have missed its rightful owners. That is an instance of the methods pursued. I promised the committee to read some of the recommendations made by the Royul commission to which I have referred. commendations have been carried out by I should prefer the the present Postmaster-General. adopted, but not all. But even if they had been carried out in their entirety I have a right to call attention to the fact that the Although the Deputy Commonwealth is paying a man in a high position whom we regard as incompetent, or something worse. He is the man responsible for the maladministration of the post, and he may repeat it in the future. First of all, the commission point out a most serious thing, namely, that robbery from the Post office was frequently condoned. Paragraph 4S of the report in question statesCrimes committed against a great public deI have partment like the Post and Telegraph department are serious, aud offenders should be prosecuted I propose now to read the testiaccording to the law. This has been the exception rather than the rule in regard to misdemeanours committed in the past by Post-office officials ; most of the offences having been condoned on the offenders or their friends making good any deficiencies which may. have occurred, the only punishment meted out in the majority of cases being dismissal from the service. The Government should consider whether they cau safely leave the administration of a great department of Statei n the hands of a gentleman accustomed to the compounding of felonies. We find also from the report of the commission that he surincompetent or have very little to do. A t the time of which I am speaking the Deputy Postmaster-General kept a chief clerk, whose work was done by another officer. On this point the Royal commission reportedThe chief clerk stated, in evidence, he was not fully employed, as the Postmaster-General had taken the work out of his bauds, and did nob utilize his services to the extent he might. He also said that on his return to duty, after twelve months' leave of absence, he found a number of officers doing the work he was performing prior to going on his holiday. The evidence shows that tlie chief clerk has now duties allotted to him that can easily be carried out by a* subordinate officer. Yet the chief clerk continued to draw his might expect that the advice of a Royal commission would have been taken to heart by the Deputy Postmaster-G eneral. A t any rate, it should have induced him to take proper precautions for the conservation of public moneys.

79,Mr Mahon,"Some of them have beenin the department, neither was there a proper system of checking the accounts of the district officers. Hence the embezzlements. The administration was faulty, and offered temptations to the officers at every point. As to the robbery of £922 from the Telegraph branch in .December, 1897, the Commissioners stateWe cannot help thinking that if ordinary precautions had been employed the moment the robbery wus reported, and every employee put through a strict inquiry, the mystery might have been solved, or some clue obtained which could have been successfully followed up. But nothing was done; there was the usual ""masterly inactivity."" I believe that the State Government subsequently compelled the unfortunate officer, from whose room the money was taken, to make a refund. In the following paragraph, the Royal comniission referred co a very important matterThe salaries paid in the l?osfc and Telegraph department are, as a general rule, on too low a scale to insure the proper class of officers being retained, and this is particularly noticeable iu the case of subordinate officials engaged in work of a responsible character. It appears to us also that too much attention is paid to length of service, as compared with an officer's ability, and the character of the work he is engaged in. In other words, there is not a proper system of classification of duties as well as of officials. The anomalies in salaries paid for services rendered are often striking. It is doubtful whether there has been any improvement in the salaries, except, of course, that some officers have obtained small yearly increments. The higher officials are well looked after, both in regard to salary and allowances. The Royal commission, in their report, dwelt on the necessity of transferring officers who for a long time have been stationed in unhealthy or tropical latitudes. On this the report is Officers who have been stationed in tropical or out-of-the-way places, where the conditions of living have a tendency to injuriously affect the healtli, should have the privilege, after a certain period of service, of being transferred to stations further south. This is a matter that should receive prompt attention. Buti t has not received ""prompt""attention. I have already given an illustration of how much attention was paid to this recommendation in the case of a young fellow who, stationed at Coolgardie for several years, had undergone all the hardships of goldfields life. He. was transferred, not to Perth or Premantle, or to some other habitable place, but to Eucla, where, perhaps for a whole year, he may not see a strange face. Another example of extraordinary management is given inthefact thatalthough there is an excellent Government Printingoffice in Perth, the Deputy Postmaster General had all the postage stamps and postcards printed in England. The Royal commission drew attention to this matterPostage stamps and post-cards are printed in England at a cost, of about £2,000 a year. The dies and plates are the property of this Government. The other Australian colonies print their own stamps and' post-cards, and the accountant, gave evidence that if this colony would follow suit there would be a considerable saving in this respect. There was also the recommendation of the Royal commission that private letter-boxesshould be provided at the General Post office accessible to holders at any hour of the day or night. The Treasurer is in error if he thinks that all the recommendations of the Royal commission have been carried out. This is one that has not yet been adopted. what the honourable member said, namely, that a large number of the recommendations had beeu carried out on his bringing them before the Postmaster-General. land parcels post, the speedier payment of money orders, and a few little things of that kind, the recommendations have been adopted. Under the old system, if a person desired to telegraph £ 5 from BrokenH ill to Kalgoorlie, the message went to Sydney, thence to Perth, and later on to its destination-; so that a message from the payer to the payee arrived from 24 to48 hours before the money became available. The Treasurer ought to understand that there is great complaint about the system of accounts in the post-office of Western Australia. I do not profess to understand the matter fully, but I believe there is a great deal of duplication of work in the money order branch. In the eastern StatesI understand the same form is used for an Inter-State as for a foreign money order; but in Western Australia there are about half-a-dozen different forms for State, foreign, and Inter-State orders. An officer in this department has to balance his accounts twice a day, once about 2 o'clock before the banks close, and a second time ab the close of the clay. The administration of the Western Australian Telegraph department was the scandal of the civilized world in the olden times, by which I mean the boom",27,George Turner Does The Honor Partment To Facilitate The Change

81,Mr Mahon',"In regard to the i ntimes, when there was considerable speculation on the Stock Exchange. Even at the present moment there are great delays, in illustration of which I may read an amusing newspaper extractA case heard in the Menzies local court, last week, hinged partly upon the times at which certain telegrams were despatched and received. This led to various experiences with the telegraph any satisfactoiy information. We were office being related. The plaintiff in the case related that a telegram for him had been despatched from Menzies at 10.55 a.m. ou a certain day, and that ib took five hours to reach Kookynie. That is, the telegram was about five hours in going 34 miles. ""Oh,"" said the police magistrate, ""that was quick work. When I was at Mulwarrie the other day, I sent a wire to Menzies, and it was received that when this matter is settled, all arrears bhe next day, two ami a half hours after I had arrived."" Mr Hill : I sent a wire from Mulwarrie to advise my return to Menzies, and I beat it easily on the road. This did not occur in 1895 or 1896, but in the present year. Mr Maxwell; I can relate a similar experience. I sent.a wire to Perth the other day to say that I would be down, and AfterI reached Perth the wire was delivered to me at my ottice. This recalls an incident in .1 SOB, when an hotelevery honourable member is entitled to keeper at Albany sent some billiard cues to a friend in Norseman. They were despatched to Esperauce by the 4-knot per hour steamer, then by horse team to Norseman. A telegram was sent from Albany ou the day the steamer left, advising the despatch of the cues. The message arrived at Norseman the day after the goods. In the same year a resident of Albany was iu Adelaide, and ho sent a telegram to his wife advising his return by the first boat. When he reached home the message had not arrived. About a mouth afterwards the man died. Judge the surprise of tlie wife when she got the telegram five months afterwards, stating that her husband was returning by bhe first boat. In conclusion, I say that the time has come when both in the interests of the public and for the welfare of tlie public servants, it is imperatively necessary that this department in Western Australia should be reorganized. time to time brought under the notice of the Treasurer the treatment which the Victorian transferred officers are receiving from the Government. ago, when we were considering a temporary Supply Bill, I mentioned this matter, which has been repeatedly referred to by the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and others, and we have been promised from time to time by the Treasurer, that effect would be given to this clause. An officer was sent from Victoria to obtain information as to the .remuneration given for corresponding work in' other parts of the Commonwealth, and although his report was submitted about six months ago, and questions in regard to it have been asked since, I have not been able to obtain told yesterday by the Attorney-General that this matter is in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. Transferred officers who were entitled to increases .ranging from £ 8 0 to £ 3 0 0 obtained them at once, but that has not been the case with men whose increases represent only a few shillings a week. "" I am aware of the fact will be paid up, but I am afraid that some of the unfortunate men may be dead before the Public Service Commissioner has an opportunity of deciding as to the value of the work. By permission of the Government I have seen the report to which I have alluded, and I cannot understand why it was not Laid on the table long ago. As the document was prepared by a public officer for the use of the Commonwealth, peruse it, and it should have been laid on the table df the House. There may be vagueness in regard to certain matters in the report, but other matters are made absolutely clear. Some officers received their increases nearly eighteen months ago, and it is about time the remainder received some consideration especially those officers about whom the report is clear. The report further shows that the Melbourne letter-carriers work much longer hours than the letter-carriers in any of the other States, including New South Wales, and that their pay is less than that of the letter-carriers in the other States. Then, again, the minimum pay given to instrument fitters in some of the States is higher than tlie maximum pay given in A ictoria. 7 There are similar discrepancies in regard to the postal assistants. About twelve months assistants do not occupy the same position as the postal assistants in Queensland. 7 the maximum pay of postal assistants at £156 per annum, while, according to the information in my possession, the postal, assistants in Queensland may receive as much as £ 2 3 0 per annum.",28,George Turner Does The Honor Partment To Facilitate The Change

84,Mr Tudor,"The A ictorian Act fixesSir ferent class of men from the Victorian postal assistants. tants in Queensland and New South Wales are in tlie Clerical Division, and are put in charge of post-offices. The postal assistants in Victoria who are getting £ 9 0 or £ 1 0 0 a year are sometimes put in the same position, although they have not passed the necessary clerical examination, and Mr Cerrutty's report says that the work is practically the same. If they do that work, their case should be looked into, and they should receive the benefits which the A ct intended to give them. I trust that the Minister will do what he can to afford the long-deferred justice which is due to these men. If it was right that the officers should receive increases, surely the men should do so too. In regard to the preparation of the Estimates, I wish to point out that the divisions dealing with the Victorian department are delightfully vague. The New South Wales Estimates show exactly haw many clerks, letter-carriers, sorters, ifec, are employed, and what salary each receives, whereas in the Victorian Estimates they are all bunched together, and we have items like these41 -clerks, :£11,857: £ 1.1,923 : from £40 to £110, £0,710 ; 183 operators at from £40 to £200, £33,0(19. The same thing is done in regard to letter carriers and sorters. had to be prepared when not very much time was available, arid we had, therefore, to continue the system which has previously been in vogue in each State. In future, no doubt, there will be mora uniformity, and we hope to ultimately obtain absolute uniformity. ' system were adopted in regard to the Victorian Estimates, it would be of much assistance to representatives of Victorian constituencies. There are several other discrepancies to which I wish to draw 'attention. For instance, on page 114, we have the itemOne hundred and fourteen sorters, at from £11 10s. per month to 75s. per week-maximu m per annum, i'150. > If my arithmetic is correct, 75s. per week is equivalent to £ 1 9 5 per annum. down is the maximum allowed under the 37 u the men were appointed under the old regulations, which provided for a higher maxiI know the postal assismum. misleading to that extent. I find that there are letter-carriers receiving 57s. per week, o r £ 1 4 S per annum, when the maximum of their grade is set down at £ 1 3 2 per annum. I find, too, ridiculous items such as theseOne messenger at from £84 to £120 ; maximum, £120; . . . one stamp impresser and machine man, ut from £148 to £204; maximum, £160. AVhy is not the actual salary given in these cases'? The honourable member for Coolgardie complained about the way in which the Western Australian Postal department is managed, but, judging from the manner in which the Victorian Estimates have been prepared, the Victorian department is still worse managed, as the Western Australian salaries are set forth clearly, and it can be seen how much each officer receives. Last week the honourable member for Parramatta stated that there are more men employed in the New South Wales department than in the Victorian department, but I was not prepared to find that there are niore than twice as many 63 clerks, 122 female assistants, at men employed in New South Wales as in Victoria, the total number employed in New South Wales being 5,436, and in Victoria 2,594. The fact that the territory of New South Wales is so much larger than that of Victoria hardly accounts for this difference, because a similar comparison does not hold good in regard to the Queensland and Victorian departments. I find, too, that with regard to letter-sorters, Victoria appears to have 271, made up of two batches of 114 and 157, whereas half that number would appear sufficient, having regard to the relative proportions of the two services in other grades. I should like some explanation from the Minister in regard to that matter. I cannot understand the provision made on page 110 of the Estimates for increases of salary to deserving officers in New South Wales, who do not come under the increment regulations in accordance with the practice at the time of transfer, and no similar provision is made for officers in this and other States. How is it that these officers have been selected for special preference over the officers in Victoria? practice was adopted in New South Wales",29,George Turner Does The Honor Partment To Facilitate The Change

The conditions in Victoria and New South Wales are entirely different. is set apart for increments to officers in New South Wales, but no provision of a similar character is made for increments to Victorian officers. I hope that in cases where it is found that Victorian officers are justly entitled to increases they will not be overlooked, because-no provision is made for them upon the present Estimates. Sir will be made upon* the next Estimates, and the money will be paid to them. There will be no difficulty in regard to that. made for £ 1 2 0 to defray the expense of employing a motor cycle for clearing letterpillars in Sydney, .whereasi n Victoria bicycles are hired for the purpose. of the motor cycle in Sydney was purely an experiment, and I do not know whether itproved satisfactory. ferred to the fact that certain officers in Victoria have not received the increases to which they are entitled. I find that the Chief Inspector, the Accountant Controller of Stamps, and a number of others have their increments ranging from £ 1 1 to £ 2 3 per annum provided for, whereas the men who 'are in the lower grades of the service have not received theirs. are altogether different. The increases in one case are fixed by the Act, and in the other they still have to be fixed. that it was not specified in the Act that no officer should receive any increase under Act 1921 of Victoria until all had been provided for. Then the higher officers would have worked all the harder to secure the increments for the men. the officers, who have nothing whatever to do with the increments to the men. exerted some pressure upon Ministers. In South Australia a number of men, who have been employed as line repairers for years, are still classified as temporary officers, whereas men who occupy somewhat higher positions have been converted from temporary into permanent officers. seems singular that in every case where an advantage has been conferred, it has been derived by the officers in the higher grades. W it h regard to the charwomen who are employed in cleaning the General Post office, I understand that lately two women who were temporarily employed have been dispensed with, and that anotiier has retired. The staff has not been restored to its f u ll strength, and now 21 women are required not only to do the work previously performed by 24, but a great deal of additional labour. I find that in Sydney six men at £ 2 per week are employed, in addition to three caretakers and assistants, in cleaning the General Post-office. I do not I see that provision is know that the floor space is very much larger there than in Melbourne, but even with this large staff it has been found necessary since the outbreak of the plague in Sydney to appoint extra cleaners. It would, therefore, appear that the women employed in Melbourne are being sweated. Many of them have been employed for a number of years, and they are still classified as I have previously retemporary employees, although they have the same right to be placed on the permanent list as have officers holding higher positions in the service. I hope the Minister will see that these women obtain their rights, and that they will receive fair remuneration for the hard work which they perform. The letter-carriers in Victoria who do relieving work were entitled for a number of years to Is. 6d. per day, as a relieving allowance, but at the time of the depression this was reduced to Is. per day. According to the terms of tlie Constitution Act, all public servants taken over from the States are entitled to their existing and accruing rights, and the letter-carriers accordingly applied in October last to have the Is. 6d. per day restored to them. They found, however, that even the Is. allowance had been struck off, and that they had been denied all rights in this direction. If the terms of the Constitution are not to be ignored, the men are entitled to at least the Is. per day allowed to them at the time of the transfer of the department. When the Public Service Bill was before us we were informed that those men who were temporarily employed would have the preference in regard to any permanent appointments.

We are in f u l l swing at the present time through private agents. u statement from the Minister representing tlie Postmaster-General in reference to certain new regulations for the carriage of parcels. I think that the Government proposal is one which will be of great advantage to residents in the country districts. A t the same time, I should like to know whether any provision has been made to cover the extra cost which will be involved in the carriage of these additional mails ? I wish to outer ni)protest against the system, which appears to be a growing one, of compelling private individuals to subsidize mail contracts. Some time ago, when I endeavoured to obtain a return of the mail services supported by private individualSj. I ascertained that no record was kept of them. The practice adopted is as follows: An application is made by a country district for a mail service, and an inspector is. sent to investigate the claim. Probably he reports that the department might reasonably set .apart an expenditure -of £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 a year in this connection. Accordingly the people interested are informed that if they can get their mails -carried for the amount mentioned the Government will provide them with a sendee; but, if not, they will have to make up the deficiency themselves. few persons usually become responsible for the additional cost, whilst others along the route get their mails carried without contributing anything. I object to this principle altogether. I hold that the -Commonwealth should provide for the -carriage of mails, and not levy any tax upon, private individuals. If any place is entitled to consideration in this connection, it is certainly the back country, where people receive their mails only once a week, or possibly once a fortnight. If a loss occurs, through the carriage of mails in remote country districts, it should be made good out of the profits accruing from services in more densely populated centres. recently I learned that the mails in a certain district had been discontinued upon the ground that they did not pay. I protest against such a plea being put forward as justification for the action taken.. I understand that new regulation's are to be enforced in regard to the establishment of telephonic communication. The Government propose to ask the people interested to find the money necessary for the purpose, which money is to be held by them for three years, as a guarantee that the department will not suffer loss. To my mind that is asking altogether too much. The old system was infinitely better. The excuse urged by the department in Sydney against the extension of telephonic communication induces me to say that some system should be devised to expedite ordinary routine work. I know of the ease of a man who recently desired to have his establishment connected by telephone. The work merely necessitated! the putting of a wire across one street, at a cost of about ( 30s., but he could not get it done. In my own district, an application was made to connect the hospital with the telephone service, but the institution is still waiting for the necessary funds to enable this to be done. If we defeat the Loan Bill, I suppose it will have to wait for ever. I hold that officers in the States ought to be vested with authority to keep these works going. Certainly they ought not to be discontinued suddenly because of the accomplishment of federation. As we have made some very good departures recently in our legislation, particularly in regard to the prohibition of the empl6yment of black labour upon our mail steamers, I think it would be wise to stipulate in future conAs a result, a tracts the number of hours which the drivers of mails should be employed. I know that in the back country there are men working lO -hours a week. All the mail coaches which run from Bourke leave the post-office about eight o'clock at night. The drivers have frequently to work for thirteen hours at a stretch, in all sorts of weather, and at the present time they are forced to carry water as well as feed for their horses. It is unfair and unreasonable to work men 60 or 70 hours a week, and I urge the Minister to see that in future contracts there is a stipulation against these excessive hours. These men have no remedy unless they leave their work, and we know Only that men will sometimes cling to a situation under very uncomfortable conditions. There is another grievance which has existed for a long time in connection with the method adopted when men are employed on relieving work. The department always takes care under such circumstances to pay a low rate of wages; and in VictoriaI know a telegraph messenger who has been employed for the last nine or ten months as a",32,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not

A few weeks ago I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that a circularhad been issued by the Postmaster-General intimating that allowances which have hitherto been paid to postmasters for acting as wardens' clerks, reading tlie water gauge, and similar little duties, would in the future be paidnot to the officers themselves, but to the Commonwealth Government. These allowances may appear small to a man with a large salary, but they are of some importance to those whose remuneration does not exceed £ 1 0 0 or £150 a year. I had hoped that in view of the reply I received from the Prime Minister on the occasion to which I have referred, there would have been some provision on the Supplementary Estimates to recoup these officers, because it would be cruel to withdraw the allowances without giving some increase in salary. SirG EOHGK TURNER -W'ha f is' the ject of the new arrangement 1 The Commonwealth will only have to pay the money back to the States. the reason for the circular; but it indicates that, almost at once, these allowances, which I think that the arrangement theiein set vary from £ 1 0 to £ 1 5 a year, are to be out is contrary to the public interest. paid to the Commonwealth, and not to the officers. mistake ; it has not been supported. difficultit is for honourable members to undertelegrams sent to places within the States stand what is going on, when a circular is themselves.

If the public prefer to use the telephone instead of sending telegrams, they should have every facility offered to them at reasonable rates. Even though it were necessary to erect a special wire between Bathurst and Sydney, the cost would be a comparatively small matter, because _ the poles, which represent the greater part of the expense of constructing a line, are already in position. If the suggestion I now make were adopted, the convenience extended to Bathurst might also be enjoyed by the people of Penrith, Blackheath, Lithgow, and other places along the' line. The department ought to make more use of the telephone system, and it will be useless for them to attempt to block the development of the service, because they thinki t will interfere with their telegraphic business. tion should be the convenience of the public, and that can best be studied by offering more facilities for telephone communication. I remember that when the telephone service was first started at Bathurst only 22 subscribers could be secured, but when the value of the system was realized the number rapidly increased, and now there are fully 130 persons connected with the exchange. In the same way, as soon as the people realize the benefits to be derived from a system of telephone communication between Sydney and Bathurst, such as is now provided between Sydney and Parramatta, there will be no difficulty whatever in securing a sufficient number of subscribers, not only to pay the interest on the capital outlay, but also to defray tlie cost of maintenance and to leave a fair profit. line the only long-distance telephone service careful consideration.

Tlie Minister representing the Postmaster-General. referred in tones of regret to the additional £35,000 which the department will have to expend in consequence of the That is not adoption by this Parliament of the minimum wage provision in the case of adults who have been three years in the service. I regard that provision, however, as one of the best of our legislative acts. We have no right to countenance a sweating system in any Commonwealth department. It is our duty to adequately remunerate our employees for their services. Some very hard cases indeed were brought under my notice--case s in which married men engaged in the postal service were receiving less than £ 9 0 per year. I remember one young man asking me to intercede with the Postmaster-General with a view to getting him an increase of salary. He was 26 years of age, a married man, and was in receipt of the munificent salary of £ 8 5 annually.

I wish, also, to enter my protest against the action of the Government in delaying the submission of the Estimates to' the House till this late period of the session.

In terest will have to be provided upon that amount, and we ought to know as early as possible what are the intentions of the Government in this connection. I have deemed it my duty io criticise the Estireceive early attention. mates, because I feel that strong steps ought to be taken in connection with the matters to which I have referred. A number of anomalies and cases of maladministration have been referred to by honourable members. I should like to point out that the postal authorities are acting in defiance of the law in continuing the old barbarous system of sanitation at the post offices within the metropolitan area. I am told that provision has been made for establishing the sewerage system at the offices of the department in the various suburbs, but there has been much delaj which, in the T case of a private individual, would not be allowed. what has been said in regard to the increments of the transferred public servants in the Postal department. This question has been a prominent feature of the discussions in the Chamber, and we have been assured that some decision would be arrived at. The right of these public servants to the increments has been tacitly admitted, but no steps have been taken towards their payment; and it is a bad thing for the Federal 'Government to break faith with any class. The matter of the employment of charwomen at the General Post-office ought certainly to possess some interest for the Minister in charge of .the department. No class of people, however insignificant or weak, should be neglected ; and it must be remembered that these women now have votes and can assert their rights as citizens. Up to February last 24 women were employed cleaning the General Post-office in Melbourne. That number was reduced to 21, and the services of these three have now been dispensed with. No effort has been made to replace the .discharged women j though the absence of three from a staff of 24 must make a perceptible difference in the work. It is said that many of these women are old, and that so large a number would not be required if younger women were employed. But these women have served the department well for many years, and we have not yet resorted to a system of pole-axing the old. These women should not be overworked ; and I am assured that there is ample room for the f u l l staff of 24. I hope expedition will be used in adopting the sewerage system for the metropolitan offices, and that the other matters to which I have referred will The honourable member for Macquarie has made some very sensible suggestions in regard to the telephone service. Telephones are very often used for frivolous purposes, and the attendants are kept employed on Sundays for long hours serving no particular purpose. In the interests of the subscribers there ought to be a limit to the use of the instruments, ladies, who have nothing else to do, monopolizing them for mere gossip.

The extra price of forage has to be considered. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON -Does that explanation apply to ordinary expenditure ?

151,Mr Wilks (Dalley),"I am astonishedAlthough the Postmaster-General's department is not surrounded by any glamour in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth, it is one of the most useful, and certainly the most expensive, of the Commonwealth whose annual expenditure is something like £2,400,000, is one which warrants close attention and criticism, and, under ordinary circumstances, duction in regard to details. But, inasmuch as we are now dealing with the Estimates when the votes to which they apply have been nearly exhausted, there is no opportunity to do effective work in that direction. such a prolonged one, I think that it might be well, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to continue in session a few months longer, and, before we prorogue, deal with the Estimates for the next financial year. It is only by dealing with Estimates before the money is expended that this House can exercise the control of the public purse, which is among the highest powers it or any other House of Parliament possesses. The people, too, are fast awakening to the fact that the expenditure of this and the State Governments must be closely watched. I wish to emphasize the matter to which the honourable member refers, which is of graver importance than may appear on the surface. That honourable gentleman was informed by the postal authorities in Melbourne that it is not intended that the reduced rate in regard to Commonwealth press telegrams shall apply to anything transpiring out of Melbourne. That means that the people of other parts of the Commonwealth, the citizens of that great metropolis, Sydney, or of the other State capitals, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth, are to be practically debarred the pleasure of hearing the public utterances of Commonwealth Ministers. Ministerial utterances in Melbourne can be transmitted by telegraph the Commonwealth at the rate of Is. per 100 words, the charge for telegraphing speeches delivered in any other part of the Commonwealth is 3s. per 100 words. In my opinion there should be a standard rate applying to the whole Commonwealth. become the phonograph or the whispering gallery of the Commonwealth. ter representing the might desire to make a declaration of policy Mr Wilks. in Hobart as a compliment to the people of his State, and his remarks should be telegraphed from that city to other parts of the Commonwealth at the same rate as would be charged if he spoke in Melbourne. The departments. A department Minister for Trade and Customs, too, might well desire to address his constituents in South Australia, and at the same time speak to. the larger, public of the Commonpossibly revision and rewealth, but, inasmuch as the press would have to pay 3s. instead of Is. per 100 words for telegraphing his remarks throughout the Commonwealth, he would probably find it more advantageous to speak in the whispering gallery of Melbourne, beSeeing that the session has been cause it would secure greater publicity for what he had to say. Thus his constituents who have trusted him for so many years will be debarred from hearing his melodious utterances. This is a centralization at the temporary seat of government of political thought and action which should not be permitted. The question is one which affects not only Ministers of to-day but all future Ministers, and concerns, the elector residing near .the Gulf of Carpentaria, as well as the elector residing in Victoria. I hope that the Postmaster-General will put an end to this antifederal arrangement, and thus prevent the for Macquarie growth of a feeling of jealousy against Melbourne. A salient point in connection with these Estimates to which I wish to draw attention is the fact that it is only in regard to the expenditure in Now South Wales, the mother State, and the most populous State in the Union, whose demands are growing more rapidly than those of any other State, that there has been a decrease. While the postal expenditure of New South Wales has been reduced by about £1,000, the expendiHobart, ture of the other States has been increased by £42,500. A t the same time New South Wales is the only State whose postal While revenue exceeds her expenditure, her estimated revenue being £868,000 per annum throughout -the Minister representing the Postmaster General says that that amount will be exceeded-and her expenditure only £787,000. Therefore there is a profit of £80,000 per annum in the working of the New South II Wales department, and at the same time a saving of £1,000 per annum in her expendiWe do not wish Melbourne to ture. In Victoria the revenue practically balances the expenditure, the receipts of the The Minisdepartment there being £545,000, and the Postmaster-General expenditure £544,900, while the expenditure has been increased by£7,000perannum. Similarly the expenditure of the other States has been increased, but I have not time to go through the figures in detail. I wish now to say something in regard to what I consider the bad treatment of New South Wales in regard to postal facilities. I find that the officer in charge of stores in New South Wales receives £300, although the stores under his control are more valuable than those under the control of any similar officer in any of the other States, while the Victorian officer receives £ 4 3 1 per annum. The officer in charge of stores in Queensland receives £300, his salary having formerly been £250 per annum. I find by reference to the report of the Victorian Public Service Board for 1900 that the officer in charge of stores received a salary of £350 per annum. Upon the transfer of the department to the Commonwealth, that salary was raised to £421 per annum, at which amount it now stands. This is only one case of many, and it is not to be wondered at that dissatisfaction should exist in tlie New South Wales service under these circumstances ? In all the Postal services the same salaries should be paid for services of a similar character, and there should be general uniformity of practice. Referring next to a lower grade of officers, I wish to point out that in the New South Wales service there are 143 letter sorters, whilst Victoria has 114. This latter number includes ten additional men who have been taken on since the transfer to the Commonwealth, whereas in New South Wales the number remains as before. The discrepancy in regard to salaries is greater. In Victoria the minimum wage paid to sorters is £ 1 3 0 per annum, and the maximum £ 3 15s. per week. In New South Wales, 68 sorters out of 143 receive less than the minimum salary paid in ""Victoria, whilst not even the overseer is paid so much as £ 3 15s. per week. The State which provides the most revenue and the largest profit should receive more consideration than has hitherto been paid to it, and the officers should be placed upon at least as good a footing as that occupied by employees in Victoria. The disparity in the treatment accorded to the "" men in the New South Wales and Victorian services justifies the dissatisfaction which prevails throughout New South Wales, and gives colour to the impression that Victoria is endeavouring to dominate the whole of the Commonwealth Administration. I trust that the next Estimates will be introduced at an earlier stage of the financial year, so that we may have an opportunity of passing them in review with some practical result. think that this is an occasion upon which we should enter into details in connection with the Post and Telegraph department, but there are one or two questions of administration and of policy to which I should like to refer. In the first place, I endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Coolgardie with reference to the administration of the Post and Telegraph department of Western Australia, which has for many years past caused universal dissatisfaction. Every one blames the present head of the department as the cause of all the trouble. This gentleman was in the same position in the old days before the discovery of gold, when the population of the State was only 40,000 or 50,000, and he has never seemed to fully realize the great change that has taken place since gold was discovered, and the population has increased to nearly 200,000. He continued to manage the affairs of tlie department in the same way as fifteen or twenty years before. A t the time of the federal referendum he adopted the extraordinary course of issuing a circular to the officers of the department expressing a desire that they should not vote for federation. In that circular he said that the only man in the service whom federation could benefit was himself. He seemed to believe that under federation he would have even more autocratic powers than thosepreviously exercised by him and he acted under that delusion unti' he was checked by the Postmaster-General. When the strike that occurred in 1895 was settled, one of the conditions was tn&t the interests of the officials who took part in the trouble should not be in any way prejudiced, but I shall show from a letter written by the Deputy Postmaster-General that that stipulation has been disregarded by him. In a letter written by him, after he had become an officer of the Commonwealth, to the postmaster at Coolgardie, in reference to an official who desired to be promoted to a vacant position, he said, referring to this officialHJS name appears as one of those connected with the strike in 1895. If he failed me then, what guarantee have I that he will not do soagain ?",38,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not
152,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"I hardlyThat is the way in ""which the present Deputy Postmaster-General has kept the terms of an amicable settlement arrived at with . the employees of the department in Coolgardie. I trust that the Public Service Commissioner, or whoever has control of the actions of this gentleman, will make the fullest inquiry. I am told on good authority that he would have been dispensed with long ago, but for the fact that he is entitled to a pension. We should effect a saving of public money in the end if we pensioned him off, and appointed a live, active man in his place. Until some change is made in that direction, there is absolutely no hope of giving satisfaction in the administration of the Post and Telegraph department of Western Australia. I sincerely trust that as a matter of policy the Post and Telegraph department in Western Australia will not be conducted upon purely commercial lines. In such large and sparsely-populated territories as are to be found in most of the States a certain number of postal services must be maintained at a direct loss. Some of these services form the only links which connect the people in the, outlying districts with civilization, and if they are stopped a large area of country, in which men now carry on mining and other operations, must be abandoned. Therefore, although the services may involve a direct cash loss to the Commonwealth Government, the indirect gain is considerable. The idea of the Commonwealth Government is that where services of this kind are carried on, the States should defray some portion of the loss involved in their maintenance. to contribute. by the Postmaster-General I.noticed that the idea was expressed by him that any loss upon these services should be made up by the States. pay the money and then get it back. ing period that would be so. It would pay the Commonwealth to maintain these small services even if they cost five times as much as they do. If by their maintenance the country is kept open to the prospector, and only one valuable goldfield-suc h as Kalgoorlie, or the Boulder -is discovered, the Commonwealth will be recouped a hundredfold. I hope that the two matters which I have mentioned will receive due consideration. I have not the slightest hesitation in affirming-and I believe that nine people out of ten in Western Australia share my opinion-that the public will never be satisfied with the administration of the Postal department in that State so long as the services of the present Deputy Postmaster-General are retained. nise that in connection with the administration of this department the' Minister has had a great deal of work. Following up the question which was raised by the honourable member for Macquarie, I wish to institute a comparison between the different rates charged upon telephonic lines in the various States. Looking at the reports before me, I find that between Melbourne and Ballarat, a distance of 75 miles, there are two services. I understand that the rate charged upon these lines is Is. 6d. for five mintues' conversation; whereas between Sydney and Newcastle, a distance of 102 miles, it is 2s. 6d. for three minutes' conversation. There is thus a vast difference between the rate charged upon lines of somewhat similar length. The revenue from the Ballarat lines about meets the expenditure, whereas during the first year in which the Newcastle line was established, namely, 1898, it realized a profit of £200. In 1899 the income from the latter jumped from £77 9 to £1,143, thus yielding a profit of £569. The loss upon the telegraph service during the first year was £351, but in 1899 it was only £292. Deducting this loss I find that there was a total increase in the revenue of £126. Last year the revenue from the telephone line, so far as the NewI n a speech delivered castle end is concerned, was -approximately £900, or only £ 2 0 0 short of tlie total receipts for the year previous. It seems to me that if the charge levied in one State is Is. 6d. for five minutes' conversation, it is but fair that other States should be similarly treated. If Is. 6d. is too low a rate, then-a D u r in g the bookkeepmargin should be struck which will permit of the lines being made reproductive. I notice that the number of messages transmitted daily between Newcastle and Sydney is in excessof the numbertransmittedbetweenany other two Australian cities. A second service to Newcastle is urgently required. It frequently happens that business men have to wait half-an-hour before they can get access to the single line which at present exists. If a second service were established it seems",40,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not

157,Mr Watkins (Newcastle),"I recogto me that more business would be done, because the-inconvenience of waiting would be obviated. U p t i ll a month ago the charge levied upon the Newcastle line was 3s. for three minutes' conversation. If the line between Melbourne and Ballarat is paying, it necessarily follows that the charge levied upon the Newcastle line is excessive. I think that we should have uniformity in this connection. made the rates uniform over all telephone lines, and reduced the charges. objection can be taken. I hope that the Minister will take cognisance of the fact that the line to Newcastle is a profitable one, and that the establishment of a second service would result in an increased revenue. MrM c DONALD . (Kennedy) -There are one or two matters to which I should like to direct attention. Some little time ago a deputation waited upon the Postmaster-General and urged upon him the necessity for providing an extra mail service to the northern portion of Queensland. The whole of the representatives of that State were present at the deputation, but they received no definite assurance from the Minister that Anything would be done in the matter, save that a report would be obtained as to the cost which the proposal involved. I do not know whether that report has yet been secured, but I wish .to point out that at tlie present time the northern portion of Queensland receives only one mail a week. run weekly, but, despite this fact, there is practically only one mail service a week. For example, a mail leaves Brisbane upon Friday night, which catches the Barcoo at Gladstone on Saturday at noon. On Monday morning it reaches Townsville and Charters Towers, where it is delivered about two or three o'clock in the afternoon. Of course, there is a boat leaving Brisbane on Saturday, but although it leaves that city only a few hours later than the train, its mails are not received in Northern Queensland t i ll four or fivedays have elapsed. Another boat which leaves on the Monday arrives' in Townsville, weather and other circumstances permitting, on the Friday night, and the letters are delivered on the Saturday. Oftener than otherwise, however, this boat does not arrive t ill Saturday morning, with the result that the mail does not reach Charters Towers until Saturday night by the seven o'clock or tlie eleven o'clock train, too late for delivery that day. The mail is delivered on Mondays, when the letters, which have been posted five days later, are also delivered about five hours afterwards. It will be seen that there is really only one mail per week to serve two large centres with a population of about 45,000, who are deserving of much better treatment. Some years ago the late Mr T. J. Byrnes, when Premier of Queensland, decided that the GovernI f that be so, no ment should buy a fast steamer and have the mails conveyed twice a week from Gladstone to Townsville, but, unfortunately, that gentleman's death caused the project to be put aside. The present Premier, Mr Philp, contends that an extra mail is not required; but he was a member of the Byrnes Government when it was decided to build a fast steamer. . Mr Philp's real reason for opposing the running of the two mails is the extra expense at the present time. ThatI could understand as an ar<rument against the project just now, but I cannot understand it as an argument why these two centres should be content with one mail a week. All the western country would be served by the extra mail, together with places like Mackay, Bowen, Cairns, and Cooktown. The whole of the north of Queensland, with a population of some hundred thousand, would be benefited ; and we ought to try to bring those large centres as close to one another as possible. I understand that the subsidy asked for by It is quite true tliat three boats the present steam-ship companies, who have a monopoly on the coast, is out of all proportion to the work done. For a long time the people of Hughenden have been promised additions to their post-office, which at present consists of a room 6 feet by 8 feet, in which all the business has to be transacted. I understand that the department approve of the work, but there is a desire that the expenditure should be met out of loan money, of which there is at present none available. The cost would not be more than £ 1 3 0 or £150, yet the Government allow that objection to stand in the way. I should also like to urge the construction of a telegraph line from Richmond along the Flinders.

166,Mr Watson,"I do not remember thean error of judgment, involving the country in an absolute loss within two years of between £20,000 and £30,000. The public interests of Australia in connection with telephones and telegraphs and other electrical undertakings are so enormous that we want men who have graduated elsewhere than in Australia to advise us in regard to our expenditure. In my opinion we should obtain an expert from America or England to inspect our existing electrical appliances. It is evident that the various State officials have not the opportunity to keep themselves up to date in regard to the development of electrical engineering. No other science is progressing with such leaps and bounds, and it is expecting too much from men whose time is taken up with the routine of their everyday work to ask them to keep abreast of, aud in touch with, such development. Therefore, I think that I am justified, in view of the loss to the country, and the inconvenience caused 'to the thousands of subscribers in larger centres in asking the Government to engage some foreign expert at a large fee to advise them in regard to these undertakings. Only a little while ago, when the Sydney Municipal Council proposed to lay down an electric lighting plant, they brought out Major Cardew, and paid him £1,000 for his advice on the subject, and I think that the money was well spent. In my opinion, it is unwise for us to hand ove.r to officials who may be worthy men, but who are not, and who cannot be expected to be, up to date, such vast sums of money as are contained in these Estimates and in the loan Estimates. I trust that the Government will have an inquiry made into the circumtances under which the Sydney fiasco occurred, and will place the responsibility upon the proper shoulders. pears likely on the face of it , the officers are responsible, they should no longer be retained in their positions, though if the blunder was a Ministerial one we cannot unfortunately punish the offender. A t any rate, the departmental officers ought to have advised that the accommodation which the switch-board provides woidd not be sufficient. Althoughi t has been in position for only about eighteen months, it cannot take more than 200 additional subscribers. But the departmental officers knew that the telephone system had been rapidly increasing in Sydney for years past, hundreds joining every year, and they should have advised against the erection of a switch-board which would be inadequate within a very short time. In my opinion the telephone system should be extended throughout the country to a much greater degree than is now the case. In New South Wales, despite bad management and the mistakes which have been made, the telephones are paying handsomely. are interfering with the telephone system in some cases for the sake of the telegraphs. That should not be. so in some cases, but if we can add to the convenience of the people, we should be prepared to wipe off the money already expended upon telegraphs. the department should attempt to prevent the construction of telephones, if they will get as much revenue from them as from telegraphs. encourage the use of telephones by increasing telephonic communication, and erecting more trunk lines. heavy expense. justifiable if a fair return is obtained. The present permanent head of the Post-office has in a most foolish manner pointed to what he terms the extravagant expenditure in New South Wales, ignoring the fact that the New South Wales postal revenue more than justifies that expenditure. Where the revenue is small, only a small expenditure is, perhaps, justifiable; but where, by largely increasing the expenditure you can correspondingly increase your revenue, an inI f , as apcrease of expenditure is justifiable. Unfortunately, some people will not recognise that. I believe that with an up-to-date telephone system and better management the rates charged to subscribers would be considerably reduced, and that a good profit would still be left to the department. It seems to me that the telephones would pay if business houses in New South Wales were charged less than £ 9 per annum, and private householders less than £ 5 per annum. increase of revenue if 'a reduction were made.",43,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not

173,Mr Sydney Smith,"There would be an 'be an increase in the net return. I have noted with a good deal of interest the fact that nearly all important country towns in New South Wales are now having telephone exchanges installed, notwithstanding the high rates charged to subscribers. I hope to see the time when, not only will every town havo its exchange, but residents living at considerable distances round about -perhap s twenty miles oui-wil l be able to avail themselves of the conveniences of telephonic communication. Unfortunately the methods of the department are so conservative that little encouragement is given to the people to avail themselves of these facilities. To my mind, it is a pity that the portfolio of Postmaster-General is not held by a Minister who is a member of this House. A large semi-commercial concern like the Postal department should be represented in the House whose members represent, separate constituencies, because it is localities that are chiefly interested in these matters, and we should have an opportunity of speaking directly to the Minister responsible for the control of the department. In the additional Estimates circulated by the Treasurer, I find that £ 5 5 0 has been set down to provide for alterations to the post-office at Young, in New South Wales. I wish to assure the Treasurer that that sum is altogether inadequate for the purpose. Some two years ago the postal authorities in New South Wales agreed that it was necessary, in order to allow the business of the office to be properly conducted, to make certain alterations, and the Government Architect reported that those alterations could not be made for less than £S00. Since then there has been no material change in the price of materials or the cost of labour, and therefore the reduction in the amount set down must mean a reduction in the proposed additional accommodation. I would impress upon the Treasurer, and upon the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, that what we ask for is not a tower, or some ornamental addition, but increased accommodation, which is absolutely required. I trust that before the work is begun, inquiries will be made which will insure that no mistakes will occur which will, compel the re-opei ing of the matter within a year or two. In conclusion, I wish to say that the amount expended by the Postal department is so large that the most careful administration is required at I think that there would the hands of both the Minister and his permanent advisers, and for that reason I emphasize the suggestion which I have already made, that expert advice should be obtained in regard to the highly technical services connected with telephonic and telegraphic communication. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia.) -Attention has been directed by several honourable members to the necessity of maintaining mail communication between the sparsely-populated inland districts and the large centres of civilization, and I desire to direct attention to the desirableness of improving the mail facilities between the capitals and our outlying coastal settlements. A few years ago there was direct steam communication between Adelaide and Esperance Bay in Western -Australia, but for some time past the people of Esperance have had to depend for their mails, and also for their stores, upon a small branch service from Albany. This matter has been brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General by honourable members representing Western Australia in both branches of the Legislature. In January last a special effort was made to induce the Postmaster-General to call for tenders for a direct service between Adelaide and Esperance Bay. Such a means of communication would prove of the greatest advantage, not only to the people of Esperance, but to the mercantile communities of the eastern States. But whether it is due to the desire of the mercantile community of Fremantle and Perth to have all the trade pass through their hands or to the fact that the department has been prevented by pressure of work from giving attention to the matter, no service has been established. The business people of the eastern States who have been trading with Esperance Bay for a number of years, and whose capital has been expended in the development of that district, have to submit to their mails and merchandise being carried past that port to Fremantle or Albany and then being brought back again, solely in order to comply with the wishes of a certain section of the Western Australian mercantile community. This inflicts great hardship upon all concerned. The cost of a mail service between Adelaide and Esperance would not be very great, because no doubt many of the coastal steamers that now trade between the eastern States and Albany and Fremantle -would call in at Esperance Bay both going",44,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not
174,Mr Watson,"and coming. I hope that the Government will see their way to deal with this matter at an early date. A proposal for the establishment of a mail service by steamer between Port Darwin and Singapore was favourably considered by the mail authorities of South Australia before the Post and Telegraph department was taken over by the Commonwealth. For many years there was some kind of mail communication between these places by means of a line of steamers subsidized by the South Australian Government for the conveyance of live cattle to Java and Singapore. The subsidy and the service have now been discontinued, and the people of Port Darwin are deprived of facilities for direct trade with London via Singapore. All their goods have to pass through the hands of merchants in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and in many cases their supplies have to be brought back to them after having been carried past their doors and half-way round the continent. This proposed service might readily be extended to Thursday Island, on the one side, and Cambridge Gulf on the other. This would confer immense advantages in the way of mail communication and trade, which have been pointed out to the State authorities. In 1900 the Postmaster-General of South Australia called for tenders, but I have never heard how they were dealt with. The State Government were in full sympathy with the proposal, and, I believe, are still ready to support it . But the postal authorities apparently either have not the time or the inclination to deal with such a very important subject. I hope the matter will be inquired into. Trade between the northern parts of Australia and Singapore was rapidly increasing when the steamer service to which I have referred was discontinued, and I have no doubt that a large trade would soon be developed if a moderate subsidy were offered. We know that the Post and Telegraph services very nearly pay their way, and as the main object of the department should be to serve the requirements of the community, and not to make a profit, I do not think that in asking that additional mail services may be maintained for the benefit of our somewhat distant coastal settlements we are requesting too much. I should like to direct attention to the employment of Chinese and other aliens in the Post and Telegraph department at Port 37 x Darwin. In October last I asked the following-question :Whether any, and if so, how many, Chinese and other Asiatic aliens have been employed in the Post and Telegraph department in the Northern Territory of South Australia since the department was taken over by tlie Commonwealth ? The reply given by the Minister was""Fifteen Chinese, but no other Asiatics have been empkryed in the Post and Telegraph department in the Northern Territory of South Australia since it was taken over by the Commonwealth. They were all employed previous to the transfer, and were taken over with the department. In view of the fact that the Government are administering a very stringent Immigration Restriction Bill and other measures directed against the introduction and employment of coloured labour, I desire to know whether the postal authorities at Port Darwin are continuing to employ Asiatics to the exclusion of Europeans. MrV . L . SOLOMON"" I am not aware whether their employment has ceased, but the honourable member will recollect that in October last some surprise was caused when the reply to my question showed that after taking over this department, the Government which professed to be so strong upon the subject of a white Australia had continued to employ Asiatic aliens. I hope that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will inform the House before the debate upon the Estimates is concluded, whether the services of these Chinese employees hove been dispensed with, because there are plenty of youths-the sons of men who have settled in the northern portion of Australia-wh o experience the greatest difficulty in find'-' c i suitable employment, and who would oe only too glad to take their places. I have nothing more to add at the present stage. There are one or two items to which I should like to refer, but I shall have an opportunity of dealing with them when the details of the Estimates are under consideration. rally when the Estimates of a department are under discussion honourable members take advantage of the opportunity to air tlieir complaints. But I think we should give credit to those administering a department whenever it is due to them, and as a Queenslander I desire to compliment' the Government upon their action in regard to",45,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not

Unfortunately, Queensland has of late years been too much in the grasp of two or three monopolists. that pressure has been brought to bear upon the Post and Telegraph of that State, and I am pleased indeed to find that there was sufficient backbone in the Commonwealth Government to resist that pressure and to bring the Cobb and Co. monopoly to its knees. But I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to one item in the Estimates which seems to me to be grossly unfair. By a certain section of the press, and particularly by the daily newspapers of Queensland, the administration of the Commonwealth is. continually being referred to as expensive. portunity Government, it, to make it appear to the public that that administration upon very extravagant matter of fact-as 1 is shown by the official reports-as decided to enter the Federation the expenditure of the various departments which were to be transferred was abnormally inflated. If one examines the reports of the railway commissioner prior to the federal referendum being taken he will find that whereas £40,000 per annum used to be charged by the commissioner for the carriage of mails in that State, as soon as it was clear that the Post and Telegraph department would become a federal institution, this cost was run up to £50,000an increaseof £10,000. Of course the increase makes no actual difference to Queensland from the point of view of money. It simply means that that State will have to make up the additional £10,000, whilst the receipts from the Railway department will show £10,000 more than -is actually earned. I think honourable members will agree that within two or three years the cost of carrying the mails in that State has not increased to the extent indicated. apparent increase makes the administration of the Commonwealth appear expensive-a grossly unfair proceeding. Further, I think I am justified in saying that even when the Railway department received £40,000 for the I think carriage of mails in Queensland it was being paid more than enough for the services rendered. In this connection I have taken the trouble to consult Coghlan's statistics for the year 1899. be a greater mileage of railways in Queensland now 1 It is not the first time construction has been undertaken in Queensland during the past two or three years. I department 'find that in New South Wales there are 2,896 miles of railway; in Victoria, 3,218 miles ; in Queensland, 2,801 miles ; and in South Australia, 1,901 miles. When comparing these figures, honourable members should recollect that in New South Wales and Victoria there are more double lines than exist in the other States, and con-, sequently the railways of the two States mentioned do not cover the same distance that is traversed by the lines of South Australia and Queensland. During 1899 Every opNew South Wales carried 76,726,700 letis seized by the Queensland ters and post-cards; Victoria, 77,796,600; and by the press behind Queensland, 21,181,300; and South Australia, 19,765,400.

Similarly, New South Wales carried 13,986,600 packets; Victoria, 23,614,200; Queensland, 11,663,300; and South Australia, 1,531,400. When the charges made by the railways in the different States are compared, it will be seen tliat the Railway department of Queensland is being paid much more relatively for the service which it renders than are the departments of the other States. The Post and Telegraph department in New South Wales pays the Railway department £73,440, whilst the volume of mail matter carried in that State is three and a half times greater than that carried in Queensland. In Victoria, the Railway department is paid £58,810, or only £8,810 more than is charged by the Queensland Railway department, despite the fact that Victoria carries three and a half times the quantity of mail matter. In South Australia, the railways are paid Nevertheless, the £17,370 for the carriage of mails.

But in the other States, notably in Victoria, a march was stolen on the Federal Government by undertaking increased services and increased expenditure just prior to the transfer of the department. the Federal Government, while exercising due care over the expenditure to the extent of seeing that no moneys are wasted, will not go back to the old rigid policy of demanding guarantees before postal or telegraphic facilities in developing districts. in development, and a narrow-minded policy in this connection would more than anything have the effect of bringing the federal movement and federal into disfavour. knowledge only of New South Wales, and in my own electorate there are a number of new centres where mining and land settlement are going on, and where the natural desire is to have reasonable postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities. ber of necessary works were under review -during the last twelve months of State -control, and in some cases were approved ; but it was decided, in pursuance of the policy of the State no action should be taken of the transfer to the The only reply the people of those centres, .and I acting for them, could obtain from the Postmaster-General twelve months amounted to this, that he .and his officials were engaged in determining some common policy in regard to guarantees, and some common method for providing facilities of the kind desired, and that until they were settled matters would have to stand in abeyance. these improvements have had to stand in .abeyance for the twelve months preceding the transfer of the department, and the twelve months since they were transferred. Three or four glaring instances of the delays to which I refer are those in connection with the telephone extension from Waroo to Begerebong, and in connection with the extension to the Bena settlement, to the Landsdale settlement, and to Woodlands. A considerable amount of dissatisfaction was caused by the guarantees by tiie State authorities in New South Wales prior to federation. taking the reconstruction or telegraphic communications the department very often required a guarantee from Mr Broien. persons in the district concerned-ofte n from five approved persons-for the payment of any difference between the cost of the service and the receipts, the result being that these people had sometimes to I hope pay a small initiatory deficiency while the general community benefited.

If that is the system to be adopted, administration it is a worse one than the very bad system I can speak ' with special hitherto in force in New South Wales, and instead of the Commonweath department extending facilities of communication to pioneer communities, they will be placing additional handicaps upon them. I wish to bring, under the notice of the MinisterA numthe great inconvenience which the mail contractors in New South Wales and elsewhere are suffering through the continued prevalence of the drought. Attention has already been directed to the matter more Government, that than once, and the Minister representing in view the Prime Minister received a strong Commonwealth. and representative deputation from New South Wales this afternoon, asking for special consideration. I wish the Postduring the past master-General to extend this consideration to the mail contractors. I have made representations to the department on their behalf, but hitherto not with very great success. In one case where a light mail is sent over a long distance by the contractor by means of a horse and sulky, according to the terms Therefore, of his contract, he asked to be allowed to substitute a bicycle service, but the reply I received from the department in regard to the matter was that consent could not be given to vary the contract in the manner proposed. Considering, however, the exceptional conditions, and the fact that the keen competition causes these services to be undertaken at extremely low rates, I think the request might have been complied with. In another case the Postmaster-General consented to reduce the service by 50 per required cent., but, at the same time, made a reduction of 25 per cent, upon the mileBefore underage allowance, and I have since been of telephonic informed by the postal authorities that where a reduction in the services is made, a corresponding reduction will also be made in the allowances, too. I think, however, tliat, considering the low rates at which the contracts are let, the contractors might be given more liberal treatment. If the Federal Government are willing to remit the duties upon fodder for the benefit of those who have starving stock to feed, they ought also to do something for the mail contractors who have to use horses to carry out their contracts; and when reductions are made in the services they should not insist upon a corresponding or even a smaller decrease in the allowances. I wish also to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the fact that, while the townships on the New South Wales western railway lines have been benefited in certain directions by an alteration in the train service, their postal facilities have been reduced. Previously, only one train a day was run from Sydney to places west of Orange. It left at eight p.m., and carried the mails. Now trains leave at half-past seven p.m. and nine p.m., the former only carrying mails. The result of that arrangement is tliat the mails close much earlier than they did formerly, and the trading community in the townships affected are thus put to considerable inconvenience. I do not know upon what lines the Government intend to proceed in regard to expenditure upon public works. I notice that in the supplementary Estimates ±'4,000 is put down for the construction of a new post-office at Inverell amongst other places ; but when I asked for improvements to existing offices in Orange and Parkes, I was informed that the money could not be provided out of current revenue, and would have to come out of loan funds. all expenditure, except in regard to very large buildings, to the revenue vote. because I have had considerable trouble with the department in regard to necessary alterations in the Parkes office. The expenditure of £ 1 0 0 has been authorized for the carrying out of repairs to that office, and an expenditure of £ 1 6 0 for providing protection against the weather for the public. The department held that the first expenditure should come out of revenue and the other out of loan funds, which would mean that the work would have to be carried out in two sections, entailing extra cost and considerable inconvenience. the two alterations to be made at the same time? surer to say that part of the work was provided for in the Loan Vote, and that he could not anticipate Parliamentary sanction by ordering it to be carried out. the amount involved was so very small, I authorized both works to be carried out at the same time. it. I am also pleased to know that the cost of a large number of works which it was originally proposed to provide for out of loan funds is to be defrayed out of revenue. I hope that included among these will be the proposed additions to the Orange post-office, which were approved by the State Government, and for which bhe sum of £2,000 was allotted prior to the transfer of the department to the Commonwealth. The statement made by the Treasurer will tend to remove a great deal of dissatisfaction. half of my constituents, to compliment the Government on the stand they took with reference to the contracts of Cobb& Co. for the carriage of mails in Queensland The Postmaster-General was told when he permitted Cobb& Co. to create a monopoly in Queensland, that he would live to regret it if he continued to administer the affairs of the Post-office. I am sure that the honourable gentleman little thought that that prediction would so soon be realized. In times gone by, Cobb& Co. found it comparatively easy to obtain concessions from the Government, but it is forI have transferred tunate that the administration is now less, amenable than formerly to local influences. I desire to call attention to the vote trim to defray his expenses to London to attend the International Telegraphic Conference. Every one knows that the conference has been postponed for two years, and therefore there is no necessity for the vote being placed on the present Estimates. When the conference was postponed, Mr. Outtrim had reached Colombo, and he was. asked by cable whether he would continue his journey to London on leave or come back. Of course, he continued his journey. If I were given ' the same option, I should do as Mr Outtrim did. I cannot understand",48,George Turner What Are The Minister That The Government Would Not

All that will be altered next time. the public service we should do everything possible to secure a contented staff. If any officers are entitled to increases of salaries, it is not for us to inquire whether the States Governments have done rightly or wrongly in providing for them, but we should pay strict regard to existing rights. All that the Victorian officers desire is that they shall be placed upon the same footing as officials in the other States. I glory in the pluck which they exhibit in attempting to uphold what they regard as their rights. The other evening, when I objected' to the for the Victorian deallowances paid to Mr Cohen and Mr Lewis, the honourable member for Parraniatta asked Dealing first with the clerical why those officers should not receive allowances, seeing that they formed a part of their agreement with the Commonwealth Government. But I would point out tliat the same argument is applicable to Mr Scott and Mr Oxenham. ' They accepted their present appointments upon the understanding that the former would receive £1,000 a year with an allowance of £ 2 2s. per week, and the latter £600 a year, with an allowance of £ 2 per week. I ask the Minister, what are his intentions in regard to the agreement entered into with these officers when they relinquished their State positions 1 In the northern State they were one considered twoof the most trusted and valued officers in the Postal department, and that department to-day, upon the score of efficiency, is second to none in the Commonwealth.

One or two honourable members have complained of the difference which exists between the charge levied for telegraphing the speeches of honourable members and that exacted for transmitting the utterances of Ministers.

That is rather unjust under the circumstances. To my mind a certain .amount of latitude should be allowed. There is just one other matter of some importance to tlie people of Western Aus. tralia to which I must allude. It has already been mentioned by some of my col. leagues. I refer to the admistration of the Postal department of Western Australia by . the gentleman who has been in charge of it for a considerable number of years. I have no hesitation in declaring that his management has been characterized by very gross incapacity, and by a senseless tyranny over his officers generally. Within the service itself there is very grave dissatisfaction, and there is also general discontent amongst the outside public. I am convinced that if the Government investigate this matter, they will arrive at the conclusion that it will be an advantage to the Commonwealth . generally, and to Western Australia in particular, if they retire the present chief of the postal department in that State. under some fair and equitable arrangement, and appoint in his stead an officer who is more up-to-date, and one who is imbued with more democratic ideas regarding the treatment of his subordinates. I do not wish to dwell on this matter. It is somewhat unpleasant for me to say as much as I have said, but I felt -impelled by a sense of duty to my constituents and the publio of Western Australia to mention the' subject. Mr PO YNTON(South Australia) -From time to time. I have brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and also of honourable members, the question of the increments which were due lost June to a number of letter carriers and others, and which have not yet been paid. I have been told that the increments cannot be paid until these Estimates are passed. Are these allowances included in the Estimates; and if any are omitted, will the Minister undertake to have the matter rectified t which officers are entitled are provided for in been informed that, in Victoria alone, the Estimates, so far as I know. The rule is not to pay until the Estimates are passed, but under the circumstances I gave permission for their payment with the June salaries. Of course I do not know whether the increments to which the honourable member is particularly referring are included in the Estimates, and I should be glad if he would let me have a list. list at the present. When under the South Australian Government these officers were entitled to annual increments, which were paid without waiting for the passing of the Estimates. the only Statei n which the Government have been paying increments which are due under Act of Parliament. increments, due under regulation, which have been held over by the Treasurer until the passing of the Estimates. titled to the allowances, I am perfectly sure these have been provided for in the Estimates. in Victoria are on the whole receiving less remuneration than is paid in the other States. I am informed that while in Victoria no trousers are provided by the department, in Queensland each letter carrier is given, in addition to the coat which is allowed in each State, four pairs of trousers per year. The Victorian letter-carriers, prior to retrenchment, were allowed trousers, and in New South Wales three pairs are provided, together with, as in Queensland, a mackintosh to each man. Sir PHILIPFYSH I had not intended -to make any special reply to the criticisms which have been offered. I thought the better plan would be to peruse the report which the Ha/nsard staff so readily and accurately give us, and submit the requests made to the Postmaster-General. As to the observations of the honourable member for Maranoa, I think a reply could best be given when we deal with individual items. I , do not think it desirable to enter into the important question which the honourable member for Bland properly raised as to the desirability of having a thoroughly qualified expert electrician associated with the department.

In the neighbourhood of the telephone exchange in Melbourne, tons of wire are sagging across the street, to the danger of the traffic. I propose to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General and the Cabinet all the suggestions which have been made, and as the committee deal with the items I shall take care to be prepared with full information.

We are dealing with an administration which extends over the whole of Australia, with 50,000 miles of telegraph wires and 12,400 employees. It can be imagined what an enormous task the Postmaster-General has had to gather all the strings together before a year has passed, and to issue regulations, remedying defects and extending the usefulness of the services. The Postmaster General has had his central staff only about eleven months, and if he has been able to accomplish so much in that time he will, as he learns the requirements of the country, still further extend and complete the department year by year. there is new expenditure to the amount of £5,360.

The secretary to the Postmaster-General, who is running the whole department, could not be expected to take less than is being paid to the Deputy Postmaster General in one of the States.
