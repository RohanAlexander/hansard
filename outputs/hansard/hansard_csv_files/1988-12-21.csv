The Government is But this $5m is not a trivial issue. We are not inclined to go beyond that point. We are concerned not to have the Senate trying to not inclined to reverse the decision that we make a patchwork quilt out of our Budgettook in the context of a difficult budgetary that is, accepting some parts of it but trying situation, and I might say pursuing a fiscal to add to expenditure in other parts of it.

It is the role of the claim that we should be spending less money, properly elected government, and that is what not more. But in the context of trying to get we have done and that is what we continue fiscal policy right-and we have been far to do. It is for that reason that we are not more successful than any other government going to accept the Senate's insistence on that has gone before us in that sense-we this particular measure and, lest there be any had to make some difficult decisions and this suggestion there is an inconsistent approach was one of them.

Secondly, there is the sumably the majority in the Senate has difrelated question of eligibility for Austudy. ferent advice, and during the period between The way in which Austudy operates at the now and when the Parliament next remoment, eligibility is determined by those sumes-because I do not expect that this students who are enrolled in government matter will be resolved tonight-there will supported courses and therefore those who be the opportunity to further pursue that have been enrolled in courses in these busimatter.

If one asks a bunch of that the Opposition and the Senate will conlawyers for their opinion on this sort of template the potential damage that they have subject, one gets a range of views.
