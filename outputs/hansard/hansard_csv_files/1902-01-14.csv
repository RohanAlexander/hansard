Honourable members will see that that is a much more serious statement than the one which had appeared in the press before the adjournment of Parliament, and a statement which I , for oneI suppose there are others in the House penny-a-liner 1 Times from the Vossiche Zeitung, one of the leading newspapers in Germany. I suppose. newspapers in Germany. But if tlie honourable member is inclined to group all these press attacks from German sources as pennya-line ones, then perhaps he will be not at all inclined to think there is any truth in them. I am one of those who say that there is no truth in them, and I think the time has come when, taking this fact in conjunction with other facts which I shall presently relate, I should propose to suspend the standing orders, in order to afford the House the first opportunity of passing some resolution which will leave no uncertainty about the feeling and the loyalty of this Parliament and this country. Had this request for troops come to the Government while Parliament was sitting no action would have been taken without a full opportunity for discussion ; though the Government certainly would not have refused-it would have agreed to send any troops, and would have submitted, if the House was not sitting, its determination to Parliament afterwards, for honourable members to take such action as But what was the position at that time ? No one can doubt the importance of the German newspaper which was responsible for the statement published in the press of the 9th December. much amplified, and appeared to be much stronger when, on the 17th December, after the House rose, I received a message telling ine what had actually been quoted in the Times from the German journal I have referred to. On the 10th December last, as honourable members will recollect, there from the ex-Minister, of Defence for Victoria suggesting an offer of 5,000 troops, and on the 11th December the question of offering these troops was discussed in the press, and was common talk among citizens. ""When the question was asked me by the honourable member for .Kennedy on the. 11th December, the matter of that offer was in the minds of every one, and the question which I assumed the honourable member to ask me was wrote that, some whether we had determined to offer any troops. It had been fully determined by the Government at that time not to offer any troops, or at any rate not to make any offer without consulting Parliament. I may say, if I may be allowed to do so, that before I stated to tlie honourable member It is one of the leading that it was not the intention of the Government to offer troops, I had made a similar declaration which had appeared in the press, and I made that statement on two grounds. The first was that when the spontaneous offers of troops were made by the various Australasian colonies in October, 1899, the situation was wholly different from that which existed in December last. The British arms had sustained certain reverses, and the Boers had threatened to drive all the English in South Africa into the seawe see now from recent disclosures how they were preparing to do this. that threat ? matter, because I think it is common knowledge; but if tlie honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne will look back to the papers of tlie time, he will see that the leading Boers had uttered this threat, and that it was published in the newspapers of the old country. papers they have already killed 3,000,000 they might be advised. Boers in South Africa. can give their own version of these matters, and I accept the responsibility for my own. The whole question which' was This statement was agitating the minds of the public on the 11th December, and which I assumed to be agitating the mind of the honourable member for Kennedy was, whether the Government intended to offer troops to the British Government.

43,Mr Mcdonald,According to the news,17,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
44,Mr Barton,"Honorabl e membersany such offer, and I may state the reasons why. After the reverses, to which I have referred, had been sustained by the British arms, the situation was totally different from that which existed in December last, because, as we all know, although sufficient troops were eventually sent to South Africa to retrieve the major part, if not the whole of the losses incurred, there was a lapse of time during which reinforcements from us would be peculiarly acceptable, in order to fill up the gap before a fresh array corps could be sent from England. Therefore the offer made by the colonies was peculiarly opportune. The situation was not the same in December last, and [ freely grant that to the honourable member for Kennedy. made before there was auy fighting in South Africa. Wales Parliament, and supported the offer to which I refer, and my memory does not take me back the same distance as that of the honourable member. He may be right, or he may be wrong. However, there was a time when there was an insufficiency of troops in South Africa, and it was at that time that the offer was made by the different States now forming the Commonwealth. Premier of Queensland, offered troops long before war was declared. a proved insufficiency of troops in South Africa at the time to which I refer-that was a matter that, to use the popular parlance, was "" sticking out."" Time went on and the reverses to British arms were retrieved. Johannesburg was taken, and Bloemfontein and Pretoria were also captured, and when I was asked whether tlie Government would make an offer of troops we had arrived at this position: The Marquis of Salisbury had previously stated in his Guildhall speech that every week showed that the British aims were making substantial progress in South Africa. The situation in December last was different also, because of the practice established by the British Government itself, and for this reason I now pvopose to mention some facts which may have been to some extent forgotten. About the 1st March, 1900, 2,000 Imperial buskmen were asked for. The message received was as follows :Her Majesty's Government require additional force of 2,000 men of a similar kind to the bushmen for general service anywhere in South Africa, and they are confident tliat Australia will respond tofchisfurther call. Theu follows a statement of the terms on which the Imperial Government would provide for that contingent. On 2.9th December, 1900, the Secretary of State for the Colonies wired us to the effect that Lord Kitchener had paid a high compliment to the services rendered by the Australian troops, and that Her Majesty's Government would highly appreciate such additional assistance as the colonies might be able to give. The telegram suggested that the strength of the contingent should be kept up by drafts of men from the colonies, as Lord Kitchener would be sorry to have any clkninutiou of the mounted troops. That telegram was sent to each, of the States, so that the position of affairs which existed I was in the New South when this Government had come to the conclusion not to make a speeifie offer of troops, had existed from March, 1900, or for a year and eight months or more, up to the 11th December, last year. We had evidence of the sure and substantial progress of the British arms, offered by the speech of the Marquis of Salisbury, and also the fact that instead of i^s being thought a humiliation on the part of the British Government to Mr Dickson, the ask for troops, there were at least these two specific occasions-in March and December, 1900-o n which they had asked that contingents might be sent out by us. That being the case, and tlie Government knowing that on at least two occasions before a general request had beenmade to the States for troops, I take it that the Government were exercising a wise discretion when they determined for themselves, and stated to the House that before they sent any troops they should have some official and authentic notification of the necessity for them, and of the probable number required. In what they had done before the Imperial Government had established a precedent in their dealings with the colonies, and upon a reapplication of what they had laid down as the right eourse, this Federal Government were perfectly ready to do their duty to the Empire. As to our having waited for this official request, may I correct a statement which recently appeared in the press : It was reported in the Argus that I had stated at Maitland that it was a humiliation for the British Government to ask for troops. My statement was exactly the opposite, and",17,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
45,Mr Higgins,An offer of troops was,18,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
46,Mr Barton,,18,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
47,Mr Mcdonald,,18,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
48,Mr Barton.,"A t any rate there wasJ. explained why-namely , that the Imperial Government had asked before, and had given us the benefit of knowing what tlieir requirements were.' Therefore we have taken in this instance the course which was sanctioned by these precedents. The newspaper in question has very properly corrected tihe misreport, as can be seen on reference to the Argus of Saturday last; and I mention the matter now iu order that it may be known from end to end of Australia that I did not make use of an expression so utterly unworthy of me as that it was a humiliation on the part of the British Government to ask for assistance from parts of the Einpire whose duty it is to furnish that assistance. In order to give an opportunity of discussing the question, it is my intention, as I said before, to move the suspension of the standing orders. motion ; I withdraw my objection. say, first, that there have been some imputations made against the Government of a breach of faith in accepting this invitation to send troops, and in going on with the preparations for sending them. I want to make it clear to honourable members that all that was present to my mind, and all that was present probably to the mind of the honourable member for ""Kennedy was that there was tlie question seething in the public mind as to whether we should offer troops or not ; and as we had not made up our minds to offer, as distinct from accepting an invitation to supply troops, I said we would not do anything without consulting Parliament. But the situation altered, because eight days after Parliament arose, and ten or eleven days after tlie honourable member for Kennedy had asked his question-whic h to my mind pointed only to au offer we got a further telegram specifically asking us to furnish troops. I put it to honourable members : how was ib possible for any one to suppose that, on receipt of that telegram, any part of tlie Empire which knew its duty could refuse to accede to the request 1 Whatever a man's sympathies are, unless he is of opinion tliat we sliould break the bond of union between ns and the mother' country, he must see that, if she shows evidence of any extraordinary requirement of assistance, u denial of such assistance would appear to be almost a denial of our responsibilities to bhe Empire, aud that it would be righb us for troops for us to at once accede to the request. I ueed not, in referring to this portion of the subject, point out to honourable members that fche bond of Empire is not one only of mere patriotism-o n which terms I think the bond of itself ought to be maintained if there were no ulterior considerations-bu t also one of self-interest. One thing is quite clear, and that is what I spoke of when referring to the first troops from New South Wales-namely , that in the event of Britain at any time losing the control of the passage of the Suez Canal, the route by South Africa would become most important as the trade route from Great Britain to India ancl Australia. I will not, at the present stage, go into what I have to say on the resolutions. I am now only showing reasons why the standing orders should be suspended in order to enable me to submit those resolutions. draw my proposal. should be kept separate. the' honourable member why I think the two matters ought not to be confused. Honourable members may desire to criticise the actions of the Government in connection with the sending of the contingent, and I am perfectly willing that that criticism should be expressed. But, at the same time, I think that when we come to the resolutions I shall have to move, they should be as little as possible leavened or defaced by any quarrel amongst ourselves. We ought to do our very utmost to sec that they are carried free from any such considerations. I was going on bo say that honourable members will see plainly, from the statement. I have made, that my answer was confined to what .' was then in 103mind, and what I thought -was in the mind of bhe honourable member. Two positions occurred-first , I was not dealing with anything but the subject of an offer which we did not intend to make, and, next, I was under the impression that as Canada and New Zealand had offered troopswhich we did not intend to do-if there was any requirement for troops, we should probably hear of it before Parliament rose, an event which I thought would happen on the 18th, but which as a matter of fact",18,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable

53,Mr Mcdonald,All right.,19,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable
54,Mr Barton,"AndI will tellhappened on the 14th. It may be unfortunate-thoug h I do not think I can blame myself-that I was careless in not guarding myself by confining the statement to the sitting of the House-by not saying that if any such thing arose in the recess I would deal with it and meet the House afterwards. But I want to say that to any such request we were bound to say "" Yes "" or "" No . "" If we had been asked to say "" No,"" we should rather have resigned-that is quite clear. But if we were to say ""Yes"" on the 21st, were we to wait 24 days without making any provision for uniforms, without buying saddle ? How would it have been possible to go on in that way 1 This is a matter which must be dealt with on broad grounds, 'fhe question of an oiler was the question in party differences to a level at which I hope the minds of honourable members, and was certainly the question in my mind. But the situation changed when we were asked to send troops. The request came during the recess, and there was only one answer possible. It would have been absurd to leave the public mind of Australia simmering in exasperation and excitement, simpty because the Government were afraid to buy a horse or contract for the supply of a saddle. It was not the duty of the Government to take that view. It was the duty of the Government to recognise their responsibilities to the Empire, and with the f u l l clearly. So strongly did I feel the prosense of their responsibilities to tell the House what they had done, and how far they had gone, staking their fate upon the opinion of the House. Heaton's statement ? words about Mr Henniker Heaton. I only want to say, as an illustration of the various show that whilst I do not surrender my ways in which Australian affairs are understood in England, that I recently received a letter from an educated person there, who ought to have known better, addressed"" Premier of South Australia, Sydney, New South Wales."" Such ignorance is being constantly illustrated. I was spoken of in England last year as a delegate from Tasmania. It is very difficult to get people in England to recognise the difference between the various States of Australia, and they are very apt to take the mendistributed amongst honourable members at tion of one State as the mention of the whole of the Commonwealth. fcJo'ne comment has been made on the fact that the number of troops we are asked to furnish is only 1,000; but I will go so far as to say that had we been asked for 2,000 or 3,000 troops we should have sent them. I move That the standing orders be suspended to enable a motion to be made, without notice, in reference to the South African War, and Australian aid to the Einpire. echo the desire expressed by the Prime Minister that we should draw a distinct line between any criticism we may have to offer as to the conduct of the Government with reference to matters which the Prime a horse, or contracting for a Minister has gone into at considerable length, and the subject of the resolutions which the right honourable gentleman proposes to submit. Those resolutions rise above our local the debate will be kepta level entirely free from narrow distinctions, and embodying, as I believe, the national feeling of Australia. I shall at the proper time have perhaps strong criticisms to offer on the action of the Government in the matters referred to, but I felt so strongly on the more important question that I took the liberty of addressing the letter to the Prime Minister yesteiday. presently. priety of the course which the Government are taking, that I yesterday took the liberty of addressing a letter to the Prime Minister, suggesting, so far as I was concerned, the wisdom of the step, and assuring the Government of my hearty support if I do not want to bandy they decided to submit a resolution of the kind. I merely make this explanation to right of criticising any action of the Government at any time, I consider that the proposal which the Prime Minister is about to make is one which should unite us all in a unanimous expression of opinion. Upon this motion may I say that, whilst I shall not interfere with the Prime Minister's proposal, I should like to ask, seeing that we have not had a chance of ascertaining their terms, that copies of them should be once.

I replied to my right honourable friend, telling him that we very gladly accepted his offer, and subsequently I sent him the draft of a motion which, although not couched in the exact words of these resolutions, represented very fully what I am now moving. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has requested that these resolutions should be put separately, and to that course I take no exception. That, however, is a matter for the House to settle for itself, and will, if neeessaiy, be made the subject of a motion to the House. The first part of these resolutions deals with the baseless charges made abroad against the honour of the people and the humanity and the valour of the soldiers of the Empire. In this connection I have already read not only what has been partly quoted in cables received here on the 9th December last, but what appeared from a verified extract from the Times which I secured by cable-to be the words of a leading German organ, and I am sure that honourable members will recognise that what I received on the 17th December very much aggravated the enormity of the taunts upon the honour, the capacity, the bravery, and the humanity of our people. Since that time other things have occurred. On the 6th of January, if I may quote from the Argus, I find that the British soldiers and officers were charged with having ravished a third of the Boer women and children, and with having then handed them over to the Kaffirs. These statements were made by persons who were alleged to be eye-witnesses of the occurrences, and, of course, their falsity was enormously aggravated by the fact of men putting their names to them as eye-witnesses. On the 10th of January, a-speech was made by Count von Bulow, to whom I wish to refer in a tone of respectf u l moderation. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, exercising his undoubted right of addressing' an audience of his fellow citizens in England, had previously said that if the British army needed precedents for pursuing a certain line of conduct they could find them in the history of the conduct of the armies of other powers. He did not accuse those powers of doing anything beyond what was sanctioned by the rights and the laws of war, but merely pointed out that precedent would afford the British army justification for taking a much stronger course than has been taken. Count von Bulow, in commenting upon that speech in the Reichstag, saidIf Mr Chamberlain desired to justify his policy in Soubh Africa he had better not refer to foreign countries, unless he exercised the greatest prudence, lest he should offend their susceptibilities. Surely this comes well after what has been said against us as a nation. Count von Bulow continuedThe German army stood far too highfcosuffer from perverted or unjust judgments.. ThereI quite agree with him. Notwithstanding all that has been said, acts mav have been committed in the terrible excitement of war which, in individual cases, 'soldiers have to regret. That may have been the case with the German and other arnvies, but neither Mr Chamberlain nor anybody else has accused the German army",20,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable

62,Mr Bart On (Hunter,"Minister forof exceeding or violating the lights of war -of the German Empire, and for that withI t has merely been pointed out that if precedent were needed for the adoption of more drastic measures, it could be found in the action taken by other countries. On the 11th January, the following cable appeared in the ArgusThe Krtuz Zeituwj states that Lord Kitchener's so-called prisoners include aged persous, women, and Kaffir servants. It also asserts thab Lord Kitchener bas organized commandos of Kaffirs. Now, we all know that throughout this war the Empire has religiously abstained from 'calling to its aid the assistance of the armed native inhabitants of South Africa, which was quite within its reach, and might have terminated the campaign much more speedily. Buti t has had so much regard for the amenities of warfare between white peoples that it has chivalrously refrained from exercising this power. Yet, in repayment for this noble abstention on the part of the Empire, we find an accusation that our prisoners include old persons, women, and Kaffir servants, and that we had organized commandos of Kaffirs. This is a charge against us as well as against England. Our troops are serving in this war under British generals* and are bound to subscribe to the articles of war. All these acts which are laid to the charge of British soldiers are, when Australian troops are often indiscriminately drafted with them-charge s against our troops as well as against those of the United Kingdom. January, quoting from the same paper, I find that Mr Chamberlain was called by a member of the Reichstag "" the most accursed scoundrel on God's earth,"" whilst the British army was described as "" a pack of thieves."" same of the late Mr W. E. Gladstone. say it . ber like it ? Now, on top of all that, and after all we have heard, the Chancellor of the German Empire, Count von Bulow, expressed deep regret at this attack upon the army, and' deprecated the tendency to vilify foreign Ministers. There was a sort of withdrawal on the part of that distinguished Minister drawal I think we can thank him. I , at any rate, believe that although there was an utterance of Count von Bulow's that may seem very irritating and annoying to us, on the whole the attitude of the German Empire, as a power, has been correct on the principles of neutrality, and that it has not been in its Government an unfriendly power to us and when I say us, I mean the Einpire. I am not about to make any complaint against the Chancellor of the German Empire, or the German Empire in its government as a power, but I do feel that in continental countries, and especially in that country, there has been, for weeks, a campaign of vilification. We had yesterday or to-day a confession of a Dutch paper, for instance, that it has been absolutely bribed to publish such statements. Express says. What did it say about the massacres in China? says about China. Perhaps the honourable and learned member will take fche course I took and try and verify such statements. . gentleman spoke of the Dutch press. which I think a public man should take in such matters and got these statements, verified, and I found the reality even worse On the 13th than tlie reports. That affords no reason to my honourable and learned friend to surmise that because my last reference. was to a Dutch paper the reality will be better than the report in that case. gentleman believe all that the DaUy Telegraph says about him ? member believe it 1 warrant for not believing it. But supposing I do not believe what a certain newspaper says about me, does that give the newspaper any licence to pursue a course of Was ifc not wrong? unwarrantable vilification and insult? If newspapers publish fiendish and malevolent statements about a foreign power, do honourable members think that it will not be apt to disturb international relations, or that it is not cruel to the soldiers of another power if they use like terms with regard to them ¥ That is an answer to my honourable friend",21,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable

76,Mr Barton,"I have very goodopposite. We do not need these quotations from papers published in Australia to assure us that there has been a perfect riot of slander on the continent against the Empire to which we are proud to belong. The situation that exists now is in a degree infinitely worse than the situation on the 11th December, when I was asked a question on the subject. Nowi t becomes abundantly plain that it is the right thing for us to repel theseaccusations, and to assure the land from which we spring that the jeers and taunts, and statements absolutely unmeasured and wicked, with regard to that country to. which I hope we shall be proud to be always attached, are not believed in Australia. I shall say more than that. I say that as, of necessity, we are implicated in these statements, it is necessary for us to repel them. That leads me to this declaration. Andi f we are right in repelling the statements by the' declaration in the first portion of these resolutions, should we not do right to repel them by the action suggested in the second portion in which we affirm the readiness of Australia to give all that may be required by the mother country, in order to bring the present war to an end ? I Say that I shall always be prepared to do whatever we may leam to be necessary as to the requirements of the mother country for the purpose of bringing this war to an end. I wish to be judged upon these resolutions in this way. I have described the situation whichexisted when I assented to the request to send 1,000 troops. If a position arose in which we thought a spontaneous offer would be an absolute necessity, we might take that course, but the course we have taken we deemed to be a sufficient one, because we are dealing with our own kith and kin and our own flesh and blood, and with a power, therefore, which sustains no humiliation in telling us what it requires. And to the very extent of its requirements, I beg to inform this. House that the intention of the Government is to accede to any request for troops that may be made to us within our capacity. ment of the troops as well ? decidedly. If it seems necessary and if we are asked, yes. I take that responsibility, and I am sure the House will be with me. day is tlie evil thereof. War is not a benefit, a privilege, or a delight. Wheni n the endeavour to enrol troops under a medical examination, we read that in one State in one day, out of 50 who presented themselveSj and who had previously served in South Africa, 25 were declared to be medically unfit, mainly through heart disease, though they had been fit when enrolled for tlie former campaign, it will be seen that there should be no harum-scarum action taken in such a matter. There is a distinction between hysterica] action in matter's of this sort and a recognition of our responsibilities to the Empire so long as we remain a part of it, and I hope tliat will be through all the days of my sons and my sons' sons, and through all our time on this earth. But there is that distinction to be drawn, and we do not believe and do not desire to pretend that war is such a boon and benefit to us in Australia that we should run off at a tangent and make offers which our capacity will not enable us to execute, and which a right care of our people ought to lead us not to take. But we ought to be ready within our capacity to supply anything that may be requisite for the purpose of bringing to an end a war which, I say, is shown by mountains of proof to have been conceived in treachery and conspiracy, which has been carried on in many instances by equal acts of treachery and cruelty, and which is supported on the Continent of Europe against us, and against the Empire and the land from which we are sprung by those who wish tlie injui y and downfall of our Empire, which injury and downfall we are by every sacred tie bound to help her to avert. cannot consider the step taken by the Government to be open to any unfriendly criticism. I think the Prime Minister has performed a great public duty in moving the resolutions which I now have the honour to second. I was in a position of some official responsibility before this unhappy war broke out, and in that position I absolutely refused to be a party to any step which might tend to irritate the people in the Boer territories. I had no sort of If we are asked, sympathy with any kind of interference afc that time. But since then events have marched very rapidly, and it seems to me that the act of the President of the Transvaal Republic in declaring war against",22,African War Standing Orders Before The Right Honourable

Let us suppose that that declaration of war had been a declaration of war against a suzerain power such as Germany, France or Russia, or any other nation. been open to any country but that of taking up this war challenge? challenge was token up, there were only two courses declaration of war, there were only two things which a merciful and humane British Government could do. One was to put an end to the war; the other was to take such steps that no such war could ever possibly occur again. I take those to be the broad lines of Imperial policy in dealing with this unhappy matter, and they have my absolute approval. policy other than that which could be adopted in dealing with a difficulty of the kind. the Prime Minister has alluded were mere chance remarks in an isolated organ of public opinion, however high its influence, or wide its circulation, I should agree with the spirit of one or two of the interjections which I have heard during this debate; motion upon a much broader ground. fact is, that Great Britain has been fighting at the same time not one war, but two great wars-a war against the Boers, and a war against an organized false and hypocritical campaign of lies, upon the European continent, partly the result of a wholesale and unscrupulous system of bribery. heart becomes full of sympathy for those gallant men who are out on the veldt to-day fighting, believe, for the cause of their country and the rights 'of human liberty, and it is sympathy false and lying statements into this bloody and hopeless struggle, that animates my mind on this occasion. men, with their money and their bribes in Europe, can carry on their villainous proceedings in comfort; but my mind turns to those heroic scattered remnants in Africa who are enduring maintaining their flag aloft on the faith of the systematic lie that help is coming-that an European intervention is about to take place. This is but part of a campaign of malevolence against the mother I think it is high time that we showed the Mr Reid. people who are trying to persuade the Boer soldiers in South Africa that Australia has changed its mind-that Australia is sick of the war ; that Australia its prepared by its changed attitude independent to encourage them to fight, ancl keep on What possible course would have fighting-what we feel; it is time we made our position and attitude absolutely clear And once the before the whole world, as a matter of mercy to these men as much as of mercy open.

That is the high character which has come down to our soldiers and our sailors, and makes our flag one of which we are-all proud. That character is worth untold hardships in preserving. It is a reputation which we ought to strive to value and maintain.

I believe this is one of those occasions when our mother country and our soldiers should be again assured of the continuance of those sentiments. I feel that in taking a stand of this sort we in no sense forfeit our desire to maintain the freest and fullest principles of political liberty. so heartily and so thoroughly to stand by the old flag 1 conspicuous amongst those of the older nations of the earth that flag is more often found shielding freedom and justice, and protecting the oppressed, than any other that has ever waved in the breeze of heaven. And thus it is that I never feel prouder or stronger in my aspirations after liberty and freedom than when I help, as we all ought to help, in maintaining tlie Empire which means so much for the benefit of all mankind. the Government have deemed it necessary to bring forward a motion of this kind, because it seems to me that, from whatever stand-point it is viewed, there is no need to pass a motion such as this. As one who has attempted to follow as closely as possible the record of what has been done in South Africa, I believe that never in the history of nations has a war been conducted with a greater regard for humanity than the Boer war, and I am glad to say that authentic reports make it appear* that that remark applies to the conduct of both parties. I have had the pleasure of talking to a considerable number of the men who have returned from South Africa, and, with very few exceptions, they have given every credit to their opponents, the Boers, for the manner in which the wounded have been treated aud the prisoners cared for. But while I believe that the war has been conducted with humanity, and that there is practically no basis in fact for the slanders which have been published in the German press and in the newspapers of other civilized countries, I do not think that we should make this an occasion to gratify the vanity of a few people in Germany who think that they can pull the strings to advantage, or allow them to run away with the idea that whenever they twist the lion's tail he will jump in the direction they want him. It 25 G seems to me that in taking notice of the pinpricks of critics whose information entitles them to no consideration, and who have no great influence upon the welfare of the British nation, we are abandoning the traditional attitude of British people from time immemorial, and that it is a sign of deterioration when charges are hurled against us by the press of foreign countries, or when enthusiastic, though misled, persons What is it that enables us in our midst raise stories which will not bear investigation, to fall into an hysterical It is because condition in repudiating them. I am. sorry to say, however, that that has been the condition of the English press, and also of our own press. The Times, according to the cabled reports, worked itself up into a terrible ferment over the attacks of the German newspapers, and certain Australian newspapers have out-Heroded Herod in their demands for vengeance upon all and sundry who have dared to whisper a word against the integrity and honour of the Empire. It is only natural that we should feel a certain amount of indignation at what we believe to be absolutely unfounded charges in regard to the conduct of the war, but to carry a series of resolutions in the Commonwealth Parliament specifically denying our belief in them is, I think, like using the proverbial steamhammer to crack a nut. think that more troops should be s.ent ? another matter altogether, but, in reply to the honourable member's question, I say that, if the Empire asks for troops, I am prepared to assist her. I shall probably have a word or two to say with regard to the war itself when we come to the discussion of another motion; at the present time we are discussing whether it is wise to pass the motion moved by the Government. I protest against any such motion being passed, because I think the occasion does not warrant it, and that Parliament in passing such a motion will give undue importance and weight to charges which, after all, have been made by persons who, from a national point of view, are irresponsible. The statement of the German Chancellor, as I read it in the cabled reports, does not seem to me to warrant any indignation so far as the people of Australia or even so far as the people of England are concerned. minds of his own people off their own internal troubles.",24,Honourable Members Hear Hear

In the same way we often find men in our own community who are willing to turn manifestations of public feeling into account in their own interests. I certainly take exception to the charges which have been published in the German press, but, «in my opinion, this Parliament will only magnify their importance if it passes the motion submitted by the Government. W it h regard to the second part of the motion, I am glad that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has indicated his desire to have it put separately. I , for one, wish to know, to what it commits us. If it is to commit us to any large demands either for troops or for money, we should have an understanding as to what position is to be taken in regard to the final settlement. It is noticeable that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has persistently stated that Australia will be satisfied with nothing less in the way of a settlement than the complete subjugation of the Boer States. Australia has given no indications of such an intention or desire. We certainly responded to the call of the Empire for assistance when-it was thought that our men would be of service. In loyalty to the Empire we could do no less, so long as there was need for men. But I do not believe, and I should be sorry to think, that our people desire that the war should be carried to the bitterest conclusion, and that the terms made by the British Government with the Boers should be pushed to the last extremity, I will not say of justice, but of possibility. wise, can we terminate the war 1 concerns Imperial statesmen.

British Government can be learned only from the expressions of Mr Chamberlain. He saysGreat Britain is not entitled to make peace unless on terms satisfactory to the colonies. Andi n his recent speeches he has persistently led the public to believe that Australia and the other colonies are insisting, through their representatives, upon extreme conditions being forced upon the Boers. able member know that is not true ? that no set of Ministers would put forward recommendations of that sort without giving some indication of tlie steps they had taken to their respective Houses. of government there resembling our colonial form of government, and that is free enough. that meets the case fairly well. WhatI am objecting to is the statement that there exists in these States a desire to have the fullest extremity of satisfaction from the Boersi n any settlement of the war. I believe that the position occupied by the majority of Australian people is rather that, while they are willing to make all reasonable sacrifices in order that the Empire may be triumphant, at the same time they are ready to consent to any terms which the British Government offer to the Boers. I do not think that there otherwould be any objection if the British Government were to make the most lenient, terms to-morrow; but the assumption tliat 'has been studiously put forward by some of the British press, and by one or two of the British Ministers, has been that Australia and the other colonies would not acquiesce in any such lenient treatment.

I object most strenuously to the idea being put abroad sedulously that we are asking for more than even the British Government ask for-a n impossible settlement. The only possible inference to be drawn from the statement which Mr portion even more heartily if bhe offer had Chamberlain put forward recently, was that he was prepared to make reasonable concessions, but that he was restrained because of his regard for the feeling of the colonists. the South African colonists ? Mr ""WATSON I took it to refer to the dependencies of the Empire as a whole. I should be quite prepared to support the second part of the motion.if it indicated the extent to which it commits us in regard to furnishing men and money; and in order to counteract any misapprehension which may have got abroad in that regard I should prefer to see added to it a statement tliat we are quite prepared to accept any terms of settlement which would be agreeable to bhe British Government. Of course, it may be held to be presumptuous on our part to interfere at all, but at the same time we have a degree of responsibility which comes from our participation in the war, and, so far as our power allows of our doing it , we should always have in mind, as bhe Prime Minisber indicated, that war is not a thing to be encouraged or a thing to be long drawn out if it is possible to be avoided. I have noted with more than regret the large proportion of our returned soldiers who, when presenting themselves for enrolment in the new contingent, are found to be ineligible for medical reasons. Of those who, in New South Wales, not more than a couple of years ago, were sufficiently well physically to pass the medical inspection-of bhose who now consider bhemselves well enough bo be enrolled, aboub one-third have been rejected, and that in a young country where we require every man in order that the interior may become reasonably populated ancl broughb into a sbate of prosperity. That is indeed a serious condition for us, so I think we have a distinct interest in having this war brought to a conclusion at as early a date as possible, consistent always with the safeguarding of tlie interests of the Empire. I should prefer to see in this series of resolutions some indication that we are prepared to accept any settlement of 25 a 2 the trouble which is satisfactory to the British Government. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I had no idea that this quesbion would come on for discussion bo-day.

There is no part of my public career to which I look back with so much pleasure as the time when my Government were enabled to render assistance to bheBritish Government. During the time we held office-barel y one year-w e equipped, trained, and despatched four separate contingents, three bo Soubh Africa and one bo China, and we did nob waib bo be asked to do so by the Imperial Government-excep t in one case, I think, speaking from memory. Every country before going to war should exercise the greatest possible care and discrimination to ascertain thab ibs cause is righb and jusb. And having satisfied ibself on bhat point, then the more vigorously the war is pushed forward tlie more effective, economical, and humane ib will be. If the same vigorous policy which was pursued by the whole of the Stabes during bhe firsb year of the struggle had been continued, I believe it would have been over before now, because bhe Boers would bhen have been convinced of bhe hopeless nabure of the struggle they were trying to prolong. We know that in prolonging it bhey are only inflicting greaber in juries on bheir own ill-fated country. They are only adding to the bloodshed' which has been going on there. The more vigorously the war is prosecuted the sooner it will be ended, and bhe less bloodshed will be involved. Therefore, I sincerely trust that every member of bhis House will support bhe motion, as far as it goes. I should certainly have liked the motion to go a little further. It is not only our patriobisrn and our feeling for our kinsmen ab home bhat should impel us to take this course.

She has given us all that we have ever asked for in the way of self-government, trade relations, and, indeed, all our relations with the mother country, are eminently to our advantage. forget that our safety depends on the prestige of the British flag. We know that during the first' century of our existence we should have fallen a veiy easy prey to any foreign military power that might have cared to undertake our invasion, if we had not been protected by the mother country, and surely the least tliat we can do, when we remember that we have enjoyed absolute gression history, to ourselves, is to give our support, in the most ungrudging spirit, to the mother country in her hour of trouble. I do not care how far this motion commits us. I am prepared to go quite as far as its language can carry us, and I am prepared to affirm the principle that we should aid the mother country as far as we can until the war is brought to a conclusion. It will be time enough to speak about terms when the Boer flag is hauled down. When that time comes, I believe that the mother country will not be unduly hard or harsh, and I am perfectly Australia will show a humane spirit. However, the duty that lies before the Einpire now is to bring the war to a termination as speedily as possible, and I believe that Empire, but every other portion, will cooperate in bringing about that desirable result. was the policy of the man whom I esteemed and respected perhaps as much as any man whose name appears in English William Ewart Gladstone-which about this war. It was his weak and vacillating policy, dictated by probably the hisrhest and most humane motives that could have inspired any man-it mistaken policy that brought about this cruel war. It was his policy, after the slaughter of Gordon at Khartoum' that brought about the war in the culminating battle of which, at Omdurraan, 14,000 or 15,000 bloodshed would have been averted if a firmer mother country has given us the beginning, and it was the same want of firmness after MajubaH ill which resulted in the conclusion of peace, immediately following the signal defeat of a and our portion of the British army, that encouraged the Boers to take a course that has proved their own destruction. It is that policy Above all, we should not that has caused rivers of blood to be shed during the recent war, and which has lost the Boers their liberty.

We must remember that the seat of war is within three weeks' sail of our own shores, and that the nature of the conflict is such as to render Australian bushmen especially suitable to take part in it . The Australian bush man is the equal of the Boeri n horsemanship, in marksmanship, and in bush craft, and therefore his aid is invaluable to the mother country; and I am perfectly sure that no considerable section of the people of sure that the people of Australia would tolerate anything in the way of refusing the aid that the mother country is now asking for. My only regret is that she has had to ask for it . I should have been better pleased if the not only this portion of the Government had seen their way to make a spontaneous offer of a much larger contingent than that for which the mother We know perfectly well that it country has asked. In asking for this contingent, the British Government may have been actuated by a desire to save the repuhistorytation of Australia itself in the eyes of the brought civilized world, because it would have been a reflection on Australia if we were to have held back when Great Britain was engaged, so near our own shores, in a war in which was his we could render such material aid. I heartily support the motion. When I was before the electors of Northern Melbourne during last February and March, Dervishes were slain.

I feel that it would be utterly impossible and absurd for a man to try to convert another on this question one way or the other. The position was the same in regard to the war against the colonies which afterwards became the United States of America. It was the same way with the opium war against China, and with the Crimean war. I may refer to the History of Our Oimi Times, by Justin McCarthy, in regard to the opium traffic. MrA . McLEAN -On e factor is that the British were not prepared for war, and the Boers were. for Gippsland has already sufficiently advertised his views to his constituents and the outside world. W it h regard to the opium war, we read in the History'of Our Otvn TimesI t may he safely asserted that if the same events were to occur in our day, it would be hardly possible to find a Ministry to originate a war, for which at the same time it must be owned that the vast majority of the people of all politics government it is customary for the Ministry and classes were only too ready then to find excuse and even justification. I may say that I am anxious at the earliest possible stage, for my own self respect, to disclaim any responsibility in regard to this motion, and in regard to this war. What has been done 1 The Prime Minister has submitted a certain motion. Buti t is not enough to make a rhetorical address about our attachment to the old countiy ; because, I take it , we are all attached to the old country. It is not enough to show what has been done at other people's expense, out of the taxpayers' money, for the pui-pose of demonstrating how loyal the Ministry is. What we have to deal with is the specific motion before us. The Prime Minister has not disclosed to the House any grounds upon which the soldiers of Australia ought to be sent to kill the Boer farmers; and it must be admitted that the proposal is a very extreme step when one comes to think of it. making a very extreme statement. .step, when one thinks of it, that the Prime Minister should . invite men, who are Australians, to try to kill men with whom they have no personal quarrel, with whom they have had no relations, direct or indirect. The only ground on which the Prime Minister has urged the sending of a contingent is that Great Britain is at war, and that, therefore, we should help her. If that is to be sufficient ground, we should like to know it ; but let us see how far it will lead us. I apprehend that the Prime Minister is making a very difficult position for himself and his successors in connection with future warsthat he is making a very difficult position for Australia. Are we, without going into tlie causes of the wars of Great Britain, to adopt the principle that we should actively side with Great Britain, no matter what is done 1 The adoption of such a course will commit Australia to the principle that she must aid the Imperial Government in all wars with her young lives-and there are few young lives to spare in Australia-althoug h she has no voice in the negotiations which precede war, and is not to be consulted in regard to its expediency or necessity. I repeat that the Prime Minister has put himself and others in a most difficult position. In other countries enjoying constitutional to ask Parliament for a war vote, and to explain, in supporting that vote, how it is that the country has been drawn into war. That course, however, has not been followed here. directing a permanent force, but here the men are volunteers. they are volunteers, at os. per day, and the position is that they are going to fight a number of men who get nothing, who have no distinctions to which to look forward, no prospect of notices in despatches or even of notices in newspapers, no Victoria Crosses, no Distinguished Service Orders, no epaulettes, and no promotions-in short, who have nothing to hope for save the approval of their own consciences. May I also sayand I hopel shallbe clearly understood-that I take up the position that the Empire is in no clanger, and has been in no clanger. If the Einpire had been in danger the position would have been a very different one from It is a very extreme what it is to-day. It is absolutely absurd to suppose that an Empire numbering 250,000,000 or 300,000,000 people is i i i clanger when it is engaged in a war against only 250,000 or 300,000 Boers, and when the wealthiest country in the world is fighting",29,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I am one who regard it as clear that no empire in the histoiy of the world has done so much for civilization and for liberty as has the British Empire. I may also add, if honourable members will allow me to do so, that personally I belong to a stock which is the most loyal and the most attached to England of all stocks within the wide ring ""of the world. will understand my meaning when I say that no one who has not been in Ireland can realize the peculiar attachment which Protestant Irishmen have for England. They are more English than are the English themselves. They look to England for their principles, for their ideals, and for their religion; they lean upon England, and England leans upon them. There is no doubt that they"" are a minority planted amongst a population which is supposed to be disaffected. They regard themselves as having in their trust the maintenance of the British flag. Under these circumstances, when I was a boy I regarded with great delight the accounts which I read of the meetings which were held in England when Kossuth went through that country with triumphant demonstrations, and when the English audiences so heartily applauded him. I was delighted to find how English newspapers encouraged Garibaldi, how English statesmen upheld the independence of little Belgium, how England favoured Poland against the autocratic and imperious power of Russia. I was proud to know that, England was the friend of the oppressed, and the foe of the oppressor. To me, therefore, it is a matter of the deepest pain to find that the country to which my father and forefathers were always attached has entered into a war with a nation far beneath its size, and without any sufficient justification. Mr Gladstone, I think, died at the end of 1898, and ere another year had passed Lord Salisbury and his Ministry were at war with the Boers in South Africa. I do regret that at the present time there is not one person in England who can touch the conscience of the English people as the late Mr Gladstone could touch it. Crimean war, has passed away; and he was right ; Sir James Graham, who opposed the opium war, has passed away; and he was right ; Fox and Burke have passed away ; the great Earl of Chatham, who opposed the war against the colonies of America, has passed away; and all of these were right. We have not now in England a Gladstone, who opposed the war with Russia, and who was successful in the elections of 1SS0; and who was right. We have not to-day anything like the condition of affairs which existed even in 1SS0. What happened in 1880? A t that time Honourable members the hysterical shrieks of the London press and the ribald yells of the music halls were all in favour of the 'war with Russia. The gabble of the clubs was in the same direction. But all these noises were silenced by the great voice of England speaking through all its provinces. Unfortunately we have not in England to-day men like those who opposed such iniquities-me n of light and learning-thoug h I amglad to know that some of tlie veiy best minds there have declared themselves unmistakably against this war. In this respect I am proud to be a follower of such men as John Morley, Herbert Spencer, Frederick Harrison, Sir Edward Clarke, Leonard Courtney, and John Burns; of men in the ecclesiastical world like Dr. Clifford, the Bishop of Hereford, the Bishop of Stepney, and the Bishop of Durham. Where the}'' lead, surely it is not disloyal of meto follow. The announcement which has been made by the Prime Minister is that the Government has acceded to tlie request of Mr Chamberlain to send 1,000 men upon such terms that Australia will not be called upon to bear the expenditure of one penny, but that even the equipment of the troops is to be paid for by the English taxpayers. I feel that there are really very few who are strongly in favour of the course which has been proposed. The position is a very curious one. I have been the recipient of confidences such as probably have been reposed in few other honourable members, because, as I was known to be an opponent of the war, a large number of people have privately confessed to me that they did not believe in it at all. But the truth is that it is a very unpleasant thing to oppose it . A number of men think it ungracious to appear to oppose any movement to help the John Bright, who opposed the mother country. There is a very laudable anxiety to find justice on the British side, and to show Great Britain that we are still her sons, and are still willing to help her. A t all events, it is true that there is no active opposition here to the war which is now in progress. understood as condemning the conduct of A t the same time, what is proposed 1 the Prime Ministeri n withholding a comAVe are not to risk our own lives, or to munication which is confidential.

The result King of England, we must forswear our is that we find that where men feel very strongly privately with regard to a particular proposal, as politicians they feel that it anything of the sort ? is better to follow the newspapers, and to appear to influence public opinion, rather than as statesmen to influence public opinion and appear to follow it . The Prime Minister referred to a statement that in a Dutch paper there was an admission that it had received money; but if the right honourable gentleman had looked into the matter more closely, he would have found that it was the Daily Express of London that said it had been admitted by somebody. What is the Daily Express? The Daily Express was, a year and a half ago, the author of bhat vile lie with regard to the massacre in China. I happened to have staying with me at the time the mother of a man who was supposed to have been massacred; and I know the agony which tliat lie of the Daily Express produced in her mind with regard to her son. I say that the whole of the origin of this statement upon which the Prime Minister relies for his motion for my motion ; that is an entire misstatement. There ought to be some such thing as fairness in a debate of this kind. been at all unfair. I am saying that the Prime Minister referred to a statement that some Dutch editor admitted that he had received money from Dr. Leyds.for the purpose of making certain statements. It all conies back to the same thing; there is no chain stronger than its weakest link, and I take it that the Daily Express is one of the weakest links one could get hold of amongst the journals of the world. If there is anything which would impel me to express my sentiments upon this occasion, it is the attempt made within the last few days, by certain journals, to terrorise members from expressing their opinions. It is one of the most valuable inheritances we have from Great Britain. We intend to I keep it and preserve it for our children ; and when they challenge us to come out and exI know 'that I press our real sentiments, I say, we will.

Australia, for some reason, is not having its normal increase of population within its own bounds ; and there is no doubt whatever that these fine young fellows who go out, as they think, to serve the Empire-and , as I think, to injure the Empire-ar e wanted in Australia. We want men to develop Australia ; we do not want men to desolate South Africa. We want men who will build homes in Australia, not men who will burn homes in South Africa.

Injustice has even been done to the tactics of British soldiers in this war; but I am not dealing with tliat matter now. I am simply considering the question whether the war was justified or not. Honourable members will bear me out that in addition to the havoc which has been played with our Australian young men by death upon the battle field, and still more by disease in the camp, there has been a general unsettling of some fine healthy young men who have tasted the adventures of South Africa, and who have since forsworn all interest in peaceful civil pursuits. those who have had, some experience to bear mc out that there are many promising men who owe their ruin to-and brought most extreme grief to their parentsby the unsettlement of mind which this war has produced in them. The interference in this war which has already taken place on the part of Australia has distinctly tended to prolong it. Britain had veiy clearly the upper hand in the war-moments, minds of honourable members when Pretoria was taken, when Cronje was taken, when Ladysmith was relieved, ancl other critical moments when England could have made peace with honour and dignity. these opportunities were lost. And why 1 Simply because they raised the cry in England-""What unless we press to the extreme end of our rights?"" the part of the colonies will be an excuse to any great power, if at war with England, to strike England through Australia. to this time we were a peaceful people minding our own affairs, and there would have been a howl throughout the civilized world if a great power, fighting England, had hit her through her colonies. Now we have given them an excuse to some extent to attack us. The new departure is spoken of as having for its motive the cementing of the Empire. I wish it had. I fear the re-action, as soon as the men of Australia find that they have been grossly deceived in the cablegrams about the war. I do not think that this Empire -the seen in certain respects-can cemented by injustice. in the war with Denmark?

There is nothing in it . between the mother country and the Commonwealth than there was between Austria and Prussia? great many Germans, and they felt more attached to Germans than to the Hungarians and Slavs on the other side. The mere joint spilling of blood in a cause which is not just has not, and can never be I ask the means of cementing an Empire like this. So far as I am concerned, I think that a flagrant error has been committed by the who have different States, and is now being committed by the Commonwealth. I had hoped better things of Australia as a whole. It would have been very hard for any particular State to hold out when all the other States were sending troops. There was a kind There were moments when of rivalry between the States as to which should be first to despatch troops to which will recur to the South Africa, but I should have thought that an Australian .Parliament, speaking for Australia as a whole, would have acted upon broader grounds and in a better spirit.

I do not say it has reduced the military prestige of the Up Empire. I think that has been overstated ; but it has reduced the moral prestige of the Empire which has always been supposed to be the friend of all-and especially the friend of the small nation-the Empire that abolished the slave trade, and which has been generous in so many respects under greater leaders than it has now. Look at the shabbiness of it all. I think that here I do not believe a word of it. the only people who sacrifice or risk anything are the poor men who go to the war, and their families.

A t the same time, I consider that the man who is a commissioned officer has hopes of distinction ancl other prospects, which the man in the ranks has not. There is no doubt whatever that the majority of the men -who are egging on this war will not sacrifice one penny, and still they are loudest in the cry of patriotism. What is patriotism ? Isi t not the willingness to sacrifice one's self for one's country ? Where is the sacrifice in a few years it will be seen who has on the part of those who send others to the war, who put others in the frout and stay behind, ancl who say they will not pay one penny towards the sending of a contingent? If w'e are going to do a good thing for the mother country we should do it handsomely. We should put our hands into our own pockets and help her. I should be the first to vote for any taxation or device which would preserve this great Empire from destruction if there were any danger threatening it . In spite of misrepresentation, truth is gradually coming through the chinks of the great wall which it has been sought to erect around this war, ancl there are many people who are beginning to doubt the justice as well as the wisdom of it. Can we not be candid with ourselves and answer candidly in our own minds 1 If Lord Salisbury, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, or Mr That was what was asked for by a Tory Balfour had known what this war would cost England in men, in money, and otherwise, would they have pressed Kruger into a corner to try and force upon .him reforms in the Boer franchise?

Would they have driven Kruger to bay, as they did, if they had known that other powers would been, riching themselves in the meantime in Asia, where Great Britain has far larger interests than in South Africa?

It is because I love England with an hereditary affection, and from training, that I have opposed this war; and been the true patriot, who has been anxious to preseve the Empire, and to prevent her from leaving the path of progress which she has hitherto followed.

All I claim for myself is that I have taken more trouble than a good many others have taken to go to the original official documents, and to read the statements of both sides. On page 825 of volume 64 of the Parliamentary papers presented to the House of Commons during the year 1899-and the volume is in the library for any one to see -ther e is a copy of a letter sent by Mr ending with champagne, there was great disReitz, the State Secretary, to Sir Alfred Milner, dated 10th October, 1899, just before the war began. I u this letter, after a good deal of discussion, the final proposal was made1. That all points of mutual difference shall be regulated by the friendly course of arbitration, or by whatever amicable way may be agreed upon by this Government with Her Majesty's Government. 2. That the troops on the borders of this -Republic shall be instantly withdrawn. It is not stated in the papers, but it is perfectly clear, that during the negotiations, and when Mr Chamberlain had announced to the .Boer Republic that he would formulate his own proposals, troops were pouring in from India and from England, and occupying offensive strategic positions round about the Boer Republics. The third proproposal in the letter is3. Tliat all re-inforcements of troops which have arrived in South Africa since the 1st June, 1S99, shall be removed from South Africa within a reasonable time to be agreed upon with this Government, and with a mutual assurance and guarantee on the part of this Government that no attack upon or hostilities against any |X>t'tion of the possessions of the British Government shall be made by the Republic during further negotiations within a period of time to be subsequently agreed upon between the Governments, and this Government will, on compliance therewith, be prepared to withdraw the armed burghers of this Republic fromfcheborders. 4. That Her Majesty's troops which are now on the high seas shall not be landed in any port of South Africa. Therefore it is perfectly clear that up to the last the Boers were willing to have arbitration in such a way as might be agreed upon. All they insisted upon was that they could not carry on negotiations while was planting more and more troops upon their borders. When it is said that Kruger took the initiative by declaring' war, my answer is that war was virtually by Mr Chamberlain when he said that he would formulate his own proposals. writer upon this subject who has any fairness has admitted that it is not just to Mr JJigyins. accuse Kruger of having declared war. It was simply a strategic move on his partand it is not for me to say whether it was right or wrong to prevent the English from making further preparations for war. As soon as it was found that the Boers were more prepared than was at first supposed, and that the war was not to be merely a parade to Pretoria, beginning with the waving of the "" red, white, and blue "" and gust, and the cry was raised that there was an arrangement to drive the British into the sea. When the Prime Minister was speaking, I asked him for any tittle of evidence in support of that statement. He said that it was common knowledge. It is common newspaper statement, but I deny that it is common knowledge; and I challenge him to find any proof of a conspiracy to drive the British into the sea. Erom 1884, when the last convention was signed, until 1895, when the Jameson raid was made, there is no evidence of any attempt on the part of the Boers to make preparations for war. for war must have cost millions of pounds. years. tions, and I think that the Boers had reasonable suspicions, after the Jameson raid, but until 1895 no preparations for war were made. After 1895 there were extreme preparations for war. W it h an ignorant nation like the Boers, it is little wonder that they became suspicious. I do not suppose that honourable members will impugn the testimony of Dr. Jameson, who was the author of the raid, as to the state of these preparations. What did he write in the Diamond Fields Advertiser, of 23rd June, 1899, in justifying his raid? Referring to the end of 1895, he saysYou must remember that at that time fche Transvaal was not the armed Transvaal of to-day. Apart from the rifles in the hands of the individual burghers,fchewhole armoury offcheTransvaal was contained in the so-called Pretoria fort, England guarded by, I think, three States Artillerymen, and its sole protection a broken-down corrugated iron fence. Only a few days before our crossing fche border, Judge Koefcze, travelling north with Mr Newton, told fche latter that, seeing and declared recognising the serious discontent on the Rand, he was then on his way tp warn Mr Kruger fchafc, Every in his opinion, any night 150 Bandites armed with sticks could march across to Pretoria, seize that fort, and have the Transvaal in their possession.",35,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Bight through-befor e the war, and since the war--Kruge r and his Ministers have been for arbitration. It is utterly false, so far as I can find out, that they desired to have war. that there should be arbitration by foreign rjowers.

The offer of mediation has always been open, and I am sorry to say it has not been accepted. able member for Gippsland has spoken in attack on Mr Gladstone. his faults, there is not a man of * us who could hold the candle to Mr friendly power, Portugal, but that he Gladstone for moral force, for puipose, for unselfish obedience to what he thought to be right. There was nothing grander than the way in which England submitted to the Alabama award and quietly paid it, and there was nothing grander also-and history will show it-tha n Mr Gladstone's abandoning the war against the Boers as soon as he found that the facts had been misstated to him. He had been told that the Boers wished to be incorporated with England. He found that Sir Theophilus Shepstone was wrong in the matter, and magnanimously, and to the honour and glory of England, he said"" No, I find that I have been mistaken ; I find that my agents have not told me exactly what was right; find that you do not wish to be incorporated ; I give back your independence."" When we come to look with a larger focus, and with a more generous eye, when history comes to stone's action was the wisest one; but unfortunately it has been spoiled by miserable successors. Ever since the disaster at MajubaH ill , and ever since the engagements out of which the English army unfortunately did not come with glory, the military heads of England have had an edge against the Boers, and they never will be content until they have the Boers down and licked. The military forces of England have been at the back of all this. military forces of England. "" Well,"" being severe on the military authorities of England.

If honourable members will read the report of the debate in the House of Lords on the 15th March, 1901, they will see that while the negotiations were pending between The honorKruger and Milner in 1899, Lord Wolseley proposed to Lord Lansdowne, the Secretary W it h all of State for War, not only that he should seize Delagoa Bay, which belonged to a should seize it in June, 1899, aud subjugate the two Boer republics before November, 1899.

I confess that I rather follow men like John Morley and John Burns than the outcries of the music halls and the rabble of jingoism. If the question were left to the decision of the great population of England by plebiscite or referendum, I do not believe that they would declare in favour of the war; but, unfortunately, at present the machinery of public opinion is manipulated in a way of which we have not yet got control, though I hope, in the course of time, we shall be able to do so. I do not suppose that there is any one in England whose honour, devotion to the Empire, integrity, is more apparent than is that of Earl Spencer, a nobleman whom I remember seeing when I was a boy-a t a distance, of course. What does he say 1He did not see that the dignity and honour of the Crown would be lowered if they came to favorable terms with the gallant, foe which had been opposing them. That is just my view, and if Earl Spencer, an ex-Minister of the Crown, and a friend of Mr Gladstone, is of that opinion, I should be at liberty to follow him. The two divisions of this motion stand on a different footing, and I thank the Prime Minister for having indicated that he has no objection to their being submitted to the House separately. W it h regard to the first portion of the motion, which expresses our indignation at the baseless charges made abroad against the honour of the people and the humanity and valour of the soldiers of the Empire, I do not know that there is any call for it . There is, perhaps, no objection to it ; but, really, it seems to me that it would be degrading on our part to take notice of statements made in the newspapers. There have been nnjust statements made in some of the German newspapers, but is it worthy of this new Commonwealth to take notice of that sort of thing? I do not agree with the charges that have been made against the people or the soldiers of the Empire. I think it is too extreme to say that the concentration camps were established for the purpose of destroying the Boer women and children. I know enough of soldiers to say that they are very stupid in managing the affairs of women and children, and that they havj very likely bungled the arrangements in connection with these camps; but they are as I am not likely to give humane as any one in their dealings with women and children, and are kind at bottom. I do not agree with those who say that there was any such object in establishing these camps as the destruction of women and children. Two hundred and sixty per 1,000 per annum is an awful death rate, and it is exceedingly unfortunate that the arrangements should have been so faulty. I am quite sure, however, that the British Government will do its best to remedy the existing defects. Soldiers are bunglers, but sailors are not-that is, speaking in a wide sense-and it is not to be expected tliat a number of men working under martial law should make proper arrangements for women and children gathered together in camps such as those in South Africa. I regret that so many deaths should have occurred,'and I sincerely hope that the existing conditions will soon be ended. I think that the proper course to adopt would be to ignore with dignified silence the slanders upon the valour and honour of our soldiers. W it h regard to the second part of the motion, I have no hesitation in voting against it . I do not think we ought to try to bring the war to an end in the way indicated by that portion of the motion. I say that the war is an unjust war. Many of us know that it is unjust, although perhaps we do not feel free to so express ourselves. If the motion indicated that the war should be brought to an end by extending, as Earl Spencer says, humane and considerate treatment to a gallant foe, I should vote for it ; but as the motion evidently means that we should pursue the Boers to their ultimate extinction or to the surrender of their independence, I say"" No."" of the motion before the House is somewhat unfortunate in its wording. I should have preferred a motion indicating that, this House still had the utmost faith in tlie humanity and valour of our soldiers. That, I think, would have been an effective way of dealing with the insinuations that have been so frequently made by the Continental press. As regards the general policy of the war, we might also express our approval of it in a somewhat general way. Apart from this consideration, I cannot agree for a moment with a good deal that has been said in this House this afternoon as to whether such a motion is necessary or not. It has been stated, by way of interjection,",37,Honourable Members Hear Hear
167,Mr Higgins,,38,Honourable Members Hear Hear
168,Mr Powler (Perth),"The first partthat a good*many of the charges against our troops have been made by irresponsible penny-a-liners, but in my opinion the charges which have appeared in the Continental newspapers have been paid for at a .much higher rate than a penny per line. But whether that be so or not, I hold that the continuance of the charges and their frequency, and the venom which characterizes them, demand that they shall be taken notice of. If I heard that some insignificant individual was vilifying me at large I should take no particular notice of it , but if I discovered that by means of lies and insinuations he was turning my natural friends against me, I should certainly take action in a most distinct and spirited way. The charges which have appeared in the Continental press have not been made against the old country, but against the soldiers of the Einpire and against our Australian soldiers, and I , for one, consider it to be the duty of this House to say most emphatically what it thinks of these charges and insinuations. Therefore, although I regret that the wording of the first part of the motion is nob such as I can fully approve of, I shall certainly support it . W it h regard to the second part of the motion, I should have had very little to say bub for bhe spiribed speech bo which we have jusb listened. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is always interesting. He commands our respect for his courage and for the ability wibh which he expresses his opinions. I cannot, however, help reflecting that, with regard to the rights and wrongs of this war, we may roughly divide bhose who objecb bo ib inbo bhree sections. In bhe firsb class we have cerbain persons who profess to look upon this matter, as they do upon many others, from a superior intellectual and ethical stand-point. These people declaim against the injustice of this war, and denounce a big nation for attacking a little one. This reminds me of a little incident, of which I have a vivid recollection, that occurred in my boyhood. When I was about eleven or twelve years of age I had occasion to leave one school and go to another. I was then a somewhat gawky, over-grown lad, and rather bashful and unassumingas I believe people sometimes consider me even at the present time. As usually happens to schoolboys when they go from one school to another, I had to run the gantlet of a good deal of persecution, and there was one particular lada little nuggebby chap, quibe as old as I was, bub not so tall by about a head, and yet possibly stronger and more fitbed for bhe rough-andtumble struggles such as schoolboys engage in-wh o for weeks made my life a perfect misery. He evidently jumped at the conclusion that he could tackle a quiet, unassuming youth, such as I was, albhough I was so much bailer, and show off his prowess by bullying and challenging bo fighb, and by visiting upon me all bhose libble pebby annoyances of which schoolboys are usually bhe masters. I pub up with all this for a good long time, until one day, after school came out and we were going along the street of a quiet little Scbbch village, where hand-loom weaving was bhe principal occupation, bhis boy provoked me beyond endurance. -Jusbi n front of one of the hand-loom shops I dropped my books and tackled him, and was proceeding to give him a jolly good thrashing when a man rushed out of the doorway and, catching me roughly by the arm and dragging me away from the youngster, gave me a box on the ear, at the same time saying indignantly"" Why, vou great big coward you ought to be ashamed of yourself striking a little fellow like that!"" When I hear people talking about a big nation attacking a little one, I always remember that incident, ancl I want to know first whether there is any justification. I propose, if the House will allow me, to review the matter from an opposite standpoint, in somewhat the way the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has done, not perhaps with his ability, though with quite as much sincerity. Before we consider rights and wrongs, we must first try to realize the actual position. We must consider the position of those with whom we have this quarrel, and what they are. Until we realize fully these considerations, we can bring only a more or less biased view to bear on the question. This difficulty between Great Britain and the Boers is one which can hardly be paralleled in the history of the modern world. The circumstances are so singular that any attempt to argue from somewhat similar conditions is, I contend, altogether misleading. into ancient history. very far back into ancient history; but if",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear
169,Mr Mcdonald,D o not go too far back,39,Honourable Members Hear Hear
170,Mr Fowler,"I do not intend to gothe honourable member has patience, he will probably find that, so far as I do go, the facts have very important relation to this question. I wish to point out that from the very beginning we find these Boers a very peculiar people. ing a part of the world in which they established a condition of things altogether unlike anything attempted by any civilized community. The Boers, originally dwelling in Cape Colony, left that part of South Africa, and wont further north, avowedly because they felt themselveshampered and fettered by the conditions of civilization. a big outcry about tlie fact that when slavery was being abolished by the British Empire they got only some £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 a head for their slaves, while they wanted a great deal more. slavery was to be a tiling of the past in the British dominions, they decided, holding their own peculiar views in regard to the natives, that they would go further north where they could work their own sweet will with the black people. We know that the Boers view this question of enslaving the natives from a stand-point essentially their own. member say that that was the reason the Boers left Cape Colony? of the principal reasons given by their own historians and apologists. The Boers take the Old Testament stand-point that they are a ""chosen people, and that the natives are intended by the Providence of God to be subject to them. That view the Boers held 100 years ago, and they hold it just as strongly to-day. They went up into a part of the country which at that time was occupied by native races, and which was also to a certain extent under the control and regulation of the British Government. That part was occupied by numerous missionaries and traversed by traders who dealt with the natives. The British Government had continually taken an interest in the various native tribes, and, as far as possible, helped them along the paths of civilization. In that respect it is impossible for any one, whatever may be the shortcomings of the British Government, to charge them with indifference to the welfare of native races. The whole history of the colonial policy of Great Britain has been one in which, according to many white colonists, an undue amount of consideration has been accorded to the natives. We have heard that complaint frequently in Australia, and it was certainly voiced in no quiet way by the Boers time and again, when the British ""We find them occupyGovernment interfered to prevent their maltreating, robbing, and enslaving the natives by whom they were surrounded. Regarding the treatment of the natives by , the Boers, I find evidence from sources which I think even the honourable member for Northern Melbourne will not question. I find a man like David Livingstone, the great missionary, who did so much for the They made redemption of the natives of Africa, saying that he was unwillingly forced to the conclusion that the Boers were treating the natives with an undue amount of harshness and lack of consideration. The payment When they saw that which David Livingstone received for the efforts he made on behalf of the natives was , that on one occasion his station was, in his absence, raided by the Boers, who tore up and destroyed his books and even wrecked his medicine chest. We find even the South African historian, Theal, confirming the allegations of gross injustice inflicted on the natives by the Boers. That' confirmation comes in rather a naive way, because Theal is, as regards the Boer treatment of the natives, an apologist for the Boers, always taking up the position that the natives deserve everything they get. While stating frequently that the natives came into the domains of the Boers and took away cattle, he on one occasion only mentions that the Boers are liable to retaliate. One particular instance to which Theal refers was of so unblushing and criminal a character that even the Boer authorities were compelled to take notice of it . The men who made this foray on the cattle of the natives were brought to justice and convicted, and in addition to returning the cattle were ordered to pay a fine. But what happened t We find in this particular case an illustration of the attitude of the Boers towards the natives. There was a riot in favour of the Boer cattle stealers, and public opinion was evidenced by the fact that in spite of the decision of the court of justice, the restoration of cattle was not made, and the fine was not paid. The result of all this kind of thing was that the Boers were continually at war with the natives, or the natives continually at war with the BoersI do not care which way it was. There may have been faults on",39,Honourable Members Hear Hear
171,Mr Mcdonald,Does the honourable,40,Honourable Members Hear Hear
172,Mr Fowler,"I say that that is oneboth sides, as I am willing to admit. But -whoever was at'fault, the British Government could not continue to see this state of things going on without attempting to put matters right. We find the British Government continually using their influence, but quite without avail until a time came when the Boers were actually threatened with extinction by the great Zulu nation, which had rapidly risen to' a foremost place amongst the natives of Africa. When the real position was understood the Boer leaders immediately cast about for relief, and, as on previous occasions, they approached the British Government. Their usual course of action was to argue that in times of peace they should be left severely alone, ancl allowed to do what they chose to the natives, but when their conduct provoked retaliation, they should be at liberty to seek refuge behind the British authorities. Matters eventually became so serious that the Boer leaclers themselves admitted that annexation was the only remedy. Accordingly annexation was proposed, and whilst it was nominally objected to by some of the leaders, it was, in reality, welcomed. The Boer people, however, being as ignorant and pig-headed as ever, objected to annexation. They did not see the danger with which they were confronted-as did their leaders-and were unwilling to have their freedom of action curtailed. Their President at that time was a man named Burgers, who at this particular juncture made a remarkable speech in the Raad, from which I shall read a short extract. On the 3rd March, 1878, Burgers addressed the representatives of the Boers, sitting in their Parliament, in these wordsI would rather be a policeman under a strong Government than the President of such a State. It is you-yo u members of the Raad-and the Boers, who have lost the country, who have sold your independence for a sop. You have ill-treated the natives, 3'ou have shot them down, you have sold them into slavery, ancl now you have fco pay fche penalty. That their own President to these peaceful, idyllic farmers to whom the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has just alluded. I do not wish to worry honourable members with any recapitulation of the history of the Boers, but there are one or two points upon which I desire briefly to dwell. I come therefore to the time of the Majuba disaster, and to the arrangement which was entered into 25 i i immediately after that occurrence. We have heard the late Mr Gladstone praised for his magnanimity in granting the concessions which he did to the Boers at that particular time, but it has been admitted by Mr. Gladstone's best friends that, however great a success he may have been as a Home statesman, he was an utter failure in regard to his foreign policy, and the Majuba disaster affords one of the most remarkable instances upon record of his failure in this respect. I yield to no one in my opposition to war. I regard it with horror, and as a means of settling disputes to which resort should be had only in the last extremity. A t the same time, I sa)' that there are some things which are worse than war, and one of these is tliat moral cowardice which avoids a small war, but precipitates a greater and more serious one immediately afterwards. That was the result of Mr Gladstone's policy, which has been characterized as one of magnanimity. It may have been a policy of magnanimity in Mr Gladstone's mind, but we have the evidence of one of his own colleagues in the Ministry at the time that their reason for backing down after Majuba was that they feared they had not a majority of the people of the country behind them. Surely there is not much magnanimity or bravery in that! On the contrary, I coll it arrant cowardice, and it is a cowardice which has brought stern retribution upon the Empire. be said about those who to-day are following the popular cry. well be left to care of itself. cry"" one day is the sacred voice of the majority at another time. personal reminiscence to honourable members, which, possibly, may not carry much weight with them, but which carries a very great deal of weight with myself.

176,Mr Fowler,"I wish to relate a littleNew Zealand and South Africa. They were engaged in mining in South Africa shortly after the Majuba calamity, just subsequent to the settlement of that trouble which was agreed to by Mr Gladstone. around our camp lire at night they used to relate their experiences, to which I listened with a very great deal of interest. They were highly intelligent men, who had knocked about the world with their eyes open-me n of the highest probity, whom I still regard as almost my ideals of manhood, who scorned to do a wrong or dirty action, who invariably took the side of right against wrong, and championed the cause of the weak as against that of the strong. They told us of their experiences in the Transvaal, and declared then-and I am speaking of a long time anterior to the Jamieson raid-that Great Britain would yet have to fight for her bare footing in South Africa. That was the conclusion at which they had arrived as the result of their own observations, and from the talk of the Boers themselves. They also added, what is a matter of common knowledge in South Africa, namely that, life amongst the Boers was almost intolerable for any ooe who spoke the English language, for years after the Majuba disaster. The Boers were perfectly sure that they had annihilated the greater part of the British army, and were merely waiting their own time to drive the British entirely out of the country. I come now to the period when the Uitlanders were their rights as against the corruption .tnd tyranny of the dominant power in the Transvaal. HereI wish to express my sincere sympathy with those Uitlanders, because as an Uitlander in Western Australia. I have shared in a somewhat similar battle. understand how some honourable members, representing that State, fail to realize that what the Uitlanders were fighting for in South Africa, is identical with what we were so long struggling for in the State from which we come. Queensland to-day. been very much disgusted at the attitude adopted with relation to the Uitlander agitation by many of those who stand in the forefront of the democratic movement in Australia. We have been told that many of the Uitlanders did not worry their heads about the franchise. They were getting good wages under the old Boer oligarchy, and they did not want any change. We are told that we should Sitting consider their views, and that we should give some weight to the opinion they expressed that they did not want any change. ders ? ber really asks that question with a desire for information, I can only express my regret that he has not given more attention to the subject. Those people who were, getting good wages in South Africa and who were quite satisfied with their condition, were exactly the same class of people who tend to hinder the progress of the democratic movement throughout Australia It is these men who are satisfied with their beer and their tobacco everywhere in the world, who have allowed such a state of things to continue as existed in South Africa, and even exists to-day in Australia. Those are not the men we have to consider. The men we have to, consider are the men who had some ideals before them with regard to their duties to themselves and the country in which they found themselves; the men who were prepared to lay down their lives if need be for those rights which they held dear by tradition, and dear b j ' their actual enjoyment of them in other parts of found fighting for the world. If I remember correctly, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne referred to the fact that in other countries than Germany the people were opposed to our policy in the Transvaal, and America was cited. Well, I have something to say in that conIndeedI cannot for the world nexion. Some of the people who took a most prominent part in the Uitlander agitation in the Transvaal were, I am proud to say, Americans. I find it stated by one of the historians of this movement that immediately before the Jamieson raid took place, and when there were some whisperingsin the air that a movement of this kind was impending, some of those American citizens who wished for themselves in the Transvaal the rights they had enjoyed in othercivilized communities went to President Kruger, and attempted to remonstrate with him on the obstinate course he was pursuing, and to warn him of the result it would inevitably lead to.

The only answer that an American could give. His reply to that was'* You are all alike, tarred with the same brush ; you are all British in your hearts."" It did not matter from what part of the world the people speaking the English language came; in the eyes of President Kruger they were all highly objectionable, because they had the same democratic ideas as regards their rights as free men, ideas which were in the highest degree objectionable to him, and ideas he was prepared to fight against as long as ever he could. ber remarked that every American newspaper is against the attitude of Great Britain% M'.r.

Imperial authorities, to which I was about to refer when I was interrupted, is again bound up with the question of the suzerainty. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in reply to an interjection, wanted to make out that this was a mere matter of words, but I think I can bring evidence to prove that it was not a mere matter of words, but a very important consideration which has been too often lost sight of by those who have been pleading for the Boers. The whole question rests upon whether the convention of 1884 25 i i z abrogates entirely the terms of the convention of 1S81, and especially the pregained as being entirely put aside by the subsequent treaty of 1884. Now the preamble of the 1881 convention runs shortly as f ollow's :' Her Majesty's commissioners forfchesettlement of the Transvaal territory duly appointed as Such by a commission passed under fche Royal sign manual and signet bearing datefche5fch of April,. 1881, do hereoy undertake and guarantee on behalf of Her Majesty that from and after the eighth day of August, 1881, complete self-government, subject to the suzerainty of Her Majest3', her heirs and successors, will be accordedfcofche inhabitants of the Transvaal territory upon the following terms and conditions and Subject to the following reservations and limitations : There need be no hesitation about coming to a conclusion with regard to that.. Suzerainty is there expressed definitely, and, I believe, it is not usually argued that it does not exist in the 1881 convention, but it is insisted upon that the 18S4 convention abrogates it . I have read the preamble of the 1881 convention particularly, because it contains two important previsions. It speaks of the suzerainty, and it also grants self-government. If the 18S4 convention does away with the convention of 1881, if it does away with the suzerainty, it follows, inevitably that it must do away with self government also. It cannot do away with merely a part of the preamble. Eitheri t does away vtfith the whole of it or with none at all. In addition to that, I find evidence from an authority who, I believe, will be given some weight even by my Mend, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I observe that the honourable and learned member wishes us to believe always that people who express an opinion favorable to the Boers are highly estimable people. I believe they are, but I shouldlike the honourable and learned member, and other members of the House favorable to the Boers, to consider whether it is not possible that authorities who differ from them are worthy and estimable people also. Here is the statement of a gentleman who, I believe, ought to carry some weight as an authority upon such matters Professor de Loieter, of Utrecht University, in Holland. He is not. a Briton, and not even an Australian, but a Hollander, and he saysSovereignty does not admit of other restrictions than those which are clearly defined and Ireely accepted by parties contracting on equal terms.",42,Honourable Members Hear Hear

187,Mr Fowler,"This interference of theThat, spoken in relation to the position of tlie Boers under the British Government, indicates clearly the opinion of that authority that sovereignty did exist in actual and tangible fashion. If what I have contended be admitted, I think it will be realized that Great Britain, in carrying her demands to the ultimatum of war, was -absolutely justified. As I have said, already, I regard war with every possible aversion. It should only be entered into in the very last extremity, but having entered in to it I see no reason for making half a job of what has been undertaken, sind creating perhaps a .condition of things which would inevitably precipitate something even more serious in the form of war than the previous disastrous condition of '.affairs. The great crya cry I am sorry to say that has a deal of influence on those who agree with myself on most political nuatters-is that this is a capitalists' war. jmember think it is ? press a definite opinion on the point. There is no doubt that this cry is very effective with a .number of people. It is like the cry of "" wolf"" amongst a community of shepherds; it has only to be raised in order to make a great commotion. I say without hesitation that the assertion that the war is a, capitalists' war is absolutely groundless in it as a veiy great evil in our modern -the sense in which it is urged. I am per-fectly willing to admit that capitalists have .taken the side of the Britishi n this war; 'but I hope it will be admitted that capitalWhat is the weapon with which we have ists have also been taking tlie side of the Boers. German capitalists have been taking the side of the Boers. ists' wars. .say that all wars are capitalists' wars. The honourable member bears a name which connects him, like myself, with a country of which we ought to be proud, a country that .has entered into many wars, and I should be sorry to listen to any one who would insinuate that wars such as those in which .my native country has engaged in times gone by were without justification. The wars they have entered upon are wars which have enabled the honourable member and unyself to live the lives we are now leading. They have enabled the people of that country to hold up their heads among the foremost nations of the earth, and I should be sorry indeed to see the spirit which animated the people of that nation in resisting wrong and oppression lost in this new community of ours. What is it on which the assertions tliat this is a capitalists' war are founded ? AVhere do we find their origin 1 We find their origin in that press in the Transvaal which was engineered and financed by the infamous crew that had Dr. Leyds at the head of it . It was there that the cry was first originated. It is from that source that it has been taken up, and taken up, I am sorry to say, by a press that ought to be particularly careful of the source from which it receives its information. every miner who has been there. has not been listening to my speech or he would have heard me give evidence that man} miners who have been there do not 7 I am just going to exhold that view. one. « what I believe is the correct position We, as democrats, and I , as a labour man, are confronted frequently with the trouble of capitalism.

It would be very difficult for any one to say that, after this war is over, it will not be possible for the people of the Transvaal to obtain for the first time in tlieir history something like true representative government.

It has been a struggle with corruption and injustice, a struggle waged in the interests of progress and for the rights of humanity, a struggle that will now give the people of the Transvaal the rights they have been denied so long, and which I believe will lead ultimately to the fusion of South Africa in a federation somewhat similar to what we enjoy in Australia. ties propose to make, the Transvaal a Crown colony. propose to give self-government to it, and to give votes to those who are likely to use them in the interests of that movement which the honourable member, with myself, has at heart.

I say, "" No !

I do not wish to be led away any further by interjections. I have detained the House long enough. I intend to vote for this motion, believing, as I do, that it tends towards justice and progress and humanity, matters which concern us not only as Australians, but as citizens of the world. I feel that there is no special need for prolonging the debate, I am impelled to make one or two observations regarding the motion and the speeches which have been made upon it. I think tf.iat there will not be two opinions expressed in this chamber in regard to the first part of thedb not. They motion. It deals with a condition of affairs, which is happily uncommon, but which at the present time calls for some action on the part of those who hold dear the Empire to which we are all proud to belong. I have not been so much annoyed by the statements which have been published in the Continental newspapers regarding: the conduct of our troops in South Africa, as I have been distressed by the statements which from time to> time have emanated from persons to whom the honour of the British troops should be as dearas that of the members of their ownhouseholds. There are gentlemen occupying high and responsible positions in the old country who have not considered it lowering to their dignity, ancl an evidence of their want of recognition of their duty to their country, to vilify and to hold up to obloquy and detestation the acts of our soldiers now serving in South Africa. Perhaps the pin pricks of Continental critics may be ignored by us, but when inflammatory and degrading speeches are made by men who, although they do not at present occupy the highest positions in the government of the Empire, feel that they have a right to do so at the first opportunity, Ave must feel that we are called upon to reply to the inaccurate and undeserved statements I apply it without which had been made in regard to those whom we have sent to South pleasant task to have to defend the honour of one of the great institutions of the the honourable Empire against misrepresentation and vilification, and it is rendered doubly unpleasant by the knowledge that it would not be necessary if it were not for the disloyalty of some from whom we might have expected better things.

If we hold that the conduct of our troops in South Africa has been in accordance with those dictates of humanity and civilization, which we have for so many years proudly obeyed, we must feel that those troops, when they need our assistance, should be supported by us. Therefore I do not know how any honourable member who recognises that the first part of the motion is needed, can fail to see that it should cany with it the passage of the second part. We have been told that there will be an opportunity later on to discuss the proposed despatch of the Pederal contingent, and I hope then to say -a word or two in regard to it . A t the present moment I desire only to join with the honourable member for Gippsland in expressing my regret that the Government did not see fit to make a spontaneous offer, without waiting for an invitation from the Home Government. I do not know if the report is true, but it is currently stated that the desire expressed by Mr Chamberlain was the result of a suggestion made by a visitor to Australia, and a member of one of the State Ministries. would give them a poke up at the other -end. statement, but it is currently reported and honourable member make an interjection largely believed that the request of the which, though not so intended, will be reSecretary of State for the Colonies was garded -by a very large number of persons prompted by the action of two gentlemen in as a very unf air aspersion on a body of men, Australia.

I was deeply pained tcfind that one who deservedly occupies the high position member is not going to bring a debate of which he has attained in this community, this kind down to the level of a discussion holds the opinions he holds in regard as to the right of the men to an extra 14d. to the conduct of affairs in South Africa. a day or as to the action of a particular I do not intend to enter into the merits of State. the dispute, nor am I going into the causes which led up to the war ; but in my opinion every loyal subject of the Einpire, now that we have entered into the war, should, so long as it is conducted upon the principles upon which the honourable and learned member admits that it has been conducted, assist by every means in his power to give a victory to British arms, not solely for the subjugation of a free people, but to make life and liberty in South Africa secure, to maintain the integrity of the Empire and to prevent not only a very grave danger to Cape Colony and Natal, British possessions pure and simple, but a great danger to Australia itself. We cannot overestimate the danger to Australia tliat would have resulted from a complete success of the Boer arms, in South Africa. W it h regard to the merits of the war, I repeat I do .not desire to say anything. AVith regard to the jibes which have been uttered against those who do not go to fight in South Africa, but who are prepared to send others to take their place in the fore-front of Ahe battle, I desire to point out that for -every man who is required by the Home Government to go there from Australia there are 10, 20 or 30 men here not only willing to go, but able and competent to a degree.

BAMFORD -It is very significant. 1 may consider it very significant, but I am not prepared to attach so much importance to the action of what may after all be a small minority of those who went. I speak now with the authority of those with whom I am acquainted, and I declare that it is an undeserved slur on the patriotism of the men to say that they have gone for the sake of the pay they have received. I sincerely trust that, unless the honourable member can give us some evidence of the accuracy of that statement, he will unreservedly withdraw it in justice to the men. to the House presently. intention, as I indicated, to detain the House. We have .a bounden duty to perform. I feel that it is not necessary for any one to attempt to give any reason why that duty should be performed : it is so self-evident. The people of Australia are as one man in this matter. There are, perhaps, individual members who are opposed to the movement, but those individual members represent a very small minority of the people of Australia. The honourable member for Northern Melbourne told us how public opinion is veering round. He cannot read 'the signs of the times if he imagines that public opinion is changing, except in one direction, with regard to affairs in South Africa. The people of Australia have now a fuller knowledge, not only of the facts which led up to tlie war, but also of the condition of things obtaining in the Transvaal, than they had previously. If a plebiscite were taken in the Commonwealth; it would be found that an enormous majority of the people are in favour of every word in this motion, that they are prepared to do their utmost to uphold the prestige, the honour, and the dignity of British arms, and that they approve of the Commonwealth accepting the responsibility which belongs to its position within the Empire, and devoting, if need be, its last man and its last farthing-al l we possess-in order to defend the integrity of the Empire to which we belong.

I do not mind anything which these people like to say in this matter. Anything that the continental press may say concerning our soldiers in South Africa, or the British nation generally, will not affect the honour of Great Britain. The motion has been prompted from other sources, and, to my mind, it is not a very statesmanlike action on the part of fche Government to come down and ask the House to cnrry a motion dissenting from anything which may have been said by fche continental press. A short time ago a number of Australians were sent to fight in South Africa-me n whom we hold dear to us-and when the}' were called "" whitelivered curs"" there was not a man in the House who got up and attempted to defend them. When a British officer had done that which, I maintain, was „fa r worse against the men whom we sent to fight in South Africa than anything which has been said by the continental press, this House never attempted in any shape or form to take exception to it . The Prime Minister did not come down then to dissent from such a cowardly assertion as the one made by a superior officer. When these men attempted to resent the cowardly insult which had been heaped upon them what was the result ?

221,Mr Mcdonald,"S o far as the firstthe newspapers throughout Australia and by Australians generally that the British Governmentthoughtfit to interfere and bring pressure to bear upon the military authorities, and the men were taken out of prison. If the House approves of the introduction of motions such as this, there will be no end to them. There are a thousand-and-one incidents of every-day occurrence which are equally as important to the people of Australia as is that to which the motion refers, and yet no action is taken with regard to them. Public men are frequently slandered when they take up a very strong position regarding public questions, and there would be as much justification for introducing a motion in this House dissenting from press comments regarding the conduct of public men as upon the subject to which the motion refers. The motion has without doubt been introduced with a view to proving to the world the loyalty of Australia. But there is no real necessity for any affirmation upon that point. We are still loyal to. Great Britain, and as far as I can understand, that has never been doubted. I have no particular feeling with regard to the first part of the motion, and I do not care whether it is carried or not, but I intend to divide the House with reference to the second part. I deprecate the sending of troops to South Africa without consulting Parliament, and I maintain that the Government have no power whatever under the Constitution to arrange for sending away men in the way they have done. The only part of the Constitution that deals with this question is section 119, which readsThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, nsuinst domestic violence. giving the Governor General supreme control over the naval and military forces ? the Governor General power to send troops away from Australia. for the purposes of the Act only. also remind honourable members that in the Defence Acts of the various Statesi t is expressly provided that no troops shall be sent away from Australia to fight in foreign countries. The whole of the Defence forces of Australia have been organized for the purposes of local defence, and not with a view to their being sent abroad. Under these circumstances I maintain that the Government have violated the trust reposed in them, and have assumed a power which does not belong to the Executive, but which is really reposed in this House. I am surprised to hear some honorable members state that they are prepared to condone the action of the Government. Where is this berlain asked the Governmentfor permission to recruit men in Australia, the Prime Minister replied-""No, Mr Chamberlain."" When, however, Mr Chamberlain asked the Prime Ministeri f he would recruit troops for him, the right honourable gentleman said -""Yes, Mr Chamberlain."" If the Government have acted within the powers conferred upon them by the Constitution, they would be equally justified in undertaking to send 20,000 or even 50,000 men away without consulting Parliament. It seems to me, however, that it would be exceedingly dangerous to permit the Executive to exercise any such power. If we permit the Government to send troops to South Africa on their own responsibility, we shall leave Ihem at liberty to comply with a request from, say, the President of the United States, or of France, or of the Emperor of Germany, for troops to be sent to some country near at hand to fight for them. The Prime Minister has assumed a power which does not belong to the Executive, and which cannot be exercised even by the King of England. The action of the Government is such as to merit the condemnation of this House, and I strongly object, as I think most men do, to the functions of Parliament being usurped by the Executive Government. I know of one case in which the Premier of one of the States, .in order to satisfy the greed of a certain financial institution, handed over to it £60,000 or £70,000 without asking for the authority of Parliament. I understand that in the present case the Prime Minister is asking Parliament to ratify the action of the Government, but I would point out that we are placed in a very difficult position. The Government have already promised to send a contingent to South Africa, and this House would make itself a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world if it now refused to allow the men to go.

As the Prime Minister knows, I am not allowed to refer to previous debates; but the dates quoted by the right honourable gentleman did not bear out his contention. Our rights and privileges in the matter of legislation were in that instance ""given away"" by the Government. We heard that satirical speech delivered by the leader of the Opposition about the Prime. Minister and the Government saying "" Yes, berlain cables for troops it is again ""Yes, Mr Chamberlain,"" though the leader of the Opposition has now been drawn in, and re-echoes that acquiesence. I suppose we shall hear a number of the supporters of the Opposition also saying "" Yes, Mr called ""pro-Boer."" I do not know the Chamberlain."" MrM c DONALD a month ago the Prime Minister distinctly stated to me that he had no intention of sending troops; and one of the faults of the right honourable gentleman's explanation is that he does not clear himself on that particular point. What is the whole excuse which is offered by the Prime Ministeri n the face of the statement he made a month ago ? The whole excuse of the Prime Minister for taking action without consulting Parliament is that certain statements have appeared in the German press. Because of these he says it was necessary for him to take action at once. what I said. gentleman said that had it not been for the expressions of opinions in the German press The he should not have taken this course. inference that can be drawn from the Prime Minister's statement. drawn.

A good many of the statements which haA'e been made, whilst of interest to the student, Avould haA'e been better omitted, because the clear issue before us to-night is not as to how the war arose, but as to whether the CommonAvealth Government are right or Avrong in what they haA'e done during the past few weeks.

We haA'e just experienced a drought from end to end of Avhat is regarded as the richest port of AusThe proper and honourable tralia, so that there is no employment available there for our young men. Even when Ave had good seasons the constant cry Avas, "" Wliat are we to do Avith our young men 1"" No doubt the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would reply, ""Settle them upon the land."" But I would point out that there is very little scope for our young men to make homes in Australia in consequence of the bad seasons experienced. I can assure honourable memcountry would rather go soldiering at os. per day than take the place of Kanakas in any part of Northern Queensland. Then, again, Ave are told that Australia is making a great sacrifice. Where is the sacrifice ! The1 idea of the British Government informing the CommonAvealth that no contribution to the expense of sending the contingent Avill be asked from Australia seems to be poohpoohed, but I think it was very right that that fact should be stated.

Nothing of the kind. Let the honourable and learned member go into the various States, and he will find out the pregnant truth-and a glorious fact it is in Australian history-that the young men of this continent, both married and single, are volunteering for military serA'ice in South Africa out of pure patriotism.

My co-representative from Queensland, the honourable member for Kennedy, chafes at the phrase"" Yes, Mr Chamberlain.""

They could have taken no other course, and had they delayed they would have been unworthy of tlie' confidence of this House.

It has engendered a splendid spirit of militarism, if honourable members will call it so, and our best riders and shots have gone there. sentenced to be shot t were not shot, and I am veiy glad that the history of that matter has come out, because it is entirely creditable to Australians. When the story and circumstances reached His Majesty the King, his promptaction in cancelling that sentence and liberating those men, was worthy of a monarch of the British Throne. It is said that we are to pursue a policy of peace; that Australia is to be a land of peaceful development. The honourable member for Kennedy is opposed to any man leaving Australia to take part in the war, and he says that eveiy man should have been prevented from leaving here to assist in it . We are told also by him that he hopes the time will come when Australia will be disassociated from the British Empire, and, I suppose, become a republic. The honourable member said the time would come when we should be a distinct nation, and not associated with England. come when Australia would be an independent nation. That means disassociation from Great Britain, does it not? Surely no honourable member expects his speech to be repeated verbatim et literatim. The words uttered by the Prime Minister this afternoon, when he expressed the hope that his sons and his son's sons for all time would be members of the Australian Commonwealth, still associated by wholesome and natural ties to the British Empire, constitute a sufficient reply to that assertion. Even in our present position some honourable members say"" L e t us pursue the peaceful development of this country."" They say we are asked fco make a sacrifice of our young men, our best blood, and yet we escape, the monetary consequences of the war. That, they think, is not sufficient. I hold that in this timea blessed one, I think-w e are in duty bound to respect the responsibilities which Australia has naturally upon her shoulders in association with the British Empire.

We must not stand alone, if we are to partake of the benefits and the protection of the British men-of-war around the coast of Australia. We cannot enjoy that protection without understanding that something is due from us in return, if not in money at least in blood-in men. If we had stood aloof from Great Britain within the last few years, and had permitted Canada and New Zealand to do what they have done, without joining with them, the escutcheon of Australia would nave been tar-brushed all over the civilized world. While we deplore from the bottom of our hearts the spending of so much blood and treasure in the prosecution of this war, let us remember that it is controlled by the Executive of the first nation in the world, while at the same time they are governing and controlling vast interests in Great Britain, India, and other parts of the",52,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The Right Honourable Mr Chamberlain has found it his duty to reply aspersions on the character of our army, and our nation, and on our executive in the conduct of the war. After all this has happened it would be scurrilous and puerile conduct on the part of Australia to withhold its protestations against the use of such unwarrantable language in regard to our army and its conduct in South Africa.

I think a great deal of weight and importance will be attached to that fact throughout Australia. We must consider the necessity for their acting in unison in a matter of this kind. The motion, as presented by the leader of the Government, is for a specific purpose. Government, The Prime Minister stated that it was necessary that, a motion of this character They would should be carried, not to tell our Yet own people that we were loyal, nor as a test of the loyalty of the people t of Australia, but as a rebuttal of the charges that the European newspapers have for months and months heaped upon the British people and the British forces in South Africa.

I think, I therefore, that the leader of the GovernIts ment and the leader of the Opposition were justified in repudiating those charges. It is remarkable how willingly the statements of penny-a-liner Stead and the Continental, press are accepted without evidence, while on the other hand what is published in the Times, the leading newspaper in Great it should reach that part of Britain, is discredited, and motives of interest attached to its articles.

The first part of the motion expresses indignation at the baseless charges which have been made against our army for the conduct of the war. Do honourable members believe that those charges are baseless ? I believe that they are. I may be be asked for the evidence in favour of my position. My reply is that the history oi Great Britain has always given the lie direct to statements of that character, and I am not prepared to believe that the nature of tlie British people has so entirely changed that they have descended to bar> barism in the conduct of the war in SouthAfrica. We are asked to rely upon the statement of the Boer emissaries, of persons who have studiously kept away from the arena of danger, who have been removed from the scene of carnage, and the seat of warfare. I am not prepared to accept the statements which they have supplied to the journals of Europe. If the British have erred at all, it has been in following too far the dictates of humanity. It is for this reason that they have been misunderstood by foreigners. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has quoted historical facts in defence of .his position, but if he had gone further he could have shown that upon every occasion the success of the British arms has been followed, not by tyranny and oppression, but by freedom of the fullest character, such as we enjoy in Australia to-day.

If he does not oppose the first portion of the motion he will be a party to the sign of weakness. If , on the other hand, he considers it so seriously as to point to it as a sign of weakness, he will vote against both portions of the motion. The second portion, I take it , is a corollary of the first. The object of the first portion is merely to state to tlie world that Australia, and those who are responsible for its government, realize that warfare is not a nursery game, and are prepared, as they took the first step, to take the second, tlie third, and the last step. The honourable ' and learned member for Northern Melbourne said he could understand that in the early days of the Boer war one State would send soldiers and another would copy its example. What is tlie difference between the people of to-day and the people of two years ago ! The1 people, are the same, and a large majority of their representatives in this House had the privilege two years ago of occupying seats in the State Legislatures, where they could express their opinions. was very hard for any State to refuse to send troops when one had set the example. Mi"". WILKS back upon my opinion of that day, or to alter niy vote. On that occasion the honourable and learned member opposed the sending of troops, and to-night he opposes this motion. If the colonies decided separately to send contingents to South Africa to assist the British forces, we are justified, while the necessity continues, in keeping up the contingents to their f u l l strength. over the contract of the States that sent troops to the Transvaal, and it is our bounden duty to maintain the contingents at their f u l l strength. I do not wish to go into the history of the Boer of the pro-Boer. I do not wish to make capital out of the fact that a large majority of the Australianshave decided that the British power shall be paramount in South Africa. I do not wish to take that popular stand and to sing out with the largest crowds. Let me give an illustration which even the honourable member for Kennedy may appreciate.

I do not believe that a single member would hesitate to take his stand on the side of' the Britisher. I believe that a lot of this talk is fireworks-the cry of men longing for some Elysium which may come hundreds The Commonwealth took of years hence when nations shall have changed their habits, and the acquisitive power of individuals and nations shall have been destroyed. We are not dealing, however, with that very happy time which is spoken of in the best of all books, and which we hope will some day come about.

If fche honourable member for Kennedy believes that fche Prime Minister has flouted Parliament, and that his action is inimical to the Commonwealth, his duty is to vote against the Government. The responsibility of fche Government has not been in any way affected, and Parliament has not been deprived of its authority. Parliament can still refuse to send these troops, and the honourable member for Kennedy is wrong in saying that it would be an insult for us to take that course. Which would be fche greater insult-to refuse send them grudgingly, or whilst believing that it would be dangerous to the community to send them ? If it is -dangerous to the community, the honourable member for Kennedy and those who think with him, ought to take a strong stand against the Prime Minister.

Cani t .be said that Great Britain is going against the whole of her traditions and against the desires of her people, simply for the purpose of carryingthat this national House of Australia is on a war ' of oppression 1 England is in this war, which in my opinion must be seen through to. a finish. The Australian colonies separately took their part in the war, and the Commonwealth is performing a right and noble duty in continuing the work. All this is not done with the idea' of destroying people whom we must admire for their pluck and courage, but it is done in order to complete a policy to which Great Britain has put her hand, and which a large majority of the people are prepared to see carried out. Great Britain does not ' ask for troops so much for the reason that she requires the soldiery of Natal, Cape Colony, or Australia, but more because colonial troops have shown their particular fitness for the peculiar system of warfare in tlie Transvaal. The .Secretary of State for to send the men, . or to the Colonies is much decried, but although we naay differ in our domestic policy, we ought to feel gratified that so strong a personality has charge of tlie interests of the British Empire. We ought to be proud that the intellect and personality of Mr Chamberlain are being utilized to the interest and advantage of Great Britain, and not to the advantage of Germany, Prance, or -any other foreign nation. I support the motion in the speedy conclusion, and with it the difficulties attached to -the annexation of the Boer territory-a n annexation which I regard as inevitable. The Boers demand their sovereign independence, but at the present juncture no man can think of complying with that demand. The Boers declared war and involved Great Britain in war, and it is our bounden duty to the Empire to take our responsibility, and, having put our hand to the plough, not to leave it until the furrow is finished. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) The motion presented to fche House is one of such great importance and significance tliat I do not care about giving a silent vote on so memorable an occasion. I regard this as one of the proudest incidents in the history of the Federal Parliament.

278,Mr Wilks,"Exactly. This is not amajority of the adult people of Australia will approve with enthusiasm and acclamation when they hear that it has been passed. I was very proud to-day when I heard that the Prime' Minister had decided to submit a motion of the kind to the House. I feel that if he had not done so he would have made a very serious mistake. I can only join in the regret, which has already been expressed by the honourable member for Gippsland, that the offer of troops was not made spontaneously as a free and voluntary gift from Australia. In this there is undoubtedly a slight blot on the transaction, but I hope that that blot may be wiped out by the motion which has been so heartily submitted under the most gratifying circumstances. I am sure that the whole, or the great bulk of the people of. Australia, including hundreds of thousands of loyal sons and daughters of the Empire, will be proud that this motion has been submitted, not as a mere matter of form, or in order to dispose, for the time being, of a formal duty, but as expressive of our deep and unwavering sympathy with the I m perial Government and the British people in the great problem and campaign on which they have so long been engaged. We desire to show that the Australian people do not shirk the responsibility of nationhood, or allow others to fight the battles of the Empire. We should not, in a great crisis of our history, fold our arms and, sitting under our own vine and fig tree, smoke the pipe of peace and tranquility, while our brothers are shedding their blood and spending their treasure in fighting for their hearths and homes. I , for one, and I am sure every loyal son of the colonial Empire of Britain would be sorry indeed, if any effect were given to the Schreiner policy of colonial neutrality, when great Imperial questions such as this arise. There can be no colonial neutrality where.great issues of the Empire are involved, as they are in this great South African problem. This war cannot truthfully be denounced as a selfish war of aggrandizement. I disagree with those honourable members who have endeavoured to submit that it is an unjust war. unjust war ifc would have been impossible for it to have received the universal support of British people all over the face of the globe. It is said that this is a capitalistic war. the Transvaal or in the world itself, would 25 i 2 be able to purchase the moral and political, support of the people of the United Kingdom and the sympathy of the British colonies, which has been manifested during the progress of this campaign. This war was not inaugurated by Great Britain for the purpose of settVaggrandizemenfc, or for fche purpose of acquiring fresh territories and dominions. It was forced on the Imperial Government in self defence and self-preservation against the aggression of the corrupt Boer oligarchy of Pretoria.

The war was to be one for the supremacy of Africkanderdom, and the expulsion of the British power from South Africa.

So far as I am concerned, it is immaterial to me how the motion is put, as I intend to support it in its entirety. I do, however, desire to say that personally I regret, what to my mind has been the inaction of the Government, which has caused the necessity for the first part of the motion. If the Government had performed the dutydevolving upon them, and had risen to the occasion at the proper time, tlie necessity for this resolution would not have arisen. Their proposal to send a Federal contingent was altogether too long delayed. They appear to have been completely out of touch with the feelings, opinions, and sentiments of the. citizens of the Commonwealth in delaying until they were asked by the Imperial Parliament for this contingent, and in not proposing to send it. Jf we look back to the history of the State Governments in the despatch of contingents to South Africa, it will be seen that in some of the States at least, it was proposed to maintain the strength of the contingents. It was, therefore, a duty devolving upon the Federal Government when they took over the control of the Defence department and the regulation of Defence affairs generally, to maintain the contingents sent to South Africa up to their full fighting strength, and to fill up whatever vacancies might be caused by the misfortunes of war or through men being returned here invalided. Having failed in that duty, I say, without anyhesitation, that they had no other course to pursue than tliat which they have taken in connection with this motion. I have been very pleased indeed to note the attitude of the right honourable the leader of the Opposition in regard to the motion. I desire to say that some of the opinions given expression to came with a little surprise to me. The honourable member for Northern Melbourne has said that he is opposed to sending any contingent at the present time, but should the necessity arise -and some dire necessity, I assume, it would be when the Empire would be rent asunder -the n he would support the sending of a contingent to render assistance to the Empire. But what would be our position 1 Are we to wait practically until the day of reckoning has come 1 Isi t not much more desirable to send men now in order to keep that Empire intact? with a great power. the peculiar'conditions under which we are fighting. Notwithstanding the many wars in which Britain has been involved, it is no common occurrence for her to have had to put a quarter of a million of fighting men fully equipped into the field at suchadistance from theseat of government and to maintain and provide for them there for such a length of time, because we must remember that this war has now been two years in operation. As to the merits or demerits of the war, the view I took from the outset was that it was the duty of those who control the destinies of the Empire to decide. They decided that it was absolutely neeessaiy in the interests of the Empire to enter upon this war for defensive purposes. We know that as soon as hostilities were declared the Boers invaded the British territory, and it appeared to me to become at that time a question of the maintenance of British supremacy in South Africa, and whether the British or the Boers should rule in South Africa. That being so, and the statesmen of the Empire having decided as to the necessity of taking upon themselves the responsibility of this war, I say we had no option but to take our part in it . We have, as citizens of Australia, for a century obtained all the advantages pertaining to citizenship of the Empire, practically without any cost to us as citizens of Australia, and when some little of the responsibilities of the Empire are about to be cast upon us, are we going to shirk them ? As to the feelings of Australians, and their patriotism and loyalty, I say that their loyalty is more than skin deep, and more than lip loyalty. If there is one conviction thoroughly imprinted upon Australians, whether they reside where they are surrounded by the luxuries obtainable in centres of population, or are fighting the forces of nature in the desert, that conviction is that under no flag on earth could they get the same liberty or freedom as they get under the British flag. They are pre| pared to fight to uphold that flag. Some1 honourable members say that it is for purely",60,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The one regretable incident in connection with the whole affair is that some of the Governments who sent the earlier contingents to South Africa have not performed their proper duty to those who returned here invalided, and have not yet performed their proper duty to the dependents of those who have lost their lives fighting for the Empire. proportion of all the States. tion of the proportion sent. The question now is Australia as a Commonwealth, and I hope tliat this national Government will not let any of those who go out under its auspices die in the poor-house, or allow those who may be dependent upon men who may lose their lives in South Africa to be dependent upon charity, but that we shall make ample provision for them. sentiment was thoroughly impressed upon Australians, and they are prepared to fight for the Empire without fee or reward, knowing that the nation will do its duty by those dependent upon them. As to those who object to commit the Australian Commonwealth to any responsibility in the continuance of this war to a successful issue, I desire to refer to a statement made by the honourable member for Bland, in connection with a statement attributed to the right honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr Chamberlain, to the effect that a settlement of the war would only be made in accordance with the wishes of the colonies. I read that statement when it appeared in the press in Australia, ancl the ' interpretation I put upon it was, that the wishes of the British colonies in South Africa would be given f u l l consideration to in the final settlement of the war. And rightly so, to my mind, because they have been placed in a very peculiar position. Since the outbreak of the war they have been in a perpetual ferment; their territory has been invaded, the homes of their peace f u l ancl lo3 al citizens have been destroyed, 7 and their lives have become a misery the 5s. a day? But what is to them, and I think they rightly take up the position that now bhis war has been entered upon, they must have some guarantee of stability in the future. ""Whatever settlement is arrived a t ; thenopinions and their feelings should receive some consideration at tlie hands of the statesmen of theEmpire; and that theyshould not be left, as they have been left practically for the last twenty years, in a state of fear and uncertainty as to what may occur at any time. Then the Australian, as we know him, has a special value as a trooper or soldier in this war. As has been shown, he has special qualifications. The average Ausbralian, if he mounts a horse, can sib on it, and he adapts himself very rapidly to the field. The greater portion who go from here to the war are used to bush life. They have a special knowledge of bush-craft, and as to the duty of they have to deal with a people raised uuder conditions somewhab similar to their own. The average Ausbralian, taken from bush life in Australia, will be equally as wily as the Boer. put under British officers 1 That haps, that we have not the officers here who are specially brained for the work. I cannot say that that is the case. officers who are placed over our men. noticeable in bhe Ausbralian, is that he does not subjecb himself bo military discipline as readily as do citizens of other nations. It may be a useful object lesson to him to 'understand the necessity for discipline where there is a large body of men to be controlled. Our men will receive all the merit to which they are entitled. W it h these feelings I most heartily support the motion. As a citizen of Australia. I am not alarmed about any commitment that we may make in the latter portion of the motion as to the assistance necessary, and which will be forthcoming in order to bring this war to a successful issue.

I am bound to say that, in my opinion, the force and value of the motion are very much impaired by the fact that it has led to a prolonged debate in which so great a difference of opinion between certain honourable members has been shown. The speech which the honourable member for Northern Melbourne Ints madeis, no doubt, a very interesting one. To m& it is exceedingly interesting. As a pyschological study it has an interest quite apart from the purpose of this debate. I think it was Carlyle who said once that history was "" condensednewspapers""; and the honorable and learned gentleman's speech only shows me, as it will show to every observant man, how possible it is that the very -same facts recorded in our newspapers during'the lasttwo orthree years may lead to diametrically opposite generalizations in one mind as compared with thoseof' another mind educated very much in the same way. The studies of the honourable and learned member and thosethrough which I have gone are very much alike. His speech shows that it is possible for two men to have absorbed similar factsof so modern a date as those of the last two or three years, and yetto arrive at conclusions on a' questionlike this which .are diametrically opposed to each other. I should have been prepared to pass the other speechesmade during the debate, but I should feel that I was wanting in public spirit if I assented to any one of the several strange propositions that the honourable ancl learned member for Northern Melbourne has put before the House. He told us something about his lineage; but I should hope that he was what I might call the intellectual sport of that particular line of citizens, because be rude. to be-. I should be very sorry to think that it was an increasing quantity in this or any other country that politicians or citizens could arrive at such conclusions from such facts as those which have been experienced by all of us. What is this motion ! It consists of two parts, the first vin1 dicating the character of our soldiers against the libellous aspersions of the foreign press. How the honourable member can object to a motion of that kind I cannot understand. unnecessary; our soldiers stand on their Own merits. speech the honourable and learned member made many complimentary remarks about the soldiers of the Empire. We know that this motion is not intended for tlie purpose of assuring the people of England that webelieve in the virtue of our soldiers. We know it is quite unnecessary that we should assure the people of Australia that we believe in the merits, the valour, the honesty, and the humanity of our soldiers. Buti t is to tell the outside world that we repudiate the charges which have been made against the soldiers of the Empire, including the soldiers of Australia:. that we, who are on the spot, knowing exactly what they have doneand have not done, repudiate theseassertions with the scorn which-they deserve.. The second motion is simply an expression of opinion on the part of the House-and ' not on the part of an honourable member individually-that Australia is willing to help the mother countrywhenever she may require help. I find fault with the motion because of the use of the word "" requisite,"" for I consider the whole virtue of any offers of troops lies in their spontaneity. In all these cases these offers should have been' -made without calling upon Great Britain to anounce to the world that she required assistauce from us or any one else: The honourable member in the course of his very capable speech-althoug h I am bound to say that it is one of the oddest deliverances that I haveever heard from a man who has studied logic,who has a knowledge of the methods of reasoning from the particular to the general-cause d me much surprise by the conclusions expressed by him.

We have learned during the debate that he is a member of a Peace -Society. NowI can well understand why he should have an insuperable objection in his mind to war of any kind When we couple that knowledge with the fact that he has actually suggested arbitrat i o n between the Boers and Great Britain as -an alternative, it shows that upon this subject he must have a distinct kink in his mind. The honourable and. learned member has ..informed us that he told his constituents what he has repeated to this House, and of -course that promise binds him. The Prime Minister told the honourable member for Kennedy a few weeks ago that he would -not despatch a contingent without consulting Parliament, and, in doing so, bound his hands to a great extent. If the Prime Minister had not done that, I should have expected the Government to have sent troops to South Africa long ago, instead ot fumbling over the matter as they have done, in order that they might meet Parliament, and ascertain how honourable members feel upon the question. The honourable and learned member has made an unconditional and unreserved promise to his constituents that he will not be a party to the sending away of a contingent, and now, although the mother country has asked Australia to send 1,000 soldiers to South Africa, the honourable and learned member has to tell us that he cannot be a party to to the motion now before the House. But he would be no party to that does not bind us; for we have made contingents. no such rash promise. are not speaking of to make that promise. and learned member has not a monopoly of courage in this House, though he may have a large amount of it . tieats my action as though I intended to vote against my convictions. the man who rushes to a conclusion who is the bravest or the most courageous. Judgment is tlie better part of valour; and he would have been wiser if he had told his constitutents that he reserved to himself the right to approve or disapprove of the sending of a contingent to South Africa, I do not find according to the circumstances which might arise. We are asked to guide ourselves to some, extent by the action of the honourable and learned member, although he has admitted that he is not a free agent in dealing with the question, no matter what might happen in the meantime. His speech, it seems to me, was a tirade against war of every kind, and he made the extraordinary proposition that, instead of going to war, we should have gone to arbitration with the Boers, and that arbitration should have been resorted to even after the war had been commenced. The honourable and learned member knows as well as I do that all modes of settling disputes are utterly useless, unless there is a force behind them by which you can guarantee the decisions of the arbitrators being observed.

355,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I amof the Executive of a young Commonwealth whose reputation has yet to be won by the grit and character displayed by her public men. I think the Prime Minister ancl the Cabinet ought to have instinctively judged of what was passing in tlie minds of the English people at the beginning of the continental cavillings, and that they would have met with the approval of the whole of the people of Australia if they had spontaneously offered to send further troops to the assistance of the Empire in South Africa. After the first contingent had left Australia, the time for hesitation in answering tlie implied or expressed desire of Great .Britain for assistance was past. By refusing to give further assistance when it is expected we practically cancel the good effect of that which was given in the first instance. WhilstI differ from the views which have been expressed by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I cannot but admire the consistency which he has displayed. We cannot accuse the honourable member of any hesitation or vacillation. He took his stand at tlie beginning, and in face of possible defeat at the federal elections, he stuck to his guns. But I should like to repty to an interjection which he made some little time ago when he asked where was the evidence of the Boer precipitation of the war. evidence that the Boers had prepared for war before 1S95 and 1896. and learned member will allow me to read him a quotation. It happens to be from an Irish writer, but not from one of the class to which he has referred. I do not think the honourable and learned member, in speaking of one section of the Irish people, was intentionally unjust to tlie others, but in justice to the honourable and learned member himself, I should like to put some qualification upon his remarks when he pointed to the exceptional loyalty of those who constituted the stock from which he is descended. By implication, of course, every one who makes such a comparison impugns' the loyaltyI hate the word "" loyalty,"" because I think it is too often abused-impugn s the sense of public duty of the rest of the Irish. I do not think the honourable and learned member intentionally cast any imputation upon the loyalty of the Catholics of Ireland, but his words were susceptible of that interpretation. I remember, in connection with one of the great turning movements on the Tugela, when Buller had to return for tlie third time, he selected General Hart and the Irish brigade to take the place of honour, to act as the pivot on which the whole movement of the army should turn. When I remember also on how many wellfought fields, from Tugela to Pieter's Kop, loyalty to the Empire was displayedwhen I remember that the Catholic Inniskillens at Pieter's Kop went 650 strong into action, and that the 40 left at the end towards sundown were guilty of an act of disobedience in refusing to obey the bugle which called on the remnant to retireI am sorry that the honourable and learned member was, at least, not a little more careful when he-unintentionally , no doubt-cas t a slight on, to use his own terms, "" the loyalty of the Catholic Irish.""

Fitzpatrick, in his book The Transvaal from Within, saysIt is sufficient to show that the aim of the Transvaal has been to subvert the Imperial authority and expel the Imperial power, and that the sympathetic attitude of the Afrikander Bond, however human it may be, has been used to draw British subjects into a dangerous course, aud has led them to coquet with an ambition which the British half of the population and the British Empire will resist at all costs.

What does President Kruger say? The Bloemfontein Express reports a speech delivered by President Krugeri n 1887, as follows:I think it too soon to speak of a united South Imperial Government is engaged in war, Africa under one flag. Which flag is it to be ? and when Continental cavilling challenges The Queen of England would object to having her flag hauled down, and we, the burghers of our affection for the mother country, we the Transvaal, object to hauling down ours.

The war now going on impels me to render the assistance asked for by the Imperial power. I do not do so from motives Mr Fitzpatrick of Australian self-interest, and I am sorry that the Prime Minister, even for a moment, referred to the operation of such a motive in this Parliament on a question of the sort. I would rather put it that, from I cannot give the year motives of . gratitude, I support the motion. What is the position ? In 1891there was an expenditure of £14,000,000 on the British navy, while the expenditure last year was President £32,000,000. How much did the British possessions-India, all the colonies, the Dominion of Canada, and the Commonwealth of contribute towards that words the contribution of the whole of the not a sixtieth of the total naval expenditure. I do not care when it If our contribution were levied in proporDo honourable members not see that we are for ? In the export and import trade of Great Britain, the share of the colonies and possessions is about one-fourth; but, besides, there is a trade of about £300,000,000 between British possessions that never touches the United Kingdom, but which enjoys the protection of the British flag. The expenditure of £32,000,000 a year means taxation, levied on whom ? On the working classes of England, who are less able than we are to bear taxation per head.

I agree with the honourable member for Bland that we ought not to be too particular or too squeamish in regard to the criticisms of the Continental press. The press of England is to some extent responsible for the alienation of German feeling.

If the honourable and learned member thinks that the mere mention of our readiness to send the contingent if asked for would be sure to evoke a request for one, then I cannot be charged with the very thing which other honourable members are laying at my door. In this connection I have only to say that it was right, advisable, and necessary for any one at the head of affairs in this country, to lay down distinctly that the Government were perfectly ready to show their loyalty whenever the occasion for it arose. The only difference between tlie Government and certain honourable members is that, looking contingents had been asked for, we took the view that the Imperial Government which saw no humiliation in making such a request as there was no humiliation in it-and which had evinced its readiness to disclose any of its requirements in that direction, would take the same course in regard to the Commonwealth that it had taken in regard to the individual States. We are told that the cry has been raised in England-""What will the colonies say if we do not annex the Transvaal"" 1 But, assuming that that cry has been raised, is it not a true interpretation of the feeling of the whole Commonwealth 1 true interpretation of the feeling of an enormous majority of the people of the Commonwealth. The entire Commonwealth, with very few exceptions indeed, speedily became convinced that this war was undertaken as a means of ousting England from her possessions in South Africa-in which we are interested as members of the Empire-and with a view of setting up a South African Republic which would include Cape Colony and Natal. Is there not some warrant for saying this. think I can find some in a passage which I quoted in a speech made on the first despatch of a contingent from New South Wales. It is from Sir Alfred Milner, now Lord Milner, a gentleman who has been made the subject of many attacks, but who, so far as I can see, as a fairly steady reader and observer of these matters, has distinguished himself as a great servant of the Crown and people. facts out of the ultimatum. in a despatch before the outbreak of the war Imperial Government published in the Blue Book which has been referred to. He saidA certain section of tlie press not in the Transvaal onlyAnd also in Cape Colonypreaches openly and constantly the doctrine of a Republic embracing all South Africa, and Supports it by menacing references to the armal ments of the Transvaal, its alliance with the Orange Free State, and the active sympathy at the fact that previous which, in case of war, it would receive from a section of Her Majesfc3''s subjects. the war 1 despatch proceedsI regret to say that this doctrine, supported as it is by a ceaseless stream of malignant lies about the intentions of the British Governmentwhich were supported from the same quarters as the stop-the-war policy is supported from nowis producing a great effect.

Language is frequently used which seemsfcoimply that the Dutch have some superior right, even in this colony, to their fellow-citizens of British birth. Thousands of men peaceably disposed, and, if left alone, perfectly satisfied with their position as British subjects, are being drawn into disaffection, and there is a corresponding exasperation on the side of the British. I can see nothing which will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda, but some striking proof of the intention of Her Majesty's Government not to be ousted from its position in South Africa.",71,Honourable Members Hear Hear

He went to meet Kruger, and he found that there was one power ready to come to a reasonable arrangement and the other not ready to come to any except a mockery. I do not wish to go into these matters further, except to come tp this point, that a cry has been raised in England"" What will the colonies say if you do not annex?"" Hasi t not been shown from facts of that kind, and those facts were deduced from the utterances of the proBoer press, that owing to statements of this kind a spirit of disaffection was being created, not in the two territories now conquered or partly conquered, but in the territories in the possession of Great Britain herself in South Africa? If that was so, is there not truth and justice in the remark of the leader of the Opposition tliat it is necessary to take steps that will prevent the recurrence of such a war as this ? And what steps can prevent the recurrence of such a war as this after the treatment Britain received in South Africa even long before the war ? What step except annexation can be taken to prevent the recurrence of such a war ? "" What will the colonies say if you do not annex ?"" Buti t must be remembered that the colonies do not run ahead of the the British Empire in this matter. They say "" annex"" only because they know that annexation is the only cure, and that good and able management under a just and wise British Government will be better for the Boers just as it has been good for us. for them. good enough for us is good enough for them.

But that this must take place under the British Crown, I venture to submit to this House that events haveamply, reiteratedly, and loudly proved. Then we are told that the greatest barrackers of the war are the wealthiest classes, whose pockets do not suffer. I think that members of this House might pay some attention to the history of the matter, which shows that the readiness to take part in the defence of the Empire existed not merely in all parts of the Empire here, in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, but that it existed with a total disregard to wealth or position on the part of the citizens of the EmpireThai disregard was shown in every way, and men of enormous fortunes, and men of noble birth, vied with the humblest and the poorest patriot, and flocked to South Africa to defend the British Empire, for it was nothing else but such a defence. priated shire councils' funds for the purpose. may have appropriated what they pleased, but what I submit is that the honorable and learned member casts a slur, if he will permit me to say so-and I know ouvrelations of friendship will not be weakened' by anything I say to-night-h e casts a slurupon that great, noble, and generous in clination displayed by all classes for the defence of the Empire, and which was shown in the most crowded as well as ir>i the most sparsely settled portions of it . trouble before the war ? ning of the war that most of that wonderful outpouring took place.

It had an insufficiency of troops engaged, and that is why the levies fronr Ganada and Australia were' somuch appreciated at the time. A t that time the arms of the Empire were suffering reverses, which arose from the fact of its unpreparedness, which again aroseframthe fact of its hating to entertain tlie idea of war with the republics, unless it was forced into it. That was the position, and it was in that position that this great outpouring of blood of high and low, noble and humble took place. I say that it was the most creditable fact that has ever come out in the history of this Empire, that there was no stint in this matter, neither was there any obsei-vance of rank, or degree, or money. We 'a)re asked to steady ourselves for a time, 'and ask what are we losing in Asia. I am not quite sure about it, but it may perhaps be true that the Empire will not be able to negotiate in Asia with so much success while the Boer war drags on, but it would never have dragged on for so long if it had not been for pro-Boer speeches and pro-Boer papers bribed with gold. It is true that this war has been unduly prolonged, but it has been by means of this kind, infernal in some quarters, and misguided in others. gentleman think that the Boers in the hills will get the Eederal Hansard. Boers will get the Eederal Hansard, and I .am not at all apprehensive tliat my honourable and learned friend's speech is gbing to prolong the war If that is what the honourable and learned member means, I think we shall be quite safe in that regard, but it is speeches of that character made in otherplaces, which have prolonged the war. 'It/ is the assertion of doctrines of this kind, which-are not fair doctrines when our country is engaged in -war, which have led to the prolongation of the war.

Until we come to it we must act as one Empire, and that is what we propose to do. I have been charged with having usurped, power on behalf of the Government.

That is the course we have taken. I am told that I have-said that I would not allow recruiting in Australia. WhatI said was that I Would -not-accede-to it unless under the Authority of the Commonwealth, because the defences of Australia -having passed to us, it was for -the Commonwealth to decide whether recruiting should take place here or not.
