The"" ancient and fish-like smell"" surrounding the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills still lingers in my nostrils, and increases the doubts I entertain as to whether the Government have a real and earnest desire to insure the success of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. In deciding to retain the fleet, the Government aro merely carrying out the mandate of the people at the last elections. dispose of the Line because they realize the public wrath which would arise from the adoption of such a course. They have, further, to conciliate the dangerous political Cerberus who sits in the corner opposite-T refer to the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( MrW . M .

We all know that the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney still has designs upon the Treasury bench, and we are led to believe that there are a few honourable members on the opposite side who were excluded from the present Goverument ready to support him. why the Prime Minister trembles when the right honourable member for North Sydney, like a pirate of old, brandishes his political cutlass, as he does from time to time. I have no political sympathy with either tlie right honourable member I express my intention to for North Sydney, the present Government, or any alternative to the present Government other than a straight-out Labour Government. But I feel justified in commenting thus upon this political *> conglomeration opposite which, composed 'of opposing elements, cannot afford the people of Australia any promise of stahk government. orable member will not find that ^conglomeration mentioned in the B ill . am merely expressing my political distrust of the Government in connection with this measure. The Government have done no more than they should have done in writin g off the losses and redueing the valuation of the fleet. In that they have only carried out their national duty. I am most concerned, not w i th what the B ill actually contains, but with what has been left out of it . There are some provisions of the B ill that are calculated to paralyze the Line. It is i a that which has 'been lef t out of the B ill that we shall find the ""nigger i a the wood pile."" In writing down the valuation of the fleet, the Government have merely copied the example of every other country in the world. The United States of America, as has been mentioned The Government are afraid to during the debate, was compelled to reduce the valuation of her fleet, and we know that many private ship-owners went bankrupt during and after the war, or were compelled to greatly reduce their nominal capital because of the dislocation of trade throughout the world since the close of tire war. I am not prepared to j o in in the psean of praise that has been raised to the ex-Prime Minister( MrW M . Hughes) for having established the fleet. The right honourable gentleman acted in a national emergency. H a d he not done what he did, Australia's trade would have been disorganized.

It seems to me, particularly after The honourable listening the other day to the honourable member for Riverina( MrK ill e n ) I am sorry he is not here, because I would prefer to say what I want to say in his presence-that the political attitude of some members of the Country party is best described in the words of Canning' Steady patriots of the world alone True friends of every country, but their own. Wheni t comes to the development of Australian trade, and the building up of the great industries of this country, certain honourable members of the CountryI again remind .the party cannot see beyond a cowshed or a barnyard.

Their .attitude is at complete variance w it h the principles they have been sent here to enunciate. I appeal once again to the Government to grant a subsidy to the Commonwealth Line, in order that it may have an opportunity of developing and expanding its operations. Certain honourable members have referred to the loss sustained by the Line during the last two or three years.

8,Mr Coleman,"I have every respect( MrW . M . Hughes) remarking of some political opponents that, in the language f the Scriptures, they strain at the gnat and swallow the camel. I suggest that this might be said of those honourable gentlemen who now criticise the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The retention of the Line is absolutely essential as part pf our defence scheme. I have already referred to the number of seamen who went to the war. If we had not had an Australian mercantile marine, those men would not have been available to carry our troops overseas, and thus meet a national emergency. About 1,500 seamen are directly concerned in the retention of the Line, and there are also about 5,000 mechanics and shipbuilders and others who responded the war to the calls made upon them. W it h their dependants, the total is about 15,000. I say, therefore, that it is a very serious matter to bring forward any proposal that is likely to hamper or restrict the development of the Line. If the Grovernment w ill not subsidize the Line, they should, at least, insure continuity in its shipbuilding programme. I understand they have placed another ship on the stocks at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. If , when that ship is built, work then ceases, hundreds of -killed workmen will be thrown upon the labour market. worthy of its salt has recognised the importance of having shipbuilders and trained mechanics available national emergency. sacrifice any scheme that made this possible merely to get cheap ships. It is preferable for Australia to build her own ships, even if tbey cost a little more, than.to go overseas for them. A t the present time, Great Britain is paying out millions of pounds to her starving unemployed because of the dislocation of trade arising from what may be called the rotten economic fabric of Free Trade, upon which the economic policy of England is based. I hope this Parliament will always recognise that practical patriotism is best shown by the adoption of a policy which makes for the development of onr own industries. Some reference has been made to the condition of the American marine. ehips, and, therefore, have had an opMr Ooleman. portunity of comparing tlieir efficiency w i th our own. The Americans are not a maritime nation, and never w ill be. The American position in regard to shipping enterprise is totally different from our own. America is well supplied with shipping lines. A constant freight war is being waged across the Atlantic by French, Belgian, British, German, and Scandinavian shipping companies and ships of other nations. America has nothing to fear. The markets of Europe are as close to America as those of New Zealand are to Australia; they can be reached in four and a-half days by the fastest steamers. On the other hand we in Australia are completely isolated from the rest of the world, nobly during excepting, of course, the East. We are at the mercy of shipping combines, which would squeeze the lif e blood out of our trade if we were not afforded some protection by our own steamers. Some honourable members who have attacked the Line forget that but for its existence freights would be much higher than they qre to-day. An honourable member struck the nail on the head the other night when he said that instead of subsidizing the meat industry we should subsidize the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. He said that if we, as a people, vvere obliged to incur a loss, we should do it in trying to place Australia's produce Every nation on the world's markets at a price at which it would have a fair opportunity to compete with that of other countries. The for a Government propose to subsidize a shipNo nation would ping line to the East, but that is only playing with the question. We must open up markets in other countries besides China and Japan, ancl we can hope to do so only by providing an adequate, efficient, ancl regular shipping service controlled by ourselves. TheB ill does not provide for the establishment of the head oflice of the Linei n Australia. As an honourable member of the Opposition has already pointed out, the detachment of the management from the sphere in which the Line is actively engaged-her e in Australia-ha s been responsible for about 80 per cent, of the trouble among the ships' crews. W it h the head office in London there has been no one in Australia directly answerable for mercantile an interpretation of the policy of the I have travelled in American Line or the decisions of its management. In this regard I speak with a certain amount of experience. elected to this HonseI had, as secretary of the Clerks Union, difficulty in getting the Commonwealth Line of Steamers to carry out certain awards. all kinds of irritatin g delays. utterly impossible to get satisfactory results from the operation of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers unless tactful management and sympathetic control are displayed, and by having the responsible head located in Australia. No body of men can he more easily handled than seamen if they are treated w i th sympathy ancl tact. The'Government would be well advised to provide in the B ill for the employees to be represented on the Board. The shipping industry depends upon the loyal co-operation of employees to a greater extent than does any other industry. Seamen are detached when at sea from the close personal supervision of the management, and unless they have that sense of responsibility which would be given to them by representation on the Board of control, they cannot be expected to have a proper realization of the difficulties of the management or to give that loyal co-operation which is esseutial if the Line is to be operated successfully. Many business firms have granted their employees the right to share in the responsibilities of management, and my inquiries have led me to believe that the arrangement has worked satisfactorily. I hope that the Government will place on the Board a man. with wide shipping experience whose interests are divorced from those of any privately-controlled shipping line. I should also like to see on the Board a shipbuilding expert, a representative of the employees, a business man, and a representative of the primary producers. As the primary producers are bound to reap direct benefit from these steamers, it is only f a ir to give them representation on the Board. I have said some unkind things about the Government, but I at least congratulate them on retaining the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. their political misdeeds, I would not have been surprised if they had slung the Line on the scrap-heap. Prime Minister has not convinced me that his intentions are really well disposed towards the Line. BeforeI was would lead one to expect nothing from him but good. Byron describes one of his characters-^He was the mildest mannered marr There were That ever scuttled ship or cut a throatI t w ill be which shows that one cannot rely on manners alone. In conclusion, I hope that the Government will grant the employees representation on the Board, that they will establish its head office in Australia, and that they will give the Line a subsidy that will enable it so to extend its operations that Australia may reap a rich reward in increased trade and enhanced national prestige. glad that there was no cutting of throats or scuttling of ships before the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) was in a position to tell us how we could build ships, no matter what they-cost; run them under all sorts of conditions, no matter how high the expense might be, and yet be able to place our products profitably on the mai-kets of the world. It is very nice to hear such statements, but I am afraid the honourable member had only one section of the people in his mind when he was speaking. There are other and more important sections to be considered . I am strongly in favour of one or two of the suggestions made by the honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley). He said, first of all, that we should provide in the B ill for the registration .of the Boardi n Australia. We have had the promise that this will be done, but I think that we should insist on it . I want it done for one very special purpose. If we are to continue this Line of Steamersand I am opposed to it I want' it to work under the conditions under which private shipping companies have to work, and' it should certainly be compelled to observe the provisions of the Navigation Act.

The expenses connected with shipping have been so great that the British shipowner has been' compelled to increase his charges. British shipping works are totally different from those which govern our Line, which has to observe the provisions of the Navigation Act and our Arbitration laws; consequently the cost of running our ships must be considerably greater. MrE . RILEY -The honourable member would surely not advocate reverting to the conditions under which British seamen work ? agree to sell these ships. In Committee, I intend to move that the Board be given power to sell the ships. If we found that we were being exploited, we could give a subsidy to any. company which would provide shipping space under conditions which we would specify.

In the following year, the receipts were £2,274,203, while the expenditure, again without allowing for interest or depreciation, was £2,795,241.

I belong to the class of person referred to by the honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes), who want to keep the Government as f a r away as possible from commercial undertakings. I believe such ventures w ill , under Government control, always end in disaster. . The Prime Minister has treated the last Administration generously. Although he would prefer the Government not to carry on the shipping business, he has done his best, in drafting the B ill , and by should receive the benefit of the mail writing down the value of the ships, subsidies which are at present paid to the to give the Line every reasonable Combines. I disapprove of the clause chance of success. If Parliament decides to have the Line, it should give it every possible support. I intend, when thc B ill is in Committee, whether I get any support or not, to move an amendment giving the Board power to sell the ships at the most favorable opportunity. Like many other honourable members, I am pleased to think that an attempt is being made to put the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line on what we are told, is a "" business basis."" I hope it is. But I disapprove of some of the provisions of the B ill . In the first place, I take exception to the establishment of the Line. I do this, not from any meanness of spirit, but The Commonbecause a principle is involved.' The Prime Minister said that it was a stroke of genius on the part of f h e ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) to establish the Line. When, the Line was established, however, Mr Hughes was Labour Prime Minister, and he was giving effect to Labour principles. H a d he been a Nationalist Prime Minister he would not have been able to institute the I do not know what Line. I agree that employees should have a voice in the management of the Line, which, as it is not r u n to make profits, ought nob to score at the expense the honourable of the men who work on the ships. No Government undertaking can be a success unless the employees are given a voice in its management. That principle is being recognised by many of the great captains of in Australian shipping companies dustry in all countries where mass production is undertaken, and the reasons are ten times as strong why it should be recognised by an undertaking which is r u n by the people of a country. The men . employed by the Commonwealth Line are part owners of it . The adoption of this proposal would prevent a repetition of many of the industrial troubles that have hampered the industry in the past. A small misunderstanding sometimes grows to a bitter quarrel because pin-pricks, which occur in all industries, are not considered from the point of view of the men who do the work.

Board power, with the consent of the Treasurer, to dispose of the whole business. I would not object to the Board having that power, subject to the approval of the House. The ex-PrimeM in ister has said that the value of the ships should not be written down to the extent proposed by the Government, and the Government has convinced the country and the House that it is opposed to Government interference with private enterprise. Therefore, I believe there is a danger that the Government's shipping business may be sold at a price equivalent to its written down value. If the Government will agree to substitute "" Parliament "" for "" The Treasurer,"" the clause will be sufficiently safeguarded, for if it is then proposed to sell the Line, the Government will have to justify its proposal to the House. possible to repeat the scandal of the fects than the understanding among woollen mills. is that danger, which is emphasized, by the to meet the most determined and elabospeech of the right honourable member for rate attempts of a powerful combine to North Sydney( MrW .

The one consideration that determines my attitude towards any measure is my belief or otherwise in its efficacy as an instrument for the public good; I have simply to ask myself whether a measure will or w ill not work in the interests of the general community. As to private enterprise as opposed to State control, I laid down a general principle when addressing the electors. I believe the Government should not enter upon any industrial undertaking that can a t least be equally well conducted by private enterprise. If the Government proposes to enter upon an industrial venture, the onus of proof lies on it to show that, in the interests of the community , it can conduct it better than could .any private individual or company. I have said that I am somewhat -exercised in mind as to my attitude towards the measure. 1921, when the whole question of shipping was under discussion here, the ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) made a statement about Government shipbuilding and the running of the Government Line. The present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) followed with a speech in which he caref u l l y examined' the whole shipping position. He dealt w it h the subject of shipbuilding, .and, having done so, he said that the Government ought to give up any control that it then exercised in that connection. He then dealt exhaustively with the advisability or otherwise of continuing the Commonwealth Line, reasons, that appeared to me to be unanswerable, why the Government should discontinue the business. The PrimeM i nister, in the same speech, pointed out that the one object that the Government was . to the British Shipping Combine and reduce freights. Por' reasons that he then set out at length, he expressed the opinion that it is impossible for a Government Line to achieve that end, and that, therefore, he could not vote for the continuance of the Line. He added that for some years to come the Commonwealth Line of shipping must be r u n at a loss. I listened most carefully to that speech, which convinced me that the Government should give up this enterprise. MrE . RILEY Y o u were not hard to 'convince I not, but the reasons given by the Prime Minister then seemed sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the Government could not achieve the end it had in view, namely, to compete with the Combine, and, in the interests of Australia, reduce freights. Now the Prime Minister submits a B ill , the object of which is to provide for a continuance of the Line. In introducing the measure he expressed the hope that in the future the Line would accumulate profits out of which it would be able to provide its own working capital. I think, however, that'the Prime Minister must find it rather difficult to hope for any such result, in view of the fact that in 1921 he predicted that the Line, if continued, -must be run at a loss, and that the other day. he told us that the loss the Line had sustained during the last two years represented something like In November, £2,600,000. If I felt that the Government Line would be able to compete successfully with the CombineI would vote for it every time. I believe, with the honci-able member for North Sydney, that the object of continuing the Line is competition with the Combine. The right honourable member desires to insure competition. pointing out that, not only the right honourable member for North Sydney to-da.y, but also the Prime Minister in introducing the B ill , insisted that, if the Line is continued, it must be on 'business prin and gave ciples. This means that the Line must enter into legitimate competition with any other shipping that is ru n on ordinary business principles, and that, if the Commonwealth Line cannot do this, it must "" g o to the wall."" If it be found had in creating the Line impossible to compete oh business lines, checkmate the tactics of then the question may arise whether, in the interests of the Commonwealth, we should subsidize the enterprise. A t present, however, I am asked to vote for a measure to provide for the continuance of the Commonwealth Line on strictly business principles. It seems to me that the B ill does not raise the real issue. Does any honourable member imagine that, having regard to the conditions i m posed on this Line, it is possible to r u n it on business principles?

We are discussing the provisions of the B ill from a practical point of view. isolated position, and our primary products have to be carried to the ends of the earth.

In 'South Australia, a Board administered the Wheat Poolf o r some time, but at an inquiry it was shown that the personnel of the Board was not in sympathy with the principle of Government Pools. This may be the motive actuating the Government in the appointment of a Board of Control for the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The 'personnel of the proposed Board should comprise not only practical men, who would be paid adequately for their services, hut also persons sympathetic with the principle underlying the establishment of the Commonwealth Shipping Line; if not, then my fears w ill he well founded that the Government intend to abolish the Line by indirect action. has stated for the disposal of unsuitable tonnage. at present deemed unsuitable might assist materially in the development of Ausbralia, and before it is disposed of the Government should consider whether it could not be used for coastal trade, especially in those places where development is languishing for want of proper transport facilities. The Prime Minister on^many occasions has made special reference to the necessity for the development of Australia. Beyond these utterances nothing has been accomplished. Only the other day, the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe), when referring to the necessity for adequate shipping communication between the mainland and Tasmania, stated thab the shipping lines trading to the Pacific Islands had been subsidized to the extent of £55,000 per annum. Railways are being constructed as developmental works, and very seldom is the question raised whether they w ill pay or not. This aspect should be considered in the disposal of unsuitable tonnage. An honourable member, a few days ago, stressed the necessity for Various parts of South Australia are dependent on coastal shipping lines for the marketing of their goods. people of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, rely wholly upon one shipping company; there is no railway connection. It is true that the East-West railway crosses the top of the peninsula, but that area is practically uninhabited. Settlement has taken place south of the East-West line, and there is no railway connection with the mainland. The peninsula is not a wilderness, but is composed, mostly, of good, arable, wheat growing land. The settlers there have to contend with very many difficulties, for many of which this Parliament, having no jurisdiction, cannot provide a remedy. The area of Eyre Peninsula is as greab as half, that of Victoria. There are few facilities, such as water conservation and reticulation. The bone of contention is that one private shipping line has the monopoly of carriage of goods to and from the peninsula. Some years ago, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company had opposition. The rival The Prime Minister companies cut their freights to squeeze that the B ill provides their rival out of the trade. Freights and fares were reduced to a ridicuA good deal of the tonnage 'lous extent. I have heard that it was possible, if one went the right way about it , to obtain a free passage. Eventually one company sold out to the other, and at present the Adelaide Steam-ship Company alone trades to Eyre Peninsula. They charge what freights and fares they wish, and the people are at their tender mercies. According to the S u n Pictorial of 9 th July, the Prime Minister, when speaking recently on immigration, statedTheir theories were based on wrong conclusions. They wanted to hold a country larger than the United States of America with a population of a little over 5,000,000 people. We have dispossessed the aboriginals of Australia because they had failed to develop Australia. What are we going to say in the future if we are not prepared to develop it? Eyre Peninsula could he properly developed if the Governments concerned were alive to their responsibilities. The Commonwealth Shipping Line sliould not be r u n merely for profit, but also to develop the .potential resources of Australia-the principle on which' railway lines of development are constructed. oversea markets. The people of Eyre Peninsula are paying the same rates and taxes as are other people, and from the revenue from these The the loss on the ""Commonwealth Shipping Line, the transcontinental railway, and other railways has to be met. They should, therefore, be given the advantage of those services to enable them to transport their produce to the other side of Spencer's Gulf. We should, at least, attempt to make their conditions such as iwould enable them to -enjoy the same privileges as other people living nearer the metropolitan area enjoy, and thus protect them from the excessive and unwarranted charges that are made A portion of the profits made by the shipping company trading to that paTt of the coast should be going into the pockets of the primary producers on Eyre's Peninsula, as settlers there and in other parts of South Australia are being exploited by the shipping companies. Commonwealth Line entered into competition with those of private companies it would compel them to reduce their freights. Tihe continuance of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers depends largely upon the personnel of the proposed Board, and 'before any vessels are disposed of ' an effort should be made to see if some could be utilized in the coastal trade, and thus assist those who are at present seriously inconvenienced for the want of shipping facilities. which I represent are severely handicapped, and I trust their interests w ill be considered now that the whole question of shipping facilities is under consideration. I desire to congratulate the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) upon, the very concise balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Shipping Line which he has submitted to Parliament, which shows the public the actual' position of the Line. the difficulties of the Government, particularly in view of the statement made by. the Prime Minister that, although the Geelong Woollen Mills had experienced good times, the undertaking was likely to be faced w i th difficulties, and that the -best thing the Government could do was quite in accord w it h the Prime Minister's contention, and same can be said concerning the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Splendid work was done by the Commonwealth vessels while the war was in progress, but that has now passed, and Government vessels are in competition with those of other shipping lines. Under present conditions in Australia, the Commonwealth Line will never be a paying proposition. Although we have been informed that the value of the ships has been written down to such an extent that the Commonwealth has lost millions of pounds, honourable members opposite are now suggesting the by the shipping company. payment of a subsidy, which proves that the venture is always likely to be unprofitable. W h y should we continue losing money? The establishment of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers and the passing of the Navigation Act have been the means of preventing competition in the Australian shipping trade, and there If some of the vessels of the are Australian companies operating in the overseas and Inter-State trade which place shippers in the position of having either to accept the rates demanded or to decline to ship their produce. I cannot see any possibility of the provisions of the Navigation Act being materially amended whilst the Common"" wealth Line is in existence. From 1910 to 1914 apples were shipped from Tasmania at 2s. 7d. per case, and even in 1916, when shipping was particularly scarce, and the war at its worse stage, the freight was only 3s. 6d. per case. A t The settlers in the district present the freight on apples is 4s. on all Commonwealth vessels, and on those of the Conference Line 4s. 6d. per case. Apples have been shipped from Tasmania by a Conference Line vessel at Is. 8Jd. per case, which is the cheapest freight ever paid. labour. manned by white labour.

M . Hughes) stated that tlie vessels of the "" D "" and "" E "" class, and some cruisers and other war vessels had been constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard; but we have to remember that it took four and a half years, and involved an expenditure of over £1,000,000 to build i u Australia a vessel which could have -been constructed in Englandi n one year for £300,000. That is paying dearly for encouraging Australian sentiment. When the ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) was in Tasmania, he said that up-to-date electrical machinery had been installed at Cockatoo Islandf o r cutting out port holes, but the men declined to handle it , because with it work was done in a much shorter time. We are proud of some of the work performed in Australia by Australian artisans; but it is impossible for Australia to progress if unnecessarily high rates have to be paid. The right honourable member for North Sydney ,( MrW . M . Hughes) said that the vessels of the Commonwealth Line had been written down in 1921 by 10-per cent., and, although that may have been justified, a slump has since occurred and lower prices have now to be accepted. As the Government favour a continuance of the Line, under a Board of Control, highly competent men, should be appointed. I am, however, of the same opinion as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), who stated that the undertaking must be conducted as a business proposition, and if that cannot be done, it is time the Government went out of the business.

AKIN rising tocontribute to this debate is to they should be manly enough to say so. give credit to those who, during the last Those honourable members have gone just five years, have been responsible for the administration of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. I desire also to refer to the anti-Australian spirit that has prompted the utterances of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook). I do not think it would be possible for any honourable member to give expression to more reactionary "" views. His .speech The right honourable only justifies the opinion that I hold concerning many individuals who prate about their loyalty to Australia, and their patriotism. It shows clearly that those people are no more patriotic or loyal than it pays them to be. Such views as those propounded by the honourable member ill become the representative of a constituency in such an isolated part of the Commonwealth as. Tasmania, which needs all the protection that the Commonwealth Line is able to afford it . Happily the remarks of the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe) stand in striking contrast. He contended that it was necessary for Tasmania to receive every consideration at the hands of the Government in the matter of shipping facilities. that there should be an honourable member holding such unsound views as those of the honourable member for Franklin, and it is surprising that his electorate returned . him. There are other political Jeremiahs among us. We have listened to speeches from the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), who said sufficient to make it clear that they were not particularly anxious for Australians employed in the shipping industry to have the working conditions that they now enjoy if it meant extra cost to them or to the Commonwealth. The Labour party prides itself on the splendid provisions of the Navigation Act. We are glad that Australia is able to give the lead to other parts of the world in regard to the conditions governing employment in the mercantile marine. The improved conditions benefit not only those who "" go down to the sea in ships,"" but afford added security to the passengers. call attention to the If the honourable members for Swan and [Quorum formedJ] Fawkner desire to whittle away the safeM y main purpose in guards contained in the Navigation Act",39,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever

56,Mr Makin,"Yes . It is unfortunatefar enough, to indicate that the underlying reason for their objection to the Commonwealtli Line is the favorable conditions under which the seamen are engaged. Labour members are determined, if possible, not only to retain the advantages gained, but also to improve upou them. There is certainly room for improvement in the Navigation Act, and no doubt we shall be able to suggest amendments the adoption of which would provide a greater measure of justice to. the employees, and enhance the prestige of Australia. As this continent is many thousands of miles from the markets of the world, we are entirely dependent upon shipping services. If we were placed at the mercy of the Inchcape combination we should be compelled to pay it greater tribute than the cost of the provision of improved conditions for the seamen. During 1920, the Inchcape Combinei n creased its freights in every shipping service except that to Australia. We know perfectly well thab ib was bhe exisbence of the Commonwealth Line thab saved Ausbralia, as a whole, and the primary producers in particular, from the clubches of bhe Combine. Ib is beyond my comprehension that honourable members opposite, who represent primary producers, should express a wish for the discontinuance of such a beneficial Government enterprise as the Commonwealth Shipping Line, which has done a great deal in the interests of ""the primary producers in the last five or six years. I was much impressed by a statement made by the ex-Minister for Defence( Mr Massy Greene), when he occupied the position of Minisber for Trade and Customs. In introducing the Tariff he_paid a distinct compliment to the Commonwealth Line for having come to the rescue of the primary producers at a moment when they would otherwise have been completely at bhe mercy of bhe Inchcape combination. That fact has, apparently, been overlooked by honourable members opposite, who represent primary producers. suggest that the Commonwealth Line is cutting rates? from becoming excessive, because in 1920, as I have already indicated, the Combine raised the rates to every port except the ports of Australia. ( Mr Bruce) thought that the honourable member. for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) had gone too far, and he said that the honourable member should recollecb that when the private companies were charging the fruit-growers of Tasmania 5s. a case for the carriage of f r u it bo Greab Bribain, the Commonwealth Line reduced the charge to 4s., which made the Combine cut down its rabe to 4s. 6d. ber thinks that the Commonwealth Shipping Line freighbs were excessive, how can he reconcile the position of the Inchcape combination ? The Commonwealth Line has been subjected to many difficulties largely in consequence of bhe Inchcape Combine, whose ramifications are widespread. It might be of interest to mention a number of them. We see Lord Inchcape's hand in the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Shipping ©ompanies, in the British India Shipping Company, the Australian United Steamship Navigation Company, in the New Zealand iShipping Company, the Federal Line, the Union .Steam-ship Company, Burns, Philp, and Company Limited, the Eastern and Australian Line, in Mann and George (South Africa), Cory, and Company, in the English Coaling Company, Port Said, in coal mines and jute mills in India, in banking in India-the recent purchase of the Bank of Allahabad-in lighterage plants at Colombo, Bombay, and Suez, inMcKinnon& MeKenzie, agents, of In d i a ; in McDonald and H a m i l to n, agents, of Sydney, and also in engineering works and docks. trough. he could make the people of the Commonwealth pay tribute by way of increased freights in respect of the Australian services which he controls, he would he .able to wallow in the trough at our expense.

63,The Prime Minister Mr Gbegoby,"Tel l us how manyperienced in connection with the operation of the Line have been more than counterbalanced by the protection given to Australia. It is unfortunate that a certain number of vessels of the Line should be lying idle in Hobson's Bay and Sydney Harbor, but we should not forget that those steamers are an adequate safeguard to the primary producers of the Oommonwealth against any attempts by the Inchcape combination to unduly raise , commercial men had been sufficiently patriotic to patronize the Commonwealth » would have been in a much more satisfactory position to-day. There has been a systematic boycott of Commonwealth ships. Preference has been given to vessels of the Inchcape combination. I would not be in the least surprised if , as a quid pro quo, the Conference Lines gave a rebate in freight to our commercial houses. But, of course, we know the underlying purpose is to destroy the Commonwealth Line, and later to levy increased freights upon Australian produce. The following statement from a letter written by MrH . B . Larkin, the general manager of the Commonwealth Line, in March of this year, is illuminating: Australians shall not ship.goods in their own ships without being fined by the Combine. This, in effect, was the law laid down by tbe great London Conference of the Shipping Combine which caused me to take counter action that resulted in freights to Australia being appreciably lowered. This significant statement tells of the great forces that were arrayed against the Commonwealth Line, and how they were met. tered in Australia means the circulation of something like £500,000 extra to those who are engaged in working the ships, so it should be our duty to see that the Line which has rendered such valuable service to the Commonwealth is adequately supported. I tur n now to an interesting statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) on 29th November, 1921, when speaking on the Estimatesthat our ships prevented the Conference Lines from increasing the general cargo rates last year, as they had done in other places. This,"" it is claimed', has saved us an increase of 25 per cent is that the Commonwealtli Line has 'benefited An y difficulties exshippers by incorporating the. Commonwealth Sea Carriage of Goods Act provisions in Bills of Lading, and that various lines have followed with a douse tantamount to this. I think the Commonwealth Line can claim to have hud a considerable effect in this direct -tion. The Prime Minister, as a partner in a large wholesale f i r m in Flinders-lane, can, I think, speak with authority on this phase of the Commonwealth Shipping Line's operations. He went on to sayIn tlic third place it is .said to have been of freights. If our advantage to shippers by giving opportunity for shipping from other British ports. Finally it is claimed that the Line has increased the vessels to a greater extent, the Line itself bill of lading valuation .limit. With regard to the last-named point, there is not a shadow of doubt that the Commonwealth Line had a very considerable influence in tliat respect. The Conference Lines were refusing to accept liability for anything over £100 per package; hut they have had to come into line eventually, and increase that amount. It is open to question whether it was the Commonwealth Line which brought that about, or whether it was obvious that the Conference Lines would have to increase the amount owing to the general increase in prices. As a commercial man, the PrimeM in ister has a keen appreciation of the benefits conferred upon Australia by the Commonwealth Line, and it is regrettable that those engaged in commercial pursuits have not given a little more evidence of patriotism by supporting the Commonwealth Line. Lateri n his speech on that, occasion the Prime Minister saidI cannot vote for continuing to carry' on « tlie shipping business, because I do not believe that we can achieve the object which influences members to support it, namely, the curbing of the machinations of the Combine against Australian shippers. I should like to know what caused the The fact that the Line is regisPrime Minister to change his belief in the future of the Line. wisdom, uo doubt. ment, with perhaps a sinister meaning, made by .the righ t honourable member for Worth .Sydney( Mr ""W.

UnlessI receive an assurance from the Prime Minister that there is no desire or intention on his part to carry into effect the hope to which he gave expression in 1921, it will he necessary for me to oppose the appointment of this Board. I am not prepared to allow the Government to make use of the Board which is to ibe appointed, under the provisions of this Bill to wipe out the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. If it is their desire to place this Line in such a position that it can serve Australia to better advantage in the future,'they will receive every support for their proposal, but if , on the contrary, it is their intention to rid the Commonwealth of a service that has been of such great value in affording protection against combinations of overseas shipping companies, it would be more to their credit if they asked the House, straight out, for its endorsement of such a proposal. Past Governments have not given to the Line the consideration it should have been afForded. In 1920, a contract was entered into with the Orient Steam Navigation Company for a four-weekly mail service between Australia and Great Britain, and it involved the annual payment of £130,000 out of the public funds to a private company. Another branch of the Inchcape Combine has been able to secure a subsidy o£ £32,000 a year for a mail service between the mainland and Papua and the Mandated Territories. Mr O'KEEFE -The Commonwealth is paying £53,000 for that service between the mainland and the islands. me by the Prime Minister the other day was £32,000. Mr O'KEEFE A * started since June. practice, or, shall 1 say, the sharp methods employed iby the Government in supplying honourable members with information. When1 asked .a question on the first day of sitting I had a right to learn from responsible Ministers that a new contract was being negotiated with Burns, Philp, and Company for an i ncreased subsidy. Mr O'KEEFE -The £53,000 is for the carriage of mails and cargo. was led to believe. Mr O'KEEFE I was given the information at the Department the other day. cept the honourable member's statement. I do not doubt that what he has suggested has taken place. There are coastal services in which the Commonwealth steamers could 'be employed to advantage. We have vessels lying idle, yet distant parts of the Commonwealth cannot get those satisfactory mail or shipping services which it is their right to expect. I * should like to know whether the Inchcape Combine is not getting in this respect a prior consideration to which it is not entitled. I have already shown its ramifications and how it includes certain well-known companies trading on the Australian coast; and, since we know that the Government are not prepared to assist various primary producers along our coastline to market their produce to the best advantage, I am forced lo the conclusion that it is the desire of Ministers to scientifically sacrifice the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I hope that this is not their intention, and that wider opportunities will be afforded to those administering the affairs of the Line to enable them to tender for the mail services. In deed, they should be given absolute preference,^ not only in the matter of conveying mails from Australia to other parts of the world, but also in maintaining a service between the mainland and Papua and the Mandated Territories. Again, seeing that our steamers are placed at a disadvantage in other parts of the world through not being able to secure cargoes because of a systematic boycott, I think we should be patriotic enough to afford them a preference which would make them profitable and at the new contract has same time put them in a position to render to people in distant parts of Australia It shows the sharp that' service which it should be our earnest desire to afford them. I hope that in Committee we shall so amend the Bill as to safeguard ourselves .against the sale of the Line, 'which I fear may happen, and put the Line on that basis which will give to those who are employed in it the confident belief that they can justify its retention for the purpose, not only of making* profits, but of affording Australia the most efficient and satisfactory shipping service it is possible to obtain.",42,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever

The sooner we cease trading the sooner we shall obtain stability in all enterprises. Different industries are continually coming to the Government for assistance. I protest against that practice being encouraged. I regret that the Government have introduced a measure to give new life to the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and I hope that this proposal I pledged myis to be only of a temporary character. Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has received many congratulations on his clear and excellent speech in moving the second reading of this B ill . I think that special congratulation might be offered to him on the particular skill which he displayed in putting up such a splendid case for the retention of a Line which, at the outset of his political career, he threatened to abolish. It requires a good deal more skill than the average man possesses to be able with such lucidity, emphasis, and appaindustries. They rent sincerity to stand up for something, to abolish which one has I think that by entered political life. We on this side have no desire to embarrass the Government on this measure.

We cannot avoid, however, taking advantage of the opportunity of saying that the fine, clear argument which the right honourable gentleman put forward in favour of the retenThe tion of this Line destroyed the only case Parliahe had for the sale of the Woollen Mills.

The -secretary of the Shipwrights' Union says that they have 900 members in New South Wales, and 150 in Victoria-si x to one. That is a remarkable position, which is to be accentuated. The explanation of it is that there is no stability and no scope in this State for the iron trade. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to another aspect of the questiou. landed in Victoria over 100 artisans for the shipbuilding trade. They came from Scotland and England, and were mostly iron shipbuilders and boilermakers. am assured that only about twenty-five secured employment at their trade. few have gone on the labour market, and .obtained intermittent employment as labourers; others have gone out of the State altogether; some arc unemployed at the present time in Melbourne; and the remainder have returned to Scotland and England to give this country a very bad advertisement. This decision of the Government w ill affect places like Castleluain'e, where Thompson's were making marine engines, as it w ill result in men being thrown out of. work there. I suggest to the Government that, even though they do not retain this as a shipbuilding yard, they ought to retain it for carrying out certain repair work. We have fought in this House, and we shall fight again, in support of tlie principle that, as f a r as possible, repairs should be effected in Australia. I think that those repairs might well be distributed over the States of Australia. If the whole dockyard is not retained, the staff should be retained for effecting necessary repairs to vessels in this port. I emphasize one other aspect that we put forward as a party. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), speaking the ether day on the motion for the second reading, suggested that gather that about thirty years the marine workers should have representation on the Board that is to be established. That suggestion has been supported by other honourable members on this side. We put it forward with a deThat sire to help in making the Line a success. We are interested in the Line because it was founded by a Labour Government, and it represents to some extent the nationalization of shippinga policy in which we believe. It is our duty in considering a measure like this to make constructive suggestions The Prime Minister, in his speech, told us that the intention of the Government was to appoint a B'oard of three members-on e to be primaril y concerned w it h the shipping line, another w i th repair work, and the third wholly w i th finance. I agree that those are three very essential and important factors, but I suggest Since last Christmas there have that there is another important factor that w ill make for the success or otherwise of the Line. That factor is labour. In no industry does labour play a more i m I portant -part than in shipping. We urge in all sincerity, with a desire to make the A Line a greater success than it has been, and to remove all cause of friction between the workers and the management, that the Government should carry out the suggestion from this side of the House. I do not say bhab"" ib would solve the problem, but it would be a step towards a solution. Honourable members should r i d themselves of their opinions regarding the relations of employers and employees. The people, represented by the Government and Parliament, are the proprietors, and we must look at the problem from; the point of view of the proprietors, as well as that of the workers. While we have not the same object as most other employers, namely, bo get the most out of the business by exploiting the community and sweating the workers, we want to make the indusbry efficient and profitable. As our aim in this respect is the same as that of other employers, I would direct the atbention of honourable members bo whab intelligent employers are doing in various parts of the world to bring about co-operation bebween employers and employees. I regard such co-operation as one of the essential factors in running any industry, whether nationalized or privabely owned. I b is, moreover, a growing idea. I do not agree with-nay , I resent the allegations ofthose people who are eternally slandering the workers by charging them w it h deliberately slowing down. Time and again this accusation has been proved a slander. When the question is investigated, it has to be admitted that we are not getting efficiency in industries, but further in vestigation will show that it is not fair or reasonable to use the argument solely against the workers. Greater lack of efficiency w ill in many cases be found on the side of the employers, and where it occurs on the side. of the workers, it is due very rarely to any deliberate act of slowing down, but more often to the system under which they work. Shareholders in a company, for example, are in most cases quite indifferent to the welfare of the workers. They have no sympathy and no concern for those who make their dividends, and that feeling naturally becomes m u t u a l do' not suggest that this result is due to reckless unconcern by the workers, or heartlessness by the shareholders. It is due to the soulless system whereby people draw dividends without .knowing whence they come, or how they are earned. cogs in a machine, or units of power. If we are ever to have progress in this country, or peace in industry, we must get away from the idea that labour is a commodity-something , to be measured as so many units of power. Honourable members on this side of the House will strive, when the B ill is in Committee, to insert a provision that a representative of the maritime unions shall be appointed to the Board. It is proposed to have a marine expert, a repairs expert, and a finance expert. expert should be there, too. 'This proposal cannot be dismissed with idle sneers or a wave of the hand.

I have endeavoured to obtain all the information available on this subject, and have studied the reports of the International Labour Office, which was established by the League of Nations, and has employers and employees represented upon it . I recommend those publications to honourable members. They are unbiased inquiries into problems which are of great concern to the people of every country. One or two phases of the reports are worthy of the special consideration of honourable members. The governing body of the International Labour Office, at its meeting in Genoa on the 9th June, 1920, desired the office to conduct an in quiry into industrial production in the various countries of the world. The resolution was moved by the employers I group. I have the report, which, after going very extensively into the scope of the inquiry, deals in one chapter with ""' Solutions."" Among the solutions stressed by thereportwas the democratization of industry. It points out that Works Committees are operating in The workers are regarded as England to-day in industries employing over 3,500,000 workers. I confess that I was astonished that the number was so large, although I knew the system was being extended. The report also states that sixty Joint Industrial Councils are in existence in England. The Joint Councils control the whole of an industry. The Works Committees are elected by the employees in each factory or industry, and have free access to the management and to the books of the company. The committee, thereforej has We say that a labour knowledge of the inside working of the business. The inquiry then went to the United States of America, and selected a number of illustrations of what was happening there. The report menstage in the industrial tions the firm of Pilene Brothers, of There is a tendency all over the Boston, which is managed by eleven directors, of whom four are elected by the of industry-that is, the 2,000 employees of the firm.

It was started as an experiment to-increase the profits of the firm. That, by the way, is one of the objections which the workers have to it , but the objection cannot be raised in regard to -nationalized industry, the profits of which belong to the people of the country. Members of the Opposition are not asking for any alteration as great as that, but only for a step forward. We realize that the democratization of industry can come only by the education of both sides, and that, education can come only by experiment. politics at the present moment, why should we not have Democracy in industry ?

82,Mr Scullin,"workers are given a share of responsibility, they will respond in the way we desire. With a representative >on the Board whom they trust they will learn the difficulties of the management, will be in a position to appreciate the problems that are to be solved, and, with a proper incentive, will assist in their solution. Suggestions by the Labour party have been adopted' in the past in regard to Labour representation on Committees of Inquiry and Commissions; but there one cardinal mistake is frequently made by anti-Labour Governments When they appoint a representative of the workers they generally make the selection outside the trusted leaders of the Labour movement. The workers ought to have a free and unfettered .choice of their own representative, a free and unfettered choice of men in whom ithey have confidence and to whom they will listen. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr take the view that private control has Charlton) that with such representation as is now proposed, and. with the mutual understanding thus created, there would be prevented many, of those small disputes' which in the past have stopped the work of the Shipping Line. As to the selection of representatives in whom the men believe, it is interesting to note what Mr thousand s and tens of thousands of Cadbury, who speaks with some knowledge, says:The test of a scheme is the extent to which spectre of unemployment. Honourable it creates ancl fosters a spirit of good-will without lessening the loyalty of the worker to his own class and its organizations. I think that is a very significant statement, coming, as it does, from a man with much experience in such matters. Mr O'KEEFE -He practices what he preaches. say that the proposal now made will solve all the industrial problems that confront us-that if there be a representative of the marine workers on.the Boardi t will insure peace for ever. We do say, however, that with Arbitration Courts fixing the rates of iwages and hours of la'bour, and with a workers' representative sitting at the table, many troubles will not arise, or, if they do; will be smoothed away without any stoppage of work. Of course, there will always be a clash of interests; that cannot Ibe avoided in any form of business or occupation. We had bloodshed and turmoil for years in Europe owing to the clashing interests of different groups of capitalists in the world; but with a better understanding brought about in the way now suggested, we shall bring about a greater era of industrial peace than is possible by any iron-handed method. Believing, as the Labour party do, that private property is the sole aim of the majority of private employers, we are not very hopeful that' the many schemes outlined will ever prove the solution of the social problem. That is why we have faith in nationalization as a step towards socialization, and we believe that what we suggest is one step to giving the workers some control, and a sense of responsibility in the work they do. Our opponents opposite believe that private enterprise can be made successful, but I do not think there are many who been humane to the workers in all ages, or is even so at the present time. Notwithstanding all the advantages that we enjoy from increased methods of .production, by up-to-date machinery--despit e the fact.that the problem of production was solved long ago by scientific methods workers are continuously on the breadline, and have to face the gaunt (members opposite, in their political campaigns, advance as a solutionand I believe many of them are sincerethe adoption of co-operation and profit-sharing. We shall put those honourable members to the test, and see how far they believe in their own profession. But copartnership and profit-sharing, politically speaking, are meaningless, because there is no legislation by which they can be enforced. Of course, we can have copartnership and profit-sharing by nationalizing industry, ancl if honourable members 'believe 'that what they preach is. best as between the private employer and his employee, surely they ought to approve of it when applied to nationalized industry, over which the Parliament has control. What we propose is not copartnership, but a long way short of that ideal; we merely suggest that the workers",48,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever
83,Mr Scullin,"Quite so. We do notshall have one representative out of four on the Board. A proposal to that effect would test the sincerity of honorahle members opposite. As I said at the outset, we on this side desire the success of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, because we wish to see our country progress. We believe that the success of the Line will tend to the development of Australia; that it will help those who are tilling the soil, and those who have commodities to export. We desire the success of the Line because it. represents one more experiment in nationalization. We were proud of the success, of the Geelong Woollen Mills, and righteously indignant when the Government parted with them. that the Government do not propose to dispose of the Shipping Line, but I may say that there were arguments ten times stronger for the retention of the woollen mills than for the retention of the shipping. The mills have proved successful indirectly and directly, whereas the Commonwealth Line has proved a success only indirectly, and it remains to be seen whether it will result in the profits hoped. should patronize the Commonwealth Line. We are interested in the Line, and, therefore, we want industrial peace, and, to that end, the co-operation of those who manage with those who work. Lafcour is not a commodity, and should never be -treated as such. The workers should be consulted in all matters pertaining to their particular industries; and if they are they will respond even more generously ""than they have when not consulted. Such a response will prove to the advantage of the people generally, the Government, tlie management, and the workers themselves. ment will be moved to carry out the idea that I have expressed. I hope that the Government will accept the suggestion, and render any proposal from this side unnecessaiy. the suggestion sincerely because we are realily greater believers in the Commonwealth Line than are the Government themselves, and even more anxious for. its success. second reading, in the hope that the Bill will be improved in Committee.

I hope the honourable member does not infer that that boycott was initiated by the primary producers of Victoria, or of Australia. the other side of the world are responsible. We are glad ciate primary producers from any boycott of this Line, and I should like to show what they have done, and have tried to do, for bhe Line, and what it has done for them in return. To that end I shall shortly give some figures dealing with the rates charged as between Australia and the markets of the world. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Eiley) has told us that the primary producers I am now speaking for the wheat-growers, who probably have more freight to offer than has any other primary or secondary industry in Australia, and I may say bhat we have done everybhing to get in touch, to keep in touch, and to 3o business with the Line. The platform of the Country party declares in favour of the extension of the Commonwealth Shipping Line by the inclusion of large and fast steamers with plentiful insulated space for the purpose of carrying perishable products to the markets of the world at reasonable rates; any profits made to be utilized In Cominittee, an amendin the expansion of the service. The main reason why we 'have supported this Line is that we believe that in days gone by we have been exploited, and probably will be exploited again, by the We on this side make Shipping Combine. We had hoped thab bhe Commonwealth Line would be the means of preventing this exploitation, but it has not proved all thab we hoped. During the war period we chartered an We unanimously support the immense number of vessels, and the Commonwealth Line, which, I believe, was purchased in 1916, entered largely into the overseas carrying trade.

It is the desire of the primary producers of this country to foster the Line, as they -believe it operates in their interests by keeping rates at a reasonable level.

The right honourable member for North .Sydney appeared to be under the impression that in respect of depreciation millions were being written off below the already reduced figures quoted. It appears to me that this financial statement deals with the whole position from the inception of the Commonwealth until the present date, and does not appertain happened in between. shows the original capital values of the whole of the ships, and some honourable members are, apparently, under the impression that the difference between the original value of £15,000,000 and the present value of £4,750,000 is a total loss. That £15,000,000, the original value of all the ships which have been at one time or other in the service of the wealth Line, about £1,000,000 worth of tonnage, or a little more, has been either sold or lost, and the insurance money recovered, which reduces the to a little under £14,000,000. £14,000,000 £4,750,000; those two figures of a little over £9,000,000 is many times greater than our total loss. 'Profits have been made sufficient to cover well over two-thirds of that total depreciation, thc actual net loss is only To speak of a loss of only so many millions sounds ridiculous, but the difference between the total loss of two and two-third millions and the apparent loss of the difference between £15,000,000 four and two-thirds millions is very considerable.

[REPRESENTATIVES.] Shipping BiU. probably happen to the shipping comAs the honourable panies. The following is from the report for .South Sydney( Mr E. of the Administrator of the Northern Territory for the year ended 30th June, 1922:The Government shipping trade has heen carried on as in 1920-21, -with the same results of dissatisfaction to settlers and heavy loss to the Government. The loss is principally principally in the coastal due to the unsuitability and inadequacy of the opportunity John Aleje, the vessel provided for carrying Shipping on the trade. Her very poor sailing qualities and low engine speed cause her voyages to outports to & of inordinate length and highly Thehuge shipping combines expensive in the matters of payments for merely to amass money, petrol and high wages and overtime to the crew, while her register being only 33 tons, If the vessels of the Inchcape nearly one-third of which .is taken up by water, fuel, and ship's stores, the result is that, to the injury and quite legitimate dissatisfaction of settlers, cargo has frequently to ibe left bevessels, and hind at Darwin, and more voyages have to be undertaken than would be necessary with an efficient vessel which an amount considerably less than the total loss on the John Alee for the last two years should easily provide. The The continuance of this enterprise by means of .the John Aloe must inevitably continue to result in heavy loss to the Government, and general inconvenience to and dissatisfaction Peninamong those whose interests it is the inten. tion to serve. The best solution of the diffiportion of South Australia by culty would be for the service to be carried Owing to the absence out by a private firm contracting on reasonable terms with the Government, but the call for tenders with this end in view has had no result, and the only alternative seems to he to Ring. provide an efficient and economical vessel, and with her improve the service and reduce the Labour losses. How well the Government are developing the Northern Territory ! The report shows that the loss on this ship is more 'Commonwealth, . than wha't would he required to provide a larger vessel, and yet we submit to that loss. If we cannot do better than we are doing in some in of settlers such as those I stances, we ought to hand Australia back At present we are only to the blacks, and return to dear Old England. A good deal was said in South Australia at the last elections about what was to be done in the Northern Territory, but the fish did not bite, because most of the candidates who relied on that line of argument lost their seats. The proper to do all that is required. way to develop 'the Territory is to get which characterized' away from the fringe of it . There is a in France lot of good country inland, but the Gowith vernment use a steamer one-third of the were tonnage of which is devoted to the carriage of water!' Every patriotic Australian wishes to do the best possible to develop this continent The same thing would by Australians. We have led the world in industrial reforms, and we should upi hold the Navigation Act. The war taught us the benefit of our industrial legislation, and why should we go back to the Lascar days when a poor sailor had to sleep in any little hole into which he could crawl ? An "" Aussie"" will not tolerate that. The Labour party will stand to its guns and uphold the Navigation Act, and it will also fight to the last ditch before it allows the Commonwealth Shipping Line to be scrapped. A very good point was made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who asked that the Board should include a representative of the men employed in working the ships. We may have the best vessels in the world, but. they cannot be turned to useful account unless they are manned by efficient seamen. board the Somali wanted to take charge of the ship, I was not foolish enough to believe that they could do so. marked, "" W a it a minute.

One of the party then called out, "" How many certificated engineers among us, boys?"" and five of them held up their hands. men should do what was proposed, and I asked, "" Who are prepared to go into the stokehold ?"" "" How many A.B.'s here, lads,"" was the next query, and about a dozen hands went up. ThenI was "" up against it , "" and as the chairman I was forced to put the motion that cost me sixty days. One honourable member today wanted to know how many stoppages had occurred on the "" Bay"" steamers. If the seamen were represented on the Board of control stoppages could be. prevented by the conditions being made satisfactory. Perhapsi t is thought that . a suitable man to represent the employees is not to be obtained, but I think that if we take a sporting risk one will be forthcoming. died, his work in connection with the Navigation Act was so f u l ly appreciated that he was called the Plimsoll of Australia. Most men on the Labour side have to wait t ill they are dead before they receive such encomiums. If the late Senator Guthrie could earn such a tribute, there need be no fear of securing a worthy representative of the seamen. If the Government adopted the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra, it would help to promote efficiency in the service, and I feel sure that the conditions referred to by the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) would be eliminated. If the appointment of a Board would meanthat the Commonwealth Line was to perform hara-kiri I could not vote for the measure. ter and Ministerf o r External Affairs) [ 1 0 . 9 ] I do not intend to cover all the ground that has been traversed in the course of the debate. A great many of the matters that have been discussed will arise again in Committee, and a definite decision will have to be come to upon When the Australian soldiers on them. I am going to t r y to remove one or two misapprehensions that appear to exist in the minds of some honourable I remembers. The first which, I think, should be cleared away is the suggestion that the Government are not sincere in introducing this B ill , and the proposal for the appointment of a Board to control the Line. Any honourable member who heard the speech I made in this Housei n November, 1921, when this matter was f u l ly discussed, will recollect that I stressed the point that if the Government were to continue in the shipStillI was not satisfied that the ping business it was imperative in the interests of the Line itself that it should be placed under separate control, and if it was to be given a reasonable opportunity of succeeding, written down to a fair valuation I think honourable members will believe me when I say that if I or the Government wanted to "" k ill "" the Line, we could have stepped in and sold the vessels. Many political sins are charged to our account, but I do not think any honourable member will accuse us of lack of courage. I can assure the House that the underlying motive of the Government, in introducing this B ill , was to give the Line the very best opportunity of proving successful. The honourable member for Echuca( Mr When ex-Sena.tor R. S. GuthrieH ill ) was not quite fair in his criticism of the management. He stated the facts with regard to wheat charters during the last two years, but said nothing of the service rendered to the wheat farmers of Australia by the Line during the war. Therefore it is only fair that I should remind the House of what happened at",54,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever
104,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Ministhat time. their minds they will remember that shortly 'after the Line was established it was carrying Australian wheat to London at £7 10s. per ton, at a time when ' British ship-owners were charging £ 1 3 and more, and foreign charters were as high as £ 1 5 per ton. The Commonwealth Line's rates were a considerable benefit to the Australian farmer at that time, and it is only fair that I should mention the matter. Another fact to be borne in mind with regard to the charters mentioned by the' honourable member is that the ships which were offering at rates considered unremunerative by the Commonwealth Line had to get . return cargoes to their home ports or go back in ballast. It is natural that vessels so placed' should be prepared to accept rates whioh, in other circumstances, would prove unremunerative. here in ballast. stated before honourable members express their judgment upon what, I think, was a rather one-sided statement concerning the past management of the Line. propose, at a later date, to answer the criticisms in which the honorahle member for Echuca indulged? before the management of the Line. has to be borne in mind that the acceptance of these wheat charters by the Commonwealth Line would have meant sending the ships away on a long journey and returning them to Australia in ballast, because there was no possibility of getting a return cargo. I mention this fact to remove the impression that the management of the Line has been guilty of something in the nature of an absolute dereliction of duty in regard to the handling of freights from Australia. As part of my administrative duties I have been obliged to go fairly closely into the management of the Line, and I am satisfied that whatever else may be said against it , no one can accuse it of having done anything except exercise the greatest care to insure its success. remind honourable members of the successf u l fight put up quite recently by the Line with respect to the discrimination shown by the whole of t h e Conference Line veissels against shippers by the Commonwealth Government Line. If they w ill throw back W it h regard to the debate generally, . one of the misconceptions which I desire to clear away from honourable members' minds has relation to the valuations at which these vessels have been taken into account. I can assure honourable members that what we endeavoured to do was to determine the fair market value of the ships to-day, and to hand them over to the Board at a valuation that would offer some' reasonable prospect of success. If , as has been suggested, we really wanted to "" k ill "" the Line, we could have done that simply by handing over the vessels to the Board at an inflated' valuation. H a d that been done, the results would have been apparent in their operations, and within twelve months we should have had a clamour to get r i d of the vessels because they were unprofitable. I ask honourable gentlemen, therefore, to acquit the Government of any suggestion that in writM a n y of the vessels came -ing down the value of those ships we had a sinister motive. one effect, namely, to help the Boardi n the management pf the Line. the honourable the Leader of the Opposition agrees w i th me. Our sole purpose in writing down the valuation of the ships was to insure the future prosperity of the Line. The vessels now stand at their fair market valuer-neithe r too high It nor too low. As to the "" Bay"" liners, the "" D , "" "" E , "" and "" E "" vessels, we have their certified values, and they are to be handed over to the Board on that basis. These vessels were valued by C. and W . Kellock and Company, brokers, of London. Honourable members may remember the document which I hold in my hand. They saw it during the debate on the Commonwealth Shipping Linei n November, ""1921. This document is a chart ahowing the drop in the values of shipping over a number of years. As many honourable members will recall, it was handed round in this Chamber on the occasion to which I refer, and there was some discussion as to whether that course should have been followed. It was proI may also, duced by the ex-Prime Minister( Mr. W. M . Hughes) as evidence of the . tremendous depreciation that had taken place in the value of ships, and to show the present position of the Commonwealth Line, as well as the probable results of their future working.",56,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever

I do not propose to say what those values ase, and thus allow any one who may be contemplating a purchase to know 'the price we are putting on the -vessels, but I can give a 'broad 'outline .of what has -been done. We have a steamer which was built [33] in 1906. Fortunately, a vessel which was sold 'Rery (recently was ibuilt in the saime yesi.

'They are undoubtedly valued ab prices ab which any iprudent ship-owner would place them on his books to-day if he had to take stock of his fleet. The .next point raised as .that the valuations placed on .these vessels .must be abnormally low .because of certain figuues which wer© -given .to .bhe ex-Prime Minister by ibhe management of the Line in February, .19.22.. Two .sets of figures were .supplied .to the ex-Prime Minister to .show The people the actual depreciation .of the steamers.

(En .order Furthermore, there has been from July, 1923., to the present lime, a considerable shrinkage in the value iof tonnage of their type. I suggest t h a t the figaitr.es we mow put forward .are not unlike tine two earlier proposals for depreciation p u t forward by the management of the Line, but are reasoimWy .consistent with them. -On this occasion we have a double check. W.e sane aot :r.elying -solely -on the araaiiagement of the Line. We 'have 'also secured -direct valuations, -where",57,Moloney Bu T If The Territory By Ordinances Has There Ever
111,Mr Billlhse,"The -ex-Proane Ministerpossible, and where that was not possible have established a basis of comparison with the selling price of other vessels of similar character. Therefore, there is nothing to be said against our figures on the ground that the depreciation provided for is absolutely abnormal and unnecessary. No man cares to write ""downhis assets in a drastic way, but it is an unpleasant necessity to which, from time to time, Governments and private individuals engaged in trade are subjected. A man who has not the courage to write down his assets to a f a i r market value, as we have done, is headiug straight for inevitable disaster. There are two sides to the picture. If we have taken the valuations at too low a figure, no one w ill suffer. The Board w ill get the ships at a low value, which w ill enable it to show a margin of profit on very low freights. I remind honourable members that unti l 25 per cent, of the capital is reached, every penny of these profits w ill go straight into the reserves of the Line to establish its financial stability. If the valuations are low-and I do not think they are-nothin g but benefit in the long run ""will accrue. The only effect of fixing the valuations too high would be to doom the Line to disaster from the first minute that the Board took over the steamers. It would not show the position we are now iu, or what the result of the operations of this Line have been from its commencement. If there is anything we need to do regarding this shipping venture it is to t r y to see the facts f a i r l y , and to know exactly where we stand. I suggest to honourable members that there is nothing aboutwhich they need be apprehensive in relation to the valuations; I believe the valuations at which we have arrived represent the fair market value of the asset we are handing over. There seems to be some misapprehension figures the other day showing the position, with regard to the position of the "" D "" and I stress them now only because they and "" E "" vessels. The right member for North Sydney stated that and "" E "" vessels were somewhat chalthese vessels were built to a design lenged to-day by the right honourable recommended ment. So they were; they were standard vessels by Britain, and by practically every other these vessels not suitable? country during the war. The fact remains, however, that while they were adsteaming capacity; they cannot carry the mirably suited for trading up and down necessary quantity of coal. The suggesthe Mediterranean, and for similarly short tion was made to-day that it must be the Mr Bruce. runs, they were not suited to the trade in which we proposed to use them-the long distance overseas trade. There is no possible question that, for that type of vessel, they represented first-class workmanship. There is no suggestion that the price which they cost, under the abnormal conditions which were prevailing at the time they were built, was excessive. As to workmanship and cost they bear comparison with the standard ships that were being built in every other part of the world. The right honourable gentleman said today that the management of the Line did not approve of their design. That is quite correct; the management said they did not approve of them because they were not suited to the trade in which we desired to engage them. There is no questioning that fact; it has been demonstrated clearly by the results of the last two years. I have here a statement of the individual voyages which have been taken by these vessels inwards and outwards, showing the actual gross earnings and gross expenditure. Nothing is included on account of interest or depreciation, hut there is a charge for the insurance reserve-whic h is debited against each individual trip in stead of being taken out of the profits as a whole. In not one. voyage made by a "" D "" class steamer did the gross earnings equal the gross expenditure. able for the shorter trade to the East? ber of trades for which they would be suitable. The point I am trying to make is that there is no complaint regarding workmanship, cost, or anything of that nature; but that these vessels are not suitable for the particular trade in which they have had to engage while in the hands of the Oommonwealth. Without question, very serious.losses have been in curred by these particular vessels.

That is not the position; those vessels are proving to be quite a good investment, and' on a reasonably fair capitalization there should be no doubt of their ability to cover their own charges, including interest and depreciation, and to run at a reasonable profit. I desire to inform honorable members There is only one other point which rethat I am now in a position to announce quires clearing up, and that has reference to the insurance fund. whicli it was suggested the fund stood was £600,000.

It is brought in as "" Insurance Reserve at 30th June, 1923, £992,250."" A deduction has to be made on account of outstanding claims, leaving thc fund at £901,000. . These are the only points on which there appears to ho some slight confusion in the minds of honourable members. I suggest that the case has been presented to honourable members with absolute frankness and reasonable fairness: It appeared to be suggested that I had tried to present the case in blacker colours than the facts warranted. I ask honourable memhers to believe that I attempted -to put the case with the utmost possible fairness, and to show exactly the position of the Line in order that honourable members might decide for themselves the possibility of its being run successfully in the future.
