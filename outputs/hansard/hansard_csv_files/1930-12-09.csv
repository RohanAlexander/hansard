28,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [3.13],"I thing more than the imposition of taxesthat any party in power is prepared to take, yet whicli might be taken if all parties were prepared to accept responsibility for it. I speak with the general concurrence of the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Page), with whom I have consulted, in saying that the Opposition is prepared, in view of what we regard as a threatening national crisis, to share responsibility for any unpopular action which may be necessary to save the credit and honour of the country, and to make a return to prosperity possible. We are prepared to leave this Government with the power, and so far as we can do so, to accept some measure of responsibility, but how can this be accomplished at the present time? I have already said that I do not suggest the formation of a coalition government. I cannot see that that would be successful. The government of the Commonwealth must remain with the present Ministry, which commands a majority in this House. WhatI suggest is the appointment of a council, to consist of representatives of the many as the Ministry thinks properthe representatives of the States on the Loan Council, representatives of the opposition parties in this Parliament, and representatives of the Commonwealth Bank and the associated banks. Oppositions in the State Parliaments? in vernment this council. The representatives I have suggested represent all classes in the community-the primary and secondary producers, the employers and employees, who constitute the supporters of all political parties. In reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), the parties in opposition in one State House are governing in another, and if separate representation were given to all the State Oppositions the council would be unwieldy. I suggest that there should be no representation of employers or employees, or of chambers of commerce or chambers of manufactures as such, because I fear that if the council contained representatives of all these interests,, it is unlikely that practical proposals would be adopted. The council would be able to obtain assistance, information, and advice from all these sources. My suggestion is that it should be the responsibility of the council to devise a scheme to be put into operation over a 3-year or a 5-year period. We should do our best to sink party politics, and make a disinterested effort to serve our country. It would ultimately be the responsibility of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States to determine whether any proposals made by the council could be accepted. It appears to me that the issues that face us to-day are far more important than any consideration of party politics. I promise the support of the Opposition of this House, and, I think I can say, of the organizations which support it outside of this House. We are prepared to do our best, independently of party, to restore our country to the position which it sliould occupy. I do not desire to initiate a party debate. I am aware that there are many differences of opinion as to the Commonwealth Government-as remedies that should be applied to the difficulties and evils to which I have referred. I have made no reference to any of them, because I do not wish to impart into this short speech au element of division. I therefore conclude by asking the Government to consider seriously what about the I have said. I do not ask the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Penton) to make I shall refer to that an immediate reply; but I should like a moment; Let the Gohim to give an assurance that what has make the selection of been said on behalf of the Opposition, and also, in general outline, on behalf of the Country party, will be given earnest consideration.

Debate resumed from the 5th, December (vide page 1073), on motion by Mr intention of carrying the developmentof That the hill he now rend :i second time. [3.29] -When this debate was adjourned on Friday, I was discussing the general positioii of the Northern Territory, but, unfortunately, the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) was not present. I am pleased that the honourable gentleman is here this afternoon. I shall restate my case as well as I can in the brief time now at my disposal. I impress it upon the Minister that there is no need for the Government to give effect to this extraordinary proposal to abolish the North Australia Commission. The Commission has thoroughly justified itself in rhe short time in which it has been in existence. This is shown definitely in its report for the year ended the 30th December, 1.929, which gives a comprehensive review of its work and to which I refer honourable members. The Minister totally ignored the value of the academic work being done by the commission. It may not have done very valuable developmental work, but that has been due to lack of funds. The representations of the commission have shown conclusively that it has been well worth the money expended upon it, and only about £11,000 a year is to be saved by its abolition. is between £8,000 and £9,000 a year. case even better. For the sake of saving £8,000 or £9,000 a year,it is not worth doing irreparable harm to the Territory. One cannot gauge the value of the commission in terms of pounds, shillings and pence. There is a moral value in having such a body functioning as the representative of the Federal Parliament in this vast and sparsely populated area. Moreover, the abolition of the commission would destroy all hope in the minds both of residents of the territory and of the'se outside it, that the Commonwealth Parliament really proposes to press on with the development of the territory. It would be an indication that the territory has been definitely abandoned to its fate, and people outside Australia altogether would be forced into the belief that the Government, as a foolish gesture of economy, had given up all present the continent beyond its present point. No worse gesture could be made at a time when people are' already sufficiently inclined to become depressed, aud when those outside Australia have come to look upon this country as something of a failure. There is no justification for regarding tlie Northern Territory as a hopeless proposition. Considering the small amount which has been expended on it apart from the capital debt with which it was loaded when the Commonwealth took it over-the development of the territory has proceeded fairly rapidly. It has an enormous length of railway, unfortunately not yet completed, and it has a European population of about 3,000, besides 1,000 half-breeds. It also contains the bulk of Australia's aboriginal population, having within its borders approximately 20,000 natives. On that score alone the Government would he justified in spending £8,000 or £9,000 a year in maintaining within the territory an administrative body capable of exercising a benevolent control over this fast dwindling race. Moreover, if the Government ever adopts the suggestion that there should be established within the territory a ' great national reservation for aborigines, what body better than the Northern Territory Commission could be entrusted with its supervision 1 The commission could inaugurate and carry out such a scheme with the minimum of trouble and expense. If , in spite of the warning of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), the Government persists in. the abolition of the commission, it should at least give favorable consideration to the proposal for setting up au advisory council. Such a council would be better than nothing, although, seeing that the expense of the comniission is so small, I firmly believe that it would be better to retain it. Probably some commissions set up by otlier governments have not been worthwhile, but that cannot be said of the Northern Territory",13,Railwa Ybil L

44,Mr Thompson,"That makes myOoiiiiiiLsaioii. I remind the Government tliat thc Northern Territory is near to the hearts of the Australian people, though they may know very little about it. There is a glamour, a fascination, the mysterious attraction of the unknown about, this land, which fires the imagination of the great majority of persons. Thoy wish to sue it populated, and developed, recognizing, as they do, that it in time will lay claim to the dignity of a new State. advanced against any proposal for unification is that the Commonwealth Government appeal's to have had so little success in the control of the territories under its own jurisdiction. People point to what they describe as the tragic failure of the Commonwealth's qfforts in the Northern Territory, and ask how a Commonwealth with such a poor record can be trusted with the control of the Avhole continent. That appears to be an almost unanswerable argument. Government made some effort to live down that reputation, and now the present Government proposes to undo its work. As I have said, one reason why the territory makes such an appeal to most people is that, at the back of their minds, there is the idea that it is thc one rem ai ii ing part of Australia whicli may be formed into a new State. The subject of new States has often, been debated in this Parliament., and proposals for the creation of one or more new States in the Northern Territory have been, advanced. We realize, however, that until the territory has more population rind better communications it wonld be practically impossible to start, it off on a self-governing career. The possibility is there, however, but the Government, by this action, will postpone its realizations for decades. This Parliament has not fully explored the possibilities of the Northern Territory. Some years ago, on a. journey to Western Australia, I met on the transcontinental railway an American, who said of the Nullabor Plain country that if: reminded him very much of Arizona. I asked him, ""Do you mean to say that Arizona is as bad as this?"" He replied, "" A tremendous lot of it is quite as bad, if not worse."" Yet Arizona is one of the most successful of the American.Stat.es! country in the Northern Territory than on the Nullabor Plain. indeed be bad country. But I attach a great deal of importance to the opinions expressed by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), who has declared that the houorable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) has seen only a small portion of the terriOne of the arguments tory. It may surprise some honourable members to' learn that four of the largest States of America-Oregon, with an area of 96,000 square miles; Texas, with an area of 265,000 square miles: Arizona, with an area of 133,000 square miles; and Nevada, with an area of 110,000 square miles-coul d be fitted quite comfortlajbly into the Northe.ru Territory; and, if one can believe what one hears and reads, a great deal of the country in those four States is quite as bad as some The previous of the worse couutry in the Northern Territory. If they can be worked successfully, surely it is uot beyond the capacity of Australia to produce similar results in the Northern Territory; and how foolish it would be to destroy the one small piece of machinery that will enable it to progress when the time is opportune. I predicted on Friday, and I repeat to-day, that there is a great, future ahead of the Northern Territory as the principal cattle State of Australia-it may, perhaps, rival Texas in that respect. We may ""be able to combine cattle-raising with agriculture, mineral production, and other important primary activities, for which there is so much scope in the undeveloped portions of Australia. That the Northern Territory has a great future in the direction of cattleraising is the opinion of, perhaps, the foremost authority on cattle in Australia Mr J. B. Cramsie, chairman of the New South Wales Wlieat Board. His opinion has been reported as follows:After a careful examination of the various beef-producing countries, their pasturages, and land values, he is uf the opinion that Northern Australia is able to offer advantages of more economical production than any other country lie had investigated. Up to the present time no attempt has been made in Northern Australia, to produce the quality of cattle suitable to secure maximum values in the world's markets, mostly due to the fact that Australian producers have conic to thc erroneous conclusion that, to place the industry on the",14,Blakeley
45,Mr Kiixkn,There is far worse,15,Blakeley
46,Mr Thompson,"Then it mustsame footing with Argentine and Uruguay, the cost of improving the breeds, pasturages, fences and water is much higher than in those countries. believes the advantages are greatly on our side. In the last fifteen years, although, unfortunately, the number of sheep has dwindled from 57,000 to about 7,000 or 8,000, the number of cattle in the Northern Territory has increased by 100 per cent., despite the fact that the disadvantages under which the industry suffers are worse than those experienced anywhere else in the world. I refer the Minister( Mr Blakeley) to the 1929 report of the North Australia Commission, and should like him to state whether his department has seriously considered it. I invite honourable members to note carefully what it says with regard to the cattle industry specifically, and then to declare whether it would be fair of. the Government to abolish the commission, which is costing only a paltry £8,000 or £9,000 a year-fai r from the point of view of the Northern Territory itself, or of the future of Australia. The report statesThe present state of the beef cattle industry transport, it is pointed out that between 5th generally throughout North Australia is in a August, 1929, when the railway extension from most unsatisfactory condition notwithstanding Oodnadatta to Alice Springs was opened for that tlie country is capable, under proper conpublic traffic, and the 24th October, 1929, 6,718 ditions, of carrying successfully and profitably fat cattlo were railed from Alice Springs to the present extent of this. industry, and could the Adelaide markets, and sold at an average cope with a great expansion of that industry. of about £10 10s. per head. This position is due, in the main, to the following:(1) Largo numbers of cattle are fit for the price rose from about £4 to about market about thc end of January.

Ur. Thompson. (0) The cattle on their arrival at the markets arc in such a condition that most of them are only fit to As a matter of fact, he sell as "" stpres"" at about £4 per head. These difficulties form insuperable obstacles to thc advancement of the beef cattle industry. To considerably alleviate those difficulties, the provision of the utilities for transport, i.e., the main lines of railway recommended by the commission, is essential. Reasonable lease tenures, and reasonably higher land rentals, with the proper and fully warranted utilities for communication and transport, would spell prosperity to the cattleman, and the whole country, and bring into existence, on a large and profitable scale, the sheep and wool industry. We know that, since this Parliament last dealt with the Northern Territory, a great national railway has been extended within its area by some hundreds of miles, and' is producing very satisfactory results. Even the detractors of the Northern Territory will not deny that, in the year 1928, the revenue of this line exceeded the expenditure by £27,000. Is not that a feather in the cap of the territory, and does it not warrant greater notice being taken by the Government of its possibilities?

Nelson). tive council? all to pay tribute to the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his valuable work in furthering the interests of the Northern Territory. I should very much like to see the honourable member given an effective vote in this chamber, because it is only right that the people of the Northern Territory should have in this House some influence in the affairs of that great tract of country. I rose chiefly to refer to the agreement transferring the territory from South Australia to the Commonwealth. I remember the transfer very well, because it happened at the time when my late respected father, the Honourable Thomas Price, was Premier of South Australia. He, with the late Honourable Alfred Deakin, signed that agreement. It was seen at that time that the finances of the State would not permit of the proper development of the territory, and that under the control of the Commonwealth the burden of its ultimate development would fall equitaibly upon the people of Australia as a whole. The signing of that agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia was undoubtedly a statesmanlike act. I hope that as time goes on it may be found possible to develop the. territory. I have al ways taken a-great interest in it. ""When I was a member of the State legislature I visited Oodnadatta, which at that time was the head of the railway. I was much disappointed to see so much poor land. But since my election to the Eederal Parliament I have, in company with the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, and the honourable member for the Northern Springs, which is now the terminal point of the railway, and I was exceedingly pleased to find that the country between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs is much better than that lying to the south, between Hergott Springs and Oodnadatta. I am now firmly convinced of the great possibilities of the territory. In company with the honourable member for the ""Northern Territory I journeyed some 60 or 70 miles out from Alice Springs and saw some wonderful cattle for Riverina has not seen that couutry. country. the speech of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen). He is undoubtedly a pessimist in regard to the development of the territory. On the other hand, the honourable member for the Northern Territory is an optimist, and I have been strongly impressed with what he has told me from time to time of the potentialities of that vast country. While at Alice Springs we met many residents who had come south to meet us, and I must confess that never ibefore had I met men who were so optimistic in regard to the future of the territory. I consider that it will eventually be one of tlie greatest cattle countries in the world. It has, in addition, great mineral resources, particularly in the Macdonnell Ranges. It is more than likely that valuable deposits will some day be discovered there. While at Alice SpringsI saw some excellent mobs of cattle which drovers had brought from the Barkly Tableland. The trucking of these cattle for the Adelaide market was a sight worth witnessing. The beasts were in splendid condition. As the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) has said, when they were sold at Adelaide they averaged £ 16 10s. a head. If the cattle industry is to develop in Australia as it has in the Argentine, Ave must encourage it on national lines.

Darwin, particularly, is a place where such a system is fraught with I dangers. The population is polyglot, and very much union-ridden. Indeed, it is distinctly worse in that regard than Sydney. The settlement is far from the normal restraints of civilization, and there is a big temptation for the more irresponsible section to ignore the ordinary rules of order. The Minister not only changed the character of the council, but has been meddling in local administrative affairs. If an officer does something to maintain order which offends the mob at Darwin, a. telegram is sent to the Minister, who immediately intervenes and reverses the decision of his subordinate.

I have seen ships being loaded at Darwin. I have noticed four men standing round a fiveton truck, and getting 5s. an hour for ordinary lumping work. that the transport charges in connection with the cattle industry are almost prohibitive. I do not blame the wharf labourers in the Northern Territory for not working hard. The opinion I have had given to me is that the climate of the coastal belt of Northern Australia is so severe that it is nearly impossible for a man to do a fair day's work there for six days a week. That is one of the reasons why, for the present time, at any rate, the idea of agricultural development there -by white labour should be abandoned. the Government wishes to assist the people in the North, they should not be interfered with in the management of local affairs; but, if we impose ou the cattle-raisers and others, who are seriously attempting to develop the country, the same industrial conditions as operate in the south, and if gentlemen li£e the present Minister for Home Affairs( Mr north, Darwin and the Northern TerriBlakeley) interpose with their personal views in the little squabbles that occur between the different parties in the territory, life there will be made more difficult than, it now is.

The local residents seem to have accepted them with a good deal of satisfaction. It is true that this commission, like all others in Australia, has proved rather costly; but the only criticism of it is that its recommendations involve the expenditure of more money than the Government is able to provide. I think that the-Minister might have curtailed the expenditure upon the commission without abolishing it. The alternative of having one local administrator, with government from the Federal Capital, has proved a failure, and has caused much dissatisfaction. The residents could best express their views through a body such as this commission. I hope that the Minister will consider the advisability of withdrawing this bill. One realizes As one who has taken a keen interest in the development of the territory, and has on several occasions visited the southern part of it, I regret the introduction of this measure. The territory has had a chequered career, which can be attributed, in the first place, to lack of communication, and, secondly, to development from the north instead of from the south through South Australia, and from the east through Queensland. Centralized control from the Commonwealth Seat of Government has proved the greatest If obstacle to development. Scarcely any proposal for governmental action can be carried out unless it has first been agreed to by public servants located at the Seal of Government, many of whom have never seen the territory. What little authority has been exercised in the territory has been centralized in Darwin, and to many who have never been in the tory are synonymous terms.

67,Mr Stewart,"I am glad to heaias Alice Springs will provide the facilities for not only marketing the cattle and other products of the southern portion of the territory, but also will eventually lead, I predict, to the extension of that line northwards. I was the first Commonwealth Minister to cross the southern border of the territory, and, as the result of that visit in 1923, I recommended the immediate provision of railway communication with Alice Springs. There were two alternative proposals. One was the extension of the Oodnadatta line to Alice Springs on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and the other, which I recommended for investigation before I left office, was the construction of a light 4-ft. 8-^-in. line from Kingoonya, on the east-west railway, to Alice Springs. I thought then, and still think, that the latter was the better proposal, the extension of the existing ' 3-ft. 6-in railway from Oodnadatta merely continuing the tragic break of gauge policy that has already proved all too costly for Australia. Had the connection been made between Kingoonya and Alice Springs, and had the RedH ill to Port Augusta line also been constructed at that time, it would have been possible to truck cattle direct from Alice Springs to the Adelaide market, without the break of gauge difficulties that now cause extra cost and delay, and without increasing the time of transit. That proposal, in conjunction with the suggested railway on the standard gauge from Port Augusta to Hay, would have laid the foundation of a great railway system which would have eventually proved of inestimable benefit in promoting Australian development. ThoughI have not visited the western part of Queensland, or the country that lies between it and the central part of the Northern Territory up through the Barkly Tablelands, the honourable member for Riverina, who is one of the unkindest critics of the territory in this House, has done so, and he has declared that it is well worthy of development. I do not accept the honourable member's doleful predictions in regard to the southern end of the territory. I realize that the stretch of country south of the Macdonnell ranges, down to Oodnadatta, is very poor, and that its rainfall is probbeen .given to them. ably the lowest in Australia; but north of the ranges, and east and west through to Burt Plains and Barrow Creek, the country is good, and the rainfall reasonable. . This great area could certainly be developed. There are also in the region of Barrow Creek mineral possibilities which, in my opinion, are very great. Tf we had similar low-grade ore deposits in the south they would be exploited immediately; but, unfortunately, it is impossible to get mining machinery into the north to mine the ore there. I consider that the extension of the railway line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs has been thoroughly justified. It will not be long before a strong agitation is set on foot to extend the line still further into the territory. This great interior cannot be developed, and should not be controlled, from either Darwin or Canberra. It is essential that adequate facilities should be provided for getting its produce to market. I appreciate the contention of the Minister that in these times of great financial difficulty, when it is impossible to spend very much money on developmental work in the territory, the maintenance of the existing machinery is not justified; but the saving of £8,000 or £9,000 a year by the means which the horiorable gentleman is now proposing will prove ultimately not to be a saving but a serious loss. The value of the work that is being done at present is not fully appreciated. It would be tragic if the passing of this bill should mean a reversion to the old order of things. That would, undoubtedly, be a backward step. To make it necessary for every order affecting this country to be given the approval of authorities in Canberra, which is even farther from the territory, in point of accessibility, than Melbourne, would be ridiculous. It is axiomatic that to ensure the development of a new country the local people must be given some measure of control over their own enterprises. A study of the history of the development of the United States of America and similar countries of very large areas, shows that the pioneers have always clamoured for a measure of local government, and that substantial progress has not been made until it has I realize that the Government has the numbers to force this bill through the House, but. I hope that the Minister, in replying to t.he suggestions that have been made for the development of our 'great interior, by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and certain other honourable members, will give an indication that the Government intends to grant some degree of self-government t.o these wonderful pioneers of the outback. It is no exaggeration to say that these people are wonderful pioneers. one who spends a single night under the stars in this vast, empty, silent land, realizes, to some extent at least, thc environment of these people, and appreciates the fact that they must know better than people who have never visited the country what is necessary for its development. I am not making tliese observations simply to fill in an idle hour. First, that other parts of it have vast possibilias the representative of a constituency which is helping to pay the losses incurred in the Northern Territory, and, secondly, as an Australian who desires to see this country developed, I appeal to the Government not to ""take the backward step that it is now proposing to take. able member know that the Government intends to take a backward step? bill will be' a backward step. I should like to interpret the honourable member's interjection as an intimation tliat the bill is to be withdrawn, but I fear that I would not be justified in doing so. I urge the Government to consider'carefully the speech delivered ou this measure by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, to whom I pay a. tribute for his keen interest in the welfare of his constituents and the lonely land in which they live. [Quorum formed]. has been the somewhat disturbing suggestion iu the speeches made on this bill that the Northern Territory is, to some extent at least, to be abandoned. I sincerely trust that nothing like that will occur. I point out, however, that there has never been a thoroughly scientific investigation of the possibilities of this huge province of the Commonwealth. People have visited the Territory at different times and expressed their opinion upon its possibilities. It has been said, for instance, that it is capable' of becoming a great cattle country. But before even this may be said with certainty, a great deal more, investigation will have to be made into the quality of the soils, the possibility of producing certain crop3, and the best methods of maintaining a regular supply of fodder for stock. This huge area has such a varying and irregular rainfall, and such a great diversity of ' soils, that nothing but a comprehensive scienAny tific survey of it can provide the Government with the information that it needs to formulate a proper policy of development. One honourable member opposite has said that, in his opinion, certain parts of the territory are not worthy of investigation; whereas other honourable members have asserted ties. This simply goes to prove my contention that a comprehensive survey by thoroughly qualified scientists should be made. I hold that, to ensure the successful settlement of any new country, it is imperative that a certain measure of control should be given to its pioneers. Those who provide the money and human energy for the development of these areas should, be consulted as fully as possible on all thc problems which arise from time to time. Centralized government has been detrimental, not only to the Northery Territory, but also to other great areas of Australia. I shall oppose any policy which will prevent thc people of the Nortliern Territory from exercising an influence upon their own affairs. These people should be given facilities for advising the Government on the exjienditure of public money, aud the development of the land in the territory. Any scientific information that can be obtained, which may have a bearing upon the successful development of the Northern Territory, should -There he made available to the settlers there.

We, in Australia, are inclined to lie apathetic with regard to the development of the Northern Territory. should be possible to induce people, possessed of pioneering instincts, to come to Australia from other countries and settle in the territory.

Northern Territory, with an area of more than 500,000 square miles, provides a national problem which, in its immensity, transcends all party considerations. It challenges us to take steps for its proper government and development. Australia has been-entrusted with mandates in New Guinea and the Pacific, and if we are unable to develop our own mainland, it may well be claimed that we are not able to govern those other territories which have been committed to our care. I enormous problems associated with the government of the Northern Territory. Mr P. C. Urquhart, a former administrator Qf the territory, writes of it as follows :Tlie white population on the SOth of June of that year (1924) numbered 2,249, which, as [40] an index of the progress made in 100 years, i3depressing, and although there has been an increase. since,; the figures , on -30th,June, 4,^2,8, being 2,045,Vthis .is' 'due 'protablyV.to railway work undertaken by the .

Even 'this latter figure, when contrasted with those for 1901 (the earliest available to the writer), which showed a total white population of 4,073, is the reverse of encouraging . . . Are we then to say that the net results of 105 years of Britisli occupation, the last eighteen of which have been directly under the Federal Government of Australia, .are a very small and stagnant, if not diminishing, white population, with an increasing and liiore fecund coloured population gradually overtaking their number settled in an undeveloped and bankrupt territory with. small prospect of any material improvement iu any future that is not remote? That is rather a pathetic picture to draw of any part of Australia. We who live in the cities do not realize what the It residents of the territory have to put up with, and the discouragements they have received at the hands of successive governments One can compare the Northern Territory in its relation to the rest of Australia, with what California was to the United States 100 years ago. California was looked upon as a failure. The desert which intervenes between it and the Eastern States was an eveidasting problem, which was only solved by establishing proper communications. Unfortunately, the United States, not being guided by any equivalent of our excellent "" White Australia "" doctrine, allowed coloured labour to exploit a part of its west coast districts. We have refused to allow the Northern Territory The to be developed in. that way, and in consequence its development has been retarded. It behoves us, however, to attack our own problem, settle a thriving population in the territory, and make it flourish as California has done as one of the United States of America. Darwin is on the direct air route of any possible service between Australia and England, via the East Indies. We hear, every now and then of aviators, flying admit, of course, that there are from England to Australia, dropping into Darwin as their first place of call in Australia.

I said. ber said that it was a decision of the caucus. say that it was a decision of the Government-whic h is worse. Instead of compelling these men to hold their demonstrations on some common land, the Government allowed itself to be bluffed into permitting them to demonstrate in the streets whenever they choose. Some of these men were fined, and others sentenced to imprisonment, for the offences they had committed. The Minister again intervened; the convictions were quashed, and the fines were remitted. That action typifies the administration of the Northern Territory by the present Minister and Government. I have no wish to give the debate a party flavour; my object is merely to draw attention to what is happening on the economic side, which proves the truthof the contention of the Northern Territory pastoral lessees, that the problem of the territory is entirely an economic one. This industrial pantomime must end. When the Resident takes any action, he should be supported through thick and any unemployed mobs, irresponsibles, "" reds ""-cal l them what you will. These men actually flew the red flag in Darwin for months* Until that sort of thing is put down, until the Government takes a firm stand on the side of the people as a whole, there will be no development in the Northern Territory. I applaud the speech of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, which omitted only the economic aspect of the problem. I I agree that they know that at different times he has taken a firm stand in opposition to the extreme elements. I exhort him to go still further, and to make it plain that no nonsense will be tolerated by him or any other responsible person.. I trust that he It will continue his efforts to suppress the lawless elements. It is known that, at one time, the unemployed refused to sweep gutters for less than £1 Is. a day, saying that such work was fit only for blackfellows. On that occasion, however, the local Labour people stood firm. The problem of the Northern Territory has geographical as well as economic features. I ask the Minister to study the matter carefully, and endeavour to convert into a valuable asset what at present is an embarrassing liability. I urge him not to abolish the North AusI withdraw that, and tralian Commission, but to allow the expenditure upon that body to continue. The saving of such a small amount, in the circumstances, would be false economy. He should permit these men to go ahead with the work that they are doing, and, so far as he can do so, to deal with their recommendations in a non-party spirit. [5.10] -S o far, the attempts of the Eederal Government to assist the development of the Northern Territory can be said to have failed. Unfortunately, the present Government has no proposal for the improvement of the conditions in the territory; it merely proposes to abolish the commission that was appointed some three years ago. The right thing would be to allow the commission to continue to function, and to extend to it powers that should have been vested in it in the first place. Many suggestions have been made by honourable members on both sides regarding",25,Blakeley

82,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"tlie steps that should be taken to improve the conditions in this territory, upon the development of which large sums have beeu spent without success. We should regard the territory as' one that must be developed primarily by the grazing industry, in conjunction with the exploitation of its mineral possibilities. The first essential is to assist the man on the land by the provision of adequate supplies of water. visited the territory must realize the grave disadvantage under which the land holders there labour on account of the scarcity of water and the cost of providing it. If we were to expend our energies, as well as the necessary capital, in providing a water sujiply, we should improve the carrying capacity of the land and increase its wealth with the lowest possible expenditure. I am not disposed to agree to the proposal that the Alice Springs railway should be continued; it would be a colossal error to build that line for very many years. If at any time a railway should be found necessary, it should be built from Darwin to the Queensland border, linking up with extensions of the various Queensland line's and connecting with the New South Wales railways at Bourke. Such a line would best serve the valuable country in the Northern Territory, and also open up excellent pastoral lands in the far western portion of Queensland. It would be far more advantageous to Australia than any line that would give effect to any promise that may have been made in the past. But, although a Queenslander, I am bound to admit that at the present rime such a railway is not justified. We must develop the grazing possibilities of rhe territory, and provide means of transable for such investigation. Throughout port not to markets in the southern parts of Australia, but to outside markets by the establishment of a port. It appears to be generally conceded that port facilition. This National Parliament before ties can best, be provided at the Pellew Islands, at the mouth of the McArthur River, above Borroloola. I have not had an opportunity to visit much of the Northern Territory, but I have travelled over the eastern portion, and can say that the land on the Barkly Tableland, and in from Avon Downs, is quite capable of raising sheep; in fact, it was doing so at the time of ^ my i-.visit. It would be far better to 'develop that port so as to enable us to export the products of the territory, than to expend millions of pounds on railways to bring those products into further competition with similar products of the southern parts of Australia. If that were doneand this Parliament should be big enough to do it-w e would prevent a repetition of the utter failure of the cattle and sheep raising industries and the turmoil Auy one who has in the meat-works that have happened in the past. This Parliament should extend to the commission power to deal with the problems of the territory, and thus enable both the employers and employees in industry there to work to the advantage of the country generally. When we speak of developing ports in the territory we must not forget that we have practically little or no money to spend, and that we have various ports established on the coasts of Australia which are undeveloped and which, by co-operation on the part of the Commonwealth and the States, might be made revenue producing. While some of our ports are lying idle, it is useless for us to talk of opening fresh ports. Some honourable members have rightly said that if a science branch were established in the territory, to investigate plant and animal diseases, certain good would emanate. But a similar argument can be applied in respect of the various States. Many of our railways arc not paying to-day simply because the adjacent land is lying idle. That land will be of no use until scientific investigation has discovered a method of developing it. This Parliament has not encouraged any such research. In my district there is an extensive area of land, known as the Wallan country, availAustralia various lands adjacent to our existing railways are lying idle, and earning nothing towards the cost of construcit decides to build a railway from Alice Springs northward in order to develop the territory, before it expends large sums of money in scientific research in that great unknown country, should, when money is available, offer facilities to the States in order to bring about an increased development on lands contiguous to existing railway lines. Much of that class of land is owned by the Grown, ancl it is locked up because there ia no known method of bringing it into production. Instead of expending money as has been suggested in the territory,"" we should devote some of our time and energy to applying the moneys that are available to the development of idle lands lying adjacent to our existing railways. appointed, inquiries have been made by the Public Works Committee, and experts have reported on the possibility of opening up territory lands by means of railways, but, because of the enormous cost of haulage, little, if any, advantage would be derived by bringing the products of the territory into competition with those of the south. It would be far better to develop the territory by establishing a centre tliere at which to manufacture meat products, and wool and frozen meat could be exported from a port in the north such as Borroloola or Darwin. I hope that the Government will withdraw the bill so as to permit the commission, consisting as it does of practical men who have now had three years' experience in the territory, to carry on along the lines indicated in their report until such time as money is available for the proper development of the territory. The Government should not overlook the vast potentialities of that country, both in commission was appointed. The Minisregard to its pastoral industry and its mineral deposits. We know from the evidence of persons who have lived on stations along the border that there are in the territory, awaiting development, vast agricultural lands which will become extremely valuable once water facilities are provided. We should permit the commission to carry on the work that it has already commenced in that direction. That, I consider, would be a sound policy for this Government to adopt. The introduction of this hill is one of the pettiest of the little meannesses that the Government has perpetrated in its effort to avoid making all-round reductions that it knows should be made. The Minister claims that this legislation will save some £8^000 or £9,000 a year, and have the effect of putting the administration of the territory back approximately to where it was before the commission was appointed. If that is so, the work of inspecting the roads and stock routes will in future ife under the Works Department. I have with me the report of a distinguished engineer who visited the Northern Territory and reported on it to the last Government. This is what he says in regard to stock routesThe provision of water and watering places along the stock routes is absolutely essential, A commission has been and a considerable amount of work has been done in that respect, but, from inquiries I made, I formed the opinion that there was not sufficient co-ordination between the Government departments and the public, and that the bores were sometimes unreliable, especially in matters of equipment, and that maintenance was deficient . . . A report was received by the Government Secretary, Darwin, in March, 1925, after au inspection had been made by a mounted constable stationed at Newcastle Waters, to the effect that(a) All the windmills required immediate oiling and minor repairs, and, in some cases, new buckets. (i>) Four pumps were out of order, (c) The troughs all contained water, (fi) The tanks were in three cases dry, one was f u l l , and the others had from fl inches to 5 feet of water. It seems to me common sense that water stations that are not thoroughly reliable are worse than none at all, as a drover may be in serious difficulty if he has depended on watering his stock, and finds no water, whereas, if he had not been led to expect water, he would have made his plans accordingly. That is one illustration of the sort of administration in existence before this ter has taken up the attitude that it was appointed to carry out a big developmental scheme, and that because we have not the funds necessary for carrying out such a scheme we must return to the former system of administration. I hope that in so doing we shall not return to the former mistakes. Apparently the Government claims to be Heaven-sent. No doubt it is proud of its solution of the unemployment problem. The Minister sponsoring this bill was actually responsible for the somersault over the suggestion of a lottery in Canberra. scheme has ever been suggested for the Northern Territory. not be so.

But the placing of the control of that territory under a department at Canberra must, inevitably result in second-rate administration. This commission was instituted, not only to carry out big developmental works, but also .to obtain some continuity in respect of works already being carried out. It is obvious that we cannot carry through any ambitious scheme of public works in the territory. Such a scheme may be desirable lilt'imately, but to-day we cannot afford it. scheme, there can be a tremendous amount of assistance given to the people of the territory if the minor works are persevered with, and if those that have been constructed are kept in repair. If the water facilities along the stock routes are kept up to the mark, comparatively good transit will be assured for the cattle industry-the main industry of the territory-and if new bores are sunk as funds become available, that industry will receive considerable impetus. members who have referred to the expenditure on the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs as a total waste. One honourable member stated that the cattle should be exported from ports in the north instead of being brought from the south. He overlooked the fact that the cattle sent southwards from Alice Springs are not exported. The pastoral industry will have to extend enormously before an export trade from South Australian ports will develop. Adelaide has been one of the best importing and consuming meat markets in the world for as long as I can remember, and the construction of a railway to bridge the belt of dry numbers of cattle are sent to Alice country around Lake Eyre has already been of great benefit to the Northern Territory cattle industry. ""With the provision of more water supplies along the stock, routes leading.^ to Alice Springs, the advantages or the railway will b.e..greatly increased. I agree with the/, honourable' member ""for Riverina"" (' Mr Killen')"" that the cattlebreeders ih 'the territory, cannot always expect to receive for -their beef' the famine prices they'' .have enjoyed, recently in Adelaide.

The railway has opened a steady market for Northern Territory cattle at prices considerably higher than were available at any previous time, except during the war. I am not advocating the extension of the railway northward at the present time. The principal advantage of the existing section is that it bridges the-dry area about Lake Eyre. Cattle-breeders with whom 1 am well acquainted,, and whose stations in the territory I have visited, have told me that in four or five I differ from honourable years out of six they can get their cattle to Alice Springs in good condition; whereas they could only get them to Oodnadatta on the hoof in about one season in six.

I understand from lessees that the stock routes have been in better order since the commission has been functioning than they .were before, whilst the roads also have improved. In an inexpensive way roads have been better surveyed and cleared, and crossings have been provided ' over bad watercourses. Generally a lot has been done to open up the territory for motor traffic and relieve the isolation of the residents. That policy must continue if we are not to fall down on the job of developing the territory. continued stumbling will involve two serious consequences.

I am not sure Failure or whether the honourable member for Calare intends to support or oppose the bill. The honourable member for Boothby, whilst in general sympathy with the measure, indicated his intention to support the amendment foreshadowed by the Secondly, the honourable member for the Northern Territory to provide for the election of a body that will exercise executive power.

I listened with great interest to the speech on this bill delivered on the 7th November by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), and when I again read it recently, I was as much impressed as I was on hearing it! I marvel, with the honourable member for New England( Mr proposal. I would prefer the withdrawal Thompson), that the practical advice of the honourable member for tlie Northern Territory seems not to have received the consideration to which it is entitled. Why has his experience been ' ignored ? There are men in Australia who have spent practically a lifetime in battling with the difficulties to be encountered in the territory, aud they have paid heavily for the experience they have gained. One wonders why their advice is not sought by the Government. The criticism of the bill has been one of unanimous condemnation of the principle embodied in it. The honourable member for the Northern Territory went to the length of saying that, if the system proposed by the Minispastoral industry, and the only other proter were adopted, the Government would be reverting to a method that experience has proved a pre-eminent failure. The honourable member also told us that if this bill were to be taken as indicative of the administrative ability of the Ministry, the the .mining industry, the product of the settlers might as well hand their land back to the authorities. That is strong language from a man who generally supports the Government. He has, no doubt, expressed, not only his own opinion, but that of those by whom he is sent here. I do not"" know whether the Government intends to accept the amendment of which notice has been given. evidence goes to show that the adoption of the system embodied in the bill would be a retrograde step, I shall vote against the measure if the Minister persists iu taking it to a. division. most difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the wisdom or otherwise of abolishing the North Australia Commission. On the one hand the Minister says that the commission is an excrescence, and serves no useful purpose, while, on the other hand, the honourable member for the Northern Territory has submitted many arguments in favour of its continuance. One thing certain is that the Bruce scheme gave the people of the Northern Territory the only element of self-government that they have ever possessed. I understand that the Minister intends to accept an amendment by the honourable member for the Northern Territory to divide the country into four divisions, each to have a distinct representative. ThatI consider an excellent of the bill; but, failing that, the proposal outlined by the honourable member should receive the endorsement of the House. The most pressing need of the territory is very little government and a great deal of private enterprise, and the. latter can be promoted only by giving inducement to settlers to go there. So soon as any government provides that inducement, the Northern Territory will begin to prosper. It is certain that no person will settle in the territory until he is satisfied that he can make more money there than in any other part of Australia. One way in which the territory may be developed is by the fitable method is by the encouragement of the mining industry. The advantage is all in favour of the pastoral industry, because, while facilities would have to be provided for carrying off the product of pastoral industry, generally speaking, could walk off itself. It is unfortunate that a promise was given to South Australia that Adelaide would be linked up by railway with Darwin.

Unfortunately, too many Ministers for Home Affairs have considered it to be their duty to meddle in the local administration of the territory. The present Minister has proved no exception to the rule in that respect. He offers us a saving of £8,000 o.r £9,000 a year as a result of the ajbolition of the North Australia Commission,and-he says that that money will be spent in providing water for stock. As an economy measure, this proposal has nothing to recommend it. The Minister has nothing tangible to offer as a substitute for the commission. Many .times £8,000 or £9,000 could be saved in other directions, and I hope that, even at this late hour, the Minister will withdraw the bill.

112,Mr Blakeley,"I have no need topractice in every country town in New South Wales, if not in the other States of the Commonwealth, is the exception in Darwin. During tlie last three months, I addressed over twenty meetings in the main streets of various country, towns in New South Wales. obtained to hold the meetings. mits are not necessary in New South Wales. The police take care to divert the traffic from the main streets when political meetings are in progress. In these circumstances, I was astounded when I heard that men had been arrested for obstructing the traffic in Darwin when they had merely held a public meeting. If the whole population of Darwin assembled in the main street, the traffic could still move without inconvenience. The carrying of this bill will not adversely affect the administration of North Australia. . Practically the same officers who now administer the land laws-and they are men of long experience-wil l continue to do so; the same officers of the Works Department will remain there; and the same men will control the railways. The difference will be that the work will cost less than in the last four years. In my speech in introducing this bill, I paid a tribute to the North Australia Commission for the valuable work it has done. I have no doubt that ultimately the plans of the commission will be carried into effect. But"" it would be ridiculous to continue a commission which was appointed mainly for developmental purposes when the Government has no money available for developmental works. The last Government had plenty of money, but carefully refrained from spending any of it in North Australia, and so prevented the commission from doing the work it was intended to do. Sittint/ suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.. not' have been done or rather, the members have described the proposed abolition of the Northern Territory Commission as a retrograde step, particularly if it is not intended to substitute any other form of-local control. It was the intention of the Government, to increase, the powers of the present, advisory.councils, but in other respects to allow them to continue functioning as they had been doing since their inception. However, the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has discussed with me a scheme for granting greater powers to an elective council for the whole of the Northern Territory, and the Government has accepted the scheme. I wish to impress upon honourable members that there can be uo half-way house between full and complete local autonomy and control by the central government. This problem has arisen both in connection with Papua and the Federal Capital Territory. While the central government is expending large sums of money upon the development of such territories, it must of necessity exercise control over estimates and expenditure. The proposal advanced by the honourable member for the Northern Territory covers this point, so that the control of expenditure will remain in the hands of the central government. council have? make ordinances, and participate in the government of the territory regarding matters which do not involve increased expenditure. For instance, the Government's responsible officers might recommend that certain works be undertaken, such as sinking wells or bores, erecting cattle dips, taking measures to prevent the distribution of buffalo fly or tick, or that alterations be made in railway timetables, &c. When the proposals and estimates are placed before the advisory council, comprising men drawn from all parts of the territory, the council may, in its -wisdom, recommend that the proposals be varied in certain particulars. It might suggest that bores, instead of being put down on the Western Australian side, should be put down on the main stock route. During fhe term of the commission various works have been carried out which, in the opinion of residents, should money should have been spent on similar work in other portions of the territory where the need was greater. While tlit elective advisory council will have power to make recommendations, in this way, its powers in other directions will be restricted. be a purely advisory council.",33,Blakeley

The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) said that, even under the proposed system, the control of the territory would still be centred in Canberra. In essential matters that will be so, but the same applies to Papua and the Federal Capital Territory. In the case of the Federal Capital Territory, of course, there can be no objection on that 3Core, because the seat of administration is actually in theterritory itself. As I explained before, the authority which is supplying the money for development must exercise control over its expenditure. quarters of the council be situated ? against its effectiveness. the most thickly populated centre, and is on the direct line of communication. selves, uot so much with governing the population, as with developing the territory. the Advisory Council is to be representative of all sections of the population within the territory.

PROWSE I believe that it would be better to.have the headquarters of the council somewhere in the centre of thc territory. system of control is instituted, it must be are comparatively free from taxation. subject to the Federal Government in Canberra. The proposed method of control is no different from that brought into being when the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) was a member of the Federal Government. Without desiring to introduce party politics into this non-controversial discussion, may I point out to my friends opposite that the disadvantages which they profess to see in the Government's proposals must have also been preseut under the system of control by the commission, because the method of administration is practically the same in both cases? What were virtues in the system inaugurated by the last Government have evidently, in the minds of honourable member's opposite, become sins when embodied ment. There has been a good deal oftalking with tongue in cheek this afternoon, I am afraid, and I am constrained to add-agai n without auy desire to ruffle the. calm waters of debate-that there has been just the slightest suggestion of stonewalling as well. I do not propose to follow the example of my honourable friends opposite, and shall conclude on this note: I feel confident and optimistic regarding the future of the Northern Territory. The land is tliere, the rainfall is mostly adequate, aud the climate is suitable. I am certain that when the overseas market for beef improves, the future of the territory will be assured. If prices could have been maintained at the level which prevailed during the war, the Northern Territory would will militate be much more developed and more prosperous that it is to-day. It has been said that prospective settlers are faced with many disabilities. I admit that, but the system of land tenure is not one of them. Leases which had been transferred from the South Australian Land Act were, when made subject to the land ordinances of the territory, extended for 42 years at rentals varying from 2s. to 5s. per square mile, which works out at a fraction of a penny per acre. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that the rentals are too high, and who wants greater security of tenure than a lease extending to 1965? customs taxation. is no heavier there than elsewhere"". One of the great disabilities settlers have to face is the lack of railway communication with the south. They are too far from the markets, and it costs too much to get their stock to ""them.

After the agreement was ratified by the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments,, the question of the railway from Port Augusta to Adelaide was referred to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the reference being made by motion moved in this House on the 29th January, 1926. The report of that committee was submitted in due course, and its finding was as follows:After considering the matter in all its aspects the committee agreed to recommend that the proposal for the extension of .the trans-Australian Eailway from Port Augusta to KedH ill and the laying of a third rail to provide a railway of 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge on the Soutli Australian 5-ft. 3-iu. gauge railway between RedH ill and the Central Railway Station, Adelaide, be approved. A reference to the report of the com* mittee, which, by the way, was dated tha 24th April, 1926, .will show that it went to great pains to examine the matter,, and made exhaustive investigation on the question of the third rail between Red Hill and Adelaide, and its finding was definitely in favour of the railway provided for in the agreement of the 18th September, 1925, giving a standard gauge connection between the trans-Australian railway and the Central Railway Station in Adelaide. This railway, when constructed, will afford many advantages. It will remove breaks of gauge at Terowie and Port Augusta, and will increase the traffic on the trans-:Australian railway to a considerable extent. Among other advantages it w ill (a) Reduce by about 72 miles the length of the journey between Adelaide and Port Augusta, and the time occupied by five hours. An example of the circuitous route of the present raihvay to Adelaide, which lies almost due south of Port Augusta, is the fact that three and a half liours after leaving Port Augusta the train is further north than at the 'commencement of the journey.

The sums necessary for these works will be provided in the estimates of exnenditure to be submitted to Parliament in thc usual way. Leader of the Opposition is attempting to be facetious. There is no need for a bill to authorize the work of laying the third rail which w ill be carried out under the agreement of the 18th September, 1925, by the South Australian Railways Commissioner by arrangement with the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, at the expense of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Railways Department estimated the annual revenue from the line from Port Augusta to ' Adelaide £100,755,. and the annual expenses at £63,S79, including the Commonwealth's proportion of expenditure in workiug and maintaining the RedH ill to Adelaide railway and allowing for the.South Aus-. tralian . proportion of Commonwealth expenditure in working and maintaining the railway between RedH ill and a point near Port Pirie. charges on the same basis are calculated at £77,999, leaving an estimated annual loss on the working of the Commonwealth trains, and traffic between Port Augusta and Adelaide of £41,123. Against this it is estimated that by the building of this line the financial, results of the 'transAustralian. railway ' w ill beimproved to the extent of £35,000, and the extra traffic from ^Oodnadatta to the Alice Springs extension* over ..the Pdrt Augusta to Red show a net profit of £13,023. There : fore, it is calculated that the line will, after paying working expenses and interest, show a profit of about £6,900 per annum. The estimates of the earnings and expenditure were prepared some time prior to the previous introduction of the b ill to the House: The earnings for the calendar year 1924 formed the basis of the estimated annual This bill provides for the revenue. During that year, the earnings were considerably lower than in the years that followed. On the trans-Australian railway they were lower even than for the year just passed, during which depression caused a considerable diminution of trade. Therefore, the earnings of the new line may be assumed to be calculated on a conservative basis, whilst the estimates of expenditure may be reO u t of revenue? garded as reasonably approaching present No ; apparently the day conditions.

A few months ago, I had the pleasure of officially opening the new Grafton to South Brisbane railway, the first stage in the unification of railway gauges.

He pointed out that, although it. was not intended to duplicate taxation by imposing it on a company *md then on that company's shareholders, this wns not made sufficiently clear. I said that the tax would be paid by the company, and would not be imposed on its shareholders also. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that the resolution did not remove the possibility of some portion of a distributed amount on which tax had been taxed again, and he therefore asked the Government to reconsider the matter in order to safeguard the public. To do this I propose to move an amendment, ' the object being to make sure that there shall be no second payment of the tax. The Leader of the Opposition has been furnished with a copy of my proposed amendment. He also asked that taxation should not be imposed on a holding company, but should be passed on to the individual shareholders. that, if a company earning its income from ordinary business, and uot therefore subject to this property tax, passes on some of its profits to a second companya should be collected, not fro m the holding company, but from its shareholders when its profits are passed on to them in dividends. That is a suggestion which the Government cannot accept. It would alter the basis of the present company taxation. If we were reviewing the whole incidence of taxation, there might be justification for considering such a proof the Government is to levy super tax on anything in the nature of interest and dividends from property. We are compelled to raise increased revenue in order that the affairs of the Commonwealth may be carried on, and we cannot agree to an amendment which would cut substantially into the revenue that we have estimated to receive from this extra taxation. In dealing with this matter previously, in connection with the Income Tax Assessment B ill , we estimated that we should receive £1,500,000 as the proceeds of the tax; but, as the result of amendments that the Government itself has made, and those suggested by honourable members on both sides which have been accepted by the Government, that estimate has been reduced by at least one-third, and it is doubtful now if we shall receive quite £1,000,000. Under these circumstances, and reluctantly, fhe Government feels compelled to resist any attempt to amend the proposal in the direction suggested by the Leader of the Opposition; but it is submitting an amendment to make sure that there shall be no double taxation as between a company which has paid tax and a sharepaid by a company being holder who has participated in the company's profits. I hope that honourable members will agree to my amendment, and accept as a general compromisebecause that is the spirit in which I have attempted to approach the matter-the concessions already made, which have cut substantially into the estimated revenue. I hope that they w ill not agree to the amendment, hinted at by the Leader of the Opposition. agree that the Acting Treasurer has He suggested approached this legislation in a spirit, of compromise, and has endeavoured to meet the objections raised on this side of the chamber. He courteously sent to me yesterday a copy of the amendment which holding company-the tax he intends to propose, and I have examined it . I agree that it carries out the real intention of the Government in a more satisfactory way than did the resolution as originally drawn. There are, however, some other points to which I think reference ought to be made,",42,Income Taxbill No 2 1930
150,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,Acting Trea,43,Income Taxbill No 2 1930
151,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [ 9 . 7 ],"Idespite the statement by the Acting Treasurer that the main object of this legislation is to obtain increased revenue. All honourable members recognize that it is useless to object to the proposal on the ground that it imposes further charges upon the public; that is the very object of this legislation. There are, however, incidental features which it is desirable that the .committee and the public should f u l ly understand. One of those matters, to which the Minister has made no reference, was mentioned by me when speaking on the resolution. There has always been a complaint that persons with small in comes, whose rate of taxation was less than the company flat rate' were unjustly treated in not being allowed f u l l rebate of the company flat rate. This rate is now Is. 4d. in the £ 1 , and it is charged on the income of the company. ""When a company's income is distributed to shareholders by way of dividends, each shareholder is entitled to a rebate of Is. 4d. in the £ 1 ; but if he pays no income tax he gets no rebate, as the rebate is made on the taxation paid. Accordingly, he is charged more than is absolutely just. This injustice, I admit, has been permitted to, continue for many years on account of administrative and otlier difficulties. This legislation,-however, aggravates the injustice by making the'company pay 2s. lOd. in the case of certain income; that is, Is. 4d. in the £ 1 , which is the existing flat rate, and an additional Is. fid. in the property taxation. The injustice done to the small shareholder will, therefore, be gravely accentuated. centage of taxpayers involved? a number of persons enjoy small incomes made up. of dividends, upon which they live entirely, and certainly would not pay anything like 2s. lOd. as their, proper individual rate. I suggested that since the amount has now reached 2s. 10d. in' the £ 1 , it is worthy of consideration whether a method of giving relief, ought not to be worked out, as the present system imposes such heavy taxation on per-' sons, some of whom should be entirety-' exempt, from, income tax. y l . should' like' to hear the conclusion . that 'the .Acting Treasurer has reached on-'that point, if Be' has had 'an opportunity to consider j f : A further matter to which I invite the attention of the committee is the meaning of paragraph c of clause 2 of the resolution. 'This clause imposes tax upon the taxable income derived by any person "" in the course of carrying on a business, where the income is of such a class that, if derived otherwise than in the course of carrying on a business, it would be income from property."" I have tried hard to ascertain the meaning of those words. I have sought assistance on the subject, and I have been unable, up to the present time, to discover one case to which those words would apply. They are unnecessary for the purpose of covering interest earned hy a company from investments, or from an ordinary profit-making enterprise, such as money-lending, because interest is already covered under paragraph i of clause 2. I suggest that there may be a risk of misunderstanding and of litigation over this provision, unless the Minister is able to show plainly what those words mean. The final point that I would mention is that, under the resolution as now drawn, some moneys will, in effect, be doubly taxed. I should like the committee to follow me through one or two examples which I shall give in order to show that this is the case. First, take the case of a company which receives income from rents. Such income is, of course, taxable under this measure. . If it is subsequently distributed in the form, of dividends, it is then taxable in the hands of the shareholders, but they may obtain a rebate if the company has: paid the I tax.' That is f a i r enough. But COIIT sider the effect of this legislation in the-' case of a company which derived, say, I cannot ssy. .Quite £10,000 fro m rents in 192S-29, and.:dis-. tributed it in the. following year to another company which this year paid it in, dividends, to individual shareholders. The position' would be that the second company would pay Is. 6d.' in t h e ' £ l on the £10,000 it received, and could not claim a rebate because the original company had not ' paid taxation, as the provision was not in force when the payment, was made, while the individual Hvoul'd pay another Is. 6d. in the' £1 'on' dividends received"" in 1930-31. because he did not receive, the. money u n t i l ' t h e succeeding ' year. Therefore., the Commonwealth would'collect-Is. 6d.'",43,Income Taxbill No 2 1930
152,Mr Oinitiw,What would be the per,44,Income Taxbill No 2 1930
153,. Mr Latham,"in the £1 on £20,000-although the amount of income involved would be only £10,000. : be subject -to this taxation without any exemption? the £200 exemption. I ask honourable members to observe that the second company could not get a rebate of the taxation because .the first company had not paid it, as the provision was not in operation when it paid, the money over, whereas the individual who this year received the dividends could not claim a rebate because this tax would not have been paid on the .income previously. to the first year. an injustice that double taxation should be imposed on such earnings, simply because the money received by a company last year was not distributed until this year. received an income from rents last year did not pay this taxation upon it ; but the involved in the first place only £113,000. taxation will be payable on income from rents received by a company last year and distributed to a shareholder this year. To put it in another way, the taxation would not be payable by an individual landlord, but it would be payable by a company landlord. It is difficult to justify such a distinction between a company and individuals in respect to money earned in the same period. This could only happen in the case of dividends; it could not happen in the case of interest, rents, or royalties hot paid away as dividends. place a heavy burden upon a particular class of individual, although there was no substantial difference between his income and similar income earned by other sections of the community. Let me give another example, the details of which have been supplied to me. I shall take the case of income which passes through the hands of two companies into the hands of individual shareholders:These are the actual figures of an existing company -. CompanyA distributed to company B in 1928-29. dividends totalling £113,000; company B, out of, these, dividends, .distributed to shareholders C in 1929i30 £l'i2,000. Company. A in 1929-30 obtained,as income from its business, not income from property in the sense of this legislation, £109,000 out of which it distributed to company B in the same period £104,000. Out of this £104,000, company B distributed to shareholders C in 1930-31, £103,000.' In such a case this tax -would operate in this way: Company. A would not be taxable upon such incoAie as it derived it from its business, because ... that would not be income from property as provided for in this bill. CompanyB would be taxable in respect of the 1929-30 dividend income of £104,000 received from company A. Shareholders C would be taxable on the 1929-30 dividend income of £112,000 received from company B, paid by that company out of the dividend of £113,000 received from company A in 1928-29. The total income on which the tax would be collected for 1929-30 would, therefore, be equal to two years' income, and amount to £216,000, although the amount actually An individual who received by the shareholders would be only £112,000, and the maximum amountThis would be the surprising result of the operation of these provisions in the first year. It has been suggested that the position might be met by imposing this special tax of Is. 6d. in the £1, only upon dividends in the hands of the shareholders. There is a good deal to be said for that view. Section 21 of the act would ensure that if companies failed to distribute dividends to shareholders the taxation could, nevertheless, be levied by the commissioner. There is, however, this objection, that companies would be Such a distinction would able to retain one-third of their profits undistributed,and to that extent. there would be a loss to the revenue. holders C be able to claim a rebate?. was earned in 1928-29 aud the company did. not pay -this taxation on it.

161,Mr Latham,"Section 21 largelyup to two-thirds of the profits, as he may determine could reasonably have been distributed. I do not think that the Government desires to impose double taxation on the same income; but this will be done in respect of dividends in the circumstances that I have outlined, if the provision is not altered. I suggest, thereeach with £100 can, by forming a comfore, that the Acting Treasurer ( Mr pany, start a considerable business which Lyons) should give the matter careful attention. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr This double taxation will fall almost Latham) has been dealing with a difficult subject. The two points that he has made are, however, important. He has shown that under this provision double taxation will be imposed on income which comes to shareholders in holding companies, from profits earned in 1928-29 by one company, and distributed to the holding company in the same year, and subsequently paid to individual shareholders in 1929-30, and on the other hand, dividends received by. the holding company in the same year will also be taxable. The holding company would be unable to obtain a rebate because the original company had not paid tax upon the money. The figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition are correct, and the Acting Treasurer should give them serious consideration. In section 16 /; 1 and 2 there is a proviso which exempts from taxation dividends received by shareholders after the . commencement of the act out of profits accumulated by a company before the act came into operation. such proviso were inserted to prevent holding -companies from being taxed on profits earned by the original operating company prior to the commencement of the act, it would obviate double taxation in the first year. There is also to be considered the position of small shareholders having to pay tax on incomes which, if received from other sources, would be exempt altogether. There is no reason why shareholders should be treated differently from other taxpayers. A man drawing £200 income in rent is receiving it from property'just as much as a man receiving dividends from a company; yet the man receiving income from rent is granted exemption, while the shareholder will receive no exemption at all, as the company will have paid on the full amount. Most of our taxation laws treat companies as if they were something that had no right to live. As a matter of fact, companies should be encouraged. One man with £100 cannot do much, but 100 men may grow into a large one, and give a great deal of employment. entirely upon persons in receipt of small incomes. Thc large holding companies will be able to rearrange their holdings in such a way as to avoid double taxation. They may be affected the first year, but after that-n o doubt at some benefit to lawyers and skilled accountants-the y will re-draw their articles of asspciation, or make such other dispositions as are necessary, so as to avoid double taxation in the future. But a company which is trading in a small way will probably not find it worth its while to go to such expense. The Government ought to be particularly on its guard against injuring the small companies, especially as it is a Labour Government. The supporters qf the Government make no secret of the fact that they are out to attack anything successful, anything which has got on and is helpful to the country. That is part of their policy. They are always out to damage rather than help the large and successful show, and they profess special sympathy for persons or firms in a small If some way. I trust that the Government will see its way to accept the suggestions of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter). surer) [9.38] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) asked that some relief be given to the smaller taxpayers who, in ordinary circumstances, would not as individuals be taxable at all, or would, at any rate, receive the benefit of the rebate provisions. I think I covered his objections by the general statement that we cannot upset the very basis of company taxation.

""Leader of the Opposition also referred to paragraph c of clause 2, and his statement in this connection gave me a great deal of satisfaction. In common with most other honourable members of this House, I have great respect for the honourable gentleman's knowledge of taxation legislation, and I was therefore delighted at his admissiou that he. does not know what this clause means.

After all, we cannot be expected to understand all the ramifications of such legislation as this, and if it is obscure to the Leader of the Opposition, we may be excused for failing to make anything of it. I am assured, however, by the taxation officers that this clause has been put in as a special safeguard so that no class of property income will be allowed to escape taxation. In ordinary circumstances there might be some doubt with regard to ono or two forms of income, and this clause is put in to make the position absolutely secure for the Treasury. be put to still further expense by having to employ taxation experts to make out their returns. department will attend to that. It has been claimed that there will be double taxation of certain incomes during the first year of the operation of this tax. As a matter of fact, I am not prepared to agree that there will actually be double taxation, because we shall be dealing with amounts that have been earned or distributed in separate years, and on each year's earnings a tax of Is. 6d. in the £1 will be collected. I admit that there are difficulties inseparable from the application of a new system of taxation bf this kind. sidered this matter since it was raised by the Leader of the Opposition, and, with departmental officers, have eiir The deavoured to find some means of obviating the difficulties without sacrificing too much revenue: It does not seem possible for that fo be done. Reluctantly, therefore, we must reject the proposal because, if the Government is to be carried on, it is essential, among other things, that this extra revenue be raised. are not basing our objection ou a claim that the same money will be taxed twice. Our point is that a sum of money which has beeu earned in a previous year-per haps five or six years before the commencement of the act-bu t distributed only last year to the holding company, will be subjected to this special tax in the hands of the holding company if received ing company to shareholders on another year's earnings of the original company will also be taxed. Such money would already have been taxed once under the old company rate of Is. 4d. in the £1, and now it is to be taxed again, the only concession being that the holding company will receive the benefit of the rebate provision for the ordinary tax; but as the original company will not have paid the new Is. 6d. tax, the holding company could get no rebate on it. I believe that the difficulty can be overcome by providingthat the tax shall not apply to profits that had accumulated prior to the commencement of the act or prior to a certain specified date-say , the 30th June, 1929. toTliat thc following new clause he inserted: ( 2 A . ) That where tax is payable by a company under the last preueding clause of this resolution, tax uuder that clause shall not be payable upon any taxable income derived by any person in consequence of the distribution by that company to its members or shareholders of the income upon which tax is so payable by that company or in consequence of a succession of such distribution through another company or through other companies of that income or any part thereof.

I endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan). I rose principally to refer to a matter about which I have had a grievance for some time. I wish to protest against certain action which has been taken by the Tariff Board and the Minister. in control of the Customs Department. An application for increased and new duties was made to the Tariff Board by certain metal producers at Port Kembla. I have now been informed definitely that no action is being taken. I wish to protest in this House, on behalf of my constituents, against the action of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, and to urge him, before this Parliament closes, to reconsider his decision. The following is portion of a letter that I have received from the representative of the Australian Workers Union, which covers the workers in the industry concernedYour letters re applications by the M .

The following items were included in thc company's application, and arc for materials, which have hitherto not been manufactured by them, but which they will commence to manufacture as soon as the tariff is granted:-Weather-proo f braided cable, aluminium tubes, cable and wire cotton covered, aluminium wire and copper clad steel tubes. These items alone would considerably assist in giving employment, and when the Government has, in its wisdom, decided to give total prohibition to the galvanized iron industry, I certainly think some steps should be taken to alleviate the unemployment iu the copper industry.

That case is on all fours with the matter now under consideration. These requests should be dealt with in a business like manner, and when a consolidating schedule is introduced it should not only correct anomalies, but should include new items which will create additional employment.

About that time, a tariff schedule was under consideration, but the Deputy Comptroller of Customs, who was inquiring into applications for increased duties, felt that this particular application covered such a wide range of goods that he could not possibly make the necessary inquiries from his office in Canberra.

212,Mr Forde,"In regard to rawof the goods in Australia. The low price of copper. was urged as a reason for increasing the duty, and it is admitted that such'low prices had had the effect of reducing the. amount of duty payable per ton. But, in spite of this, the board considered that the present duties provided adequate protection. It drew attention to the fact that the application for increased duty was made when the London price of electrolytic bars was about £84 per ton as compared with £45 when the inquiry was held. there were methods open to the company, apart from increased duties, whereby overseas competition could be met. I have also received a confidential report from an accountant attached to the staff of the Tariff Board, in which he puts very clearly and fully the financial position of the company in relation to its ordinary dividends, and the distribution of bonus shares and the payments of dividends thereon. The Government has not yet been able to consider the report of the board; but its action in referring the application to the .board has been thoroughly justified. While I wish to make it quite clear that testimony contrary to the diagnosis of the every consideration will be given to applications for increased duty, I have said enough to justify the action of the Government in this case, and to show that there was ample need for the most careful inquiry, particularly in view of the fact that the products of this company are, to a large extent, the raw materials of other manufacturers in Australia. I urge upon the Government the necessity for giving honourable members a f u l l opportunity, without any further delay, of discussing the tariff schedules which have been tabled since its assumption of office. It is not fair to the country that tariff embargoes and prohibitive duties should have been imposed in so many eases without adequate discussion in Parliament. This is "" sudden death"" legislation. While I recognize that something can be said in extenuation of the Government for its failure to make provision for a general tariff debate, I must say that it is due to the primary producers in particular, and the public in general, that no further tariff imposts should be introduced until the whole policy of the Government has been thoroughly discussed. wish to submit for the consideration of the^Governinent a case in which I consider ah injustice has been done to a temporary assistant in the Taxation Department at Perth. This man hassuffered largely because of a conflict of medical testimony. The case has been the subject of representations to the Government and the Public Service The board concluded that Board for nearly twelve months; but, despite the fact that three medical omcers have certified that the man is qualified for permanent appointment to the Public Service, he has not been able to obtain an appointment because the Commonwealth Medical Officer feels that he cannot certify that the applicant is perfectly fit, having regard to superannuation and other requirements. The Perth branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia and the Public Service Federation in Perth have asked me to bring the case under the notice of the Government, with the object of providing some right of appeal in cases where there is undoubted medical Commonwealth Medical Officer. The man concerned is Mr L. H . Harrisson, a returned soldier, who joined the Taxation Department as a temporary assistant in April, 1922. In April, 1924, be became eligible for permanent appointment. In August, 1929, with three other returned soldiers, be was gazetted on probation. He was instructed to report to Dr. Eobertson, then Commonwealth Medical Officer at Perth, who, upon examination, told him to take certain treatment and to report again in six months. Mr Harrisson carried out the instruction given to him, with the -result that Dr. Eobertson, on the second examination, reported he ""had much improved, both in weight and also heart trouble."" He informed Mr Harrisson that, if he continued to make the same improvement, he would most certainly pass him on a further examination six months' later. Dr. Eobertson also examined three other men, including Mr A. E. Smith, who were suffering from the same disabilities, and recommendeditheir acceptance,, which was approved by the board.

In my opinion the condition of his heart is unsatisfactory, though it is not such as to interfere with the efficient discharge of his duties; it may at some future time. I do not recommend that he be accepted for permanent appointment. The result of the report was that the board informed Mr Harrisson that his appointment had beeu annulled. Mr do not wish to weary honourable members Harrisson immediately lodged an appeal, and within eleven days was notified that the decision of the board could not be varied. He then placed the matter in the hands of the PubUc Service Association and the Returned Soldiers League, which, after consideration, advised him to get three independent medical testimonies, which he did. The first doctor he went to see was Dr. Robertson, who had examined him twice previously for the department. obtained on this occasion read as follows:I have this day examined Mr L. E. Ffarrisson. He maintains great improvement in liealtli, and he looks much healthier. While his heart is not quite normal, showing occasional irregularities, his tolerance for exercise is good, and I consider, he is fit for the dutieB of Assistant, Taxation Department. The second doctor, Dr. L. Miller Oorbett, M.B., and B.S., Melbourne, statedThis is to certify that Mr L. H. Harrisson, who has this day been examined by me, is in my opinion physically fit, and, further, except for his rheumatic history, would be regarded asfirst-classlife. The third doctor Dr. D. McGowan gave' this certificateThis is to state that I have examined Mr L. H. Harrisson. I found that his heart sounds varied a little from normal sounds. Tbis is the result of rheumatic infection stated to have occurred during his war service in 1910. Other than this defeat, T could find no gross abnormality. In my opinion, his capacity for work is not greatly decreased by the above disability, and I consider his ability for clerical work is not affected. There were three medical testimonies, one by an officer who had previously acted as Commonwealth Medical Oflicer, aud two. others by doctors who, as a result of their separate examinations, testified that the man's physical condition at the time application was made was such that he could efficiently discharge the duties reThis quired of him. Because one medical status, could not give a satisfactory certificate, Harrisson's appointment as a temporary assistant was terminated, and his application for a permanent position made impossible. It is interesting to note that Dr. Robertson's certificates in connection with three other returned soldiers were accepted; but that which he gave ia Harrisson's case was not acted upon. I with the details of the representations made to the Minister and to the hoard, other than to say that Dr. Mitchell again examined Harrisson as the result of representations made by me. His report statesHis complaint, slight heart trouble, it not such as to interfere with the efficient discharge of his duties at the present time, but may at some future date, which he cannot specify. The certificate he He adheres, of course, to his original assumption that at some future date Harrisson might become inefficient; but that, of course, applies to all persons in normal health. A medical man examining any member of this Parliament might be justified in saying that at some future date, ho would, for various reasons, be incapable of efficiently carrying out the work he is now performing. At the expiration of six months, when Harrisson's services as a temporary assistant expired, he received one week's notice, which it is alleged, was given because in the interests of economy the dismissal of temporary officers was necessary. The fact remains that Harrisson's appointment was terminated because a youth of 21 years was to fill the vacancy created by his dismissal. As a Commonwealth Medical Officer certified that Harrisson should submit himself to re-examination within six months, and before that time had elapsed he ceased to act as a medical officer, and another medical officer gave a different diagnosis which is not confirmed by two others, and which, is in conflict with the original certificate, a man otherwise qualified for the appointment as a ^permanent officer should not be' denied the appointment. It has been suggested to uic that the Minister might effect such arrangements as would enable the board to accept the certificates of t.he three indebe suitably represented, seeing that the pendent medical officers, or that the board should be instructed to give Harrisson the benefit of the doubt os provided in section 84 (8) of the act. The complaint of this man is grievous. He has served for a number of years as a temporary assistant, has qualified for appointment us n permanent officer, and then, owing to medical conflict, in which tht: Commonwealth Medical Officer is involved, is not only prevented from receiving a permanent appointment, but litis been dismissed in order to make room for a man less qualified. It seems unreasonable that the Commonwealth Medical Officer should base his decision to n large extent upon possible superannuation payments rather than upon the present physical capacity of the man. I urge the Government to take the whole matter into consideration. been brought under my uotice, and although I do not wish to speak upon it at this juncture, I trust that a thorough inquiry will he made. Prime Minister) [11.6] -The case mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), and supported, by interjection, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) will be fully inquired into. In view of the strong representations made, it appears that further investigation, is necessary. With respect to the protest made by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) concerning the representation of the Federal Government at the New Delhi celebrations in India, I may say that I personally regret that owing to a variety of political circumstances it will be impossible for a Minister of the Crown to attend. A very cordial invitation was issued twelve months ago, so that an Australian representative could, with other representatives of the British Empire, attend this ceremony. Outside thc main secretariat building, columns presented by the dominions have been erected, and it is the desire of the Indian. Government that representatives of thc Governments, which have donated columns, shall attend and have the privilege of unveiling them. The Government would like the Commonwealth to Indian Government, in response to an invitation from the Commonwealth Government, sent a distinguished member of the Indian Parliament to attend the opening of this building. Those who attended the opening ceremonies on that' occasion will remember the speech then, delivered by India's distinguished representative. Moreover, owing to the pleasant relations that exists between India and Australia, it is desirable that satisfactory arrangements should be made. It is our wish that Australia should keep in close touch with the Indian people,, and, although material considerations should not be obtruded in matters of this kind, the representation of Australia at this important ceremony sliould eventually be of benefit to the people of Australia. I Tegret that a Minister of the Crown is not able to leave the Commonwealth at the present time, but. the Government is doing its best to secure the services of a suitable person to represent the Commonwealth at this ceremony.
