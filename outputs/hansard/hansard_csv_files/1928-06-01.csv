I merely mention these matters to illustrate what big business firms do when they wish to bring before the consuming public the goods they have to sell. I have already mentioned what a splendid market Great Britain affords to the producers of Australia. The only way in which we can get the people of Great Britain to buy our products is by displaying them at the doors of the British consumers. We could very well devote a portion of this £500,000 to doing something on the lines suggested by Mr Baldwin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. He saidTo spend money in the direction suggested would be a good thing. What is to prevent us, as a government in Britain, co-operating with the overseas dominions governments to establish a system whereby there could be a splendid distribution of dominions' produce throughout the United Kingdom. That is the only way in which Australia can thoroughly and effectively compete with the great opponents it has in the British market. The honourable member for Boothby that most of the Australian State Premiers have concurred in the proposal to hold this exhibition. I find, on referring to the speech of the Prime Minister, that at the Conference with the State Premiers, the Premier of Victoria committal. State Premiers, with the exception of the Premier of New South Wales, gave only a general assent to the proposal. Presumably, finding that the exhibition was not to cost their States anything, they did not wish to appear churlish towards New South Wales. The question of a site has yet to be determined. Mr Bavin, the Premier of New South Wales, has promised that Centennial Park will be placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government only with the sanction of the State Parliament, and I believe that if the State Parliament does give its 'consent it will be by the narrowest of majorities. If Centennial Park has been set aside for a specific purpose for the people of New South Wales, I question very much whether it can be used as a site for an Other firms have exhibition. That, however, is a point to be settled by the legal fraternity. I am inclined to think that the opinion of the Premier of Victoria is that money should not be spent in this direction. He and. the other State Premiers know how hard it is for them to get along at the present time. We start off, therefore, with this exhibition having only the lukewarm support of the States. Some of us remember the aftermath of -the past exhibitions held in Australia. T am not prepared to say that the last great exhibition in Melbourne was responsible for the awful depression that almost immediately followed it, but it was certainly a contributing factor. are spent on any project in a big city, it leads to the aggregation of people in that city. People flock there looking for work, which is available for a short period only, and this leads to an inflation in land values. The great financial collapse of the nineties, which affected Victoria in particular, was mainly due to the excessive gambling in land that preceded it, but tht Centennial Exhibition held in Melbourne induced a certain amount of centralization which, as we all know, leads to a most uuhealthy state of affairs in any community.",34,Setup

One of Australia's largest manufacturers of agricultural implements moved his factory from an inland town to a place near the seaboard. able member is not in order in discussing that matter. £500,000 proposed to be spent on this exhibition could be better employed. For instance, the Public Works Committee has recently investigated a proposal to spend £120,000 on Commonwealth offices in Sydney. Portion of this £500,000 could be better spent, from the taxpayer's bates. Like that honourable member, I stand-point, in completing that work. As soon as the building is ready for occupation, the saving in rent will be greater than the amount required to pay interest and sinking fund on the expenditure involved. The proposal to spend £500,000 on an exhibition is nothing but extravagance, particularly at a time when at least 100,000 persons are unemployed in Australia. Surely this money, if we have it to spare, Empire exhibition, which is naturally should be used at once to give some relief to the thousands of distressed families in this so-called bright and sunny land of ours. I live iu the Prime Minister's electorate, and I know the sufferings that the fruit growers are experiencing there. They have reached such a distressing stage that soon they will be looking for. work on the roads and elsewhere. Yet their own representative in this Parliament is proposing to expend £500,000 on an Empire exhibition! that electorate others besides the fruit growers who are suffering through unemployment. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. .Riley), gave us some interesting information, about which the Prime Minister apparently knows very little. He showed conclusively that, if during the six months that this exhibition will be in existence, the attendance is 30,000,000, the admission fees, if fixed at a moderate scale, will amount to at least £100,000 less than the estimate tant commissioner. Evidently, that is one of the Prime Minister. There will no doubt be a big deficit. This huge expenditure is ill-timed and unnecessary; and will be of no benefit to Australia. At the close of the exhibition it will be found that the expenditure, instead of being £500,000, will be more like £1,000,000. The Government is living in an atmosphere of glorious optimism, but I take a sensible view of the financial aspect of this proposal. During this exhibition, there will be a lavish entertaining of distinguished visitors. Money will be spent in profusion to.satisfy the guzzling propensities of a lot of globetrotters. There will be many other contingencies, which we do not foresee. The honourable membei for Oxley( Mr Bayley) referred in glowing terms to the San Francisco exhibition. He frequently uses an American illustration or introduces an American touch into the dehave a great deal of sympathy with and brotherly feeling for cousin Jonathan. The Americans, in my opinion, are amongst our best friends. Our countries front the Pacific Ocean, and our interests are identical. I feel certain that America would come to our assistance if Australia were in dire peril. The San Francisco exhibition was international in character, whereas we are proposing to hold an limited in its scope. America has a population of 110,000,000, and the San Francisco international exhibition attracted thousands of people from all parts of the world. We shall not have such a clientele at the Empire exhibition at Sydney. The honourable member for Oxley made special reference to the number of patriotic citizens living in close proximity to the San Francisco exhibition. The Prime Minister has made this stateThere are in ment:, In connection with Wembley, we had a number of guarantors to cover any loss on the exhibition; but that arrangement caused a great deal of friction. After a f u l l examination the Government decided that a direct appropriation was the' best means of financing this exhibition. The bill, therefore, appropriates the sum of £500,000.

16,Mr Fenton,"I consider that theextent of £500,000. No mention is made of how the money is to be raised, whether on the London or New York market, or out of the public fund. Sub-clause 1 of clause 22, provides that the commission may, with the consent of the Treasurer, arrange with any banking corporation in Australia to make to the commission advances not exceeding £300,000. It has to be remembered that interest will have to be paid on that money. member consider that that money should be advanced without interest? Government talks about appropriating £500,000, it makes no allowance for the interest charge on that amount. That is one of the many extras which the taxpayers of this .country will have to bear. The only financial supervision of this expenditure is to be carried out by the Auditor-General. The Prime Minister may say that that is a sufficient guarantee against waste, but let as examine the bill. clause 23 provides that the Auditor General shall furnish to the commission a copy of any report made by him after any inspection or audit. As this Parliament is sanctioning the expenditure of £500,000, it is only right that the Auditor-General's report should be furnished through the Treasurer to this Parliament. Clause 24 contains a list of exhibits and materials which are to be free from customs duties. exhibits, building materials, tools, and transport plant, articles for use in decorations and the installation of machinery, samples for free distribution, and such other goods as are notified by the Minister in the Gazette. Take, for instance, the item of building material. Of course, we may wish to bring here some particularly ornamental timbers that are grown in other parts of the Empire; but, apart from exhibits, why should we drop our tariff walls to allow of the introduction of foreign timber with which to build stores and other works? tained in Australia for this purpose. I certainly do not appreciate a provision of that kind. Under the law as it stands at present, any firm in Great Britain, America, or Canada, or even in the other dominions, has to pay duty on any printed catalogue of its goods that is sent to Australia. The printers and publishers of this country are protected to that extent, but under the bill catalogues are to be admitted free. That is quite unnecessary. It is quite likely that firms will send to this country, free of duty, catalogues which have no relation at all to their exhibits, and it will need a watchful eye to protect the customs revenue. the honourable The bill also proposes to preclude the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee from inquiring into any expenditure incurred both before and after the exhibition. It is quite likely that, if that clause is passed, those committees will be precluded from making any investigations at all respecting the exhibition. The Public Works Committee cannot act except by resolution of this Parliament, but the Public Accounts Committee is in a different position. I admit, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) has stated, that many of the inquiries of the Public Accounts Sub-clause 2 of Committee have taken place after the expenditure has been incurred, but I submit that very often its inquiries have led to the saving of considerable sums of money. The Public Works Committee should have full power to investigate any work, in connection with this exhibi-' tion, that is estimated to cost not less than £25,000. "" The Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner should not be allowed to sanction works without It includes hindrance or supervision; that would be unfair to this Parliament. We have appointed parliamentary committees, and they have rendered a useful service to this country. During the first three years that I was a member of the Public Works Committee its inquiries led to an immense saving in expenditure. It is in the interests of this country to have such investigations. Projected railways and public works are inquired into by these committees, the members of which, and particularly their secretaries, have become expert at their work. Their qualifications are such that they Suitable timber could be obare able to render very valuable service to the Commonwealth, and they should in .this instance be associated with any investigation which may be necessary iu this connection.

I position which may arise as a result of the introduction of printed catologues, free of duty, which will either be distributed or sold in tens of thousands to the people of Australia. A British firm may send out some of those voluminous catalogues which are produced annually for them, the printing of which could readily be done in Australia. I have no hesitation in saying that there are printing establishments in Melbourne and Sydney that can produce catalogues second to none in the world. That is why I am entering a strong protest against the tariff wall being removed in this instance. British manufacturers will send their goods to.Australia and display them at the exhibition in the best possible manner with the view, of course, of obtaining additional business. If there was not that prospect, they would not be exhibitors. The exhibition in Australia of certain articles, will be to the detriment of Australian manufacturers. Clause 27 of the bill reads27.

In the limited time at my disposal I have endeavoured to express my views upon this measure; but when the committee stage is reached, as I suppose it will, honourable members will have a further opportunity to discuss the bill in detail. In conclusion, I wish to enter my most emphatic protest against such waste of public money, particularly at a time when the Commonwealth can least afford it. Surely honourable members know that there are nearly 100,000 persons out of work in Australia, and will agree that if money is to be spent, it should be in such a way that the largest possible number will benefit. It is likely that the Treasurer will have to announce a deficit of £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 for the preseni. financial year, which is probably the largest that has been recorded for at least two decades. In view of all the circumstances, I repeat that it is criminal waste of money and gross extravagance to spend such a large sum on an exhibition, the main object of which is to advertise goods which will enter into serious competition with. Australian manufactures. committee stage, I am not a Jeremiah like the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) who has just resumed his seat. There is nothing the matter with Australia. Those who have no faith in the Commonwealth ought not to be members of this Parliament. There is a very bright future before this country, and there is no occasion for any honourable member to paint a gloomy picture of our position and make it appear to the. world that we are heading for financial disaster.

The honourable member then suggests for our consideration something which is rather startling, coming as it does from a member of the Opposition, namely, that the project should be left to private enterprise. This is a scheme to advertise Australia. What should we do without advertising? A study of the history of commercial enterprise will show that 30 per cent., or perhaps 50 per cent, of the overhead expenses in some concerns has been incurred in publicity work. I do not know what the proportion would be in connection with the exenditure by political parties, but I now that propaganda and publicity costs a good deal. We have only to recall the romantic success that has followed the exif this proposal were not proceeded with; tensive advertising of "" life-savers "" and "" aspros"" to realize the value of publicity. In placing those two commodities on the market, the expenditure of huge sums of money has been necessary. Goods have to be freely advertised or there is no sale for them. I am surprised that the honourable member should suggest that the holding of such an exhibition should be left to private enterprise. such suggestion. ber withholds his support from an undertaking which is not to be controlled by private enterprise. An exhibition is a spectacular means of drawing attention to a country's products; probably there is no other way in which that could be more effectively done. We should remember that in 1932 the great bridge over the Sydney Harbour-the largest and most important work of its kind south of the line-is to be opened, and from the time the Government of which I was a humble member passed the bill authorizing the construction of the bridge, there has been a desire the people of New South Wales to have that the opening should be celebrated ID a spectacular and effective manner. In consequence, those who have had their minds upon that important event have been speaking of an exhibition. The suggestion has never met with very much response from me personally; but the idea has grown. We know perfectly well that at the time this project was The suggestion that such an first mooted, the Canadian Government proposed to hold an exhibition in Canada. The Canadian Government was endeavouring to do for Canada that which the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales have been endeavouring to do for Australia. It wished to direct the attention of the people of other countries to its resources and possibilities; but to his credit the Prime Minister, at the last Imperial Conference, forestalled the Government of Canada, which intended to get in first with an Empire exhibition. I shall speak later concerning the. merits of this proposal ; but it is only right that, in debating the matter, we should have before us the background of the picture we are now studying. No doubt many persons in New South Wales would be disappointed but, after all, the members of this Parliament are not bound to do other than their judgment dictates in the interests of the people. The Federal Government has been moved by the desire of many persons in New South Wales, and the Government of that State has been cooperating with the Federal Government in a very effective way. did not make any member mean that the people of New South Wales have been moved by the desireof the Prime Minister to hold this exhibition ? ment. ber said this project was initiated by the people of New South Wales. able member should not misrepresent me. ber said that the Prime Minister forestalled Canada.

33,Mr Ley,"I repeat that the Primewere passed. move about the country without knowing, as most honourable members know, of a desire in the public mind. It has been openly stated that there is a widespread desire on the part of the people in New South Wales that the opening of the Sydney harbour bridge in 1932 should be celebrated in some suitable way such as by the holding of an exhibition. Knowing of this growing desire, the Prime Minister stepped in at the psychological moment and provided Australia with the opportunity to hold an Empire exhibition before any of the other dominions, and for doing so he is to be congratulated. I am glad that we have a Prime Minister who places Australia first. The right honourable gentleman and the exPremier of New South Wales( Mr over producing, but because of the smallLang), as well as the present Premier( Mr Bavin), have collaborated in what they believed to be the interests of the country. Although the holding of an exhibition may provide employment and draw a great deal of attention to Australia, and New South Wales in particular, 1 regret that I cannot see eye to eye with its sponsors. It does not seem a wise way in which to spend money when there are so many other directions in which it could be more effectively expended. We are the trustees of the taxpayers' money. If there are other ways in which this money can be expended with greater advantage to Australia, we would be foolish to go on with this proposal although, at first glance, it may seem a proper one. Since this scheme was first mooted, there has been a startling fall in the returns from customs duties, which means that the Government and the taxpayers will be faced with a serious situation. One might reasonably have hoped that these changed circumstances would be considered by the Government. I trust that the Prime Minister will still see his way clear to approach the State Government, before proceeding any further with this proposal, to see if the £500,000, or whatever amount it is intended to expend, could not be devoted to a better purpose. In the first place, I venture to express the opinion that the day has long passed since Australia needs to advertise no resolutions its products. Our wool and wheat advertise themselves. tised Australia, too. service and glorious sacrifices, made Australia's name known from pole to pole. There is no need in these'days to hold an exhibition to bring Australia, her resources and products under the notice of other nations. It maybe that the -exhibition would increase, temporarily, the sale of Australian products, because of the greater population in Sydney to be supplied, but that increase would be small and of no lasting benefit. So far as the overseas trade is concerned, the exhibition will not sell an additional tin of jam. pot of marmalade, or pound of mutton. After all, the overseas market is Australia's principal problem. We are not ness of our population, we have to find markets abroad in competition with cheap labour countries. account of the cost of production. superable, and I would infinitely prefer that Ministers should concentrate their attention on it, rather than be occupied with the problems which> must arise out of a great exhibition, even if controlled by a commission. To my mind, such an exhibition would be mere cheap tinsel, and would not increase at all the already sound knowledge of us abroad. In behalf of my own electorate, and many right-thinking people throughout New South Wales, I appeal to the Prime Minister to consult with the Premier of that State to see if a cheaper, more effective, and less troublesome method of celebrating the opening of the North Shore bridge in 1932 cannot be devised, rather than expend on an exhibition this sum of money that is wanted in other directions. If the bill reaches the committee stage, two vital points will require attention. I assume that the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee has been excluded, because examination by it of the finances of the commission would be a clumsy and unnecessary procedure. If we .vote this large sum of money for the exhibition, we shall know that it is an advertising stunt from which we shall get little direct return, and all that we shall require is the",38,Setup

The suggestion for the conclusion of a treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy has evoked widespread interest in this country, and His Majesty's Government w ill support the movement to the utmost of their power. 3. After making a careful study of the text contained in Your Excellency's Note and of the amended text suggested in the French Note His Majesty's Government feel convinced that there is no serious divergence between the effect of . these two drafts. The impression is confirmed by a study of the text of the speech by the Secretary of State of the United States to which Your Excellency drew my attention and which he delivered before the American Society of International Law on the 28th A p r i l. The aim of the United States Government, as I understand it , is to embody in a treaty a broad statement of principle, to proclaim without restriction or qualification that war shall not be used as an instrument of policy. W it h this aim His Majesty's Government are wholly in accord. imhued with the same purpose, have merely added an indication of certain exceptional circumstances in which violation of that principle by one party may oblige the other to take action, and seem at first to be inconsistent with the terms of the proposed pact. Majesty's Government appreciate the scruples which have prompted these suggestions by the , French Government. The exact fulfilment of treaty engagements is a matter which affects the national honour; precision as to the scope of such engagements is therefore of importance. Each of the suggestions made by the French Government has been carefully considered from this point of view. 4. After studying the wording of Article1 of the TJnited States draft His Majesty's Government do not think its terms exclude the action which a State may be forced to take in self-defence. Mr Kellogg has made it clear, in the speech to which I have referred above, that he regards the right of self-defence as inalienable, and His Majesty's Government are disposed to think that on this question no addition to the text is necessary. 5. As regards the text of Article 2, no appreciable difference is found between the American and French proposals. His Majesty's Government are, therefore, content to accept the former if , as they understand to be the case, a dispute ""amongst the High Contracting Parties"" is a phrase wide enough to cover a dispute between any two of them. C. The French Note suggests the addition of an article providing that the violation of the treaty by one of the parties should release the remainder from their obligations under the Majesty's Government are not satisfied that, if the treaty stood alone, the addition of some such provision would not be necessary. Mr Kellogg's speech, however, shows that he put forward for acceptance the text of the proposed treaty upon the understanding that the violation of the undertakings by one party would free the remaining parties from the obligation to observe its terms in respect of the treaty-breaking State. 7. If it is agreed that this is the principle which will apply in the case of this particular treaty, His Majesty's Government are satisfied and w i ll not ask for the insertion of any amendment. without difficulty of placing this understanding on record in some appropriate manner so that it may have equal value with the terms of the treaty itself. 8. The point is one of importance because of its bearing on the treaty engagements by which His Majesty's Government are also bound. The preservation of peace has been the chief concern of His Majesty's Government and the principal object of all their endeavours. It is the reason why they have given ungrudging support to the League of Nations and why they have undertaken the burden of the guarantees embodied in the Locarno Treaty. The sole object of al l these engagements is the elimination of war as an instrument of national policy, just as it is the purpose of the peace pact now proposed. It is The French proposals, equally because the object of both is the same that there is no real antagonism between the treaty engagements whicli His Majesty's Governments have already accepted and the pact which iB now proposed. The machinery of the Covenant and the Treaty of Locarno, however, His go somewhat further than a mere renunciation of war as a policy, in that they provide certain sanctions for a breach of their obligations. A clash might thus conceivably arise between the existing treaties and the proposed pact unless it is understood that the obligation of the new engagement will cease to operate in respect of a party which breaks its pledge and adopts hostile measures against one of its co-contractants. 9. For the Government of this country respect for the obligations arising out of the Covenant of the League of Nations and out of the Locarno Treaty is fundamental. Our position in this regard is identical wit h that of the German Government as indicated in their Note of 27th April. His Majesty's Government could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken or undermine these engagements on which the peace of Europe rests. Indeed, the public interest in this country in scrupulous fulfilment of these engagements is so great that His Majesty's Government would for their part prefer to see some such provision as article 4 of the Frenchd r a f t embodied in tlie text of the treaty. To this we understand there will be no objection. Mr Kellogg has made it clear in his speech to which I have drawn attention that he had no intention by the terms of the new treaty .of preventing parties to the Covenant of the League or to the Locarno Treaty from f u l f ill in g their obligations treaty towards that party. His 10. The language of Article1 as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy renders it desirable that I should remind Your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety. His Majesty's Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their protection against attacks is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. It must be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the Means can no doubt be found distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect. The Government of the TJnited States have comparable interests, any disregard of which by a foreign power they have declared that they would regard as an unfriendly act. His Majesty's Government believe therefore .that in defining their position they are expressing the intention and meaning of the TJnited States Government. 11. As regards the measure of participation in the new treaty before it would come into force, His Majesty's Government agree that it is not necessary to wait until all the nations of the world have signified their willingness to become parties; on the other hand, it would be embarrassing if certain States in Europe with whom the proposed participants are already in close treaty relations were not included among tlie parties. His Majesty's Government see no reason, however, to doubt that these States will gladly accept its terms. Universality would in any case be difficult of attainment and might even be inconvenient, for there are some States whose Governments have not yet been universally recognized, and some which are scarcely in a position to ensure the maintenance of good order and security within their territories. The condition for the inclusion of such States among the parties to the new treaty is a question to which further attention may perhaps be devoted with advantage. It is, however, a minor question as compared with the attainment of the more important purpose in view. 12. After this examination of the terms of the proposed treaty and of the points to which it gives rise, Your Excellency w ill realize that His Majesty's Government find nothing in their existing commitments which prevents their hearty co-operation in this new movement for strengthening the foundations of peace. They will gladly cO;operate in the conclusion of such a pact as is proposed, and are ready to engage with the interested Governments in the negotiations which are necessary for the purpose. .13. Your Excellency w ill observe that the detailed arguments in the foregoing paragraphs are expressed on behalf of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain. It w ill , however, be appreciated that the proposed treaty from its very nature is not one which concerns His Majesty's Government in Great Britain alone, but is one in which they could not undertake to participate otherwise than jointly and simultaneously with His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions and the Government of India. They have, therefore, been in communication with those Governments, and I am happy to be able to inform Your Excellency that as a result of the communications which have passed it has been ascertained that they are all in cordial agreement with the general principle of the proposed treaty. I feel confident, therefore, that on receipt of an invitation to participate in the conclusion of such a treaty they, no less than His Majesty's Government in Great Britain, wil l be prepared to accept tlic invitation. It will be observed that the British note raised several points which are of equal interest to the Commonwealth. They relate to-(1) The maintenance of the right of self-defence of a party to the treaty in the event of direct and deliberate aggression. (2) The obligations of a member nation of the League of Nations under the Covenant of the League, and the necessity for preserving the freedom of every nation that may be a party to the proposed treaty to carry out the obligations it has already entered into under the Covenant of the League. (3) The position of a signatory to the proposed treaty in the event of any Mr Bruce. other signatory violating its obligations under the treaty and resorting to war. Australia is a member of the League of Nations. We must carry out all the solemn obligations to which we are committed by our signature to the Covenant. We must also preserve our right to defend ourselves in the event of aggression by another nation. We should have our position denned in the event of another signatory to the treaty breaking its obligations under it, and resorting to war. There is a great obligation upon the British Government which is referred to in the British Note, but as it does not concern Australia we have not to deal with it ; I refer to the responsibility of the British Government and the British people as 'guarantors of the Locarno treaties, which were entered into in an attempt to preserve peace in Western Europe, between France, Germany, and Belgium. On the 22nd May the following communication was sent by the TJnited States Ambassador in London to the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsI n the Note which you addressed to me on the 19th May, 1928, you were good enough to inform my Government that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain had been in communication with His Majesty's' Governments in the Dominions and w i th the Government of India and had ascertained that they were all in cordial agreement with the general principle of the multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war -which the Government of the TJnited States of America proposed on 13th A p r i l, 1928. You added that you felt confident, therefore, that His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions and the Government of India were prepared for an invitation to participate in the conclusion of such a treaty as that proposed by the Government of the TJnited States of America. I have been instructed to state to you tliat my Government has received this information witli the keenest satisfaction. My Government has hoped from the outset of the present negotiations that the Governments of the Dominions and the Government of India would feel disposed to become parties to the suggested anti-war treaty. It is, moreover, most gratifying to the Government of the United States of America to learn that His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions and the Government of India are so favourably inclined towards , the treaty for the renunciation of war which my Government proposed on the 13th A p r i l, 1928, as to wish to participate therein individually and as original signatories, and my Government, for its part, is most happy to accede to the suggestion contained in your Note to me of 19th May, 1928. Accordingly, I have been instructed to extend through you to Sis Majesty's Governments in Australia, Now Zealand, and South Africa and to the Government of India, an invitation in the name of the Government of the United States to become original parties to the treaty for the renunciation of war, which is now under consideration. Pursuant to my instructions, X also have the honour to inform you that the Government of the United States will address through you to His Majesty's Governments in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and to the Government of India at the same time and in the same manner as to the other Governments whose participation in the proposed treaty in the first instance is contemplated, any further communication which it may make on the subject of the treaty after it has been acquainted with the views of all. It will thus be seen that the Government of the United States of America has extended to Australia an invitation to become an original party to the proposed wealth Government sent the following adjourned. cablegram to His Majesty's Government in Great Britain cordially accepting the invitation:The Commonwealth Government would be grateful if His Majesty's Government in Great Britain would convey to the Government of the United States tlie following communication :His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia have received with appreciation the invitation to participate as an . original party in the treaty for the renunciation of war which has been proposed by the Government of the United States of America. They have carefully and sympathetically examined the draft treaty that haB been submitted to them, together with the correspondence that has so far been exchanged between the interested Governments. that a treaty such as that proposed will be a further material safeguard to the peace of the world, and they will be happy to co-operate to the fullest extent in its successful conclusion. I have now made reference to all the Noupon principal documents that relate to this at treaty.

A readiness to co-operate has been shown by all the Governments that have been approached and have expressed their views, these being the Governments of Great Britain, France, Germany, and those of His Majesty's Dominions and the Government of India. All those communications have expressed the utmost sympathy with the suggested treaty to outlaw war. I am certain that the action which the Government has taken in giving its unqualified support to these proposals will receive the endorsement of the people of Australia; because no people in the world has a greater desire than we have for the maintenance of peace and the complete and absolute outlawry of war.
