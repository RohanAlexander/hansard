The Minister for Defence will represent the Minister for Trade and Customs in this House. OF WAR. Minister a question which relates to the management of the . business of this House. The Ex-prisoners of War and Relatives Association, of Western Australia is very anxious to have a representa tive at Canberra when the debate on the 1 paper relating to the claim for certain payments to prisoners of war takes place in this House. Can the right honourable gentleman, .set aside a definite' date for that debate so that I can notify the association when to send its representative to Canberra fr fix a date for the debate and I shall keep in touch with the honorable member ou the subject. suant to a question that was asked in this House yesterday, I now ask the Minister for Immigration whether his attention has been directed to a recent statement by Mr G. W. Holland, the acting federal president of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, in which he claimed that 8,500,000 people of German origin-the so-called volksdeutsche-wh o have been expelled from countries in Europe recently occupied by Russia, in which many of ( Mr C. F. them had been living for generations, and who are outside the help of the. International Relief Organization and who are regarded almost as aliens in Germany, would provide an excellent source of immigrants for Australia, subject, of course, to proper selection and screening. Will the Minister inform the House whether Mr Holland's statement is accurate? If it is accurate, will the honourable gentleman give duo consideration to making use of tiiis source of immigrants? statement by Mr Holland to which the honourable member has referred and, in fact, I made some public comment at the time in which I commended Mr Holland for the realistic attitude that he had adopted on this most important matter. I believe that the statement was accurate. It was confirmed by an article that was published in Mufti, the official journal of the Returned Servicemen's League in Victoria, almost immediatelyafter it had been made. The Government's advisers have already said that they consider that the body of men and women to which Mr Holland referred represents a useful source for the selection of immigrants, and steps to take advantage, of that source",8,Setup

I have received an urgent telegram from the Mayor of Forbes in which he speaks of many homes as well as crops being completely ruined by the floods, and points out that adequate financial assistance is essential for further rehabilitation. Widespread devastation has been caused during the last few days by floods in the Lachlan Valley, and the towns of Forbes, Cowra and Eugowra have suffered severely. Crops have been ruined, and the fences enclosing the properties of soldier settlers, vegetable growers, lucerne gi-owers, householders and many other people have been destroyed.

I point out to the right honourable gentleman that the proposal was welcomed hy Professor Stephen Boberts, Vice-Chan-, cellor of the University of Sydney, who indicated that such a faculty would he established as soon as the University of Sydney had sufficient funds to establish it. In view of the dark clouds now gathering on the industrial horizon, will the Prime Minister take up the matter with the Treasurer with a view to providing funds for the establishment at the universities in capital cities of a faculty along the lines suggested and also, if posexemptions for wheat farmers who pursible, at the Australian National University at Canberra? Furthermore, if the Prime Minister favours the proposition, will he undertake to endeavour to launch the new proposal at the beginning of next year ? the Government appointed a committee to investigate thefinancesof the various universities. An interim report has been received from that committee and it is now awaiting consideration by the Cabinet. I cannot, of course, anticipate what the decision of the Cabinet will be. However, apart altogether from the proposal that the Government should make availahle funds to assist State universities, I take this opportunity to say that I do not wish to be regarded as an advocate of the proposition that the authority of the universities to raise their own funds and to conduct their own affairs should be interfered with by the Government. tion of the Prime Minister to an article which appeared in theNew Times which criticizes the Government for maintaining the uniform tax system ?

Four out of the six Premiers indicated that' tbey would not contemplate a reversion to such a state of affairs, and, whilst the two remaining Premiers indicated prima facie that they were prepared to discuss the matter, I felt that their expressed agreement to do so was qualified by serious mental reservations. Treasurer a question relating to tax chase bulk handling equipment. In order to give an incentive to wheat farmers to purchase such equipment, and thus reduce our annual expenditure on t.he import of wheat bags, and also to reduce the time spent in unloading operations at wheat silos, will the Minister consider making the amounts expended on such equipment a direct deduction from income tax in the year in which the money is expended, instead of following t.he present system of allowing a certain proportion of such expenditure as a. deduction for depreciation. money on the purchase of such equipment is of a capital nature, and there is no provision in the relevant legislation under which it could be permitted as a deduction. I shall examine the matter and ascertain the merits of the case for special consideration in the direction that the honourable gentleman has indicated. question to the Treasurer I state by way of explanation that during the war years employees of the American authorities who worked in the small ships section in the islands had amounts deducted from their earnings for payment of income tax. Those deductions were made by the Chifley Government. As a result of an application the High Court ruled that the relevant earnings of those individuals were not subject to Australian income tax laws.

28,Mr Osbobne,"Does the Ministerat less than half its full capacity? Does he not agree that this factory, which is tooled for precision engineering of a high degree, would be of great use to the community for the production of civilian engineering goods in short supply, provided, of course, that its production capacity is not fully required for defence? If he agrees with what I have said will he investigate the factory's capacity, as well as its present employment, in order to see that it is put to its best use? Lidcombe engine factory is given over to the production of Rolls-Royce Merlin engines for aircraft and defence purposes. I have not yet had an opportunity to visit the factory, although it is only -seven miles from my home. I think that it is true that the factory is uot working to However, more recently the States of full capacity, but the honourable member will understand that there are difficulties about introducing civilian production into an aircraft or other munitions factory. We allow such production to some degree because it helps to reduce the heavy cost of maintaining essential defence factories, but we limit it in that we do not embark on civilian production that we consider will be in competition with private industry. In answer to an interjection that I have just heard an honourable member make from the Opposition front bench, I point out that in not engaging in competition with private industry by means of production in defence factories, we are following a practice that was adopted by the previous Government. But we attempt .to assist in the production of goods that are scarce, in cases in which we are requested to do so by private industry. I shall have the matter of the Lidcombe engine factory examined in detail and see what can be done to expand its production, so long as it does not conflict with the principles that I have just mentioned. for Works and Housing whether the report is well founded that the importation of prefabricated homes is to be limited owing to the fact that water supplies and other ancillary services can be provided for only a limited number of building sites which are controlled by State housing commisisons? As many thousands of private owners have home sites which are already provided with these services, could arrangements be made to facilitate the importation of prefabricated homes for private owners? Will the Minister confer with building societies, banks or other financing bodies in order to ascertain whether the owners of private buildings can be assisted to purchase prefabricated homes? housing commissions have told the Government that the total number of prefabricated houses that they can import in the coming twelve months will be limited by the number of sites that can be prepared in advance, which will total about 10,000 for the six States. New South Wales and Queensland have shown signs of proposing, to import a considerably larger number which will exceed the number of sites that they have prepared. Evidently they contemplate the erection of prefabricated houses on sites that are not fully supplied with water, sewerage and other services. them in the country, in many cases. competent for private individuals to buy prefabricated houses, as one might say, off the peg, and erect them provided that they comply with local building regulations. There is a gap in the financial arrangements for the purchase of imported prefabricated houses by private individuals because there is no provision for the purchase to be financed prior to the commencement of the erection of the house in Australia when progress payments can be collected. I have taken this matter up with the Commonwealth Bank, but it has not yet found a way to overcome this difficulty. I agree strongly that if some means can be evolved of overcoming the problem in the financing of imported prefabricated houses by securing the assistance of State governments, building societies, community improvement associations, the Commonwealth Bank, the trading banks, or insurance companies, a very considerable impetus would be given to the erection of prefabricated houses in Australia.",15,Lidcombe Engine Factory

These matters and some other items have now been determined. The members of the forces to be covered for benefits are, briefly, those who are allotted to operations in Korea and Malaya. The description of the classes, and the period for which they will be covered, are as follows:NavyCategory of Personnel -Al l members serving in or posted for attachment to His Majesty's Australian ships allotted for duty in operational areas.

(This includes both the squadron based on Japan and the transport and bomber squadrons attached to the United Kingdom forces in Malaya.) (NOTE -It was considered that the conditions relating to the squadrons in Malaya were analogous to those obtaining in the squadron engaged in Korean operations.) Period of Eligibility -(i ) In the case of units overseas-fro m the date the unit is actually allotted for operational duties against the enemy up to and including the date of disembarkation on return to Australia or allotment to non-operational duties whichever is the earlier; ( i i ) in the case of a unit proceeding from Australia on allotment for operational duties against the enemy-fro m the date of embarkation from Australia up to and including the date of disembarkation on return to Australia or allotment to non-operational duties whichever is the earlier. The areas of operations will be prescribed from time to time as'circumstances warrant. In addition to the categories mentioned, any member of the forces wherever serving outside the mainland of Australia will be covered to the same extent in the event of incapacity or death due to enemy action. This covers possibilities such as a long range bombing plane attacking troops who have not been allotted to operations in Korea or Malaya. The classes of dependants eligible for pension or other benefits will be the same as provided in the existing Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The rates of pensions will be similar and the provision will operate whereby a widow's pension, for the first six months, will be not less than the standard components of service pay and allowance which she was entitled to receive from, or in respect of, the member. Medical treatment for incapacitated members will be on the existing basis which covers all treatment of whatever description required for the incapacity due to war service. It will include the extension whereby treatment is afforded for incapacity not due to service where pension is payable at the general rate for total incapacity, on the higher special rates. Medical benefits for widows and children and certain classes of widowed mothers, on the lines of the present arrangement, will be available. Other benefits in the repatriation activities which have been approved by the Government are as follows:(1) Education of children of deceased, blinded or totally and permanently incapacitated members. (2) Gifts of furniture for members blinded or totally and permanently incapacitated, and widows with children. (3) Tools of trade for members generally. (4) Fares and removal expenses for members proceeding to employment, having pr taking up land. (5) Free passages from Australia to abroad for incapacitated members and families. (6) Immediate assistance up to £5 to a member in necessitous circumstances. (7) Funeral expenses in respect of members where death is due to war service and who die in indigent circumstances and in respect of widows and children and certain classes of widowed mothers where the member's death is due to war service, and are now engaged in a discussion of the the dependants mentioned die iu indigent circumstances. In addition to the provisions which I have outlined for members of the forces, it has been decided to grant certain benefits for Commonwealth employees, such as omciai war correspondents, photographers and cinematographers proceeding to Korea on omciai duties in association with the special overseas force. The benefits will be similar to those granted to similar employees during the 1939-45 war. They include pensions for the employee and dependants, on the same basis as that provided in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act for members of the forces, and medical treatment for incapacity resulting from employment with the forces. Assistaiice for education of children and furniture grants will be made where the employee loses his life, or is rendered totally and permanently incapacitated.

We first budget introduced by the present Government. No budget can be prepared in vacuo, and it is inevitable that a budget, and particularly the first budget of a new administration, should take part of its colour from the events of the past as well as reflect the purposes and proposals of the Government for the period that lies ahead. We have had the advantage of hearing the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), who was also Treasurer in the previous Labour Administration of which he was the head, express his views on the present budget, and I propose to direct some remarks to certain matters which were brought to our notice. The right honourable gentleman made a claim that from a technical Treasury point of view he had left the finances of this country in first-class order. That was a very modest and, I have no doubt, proper claim. However, he went on to embellish his claim by referring to the reductions of tax that had been made by his Administration, the millions of pounds that had been paid to the United and the value of treasury-bills that had been redeemed, and he emphasized the fact that under his Administration our London funds had accumulated to £600,000,000. Of course, those claims are all founded on fact; but I am sure that when the right honourable gentleman made them it must have occurred to many honourable members that those matters did not merit the praise which the right honourable time of abounding revenues, and when business was going for its life in order to try to fill the gaps in demand created by the disorganization caused by the war, it was inevitable that business should make profits and that there should be full employment.

72,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister forpaid for our export products, our revenues currency gives a tremendous impetus to increased to unprecedented heights and our London funds very largely increased. It was inevitable, therefore, that with such abounding revenues any government which had not been hopelessly profligate would reduce taxes. I emphasize the point that many of the matters for which the former Treasurer seeks credit were due to the fortuitous bountiful 3tate of the revenues and were in no way due to the policy or actions of his Government. As I have said, his claim to have left the Treasury in good technical, order was a modest one, but I think that most people woulcl want to be assured of something more than that. Most people would want to know what inheritances were bequeathed Ohifley Administration to its successor, because those inheritances inevitably colour the whole economy of the nation and are, of necessity, reflected in this budget. I propose to discuss some of the conditions associated with the nation's economy and finances which lie outside the narrow claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Treasury was in good shape when he vacated it . A f t e r all, the social and economic condition of the nation shapes and colours any budget more than do the balances shown in various Treasury accounts. The Leader of the Opposition will remember that only a few months prior to December, 1949, he not merely acquiesced in , but actually ordered, the Australian currency to be depreciated in relation to the United States dollar. for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) applauds the non-Labour parties, have no such that decision. However, I remind him capacity or intent. What do we find, howthat the decision grossly to depreciate ever, after eight years' administration our currency came out of a clear sky, by the advocates of a planned economy? at a time when the economic condition Our secondary industries, which had been of Australia did not call for any such developing during the war and post-war action. Furthermore, the United States years, found themselves starved of dollar is, we must admit, the principal power, ooal, bricks, steel and a wide currency of the world to-day, and that range of other basic materials. fact undoubtedly aggravated the conwithstanding that the manufacturing sequences of the depreciation of the Ausindustries had heen growing during the tralian currency. In fact, the T a r i ff war and, particularly in the post-war Board has recently recorded its opinion period, they found year by year a growthat the depreciation of the Australian ing insufficiency of the very basic the already existing inflationary pressures in this community, and I believe that a wide range of informed opinion agrees with that view. From the depreciation of our currency, which took place, speaking from memory, in August, 1949, stemmed a big impetus to the inflationary urges that have affected and afflicted this community ever since. Tliose pressures had, of course, existed in marked form for at least two years previously. That is the first of the inheritances which this Government acquired fro m its predecessor. We also took over a condition of low productivity in a number of our essential by the industries, ancl it cannot be denied that the Government led by the present Leader of the Opposition made no effort at all to correct that situation. I concede at once that low productivity does not characterize all our industries, but it did undoubtedly characterize a number of the basic industries, in which the production per man-year had been very low for some years. MT . CAI.WKLJ. -To what industries is the right honourable member referring? remarks on that subject sufficiently to satisfy any honourable member.

The conditions that we inherited these matters in order of importancewas the activity of the Communists in fluencing not only the budget but also Australia, towards the checking of which the wholeeconomy of this country as the Labour Government made no noticewell as the morale of its people. The able effort. For example, the right result is that inflationary pressures which honourable member for Macquarie when existed for several years before the Labour he was Prime Minister, went to Government went out of office and which the coalfields about eighteen months had been rising in an increasing curve ago when communism was as it without that Government having made is now, rife. made many speeches on the coalthis Government to tackle.

81,Mr Casey,"I shall tell the honorLeader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) I think that I would be in a position to say that he tried wholeheartedly until about three years ago to curb the existing and potential inflationary pressures that were then obvious in this community. I venture to think that something happened about three years ago as a result of which the Leader of the Opposition eased his efforts to curb the inflationary trend, and he did not try any more. Since then he has made no efforts to check the inflationary trend. In fact, he has barely given even lip service to a recognition of the problem of inflation. At the time to which I have referred he turned towards nationalization. Nobody on this side of the committee will ever know whether he took that course as an alternative to having to cope with the inflationary trends that existed. In any event, from then onwards he gave all his undoubted abilities, and a great deal of his time and I refer to coal, steel, cement, bricks, energy, to major attempts to introduce nationalization of banking and other instrumentalities, believing that he could chance his arm o""n a miracle happening. Well, miracles are poor things to rely on, and we do not propose to rely on them foT the salvation of tnis country. Those are our inheritances and the causes of the instability that we have taken over. The task to which we are now attempting to direct ourselves is to recreate stability and confidence in this community. the exchange rate. members opposite about a lot of things that they do not want to hear about. The task we have set ourselves is that of strengthening Australia, not just for the sake of so doing, but, because it is a matter of survival in the years immediately ahead of us. That task leads us into a number of contributory activities, the first of which concerns immigration. Our immigration policy was begun, and begun well by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) when he was Minister for Immigration, and it has been continued and expanded by the present Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt). Our greatest lack is man-power, and the obvious way to obtain man-power in addition to natural increase is to stimulate an increase of population by immigration. That is being done. The next need is the strengthening of our tliree fighting services, which is being done to the limit of our ability. The. third need is the strengthening of our economy. That is not by any means the least of our necessities, because it is of no use to have an increased population and armed forces unless we have also a strong, stable and well-balanced economy to back them up. That is one of the tasks to which we are addressing ourselves. Manufacturing industry is increasing almost of its own momentum all the time, but we have to repair the damage that was done by the previous Government, and to increase the production of essential materials on which all industry depends. coke, housing, water, power, and rail communications. Those are the basic housekeeping tasks and a considerable part of them is the responsibility of the two departments of which I am the Ministerial head. The simple fact is that Australia is working right up to the limit of its man-power, which, fortunately, is increasing, and it is also -reaching out well beyond the limit of its existing resources. Australia is power starved and power hungry particularly in comparison with other countries, such as America. That position has an effect on our productivity. blame the Labour Government for that. Government for it, because the means of producing power are not created overnight, but require long preparation. The Commonwealth and the States, particularly the States, are now desperately trying to overcome the lack of power production, especially for industries in New South Wales and Victoria. The task of development is frequently visualized as one of stimulating and originating a few spectacular projects. I believe that these great projects are little more than a side issue of the developmental task. The main task is to bring",24,Budget 1950 51

91,Mr Casey,"Yes. There are five in the near future. Much has been10 per cent, of Australian industry is so working. surveys have been made concerning the advantages of certain Australian incentive systems. I think particularly of one that was conducted in Victoria about two years ago. In that case five or six well qualified industrialists inquired into incentive schemes operating in Victoria. They found that in practice over the years incentive schemes in which 15,000 or 16,000 workers are concerned had resulted in the workers' earnings increasing to between 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, above the award rates. The workers' earnings increased by an average of about 28 per cent, above the award rates. It was also found that the schemes had resulted in a 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, increase in production. Moreover, the schemes were proved to have been not detrimental to the health of the workers or to the quality of the products. In fact, the schemes had achieved remarkable results for the workers, the managements and the community in general. This is clearly not the time to discuss at length, incentive payments or any other encouragements to productivity, hut I hope that honourable members opposite will not allow their minds to close against the opportunity which exists for the introduction of incentive schemes in Australia. I expect that a number of honourable members have read the recently written book by Walter Scott, who is one of Australia's foremost authorities on incentive schemes and on many other related productivity matters. He has written a monumental volume on productivity in Australia, which I commend to honourable members who have not yet had an opportunity of reading it. tee have we that incentive payments, if introduced now, will continue when labour becomes plentiful? Mi. CASEY Incentive schemes 1 generally take that matter into account. Incentive schemes are not by any means new. It is well known that they were much abused 20 and 30 years ago, to the detriment of the workers, but since then industry has become much wiser and the modern incentive scheme is introduced, with the consent of the unions and the workers, only after months of In the last few years study. There are all possible safeguards to ensure that it shall work fairly to the men and the management. The modern incentive scheme is not put into operation, as were some of those of 20 or 30 years ago, after a mere week or two of thought. It is instituted only after many months of consideration. If there is any doubt in the minds of the. management or the man about the fairness of the scheme and what will happen when production is increased or when prices fall or when labour becomes more plentiful, then the scheme cannot succeed. Such carefully prepared incentive schemes have succeeded in Britain, America and to a lesser degree in Australia. There is vast literature on this subject, and the introduction of incentive schemes is almost 'a profession. My only fear is that incentive schemes will be hurriedly introduced and that they will therefore fail. The one or two dozen examples that I have in mind which are operating in Australia, have taken six or eight months to work out between management, union, men and productivity experts. liament any legislative power to prevent the abuse of incentive systems? of literature on that matter, for it has been f ully discussed. Parliament the power? sidetracked on this matter to which I have referred. I am trying to establish that incentive schemes are not inventions of the devil. They can be of great advantage to both labour and management as well as to the country as a whole. They can also raise the general living standards of the community. I shall not impose upon the committee at any greater length on this matter, except to say that towards the end of his speech the Leader of the Opposition spoke in terms which gave me some hope. He spoke of the need in this community for tolerance, understanding ancl confidence. His plea was rather brief, but I was very pleased to hear it, and I venture to support it ; but not in any narrow field. I believe that Australia suffers probably",27,Budget 1950 51

96,Mr Casey,"I do not intend to bemore than any other country from schisms, divisions and antagonisms in a very wide field. There is too much mutual antagonism, for our comfort, between various sections of the Australian -community. I believe that we could introduce a much greater degree of trust into our relationships, and eliminate the distrust which is now so widespread and so immensely to our disadvantage. In the sphere of Gommonwealth and State relations it is essential for the Commonwealth to reach a better understanding with the State governments. If that does not happen, the departments for which I am responsible for the time being w ill suffer immensely. I am trying in my particular sphere to create conditions of confidence and trust between the departments which are my responsibility and the State governments with which they have to deal. There are certain sections in Australia which have a vested interest in discontent and have had it for many years. Eveni n this chamber things said by honourable members opposite from time to time are extremely harmf u l to our community. I do not refer to what they say against the Government, because the task of the Opposition is to oppose. So long as honourable members opposite direct their shafts at the parties which make up this Government, good luck to them. But they begin to do harm and damage to Australia when they say things directed towards causing distrust and misunderstanding in the country between management between capital and labour. honourable member knows that when such things are said they are well founded. they are well founded, other than in exceptional instances.

POLLARD (Lalor) [ 4 . 6 ] In the limited time allowed under the Standing Orders, it is exceedingly difficult for honorahle members to deal thoroughly with a comprehensive document like the budget. In a budget debate honourable members inevitably are impelled to reply to statements that have been made by preceding speakers. I propose to reply to some of the remarks that were made by the Ministerf o r National Development ( Mr Casey). He concluded bis speech by saying, in effect, that it was regrettable that we in the Parliament seem to be unable to refrain from indulging in abuse. However, during the greater part of his speech he poured abuse upon the Chifley Government, and in doing so gave utterance to several falsehoods. He said that the present and men. and Government assumed office at a time when the morale of the Australian people was exceedingly low, and added that the Government was faced with the task of reestablishing confidence and stability. He went on to laud the effort of the present I do not know that Government in obtaining a dollar loan. The fact is that when it assumed office Australia was enjoying a period of unprecedented prosperity. It took over responsibility when the Chifley Government had successfully demobilized more than 1,000,000 ex-service men and women and had practically completed the task of rehabilitating and training them with the bosses do it result that the services of thousands of additional artisans and skilled profesI am not saying anysional personnel were made available to the Australian economy.

102,Mr Casey,"I have made that stateOhifley Government's scheme for the rehabilitation of ex-service personnel. Usually, persons versed in business affairs point to the share market as an indicator of a country's prosperity and of the degree of confidence that exists in it. Any one who would say that when thc Chifley Government went out of oflice the share market was not buoyant, that the country was not prosperous and that there was not ful l employment in Australia-that happy result was achieved for the first time in our history-woul d be exceedingly blind. While the Minister was speaking about the need to provide incentive payments in industry in order to encourage greater production, I made a cursory mental survey of industrial development in Australia during the last few years. The Minister would be well advised to do likewise. During the regime of the Chifley Government some of the greatest industries that this country now possesses were firmly established, mainly as the result of the magnificent assistance that that Government rendered to them. When Bruck Mills (Australia) Limited established its industry at Wangaratta, did it not have the greatest confidence in the Chifley Government which was in oflice at that time ? Works and Housing in the ChifleyA Labour government was in office when an Australian organization, General Motors-Holden's Limited, manufactured the first complete car to be made in Australia. It owed much of its success to the assistance and encouragement that it received from the Chifley Government. The Minister and his colleagues need reminding of these facts. When Labour was in office enormous capital in dollars and sterling were invested in undertakings in Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Limited, with the assistance of a Labour government, established its immense chemical works near Sydney. I participated in negotiations that enabled that company to acquire boilers that had been installed in the power alcohol distillery at Warracknabeal. similar negotiations, valtiable' plant that hydro-electric power scheme was placed had been used in the manufacture of munitions was transferred to private enterprise. Yet the Minister has the effrontery to say that, when the present Government took over, the morale of the Sir. Pollard. Australian people was low and that the Ministry was confronted with the task of restoring confidence and stability. That is sheer propaganda,The Chifley Government assisted the International Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited at Geelong to acquire dollar goods with which to establish its huge tractor project. It is true that the present Government has given further assistance to that organization, but thc project was actually commenced when the Chifley Government was in office. That Government also assisted the great Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is probably the most efficient private organization in Australia, by arranging dollar finance to enable it to import its tinplate strip mill. The Chifley Government actually suggest -d to General Motors-Holden's Limited that it should manufacture a complete motor car, and to-day Holden cars which are being turned out by Australian workmen are to be seen on roads in all parts of the Commonweal th. The Minister harped about lack of enterprise, the low morale in the community and the need to increase our power resources. The Minister for Government ( Mr Lemmon) established a record that the right honourable gentleman who has succeeded him will never emulate."" He succeeded after 50 years' talk by conservative governments in inaugurating the great Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme.

Wo! Like the promise to put value hack into the t l, that undertaking was a hollow sham. The people were deceived. The Minister knows in his own heart, if he is f r a n k with himself, that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act represents a magnificent achievement by the Chifley Government and that he w ill not attempt to alter one line of it . I remind the honourable gentleman of something else'. For many years, in peace-time, the wheat-growers were, unable to get a nation-wide marketing scheme for their product, but finally a Labour government lined up every State government, for the first time in Australia's history, and succeeded in enacting a wheat stabilization plan. I l gained the co-operation of anti-Labour governments in some of the .States. One of the greatest tributes that could be paid to that achievement is thu fiict that the present Ministerf or Commerce McEwen) has promised the farmers that, he will extend the scheme for a. further period of five years. Everybody knows that, thc present Leader of the Opposition, when he was Treasurer, supplied the financial needs of the States so effectively that they were able to obtain labour and matnr'uils to put extensive public, works in hand. The facts are undeniable. It is of no use for the Premiers to ask for millions of pounds annually if they are unable to spend such sums. Competent, officers of the Treasury and the Department of Works and Housing assert that, the States would not, be able to make f u l l use of larger grants than have been made availableto them, and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) recently reminded the Premiers of that fact. I do not believe that any State government, whether liberal or Labour, can expend even the full amount of the money allocated to it this year by the Menzies Government. The achievements of the Chifley Government provide no evidence of any dogfights with the States. The only dogfights of which I am aware have been engendered by the ever-increasing insistence of this Government that the workers are not pulling their weight. Honourable members opposite have reHave they vived the old slogan on production, and alleged statesmen have been talking about production and incentive schemes for generations in all sorts of circumstances and in all forms of society. It is strange that the Government and its supporters still harp on the same worn theme. I believe that every man should pull his weight, but only the workers are blamed by this Government for the weaknesses in our economy. Production has always been supposed to be a cure-all f of our economic ills. I remind honourable members of a debate that took place in the House of Commonsi n 1932, when both Australia and. the United Kingdom were in the depths of an economic depression. T h irty per cent, of the workers in Australia were unemployed and an equally disastrous state of affairs prevailed in the United Kingdom. Those conditions were in marked contrast to conditions to-day, when we have f u l l employment in Australia. Yet at that and Agriculture ( Mr time the howl was. "" Produce, produce, produce! "" Mr Amery, a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom Parliament, said in the House of Commons in .1.932The one thing that mutters to-day is produetion. And Dick Casey still says so! The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN Order right honourable gentleman. The Minister for National Development still say? that, production is the cure-all for every economic ill . Mr Amery continuedAnd that depends on two closely interrelated lines of policy. The first is our fiscal policy and the second is our monetary policy. That howl is still being raised in Anstralia. The workers of Anstralia are reluctant, in many instances, to produce more unless they are assured by their employers that they w ill receive a f a ir proportion of the increased production. The responsibility is on the employers to offer inducements. I have observed that when employers offer inducements they got in return loyalty and increased production +'rom the Australian worker who if the best worker in the world.",30,Budget 1950 51

The reverse also applies. people in the electorate that he repreThat is inevitable under our present system, and the fact should be obvious to the honourable member. While that system is maintained, there must be a continuing conflict between employers and employees. Our arbitration system has from time to time increased the employees' share of the returns from production, and some Christian and well-disposed employers have voluntarily increased the returns to their workers. Such employers are getting good results in industry. However, fights between employer and employee will continue as long as our present system exists and there will be unceasing industrial trouble. obvious, but they should be emphasized. The situation will not be rectified until ownership of all industry is shared with the workers. Everybody who has worked as a selfemployed person or who has watched other Australians working for themselves in any capacity must realize that Australians will produce more in that capacity than they produce when they are working for an employer. As a primary producer for many years, I worked on Saturdays and even, he it said to my shame, on Sundays.' T did so because I was working for myself. I would never work on Saturdays or Sundays for an employer. The repeated complaint by the Government that production has decreased is an unwarranted slur on the Australian worker. It is not supported by facts. Professor Copland has pointed out that over-all production in Australia has increased hy 12-J per cent. sii?ce the beginning of World WarI I . It is true that the production of luxury goods has been accelerated to the disadvantage of the production of basic commodities, but the fact is that Australian workers are producing at a higher rate to-day than at any other time in the nation's history. Fr. TRELOAB -Bricklayers , too? labouring work for afirst-classbricklayer. T h f t tradesman, working on a chimney, laid 470 bricks for the day. against union rules; ber knows little about the work of laying bricks, although he has: been exploiting sents by selling bricks. Last night the Prime Minister quoted voluminously from the opinions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court judges in the basic wage case and played on the theme that, if wages were increased and hours were reduced, prices would go up. The right honourable gentleman was implying, because he did not have the courage to say so directly, that wage increases and reductions of hours were undesirable in our economy. He did not emphasize that the judges had pointed out that the remedy for-price increases which flowed These facts are from increased wages and reduced hours of labour was political. Because of that fact,, the learned gentlemen were unable to point out that the present economic situation resulted from the failure of the Government to put value back into the £1. However, it is obvious that the judges were pointing the bone fit the Government. An immense volume of production by Australian workers has heen unrecorded in recent years. I made a survey recently, and I found that many workers were engaged in spare-time work, that was of great value to the community. In one locality of which I know something, five men are building homes for themselves at week-ends. In summer montlis, they will work every evening until dusk.

Unfortunately, the only incentives that are offered to them in industiy to-day are those for which they have had to fight, mighty hard. member is opposed to incentive schemes. tive that Australia could offer to its wool producers to-day would not be big enough.

What sort of incentive is that? Of all industries in Australia, the wool industry is the one that serves us best by financing our imports. It makes possible the importation of dollar -equipment. The rapidly increasing demand for Australian wool in the United States of America makes it almost unnecessary for the Government to put itself in pawn for dollars. Yet the Government has humbled itself so abjectly that, accordSoon after it came into office, the United ing to reports, the Governor of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will visit us in order to give us the once-over and ascertain whether we are using the dollar loan as we ought to use it. The Minister for National Development said that the Leader of the Opposition was opposed to the dollar loan. That is not strictly correct. The Leader of the Opposition was critical of the dollar loan and said that the necessity for it might have been averted. I agree with him. It was my privilege to act as a member of the dollar committee of the Chifley Government over a long period, and I know of no really deserving basic industry in Australia that did not obtain an allotment of dollars sufficient to meet its essential needs at that time. The fact is that the Chifley Government brought as many crawler tractors and other items of heavy equipment into Australia as were available in the United States of America. At one period we could not have obtained any additional agricultural tractors from America even if we had been able to command an additional 100,000,000 dollars. Some of the importing firms in Australia were absolutely unable to obtain more tractors from their principals in the United States of America. Our difficulties were not caused by dollar shortages then. They were caused by a shortage of equipment in the United States of America. I repeat that no industry in Australia was starved of essential dollars. ducer in the electorate that the honourable member represented was able to obtain petrol in generous quantities for his genuine requirements. was suffered can be construed only as a scathing commentary upon the effectiveness of the honourable member as the representative of the electors in his division. This Government pandered to selfish motor cyclists and pleasure seekers to the detriment of the Empire dollar pool. It was able to abolish petrol rationing only by virtue of fortuitous circumstances. Kingdom Government was able to make arrangements with the United States Government and the oil interests for the manufacture of tankers in the United Kingdom as an offset against dollar expenditure on oil and other requirements. Members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party sneer at the assistance that was granted by the preceding Labour Government to the United Kingdom, yet they have not an enviable record in that respect. The present Government pandered to the selfish instincts of the Australian people when it abolished meat and butter rationing. British. At least, the Chifley Government did not dangle before the eyes of the people during the last general election campaign a succulent bait in the form of a promise to abolish meat and butter rationing. We learn to-day that the people of the United Kingdom are as urgently in need of meat and butter as they were a considerable time ago, and that their position is almost desperate. I am stating facts. Labour Government take to provide meat for Great Britain? give the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Davis) that information. The Labour Government introduced meat rationing, and retained it throughout its term of office. By adopting that policy, it incurred the hostility of the honourable member for Deakin, and of the selfish interests that he represents.

I realize that meat rationing i i exceptionally difficult to operate, and that some people suffered as a result of its introduction, but I did not hear of a butcher going bankrupt for reasons attributable to it . However, I have heard of people in the United Kingdom being nn the verge of starvation because they have not sufficient food. The Chifley Lahour Government continued butter rationing in order that Australia might supply greater quantities of that commodity to Great Britain, and those increased supplies had a. beneficial effect upon the general health of the people of that country. AVhat is more, we did not abolish butter rationing iu order to win votes at a general election. Yet this Government was no sooner in the saddle lhan it abolished meat and butter rationing. A few wfoks ago, it abolished rice rationing, at a time when people in Korea were dying from starvation. The Government made the decision to abolish rice rationing in order to pander to a few selfish interests here. Afembers of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party, when they were in Opposition, frequently spoke of their loyalty to the United Kingdom, and urged the preceding Labour Government to grant additional assistance to that country. The Labour Government retained meat and butter rationing in order to help the people of the United Kingdom, and, in addition, made gifts in cash totalling £45,000,000. The record of the present Government is not comparable with that of the preceding Labour Government in that respect.

Others will not enlist for service anywhere in the world in the numbers that are expected by the Government, because they do not know what may be involved. Had the Government continued the defence policy of the Chifley Government, whilst increasing rates of pay and making conditions of service more attractive, Australians would have reacted as they did in the past, that is to say, they would have enlisted for service in Australia, and if a conflagration were to occur abroad, they would have responded as the members of the first Australian Imperial Force and of Thc Chifley Governresponded, and would have flocked in We volunteer for service abroad.

I regret that the Governmeut has made a grave mistake in its defence policy, and I advise it to reconsider its decision. The Government is granting substantial subsidies in respect of butter, tea, wheat and woollen goods for use in Australia, but it has abolished the subsidy that was paid for years on superphosphate. In my opinion, that subsidy wa3 one of the greatest incentives to primary producers that this country has ever known. According to statements that we hear from time to time, the Government' firmly believes in the policy of granting subsidies to various industries. I point out to the chamber that the budget papers clearly reveal that the only reason why the Government is paying increased subsidies on butter and wheat is that the prices authorities in the States would not allow the increased cost of producing those commodities to be passed on to the consumers. It w ill be f u t i l e for the Government to tell this Parliament or the public that it is paying increased subsidies on butter and wheat out of kindness of heart. In Statement No. 9 of the budget papers, the details are given of various subsidies, including the estimated payments for 1950-51 compared with the actual expenditure on them in the last financial year. The estimated subsidy expenditure this year on butter, cheese and processed milk products is £11,300,000, compared with an actual expenditure in I knew where the 1949-50 of £8,008,500. For some years, the preceding Labour Government paid a subsidy on butter at the rate of 6d. per lb. in order to maintain the price to the Australian consumer at a reasonable level, and, later, approved a guaranteed price to butter producers. It is true that, I went to Egypt, after the expiration of a year, that Government asked the State prices authorities to pass on to the public an increase of the cost of production, because it was considered that a subsidy of nearly 7d. per lb. was an adequate measure of assistance at that time. However, the present Government claims that it is paying a subsidy of nearly l i d . per lb. to butter producers out of sheer kindness of heart. The budget papers contain the following interesting statement:The home-consumption prices of butter, cheese and processed milk products are being held at a level lower than is necessary to give the farmer his guaranteed return, and unless the State Prices Ministers agree to a rise in home-consumption prices, the increases in cost of production which have been established in respect of 1950-51 will have to be met by subsidy. The lifting of butter rationing also adds to the cost of the subsidy. In respect of locally consumed butter and cheese, the present rate of subsidy is 10.9d per Ib. commercial butter basis. The reference to wheat also interests me. It is as follows:In accordance with the Commonwealth's guarantee to the wheat industry the return to growers, in respect of wheat consumed in Australia from the 1949-50 crop, was increased by 5d. per bushel as from lst 'December, 1949, to cover, a rise in the cost of production. The Government decided to subsidize this increase rather than allow the effect to pass into the price of basic consumer goods. When that decision was made, a general election was pending, and it was",34,Budget 1950 51

136,Mr Pollard,"I enlisted to servenot considered that the prices authorities would allow an increase of costs to be passed on to the consumer. I note that the subsidy for prefabricated in proportion to that of the wool-grower^ houses in this financial year is estimated at £1,500,000. We cannot object to that provision; we can only applaud it, because it will make possible a reduction of prices. The Government proposes to retain the subsidy on tea that was granted by the preceding Labour Government. The provision of an amount of £20,000,000 as a subsidy on woollen goods for home consumption is fully warranted , but I do not know how the 1 Government will ensure that that benefit shall be passed on to the purchasers of those materials. The charges that are made by wholesale and retail houses will need to be. effectively policed. However, the granting of that subsidy is desirable. PerhapsI shall be permitted to remark, at this point, that it is strange that some time before the Treasurer presented his budget, publicity was given to the so called Copland plan, and we were told that wool-growers would be subject to a levy of 33$ per cent, on the proceeds from the sale of their wool, and that the funds so collected would be devoted to financing a subsidy on woollen goods consumed in this country. land told the honourable gentleman that, but the Government did not. cussions in the Cabinet. The Australian Country party wing of the Government objected to that proposal, and the Liberal party ran away from it. In my opinion, the plan was bad, bnt the Government has substituted the greatest sham proposal that has ever been devised in the history of the Commonwealth. The wool sales deduction will be imposed upon a section of primary producers who should be given the incentive to produce. It will be a sectional levy. It is true that the incomes of wool prohis speech last night, had a great deal ducers are buoyant, but the Government to say about the wheat-growers, who proposes to impose the wool sales deduc»make available a large quantity of wheat tion on their gross returns, whereas such for home consumption at low prices. a levy, if it must be made, should be However, the point is that that arrangeimposed upon the net returns. I note ment was made as the result of an agreethat the Government is not attempting to ment between the Chifley Labour Gomake brokers, who charge the same rate vernment and the wheat-growers of Ausof commission to-day as they charged tralia, which was approved at a poll when the price of wool was 8d. or 10d. per lb., subject to the wool sales deduction.. The income of the woolbroker has risen yet he will not be required to make a contribution. Many people engaged in various forms of business are receiving' fabulously high incomes that are addingto the inflationary trends. But the wool grower alone must pay the wool salesdeduction, which is a payment of tax in advance. By that crooked method, the -Government expects to extract £103,000,000 from the wool-grower, and expend it as revenue. If the Government is genuinely desirous of combating inflation, it may adopt various methods, such as increasing the incidence of taxation on a graduated scale, and keeping excess moneys out of circulation. Of course, the Government could have adopted the Copland plan, although I do not advocate that. The proposal which the Government has adopted, however, to make a special deduction from the incomes of wool-growers will prove to he no more than a snare and a delusion. There are, of course, hundreds of individuals in all spheres of business activity who are making considerable profits. Lf the Government is justified in taking surplus profits from the wool-growers, why does it not take similar action in respect of all other people who are making large profits ? What is the reason for the discrimination, which is fantastic? The wool sales deduction does not discriminate between the wealthy graziers and the strugglers. Because of the high prices paid for wool, many small farmers and dealers have gone into the sale yards and paid as much as £6 and £7 a head for sheep, and most of those individuals will need every penny that they can get from the sale of their wool.

138,Mr Pollard,"There were reperof tLe wheat-growers throughout Australia, under which the Government guarantees that wheat-growers shall receive a certain price for their wheat in the event of the overseas price falling below a certain figure. As an illustration of his argument that the wool-grower has no just cause for complaint the right honorahle gentleman also mentioned the fact that the metal producers of Australia make available a proportion of their production for sale in Australia at a reduced price, and pointed out that the wage-earners who pay tax suffer some disability because a portion of their wages bright-and that in the forseeable future no is withheld from them in order to pay their income tax. However, what the Prime Minister deliberately omitted to say was that every wool-grower The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr £1 a week was justified, not because of Ryan) -Orde r ! The honourable member's extended time has expired. budget presented by the Treasurer ( Mr increased wage. Eadden) indicates the very remarkable recovery that has taken place in our economy since the present Government assumed office, and that impression is confirmed by statistics which I have abstracted from the latest return that I have been able to obtain from the Commonwealth Statistician-. Every business indicator shows that a most remarkable improvement has occurred in our economic position during, the last ten months. For example, the number of wage and salary earners in employment in May, 1949, was 2,451,000, and by May, 1950, the number had increased to 2,544,000, an increase of 93,000. The average weekly earnings of wage and salary earners also increased by 19s. 6d. during that period. It is clear from the judgments of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the recent basic wage case that the basis upon which the general increase of f l a week was granted by the court was not, as has been suggested by members of the Australian Labour party, the needs of the people, but the general economic condition of the community. In other words, the court has decided what is fair and reasonable according to the state of our economy and according to the ability of the community to pay a higher basic wage. On page 25 of his judgment the Chief Judge statedFrom the June quarter 1949 to the June quarter 1950 the Commonwealth Statistician shows an increase in average weekly earnings of 11.2 per cent, in manufacturing and 11.1 per cent, in all industries. Mr Justice Foster, who delivered one of the majority judgments, made this observationThe general impression has come to me from the evidence, particularly from the official statistical evidence, that tbe economy is very prosperous, and that the prospects for the immediate future are bright-perhap s very threat to its continued prosperity should be feared. Following that observation the learned judge made it perfectly clear that, in his opinion,, an increase of the basic wage by the needs of the people, but because of the general prosperity of the country and the ability of our economy to meet an only one judge. in the majority on the tribunal. I propose to illustrate the improvement that has taken place in our economy and in general living conditions since the present Government assumed office by citing some important statistics. In April, 1949, Unemployment payments totalled £22,062, but by April of this year they had declined to £12,597, which was a decrease of £9,465. Between June, 1949, and June of this year the value of our imports increased by £122,000,000, and during the same period the value of our exports increased by £74,000,000. The number of building permits granted in May, 1949, was 6,801, but the number granted in May last was 10,043. The number of motor cars registered between January and May, 1950, exceeded those registered during the corresponding period of 1949, the increase for the year being 106,724. The average weekly bank clearings, which are a very good indicator of general business activity, increased during that period by more than £38,000,000 a week. Savings bank deposits also increased by £47,000,000. Coal production in Australia for the twelve months ended July",36,Budget 1950 51

In addition, the present Government has taken action to import more than 1,000,000 tons of coal, and, as a consequence, all our industries have been working full time during this year, whereas, last year, because of the lack of sumcient coal, during the administration of the Labour Government, a,large number of secondary industries had to be closed and a substantial number of men were unemployed. The improvement of the dollar position is one of the most spectacular achievements of the present Government. The dollar resources of the sterling area increased from 1.320,000,000 dollars in September, 1949, to 2,422,000,000 dollars at the 30th June last Our former dollar deficit has been transformed into a dollar surplus. If honourable members will examine the Commonwealth Statistician's ngures for the last few months they will notice that for the first time in many years Australia has had a dollar surplus each month. The Treasurer has recognized that all Provision is also made in the budget for sections of the community are entitled to payment of increased war pensions to share in the existing national prosperity children of deceased ex-servicemen.

Similarly, those who suffer from total deafness also endure a frightful disability. Nevertheless, the previous Labour Government was not prepared to increase their pension rate from 70 per cent, of the full pension to 100 per cent. BecauseI wus a member of a deputation that waited upon the present Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) to urge the Government to increase the rate of pension payable to totally deaf ex-servicemen, I am more than pleased that the Minister has persuaded the Government to increase the pension from 70 per cent, to 100 per cent. Very substantial increases will also be granted to limbless ex-servicemen, details of whioh have already been given by the Minister for Repatriation and published in the press. The basic pension of . a widow of a deceased ex-serviceman will be increased to £3 10s. a week, and if she is more than 50 years of age, or has children under sixteen years of age, she will be entitled to an additional payment of 10s. a week. Another anomaly which the previous restriction has now been removed and that, provided a soldier is entitled to a pension, his wife and children also are entitled to pensions, irrespective of the dates of marriage and of birth. Provision is also made in the budget for the pensions of parents of deceased members of the military forces to be increased by amounts of up to 10s. a week. The budget further provides that a gratuity shall be paid to the widow of an ex-serviceman, when she re-marries, equivalent to a year's pension, which is about £182. Por several years complaints have been made about the meagre allowance provided for Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees. Deputations which waited upon Ministers in the Labour Government to make representations about that matter were sent away unsatisfied. I am triad to know that, as a result of a deputation to this Government, provision has been made in the budget for an increase of 7s. 6d. a week in the allowances paid to reconstruction trainees. Widows' pensions also are to be increased by 7s. 6d. a week. The committee composed of ex-servicemen members of the Government parties recently made representations to the Government, that motor cars be made available for ex-servicemen who are double amputees. I am gratified that provision has been made in the budget for the supply of a car and an allowance of £120 per annum to cover registration fees, third party insurance and other expenses, to double amputees, so as to enable them to move about. Recreational transport allowances also are to be'provided for those whose movements are restricted owing to the loss of a limb. Submissions in favour of an extension of benefits to additional classes of ex-servicemen and the Repatriaable gentleman made a definite statement tion Department having conferred on it discretionary powers in relation to the provision of extra, facilities to disabled ex-servicemen, were placed before the former Labour Government in October, 194.6, November, 1946, and October, 1948, but were rejected. Provision is made in the budget for the supply of special devices to be fitted to motor cars to enable disabled ex-servicemen to get about. The allowance for the purchase of books and equipment by trainees also has been substantially increased. Several applications were made to the Labour Govez-nment for' the institution of machinery to enable widows to receive their pensions by cheques so that they would not have to leave their homes and their young children in order to collect them in cash. The Labour Government refused these requests. The present Government has now met the wishes of the widows and other pensioners by making arrangements for them to receive their pensions by cheque. Veiy substantial beuefits have been provided for in the budget for age and invalid pensioners. The age pension is to be increased by 7s. Cd. from £2 2s. 6d. to £2 10s. a week, and the widows' pension by 7s. 6d. a week from £2 7s. 6d. to £2 los. a week. In addition, free life-saving drugs are now available to age and invalid pensioners, in common with all other members of the community. Their provision will be of considerable benefit to age and invalid pensioners who are at a stage in life when such drugs are more essential to them than to other people. The budget also provides for an expenditure of £2,000,000 pn general medical services and free medicines for age, invalid and service pensioners. I trust that the scheme under which these services are to bc provided will be expedited. Prior to the last general election the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) intimated that it would be the policy of a Liberal-Australian Country party Government eventually to abolish the means test, which is a definite discouragement of thrift. It penalizes those who have endeavoured to provide for their old age and against sickness. The right honorabout that matter in his policy speech, but he did not make the statement which certain members of the Opposition have attempted to attribute to him. He stated that during this term of the Parliament a plan would he prepared for submission to the people at the next general election, which woulcl have the effect of totally abolishing the means test. It would be futile to imagine that the means test could be abolished without cost. Its abolition will cost about £100,000,000 a year. I believe, however, that it should be, and must be, abolished, and that the people will be ready to make some contribution to a fund that will give them security in their old age and enable them to draw superannuation as a right and not as a charity. Already the Government, in accordance with its policy, has taken certain steps towards abolishing the means test. That test does not apply to the receipt of endowment for the first child of a family. The maximum permissible income of age and invalid pensioners has been increased from £3 12s. 6d. to £4 a week, that amount, of course, including the pension itself. missible income of married pensioners has been raised from £7 5s. a week to £8 a week. During the regime of the Labour Government a man who, when he was young, had taken out a life insurance policy for the benefit of his wife and children, found when he applied for the age pension that the surrender value of the policy was taken into account when his entitlement to the pension was being considered. Some time ago I led a deputation to the Minister for Social Services (Senator Spooner) who pointed out_the injustice of that provision and asked that the surrender value of such a life insurance policy, which was for the benefit task, therefore, is to get value back into the of a man's dependants and not for his own benefit, should be totally disregarded in the application of the means test.. Although the Minister has not gone so far as we had hoped he would, he has exempted the surrender value of life policies up to £500 from calculations in relation to the means test for age and invalid pensions. That provision covers the great majority of cases of age pensioners, because few of them hold policies the surrender value of which exceeds £500. Another respect in which the means test has been eased is in relation to the receipt the Government of the United States of of sickness and unemployment benefits. In the past the pension of a war pensioner was taken into account when his entitlement to sickness and unemployment benefits was being considered. The amount that a grateful nation was paying to him for a disability that he had incurred in action could disentitle him from receiving either of those benefits. The means test has been so eased that a war pension is Mr Wilson. now to be totally disregarded when entitlement to unemployment or other benefits is being considered. The Government's policy is, as far as possible, to achieve stability of prices. The present Prime Minister in his policy speech made a statement that has proved to be probably the most misquoted statement ever made. I point out to honourable members opposite that it is what the right honourable gentleman said that matters, not what he was misreported to have said. Every honourable member opposite has had cause to complain occasionally that the press has misreported his utterances. We know that The perpersons are misreported on many occasions, and that there are also occasions on which some particularly enthusiastic people exaggerate or extend the meaning of what a person has said. What the Prime Minister did say is set out in his policy speech, which was published in full inpractically every newspaper in Australia. It was also broadcast over the air and printed in booklet form and is correct in every detail. This is what he saidThe statistician will conservatively allow that the £1 of 1939 is now only worth 12s. 2d. in purchasing power, hut on the true cost of household requirements it would be nearer the mark to say it is worth only 10s. The greatest £1, that is, to get prices down. It is absolutely untruthful for honourable members of the Opposition to say that the right honroable gentleman promised to put value back into the £1. Certain newspapers and supporters of the present Government might have said that but what the Prime Minister said is in black arid white. He said, in effect, that the greatest problem that any government could face was that of putting value back into the £1. That is the greatest problem that America has to face; it is the greatest problem that the Labour Government in England has to face; and it is the greatest problem that this or any other government in Australia could have to face. There is a lot of alarmist talk about prices. The American Consuli n Adelaide returned recently from America and, after mentioning the very prosperous conditions in America The; Order!The honorable member's time has expired'.. I heard the present Prime Minister( Mr budget with the wife I sometimes wond'er Menzies) deliver his policy speech prior to the last general election. Despite what is in. the hook from which the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) quoted, the right honourable gentleman made the clear promise that, if returned, his Government would put value back into the £1. He may have given the matter further thought before the policy speech was put into book form, with the result that it was altered, but that promise was made and millions of Australian people heard him make it. The honourable member for Sturt boasted about the prosperity of this country. It was not the present Government that brought about that prosperity. It has not been in power long enough to do so, and has not done enough to achieve it since it has been in office. There is no doubt that there is prosperity in this country for some persons. One may see evidence of that if one examines share lists and company returns and observes the huge profits which the Prime Minister has admitted are being made and on which he intends to impose an excess profits tax. The principle that the basic wage should be based on the capacity of industry to pay was introduced in the dire days of the depression, when the country could not alford to pay existing wages. The court was told that .before wages could be increased the economic condition of the country must be taken into consideration. Ever since then, the worker has been left iu a parlous position. If there is another tendency towards depression in this country the basic wage, because it is computed in that manner, must fall and continue to fall. The honourable member for Sturt stated that the increase of £1 a week in the basic wage was granted not because of the needs of the worker, but because of the prosperity of the country. That is an astounding statement. This £1 will not pay the week-end meat bill of a man with a wife and a couple of children. It will not pay the increase in his rent nor [45] potatoes and tomatoes, the latter of which have been selling at 4s. and os. per lb-.. When I discuss my home how working people manage to live. The honourable gentleman referred to the dollar loan. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) that this loan is full of danger. When the Bruce-Page Government was in power it adopted a policy of "" borrow and bust"", the borrowing being from Great Britain, a country then under the control of capitalism. It borrowed so much that it left this country destitute of London funds. That was one of the causes of the beginning of the depression. Now that there is a Labour government in Great Britain this Government is switching over to capitalist America and is going to adopt the same policy in regard to borrowing dollars. If the Government continues with this loan policy it will bring about similar results to those that were produced in 1929 by the Bruce-Page Government. As I listened to the wireless and newspaper reports of the Cabinet meetings that were held before the budget was introduced, I wondered how many budgets had been submitted to Cabinet. According to the newspapers, there were four or five. I should not be surprised if there had been a dozen. It is only because it is now so close to the end of the year and the Government can procrastinate no longer that it has brought down this muddled budget. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) tried to blame the Opposition for the delay in introducing the budget, by saying that it had held up legislation in another place. The fact is that the Cabinet, for weeks and weeks, wrangled over the dollar loan, depreciation and other matters on which the Australian Country party and the Liberal party clashed. Principles incorporated in this budget contradict the inherent policies of both. Of the Government's attempts to deal with inflation in this budget it can be said that the mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse. There is not the slightest indication in the budget of anything that will in any way retrieve",37,Budget 1950 51

Like the other actions and promises of the Government it will liave no stabilizing effect at all. Thc Prime Minister has stated that he intends to direct labour into essential industries. When the Chifley and Curtin Governments were forced to do that through the exigencies of war, honourable members of the Government parties said that the Labour party was pushing people round and niching their freedom from them. The right honourable gentleman, as a constitutional authority, should know that he has no power at all during peace-time to direct labour. not say that he would direct people to employment. was one of the things he would do to put value back into the £ 1 . That statement was published in the Sydney Morning Herald a few days before the budget speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), and I suggest that honourable members should read it for themselves. Prime Minister said specifically that controls would be imposed in order to restrict the volume of labour entering industries of minor importance. AlthoughI am not a constitutional lawyer, I say that the Government has no power to do such a thing. also said that he intended to control basic materials, as was done by the Labour Government during the war. He has no constitutional power to control basic materials during peace-time. Any working man or woman in Australia can to-day move on at any time and take a different job. No government has any power to stop them, and the right honourable gentleman knows it . Perhaps the biggest joke of all those in the budget is the statement that there is to be a big savings campaign. If livin g costs continue to rise as they are doing at present the workers w ill have no savings that will enable them to participate in any such campaign. Although the Government has made so many promises about so many things, it has made no attempt to interfere with profits. Profits, right throughout our economic system, have been treated as sacrosanct. The worker is taken into the courts and almost stripped bare. He is forced to saj' what he pays for his hoots, socks and shirts, and how much tobacco he smokes and so on, but all that the boss needs to say, after the worker has succeeded by great labour in getting a small increase in his wage, is, "" We cannot afford to pay the awarded wage unless we put up our prices "". I shall cite a classic example to illustrate my point, although no doubt many younger honourable members will tliink that it is not true. I have mentioned it before in this chamber, but it is well worth mentioning again. The chairman of one of the first wages boards to be constituted in Sydney was a man named Edward Eiley, who was for some time the honourable member for South Sydneyi n the He said that tliat Australian Parliament. Certain workers applied to the board for a determination. They had to start work at 7 o'clock in the morning, work until tea-time, then go back after tea and dress the windows at night. They worked for 56 hours and sometimes for 60 hours a week. They sought increased wages The and fewer hours. The big trading concerns of Sydney opposed their application and swore before the board that their profits were such that if they had to paj' the wages sought they would have to increase their prices. Mr Eiley and one or two other gentlemen on the board The Prime Minister demanded that an accountant be appointed to examine, under a pledge of secrecy, the books of these concerns. The accountant reported his findings to the",42,Deputy Chaieman Will It Meet Theincreases Of The Prices Of

146,Mr Lazzaeini,"chairman of the hoard, who .then said that every one of the business concerns had committed cold-blooded perjury. . Apparently another method heing adopted by this 'Government to put value back into the £1 is to increase the salaries of members of the judiciary. Those increased salaries are to be made retrospective to the lst July, 1950. Although the pensioners have not yet been paid their miserable increases I am quite certain that that Australia was safer to-day than it it will not be made retrospective to the 1st July, in fact they will be lucky if they get it by the lst November. On the subject of national defence the Prime Minister made three broadcasts that were of such a nature that if anybody else had made them he would have been gaoled for sedition. The Prime Minister stated to the world that Australia was destitute of defence forces and would be a sitting shot for anybody who wanted to come and take it. The Minister for the Army, who is also Minister for the Navy( Mr Francis), made the' same proud boast to the world, that Australia lacked any defence. The honourable gentleman who was the Minister for the Interior, but is now the also warned us of our ""inadequate state of defences"". When challenged about that statement the Minister said that in any case nothing could be done to stop our press from proclaiming such things to the world. If such things were proclaimed to the world by the press of a nation behind the Iron Curtain, all those involved would be put up against a wall and shot. Yet the Prime Minister and other Ministers have made these astounding statements. I do not suggest that our defences are particularly strong, but my point is that the rest of the world should not be told of their weakness. Such action on the part of the Prime Minister and the Ministers whom I have mentioned was scandalous. They proclaimed to the world that Australia has no defences whatsoever. The Order! The honourable member's time for a fair day's pay. We shall not has expired. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr first requisite in that respect is harLazzarini) castigated the Prime Minister mony in industry. We must establish ( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr Francis) hecause they told the world; as he put it, about the state of Australia's defences. It would appear that members of the Opposition are the only people in Australia who are not aware of the actual state of our defences; and, unfortunately, they do not seem to be very concerned about the matter. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) declared had been during the last twenty years. It is useless for the right honoraible gentleman to shut his eyes to the facts. For the benefit of the honourable member for Werriwa, I point out that during the recent war the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), when he was Minister for Air, addressed a public meeting at Tamworth and, in the course of his remarks, which were broadcast, gave the name of the airport at which he had landed, the name of the pilot of the plane and the name of the aircraft itself, as well as the current weather conditions and forward weather reports. When I drew his attention to those facts he replied, "" I did not say anything that mattered "". At that meeting the honourable member accepted money that had been subscribed by the people of Tamworth as a contribution towards the cost of an. aeroplane. I was of the opinion that all of the information that he broadcast was "" hush hush "" at that particular time. The debate was relatively refreshing until the honourable member for Werriwa dug up the depression. Most of his colleagues harped about putting value back into the £1. They tell that story day in and day out. The Government is endeavouring to put value back into the £1, and it will achieve that objective if it is not obstructed. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, made an appeal for increased production. Apparently, he realizes the need for increased production and acknowledges that succeed in putting value back into the £1 until we increase production.

The reason for that state of affairs is that many miners transferred to other industries because they were not allowed to earn as much money as they were capable of earning in the mines. under contract. some instances; but in most instances the miner is not permitted to exceed a certain darg. If the miner were given a free band more men would offer for work in the mines. We must face those facts if we are to succeed in putting value back into the £1. Nothing short of a national effort will solve this problem, and I believe that the Government will set an example in that respect. Honourable members opposite have said that the budget is inflationary. The Government has taken effective steps to halt inflationary trends. The honourable member for Werriwa, relying upon a newspaper report, said that the Government, intended to direct labour. Apparently, the honourable member is not capable of understanding plain words.

Not so long ago they were decrying the wool barons. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) advocated that the Government should impose a tax on wool in order to subsidize the production of woollen goods. Yet, honourable members opposite now endeavour to make out that the prepayment of tax by the wool-growers under the Government's plan is harsh and unfair. As the Prime Minister fully explained the Government's plan, I shall not deal with it at this juncture. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. criticism of the pay-as-you-sell wool deduction scheme astonishes me. Had the Chifley socialist Government been in power, the wool-growers would have been dealt with in a vastly different manner. were current before the Government announced its intentions.

Australians are just as courageous and loyal to-day as they were in the past and I believe that they w ill be propared to serve their country, should the necessity arise, wherever they may be asked to serve. The honourable member for Lalor also mentioned anotlier subject which he may later wish that he had ignored, liie mentioned the sale of the boilers from the Wamjukniiboul power alcohol distillery which, as many honourable members will recall, was established in the electorate then represented by ;t gcnrJemnn who virtually hold the Laboui' government of the day in the palin of his band. The venture cost the nation about £1,000,000 and eventually the distillery was pulled down and the boiler wore sold. The honourable member for Lnlor may already by regretting his reference to that subject, becanse the project was one of the failures of Labour's administration. It was generally considered that the distillery had heen erected so that Mr Alex Wilson would remain on side with the Labour fiovernment.

During minutes last night to the .= neech of the the Address-in-Reply debate early this Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Ohifley ). year, the honourable member for Mitchell gentleman learned something from it .

AVe did not hear anything from the right honourable member about the corrupt Indonesian Government, which is attacking the South Moluccas and Ambon, which were independent members of the United States of Indonesia until the new republic wa. j established overnight.

It provides for the welfare of all sections of the community. I was particularly pleased to note in it reference to the plans that had been, made for the benefit of ex-servicemen, age pensioners, invalids and other deserving citizens. Those proposals have already been discussed by the honourable member for Sturt( Mr ""Wilson) and I shall not repeat what he said.. I conclude by saying that the' budget is good. I support it and commend it to all honourable members. Mi-. Curtin (Watson) [8.9] -Al l day to-day I have listened to various honourable members on the Government side of the chamber attacking the trade union movement of Australia with monotonous regularity. The class hatred that they preach is intended for the sole purpose of stirring up dissension throughout the trade union movement. The remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr mises, like pie crusts, are easily broken, Treloar), for one, almost made me ill . The tenor of his remarks was not unusual, of course, because he is a huge importer and has a large store in one of our big country towns. The only subject that he can think of is that of profit. The honourable gentleman chants from morning to night, "" The worker won't work. We want harmony in industry. We want more production"". But he does not know the first thing about production. The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank, to which I referred in an earlier debate in this chamber, shows that, notwithstanding the introduction of the 40hour week, production in Australia ha9 increased by 9 per cent. How these big merchants and wholesalers hate the 40hour week! They are favoured by a sellers' market at the moment and all that they want to do is make the worker produce more goods so that they can take it out of his hide and bleed the market of extra profits. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but Nemesis will overtake them. The Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) said that we should introduce incentive payment schemes so that the workers wonld produce more and goods would become cheaper. The right honourable gentleman did not know what he was talking about. Let us consider the situation in the clothing trade to-day. It is riddled with incentive schemes, but I challenge anybody to find any establishment in Sydney that can afford to sell clothing to-day more cheaply than it was sold five years ago. All sorts of little factories have been set up in back yards and motor garages with the object of breaking down trade union conditions. They are scattered all over the metropolitan area. Women work at rows of machines in big rooms to produce clothing by the mile. But are dresses and suits any cheaper than they were before? Certainly not! The manufacturers have a sellers' market and that is why we hear the continual cry for more production. Government supporters to-day have denied the promise of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to put value back into the f l . They have tried to lay a smokescreen in order to cloud the issue. Proof course, but the Government and its supporters will not be able to disclaim responsibility for the undertaking that was given to the electors last December by the present Prime Minister. I have here a copy of a broadcast script that waB sent to me by courtesy of the right honourable gentleman. It is the script of a speech in which he saidLet us attack our tasks boldly. The greatest of them all, as I am sure you will agree, will be to arrest the alarming rise in costs and prices and so put value back into 'the money that you earn and spend. That speech was delivered by the right honourable gentleman on the 20th December last. Bursting with self-assurance and brimming over with vanity, he told the people what they should do. The change in his demeanor was sudden. He did not appeal to them with tears in his eyes, as he had done during the general election campaign. As soon as his hands grasped the reins of office, he began to tell the people what they should do. He made a series of broadcasts on Sunday evenings, until somebody told, him that listeners -were writing to thenewspapers stating that they were sick and tired of hearing him tell them what they should do. Even the Sydney Morning Herald, 'which cannot 'be accused of being sympathetic to the Labour party, risked the grave danger of hurting the right honourable gentleman's colossal vanity by suggesting to him that he should terminate those broadcasts, because the people were becoming weary of them. The Prime Minister heeded that advice, and, thank goodness, his voice has not been heard over the air on Sunday evenings for some time. During the last general election campaign, the right honourable gentleman assured the people that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, if returned to office, would abolish economic controls. Every one will recall that part of his policy speech in which he promised that a government under his leadership woulcl clip the wings of the bureaucrats. Tet, about a. fortnight ago. the right honourable gentleman had to crawl back into his shell, and break another ofhis pre-election promises, because the Government was obliged to re-establish the Capital Issues Advisory Board. That action was a tacit admission that the control of capital issues by the preceding Lahour Government was justified. The Minister for National Development spoke to-day of the wonderful dollar loan that the Prime Minister had contrived to induce the New York financiers to grant to Australia. He assured us that the loan would enable Australia to buy everything that would shift everything that required shifting in this country, but he omitted to inform the chamber that the loan bore interest at the rate of 3^ per cent, plus 1 per cent, commission. L i other words, the financial experts in New York, who "" get round "" Ministers when they visit the United States of America, took a rake-off of 1 per cent. Nor did the Minister mention that our former enemy, Japan, is able to negotiate dollar loans free of interest. I hope that, during Government supporters enjoy their prethis debate, a Minister will satisfactorily sent holiday in Canberra. Many of them explain that anomaly. I now wish to deal with the proafter six or eight abortive attempts to mise that was made by the Liberal prepare a budget that would relieve party and by the Australian Country tlie sufferings of the people, preparty during the last general election camsented to this chamber the breathpaign that, if they were returned t,n taking document that is now under oflice, they would put value back into the consideration. Why did the right honor£1. not like it. Housewives are sick and tired of the Government's economic policy, because the £1 is rapidly losing its purchasing power. Mr J. W. Allison, who is the vice-president of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, and is not likely to be a supporter of the Labour party, told the annual conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia that prices were rising at a greater rate here than in any other country. He saidA publio, bewildered by the prices, seemed to be clinging to the pathetic hope that controls would keep down prices. Mr Allison also statedThe federal election result was a mandate to get rid of controls. Prices continue to soar, and the Government closes its eyes to the tragic consequences of the loss of the purchasing power of our currency. The constant worry of mothers, in their endeavours to buy food for their children from day to day, is undermining their health. What is the Government doing to honour its pre-election promise to put value back into the £1? The answer to that question is simple. It is doing precisely nothing. Once the budget is agreed to, the Government will seek shelter from criticism by closing the Parliament until next February. election. porters would not welcome a general election. party avoid a double dissolution? double dissolution when we want it.

The budget will give him cause to rejoice! A man with a wife and child who is in receipt of £1,500 a year would have paid £236 under the previous system, but will pay £223 under the new scale. That, is an example of "" greasing the f a t p i g "" . like to know whether the honourable member for Watson is referring to members ot the Parliament, whose salary is £'.1,""I00 per annum. The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN ( Mr Government has overreached itself in its.

A man with a wife and one child, who is in receipt of an income of £5,000 a year, will pay £39 less tax under this budget, than he paid last year. The outlook of the poor old worker, who stumbles along from day to day, is hopeless while an anti-Labour government is in office.

The increased cost of those articles will impose an additional strain on the housewife's budget, and will place most of those toilet preparations beyond her reach financially. That statement cannot be denied. She will have to go without those little preparations whicli she likes to use every day. Even the busine-s girl's purse will be h it by the budget.

Honourable members who take an interest in their electorates realize the implications of the proposal, unlike those who merely sit on their cushy seats in this chamber, wondering how long this has been going on, and who would not know what it is all ahout. Many members of the Parliament have received an enormous uumber of protests against the proposal to increase the sales tax on radio receivers and radio parts. In particular, I have received a number of protests from members of the farming community. I mention that fact for the benefit of lionorable members in the "" hillbilly corner "" of the chamber, who masquerade as the champions of the farmers, although I do not suppose that one of them has ever done a day's real farming in his life. All that most of them do is to exploit country people by buying and selling stock on commission, and acting as agents for various high-priced products and machines. If the members of the Australian Country party would join with me in protesting to the Government, something might be done to protect the farmers from the injustice that the Government proposes to perpetrate. It is all very well for members of the Australian Country party to complain in this chamber about the long, arduous days spent by the farmers, but they should not forget that when the tired farmer returns to his home in the evening he looks forward to being entertained by his radio set. When he discovers that the replacement of some perhaps minor part in his receiving apparatus will cost him 33^r per cent, more than it does at present, he will be very angry, because he probably cannot afford to pay such a price for his entertainment. Probably, many farmers will not be able to afford radio sets at all. I therefore repeat my appeal to members of the Australian Country party to do something to protect the farmers. After all, the Treasurer is a member of their political party, and surely they sliould be able to approach him and point out the injustice that will be done by his proposals to the people whom they are supposed to represent. Of course, I am not speaking for the wealthy graziers, who are quite capable *>f looking after themselves. The rich wool growers have browbeaten members of the Australian Country party so much that those honourable gentlemen do not even stop to consider the position of the small farmers. A great deal has been said in the course of this debate about industrial relationships, and the harmony that is alleged to exist in industry to-day. We have even been told what a good employer the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is for Lalor( Mr Pollard) said that. identity of the honourable gentleman who made that statement, I have the right to say what I think. I have worked for employers such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and I kuow what they do. In fact, I have done much more work than has any honourable member opposite, and I am familiar with the tactics pursued by many of those who batten upon the workers. They are always urging us to work harder and harder, so that they can exploit us even more than they are already doing. In the course of my employment in industry, which has extended over 36 years, I have been associated with some of the finest types of men in the Australian community. Those types are to be found in the working class, and I resent the attacks made upon the workers of this country by honourable members opposite. The workers of this country are the real producers of the wealth of the community, and they are represented by the leaders of the trade union movement, more than 95 per cent, of whom are loyal to them and to Australia. Of course, the present Government would like to destroy the trade union movement. However, it has already discovered that the trade union movement is solid and that it cannot be coerced, and now it is appealing to the Labour movement to co-operate with it. However, I assure honourable members opposite that under no circumstances will tlie trade union movement ever co-operate -and I use the word "" ever "" advisedly, because I am not afraid to express my views-in any way with the Government",50,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

191,Mr Feeeth,"With whom will thedecision of the court has a wide impact on thc entire Australian economy. I do not presume to criticize the court, but I offer certain suggestions with due respect. The court has realized that money wages, as such, cannot determine the standard of living. The court can say that it will award to the worker an increased share of the proceeds of production in the form of more money, but history has proved that as soon as an increase of wages is made, prices rise accordingly and the benefit of the increase is very quickly dissipated. The judges of the court themselves, in the extracts from judgments that were quoted by the Prime Minister, expressed the view that although they had awarded an increase of wages, that fact of itself would result only in increased prices unless some other action were taken, by which, presumably, they implied either that, production must be increased or that some legislative action must be taken. I submit that it is within the province of the court to extend its investigations and inquiries beyond the consideration of the money wages that it should award. It should base its decisions on the actual standard of living, and make any change or variation of that standard commensurate with the contribution to it made by the employees. When all is said and done, if a wage increase in the form of money will not really result in anything but a temporarily increased standard of living for the worker, surely it would be more realistic for the court, to fix what it believed to be a f a i r stanthe matter of strikes should be closely dard, basing its decision on the employees' contribution to the standard. Air. CLYD E CAMEKON -What does the lionorable member mean by that? honourable member for Hindmarsh may find difficulty in following me. I have tried to compress within a few observations a line of thought which, I confess, the honourable member would find great difficulty in following. While I am dealing with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the impact of the level of production on our price level, I shall make a brief reference to the matter of strikes. When two ordinary citizens have a matter in dispute, such as a broken contract or a breach of civil rights, normally one of them does not go to the other and demand satisfaction at-pistol point. He takes the issue to court for determination. The same process has come to be accepted in our arbitration system. This point has beenlaboured time and time again but I consider that there are too many people in Australia to-day who are trying to have things both ways. They are attempting to obtain the benefits of arbitration and the benefits of the pistol point remedy at the same time. If the pistol were directed at one employer or another in a case of individual hardship, where there was no court or tribunal open to the worker, there might conceivably be some justification for this rotten tradition about the right to strike that we have in Australia. member advocating a revolution or something of that nature? a revolution at all. I say that we have developed an absurd tradition that nobody is to interfere with the workers'"" right to strike. We might as well sav that any individual who finds himself aggrieved by a breach of his civil rights should take the law into his own hands. The Labour party's attitude to that matter is like its attitude to conscription, compulsory military training or service overseas. It is quite out of step with the times. I say that while we are facing the problem of trying to stabilize our economy examined, because to-day we find that strikes are most frequently directed not at any individual employer, but at governments. For instance, although the Labour party is supporting the I realize that the Country party Government in Victoria, the railway workers in that. State are on strike against the popularly elected Government. Where will this law of the jungle end? I suggest that the Government should face with some courage, and with less respect for the traditional right to strike, the problem of strikes in Australia. The same problem exists in England. Government going to do about strikes? elaborate on that point auy further. I",53,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

196,Mr Freeth,"I do not propose to have clearly stated my views on the right to strike. I turn now to profits. We have heard the honourable member for Watson say that the Government wished to increase production only to bleed more out of the hides of the workers. member for Hindmarsh for that interjection, because if all Australian industrial profits were distributed among the employees in industries, each employee would not receive more than a shilling a week above what he now receives. ridiculous! Profitsi n Australia amount to £300,000,000. member examine the figures that relate to any industry. I find it quite absurd, therefore, that the honourable member for Watson and other honourable members opposite, like the honourable member for Hindmarsh, should make the rash statement that our only reason for wanting more production is to make possible greater Honourable members must agree that the standard increased by a mere increase of wages. The actual standard of livin g itself must be increased. When honourable members opposite say that we wish to increase production only to provide employers with more profits they are just voicing the old, old slogans that we hear in this place every day, the same old class hatred, uttered a little louder and with a few minor variations. They thereby attempt to gain some notoriety for themselves, but their views are completely valueless so f a r as assisting in the stabilization of our economy is concerned. I turn now fro m the problem of stabilization to the problem of development. I was pleased to hear the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) say to-day that in order of importance he would place encouragement of development by private enterprise before the more spectacular schemes of the .Government's own initiation, such as the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme and other schemes of similar magnitude. In Western Australia there is tremendous scope for development along the lines suggested by the right honourable gentleman. Recently, the Prime Minister made an appeal for an increased production of flax because of the urgent necessity for that commodity in stock-piling for defence. The only privately owned flax right. mill in Australia is in Western Australia. I thank the honourable The other two flax-producing States, Victoria and South Australia, have all their flax treated by government-operated flax mills. Approximately one-fifth of Australia's total flax output is produced in Western Australia. That State could treat with its existing plant an'additiona.l quantity which would raise its proportion to nearly one-half. Yet, there are proposals to increase fiax production by expending about £250,000 on CommonL e t the houorable wealth mills. With very little extra encouragement to the Western Australian industry to grow more flax, the existing mill could treat up to 400 tons of flax fibre a year. In the south-west of Western Australia there was a substantial dairying industry, but dairying is becoming unpopular there profits for the employers. because of the increased capital required to purchase machinery and equipment in of livin g cannot bc order to enable small farms to conduct dairying operations in a modern way. The dairy farm unit must be increased in size to cope with modern methods. It wil] not be possible for the dairying industry to meet Australia's total requirements in a few year.?' time unless present production is substantially increased. The problem of development must be met with an overall scheme. Extensions must be uniform. If our economy is expanded it must be expanded as a balloon is inflated-evenly-other wise there will be distortions which will be disastrous. There are acres of land in Western Australia which private enterprise is willing and anxious to develop hut, unaided by government finance, find it quite beyond its power to develop in less than one or more generations. It takes the average individual twenty or more years to save suflicient capital out of his current income adequately to expand and increase his farming area. If the Government has embarked on a developmental policy which envisages crowding into ten' years development which would",54,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

200,Mr Freeth,"normally take place in twenty years it must give some attention to these empty areas in Western Australia which are raying out for a little .Government assistance in order that private enterprise may develop them. There is a view current that those areas in which, the soil is good and .the climatic conditions are ideal will develop themselves and that there is no need for the .Government to take action. But if the Government is to cram into ten years the normal development of twenty years it must accelerate the development of those areas. The Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, set up a committee to examine ways and means of developing the north-west of Western Australia. That committee found that private enterprise, if given a little assistance, would be When the Labour Government took over quite willing to put capital into those areas, and where capital goes, labour follows. There is an illustration of that fact in the progress that has been made in the development .of the Blue Asbestos Mines in the Wittenoom Gorge area where the investment of about £1,000,000 of capital has brought into existence a flourishing township of over 500 people. The committee that was set up by the Leader of the Opposition recommended that substantial tax concessions should be given to people who live north of the 26th parallel just as they are given to the people of the Northern Territory in order to encourage them to re-iirvest their money in that section of the 'Commonwealth. That recommendation was not followed up. The Government is trying to develop this country. matter? Government would welcome suggestions instead of rather futile interjections from honourable members. Surely it would benefit the Government if, instead of expending millions of pounds on carrying out it3 own explorations and investigations of the mineral resources of the eountry, it encouraged oil companies to carry out searches for oil, encouraged the ..evelopment of iron resources at Yampi Sound, and encouraged the development of meat works .similar <to those established at Wyndham. In that way it could assist private .enterprise to carry out a job which, if carried out by the iGovernment, would cost the taxpayer millions of pounds. I support this budget, but I hope that Western Australia will share increasingly in the Government's developmental plans for the welfare of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) criticized the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) concerning the depression. There was a large number of unemployed when the Liberal Government was last in power and the Government does not want to hear anything about them again. from the last Liberal Government there were 200,000 unemployed. After the Labour Government had tidied up the country's affairs and put a nice sum of money into the Treasury it went out of power, but it will soon be back again. Labour strengthened the country's economy and because it did so, conditions are very much better to-day than they were before it assumed control. The honourable member tried to condemn miners. In his view they are terrible men who restrict their output. He said that whatever they were paid, they would not produce as much as they could because they were subject to a darg. Let me explain the nature of the darg. A darg limits the number of skips that a miner may fill in a given period. That is done in order to achieve equal distribution of the skips in the coal-mines. Before the darg was introduced the wheeler was not prepared to go into parts of mines in which some men were working because of the bad state of the roadway. Consequently the miners had to institute the darg in order to ensure an equal distribution of the skips. The honourable member for Forrest seemed to think that the worker should not have the right to strike. Every man should have the right to withhold his labour if he chooses to do so. When Labour w vs in power the then Minister",55,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

203,Mr Davies (Cunningham) [9.9],"for Health, Senator McKenna, endeavoured for many months to reach agreement with the doctors, but without success. The doctors were prepared to practise only on certain conditions. They said that they were not going to work if the Government demanded certain things and they were not prepared to come to an agreement. The same position obtains to-day. The present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has had to adopt a plan that has been approved by the British Medical Association. The only agreement that he could come to was one that the British Medical Association wanted. worker must have the right to strike. Even the wool-growers withhold their wool and put it on the market at a time when they can obtain the highest price for it. Wool is a commodity and so is labour and the worker must have the right to withhold that commodity if he thinks fit. When the present Government went before the people it made all sorts of rash promises in regard to a raising of the standard of living, but it has not accomplished anything of that nature. The honourable member for Eorrest alleged that the rate of increase of the cost of living had not become greater. The Government was going to put value back into the £1, yet the £1 has less value now than it had at the time of the general election. Wages have been trying to overtake prices but they have not been in the race. All that honourable members have heard from Government supporters in this debate has been criticism of the Opposition. BTo practical suggestion has been made by them. Honourable members of the Opposition have put forward practical suggestions for overcoming difliculties. interest must come first and -although as The Government has asked for the cooperation of the Opposition in its endeavours to get. out of the mess in which it finds itself. The Government realizes that it is in a mess and that it has no chance of getting out of it. I know that the duty of the Parliament is to try to improve the country's economic position. Honourable members of the Opposition are prepared to do everything in their power to achieve that end. This country is in a serious position. The £1 increase that has been granted to the wage-earner has already been offset. Every time there is an increase of wages, prices more than counteract it. The Government depends on its hillbilly supporters. Honourable members who sit on my left have prevented it from doing what it would like to do. They are afraid to take action because it might prejudice their political position. The appreciation of the £1 to parity with sterling would not entirely solve Australia's present inflationary problem which is assuming an alarming Every aspect, but having in mind the enormous prices being paid for our exports, it would have a strong buttressing effect on our economy. The Australian Country party has been criticized even as far away as London. In the London Financial Times of the 2nd September, 1950, this report appearsEarly this year a substantial section of the Australian Cabinet was won over to the view that revaluation was economically desirable. Tho proposal was not proceeded with mainly because the Country Party element in the Cabinet headed by Mr Fadden held that it was politically inexpedient. It must be remembered that the Australian £1 was originally devalued as a temporary expedient in the depression period primarily to assist the rural interests. No one cavilled at this, and now the Australian people expect the Country Farty and the interests it represents to play their part in tlie restoration of the national economy. Primary exports are bringing in unparalleled prices on overseas markets. Excepting for wheat and sugar and export quotas are fixed for them on the basic domestic needs of that Australian people, with the result that the local consumer is being exploited and forced to pay inflated prices on a depreciated currency. Few of the Australian workers to-day can pay the prices being demanded for a. lamb chop, a few pounds of beef, or even a leg of mutton or a pound of butter. The national pointed out appreciation of the Australian £1 is uot a panacea for the present inflationary crisis, it world tend to halt the present rise in prices and prevent exploitation of the people by primary interests. The honourable member who recently spoke ( Mr Freeth) said that prices had not gone up. I said that they had risen at a constant rate.",56,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work
204,Mr Fbeeth,"I did not say that at all.liave gone up proportionately fa r more than wages have. The worker is slipping back all the time while his employer is moving forward. That may be proved by a simple example. RecentlyI purchased a syphon of soda water and found that its price had risen by 50 per cent, from Is. to Is. 6d. .Stamina trousers have risen from £2 10s. to £3 6s. a pair. Cooked ham has risen from 5s. l i d . per lb. to Ss. 4d. per lb., cream from Is. to ts. 10d. a half-pint and beef and lamb by practically 100 per cent. price of coffee has risen from 3s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per lb. Yet in the light of those figures the honourable member for Forrest has the audacity to say that prices have noi gone up! A recent quarterly return of the Commonwealth Statistician indicates that clothing prices in Sydney were 182.2 per cent, higher at the end of September, 1950, than they were at the end of September, 1939. Dr. Roland Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistician, also has shown that the aggregate of certain retail prices in Sydney has gone up by 72.9 per cent, compared, with the 1939 figure. This aggregate is based on the prices of food, rents, clothing, and a. miscellaneous classification including household drapery and other necessaries, it would be interesting to compare the cost of certain commodities in 1939 with the present cost. In 1949 the price of food was 50 per cent, higher than in 1939, and in 1950, 71 per cent, higher. remained at 3 per cent, higher because they were pegged when they had reached rhat point. cent, higher in .1949 than in 1939, and other items rose in much the same proportion. Those figures should give to the cominittee a f a i r l y good idea of watered its shares in order to delude the thc enormous rise of prices compared with the rise of wages. Let us now consider profits. honourable member for Forrest said that no excessive profits have been made. I maintain that much excessive profit has been made. According to a recent issue of tlie Sydney Morning Herald, Washington H . Soul Pattinson and Company Limited increased its earnings by £3,114 to £96,018 in the year ended the 31si July. 1950. It3 dividend was unchanged at 15 per cent, and required the distribuI maintain that prices tion of £29,458. The staff fund received £5,000 and £21,650 went to the reserve account. The total visible reserves amounted to £494,6.11 as against a capital of £463,050. That w i ll give the committee a general idea of the profit made by that company. Carreras Limited, the company which makes CravenA cigarettes, never pays less than a. 50 per cent, dividend. Sometimes it pays up to 70 per cent. price of shares in that company? could be purchased. I also in for m the committee that one Sydney motor car trading company paid a dividend of 110 per cent. I now refer honourable members to the trading operations of Myer Emporium Limited, of Melbourne. That firm intends to make a bonus issue involving £1,725,000 to ordinary 5s. stockholders in the ratio of one-to-one. The issue wil] be financed from an assets revaluation reserve, established from a valuation of the company's city properties. Nominal capital will be raised from £3,000,000 to £6,000,000 and this issue of bonus shares will raise tbe paid-up capital to £4,204,950. that company pay? It woulcl have paid more had it not.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited also has made enormous profits, and so have Burns Philp Limited and The other big concerns. Excessive protection of our industries is leading to excessive' prices and consequent excessive profits. The Tariff Board Annual Beport of 1950, at page 5, readsA t one time, when there was a pool of unemployed labour in Australia it was part of the Board's responsibility to recommend protection to those industries which could absorb some of this pool, provided too much excess oost was not imposed in the procew.

211,Mr Davies,"No t more than 3 perthe position is reversed. Under conditions of full employment, -the extension of employment capacity through the protection of some industries would promote unfavourable economic reactions, in that such industries would entice revaluation to parity with sterling in August, labour from more important producers, and aggravate the existing labour shortage. Obviously a number of companies to-day being protected should not be protected to the existing degree, because it leads to their inefficiency, and to excessive prices being charged to the public. Excessive protection leaves the w a j ' open to inefficiency, wasteful expenditure on labour and materials and excessive prices and profits. The report continues at page 6In some countries the trading results of protected industries are examined as a matter of routine to ensure that advantage is not taken of tariff protection. No system of review has been established in Australia. Industries have been protected, but such protection has not been reviewed. I suggest that protection should be reviewed in order to see that, protected industries are not taking advantage of it . Reverting again to revaluation of the ±1, iu regard to which, I know, there is a great difference of opinion, my view is that the f l should be appreciated. Any one with any experience of overseas travel w ill know that it is necessary to pay £125 Australian for £100 sterling. Many elderly people have been saving all their lives so that they w i ll have enough money to travel home to England to see their relatives. No'w they find thai perhaps they cannot go because of the exchange rate. I went to England some time ago and had experience of the adverse effects of the exchange rate. While the ship was travelling closeto the Australian coast, ale co3t 6d. a glass. When the ship hacl proceeded beyond the 3-m-ile l i m it the price was' raised by 25 per cent. The bottle fro m which the ale was taken was branded ""ToothsA l e "" . Therefore, although the beer was made in Sydney we were required to pay 25 per cent, more f oii t 3 miles out from the Australian coast. That is just a racket and something should be done about it . When the New Zealand£ 1 was revalued a Sydney newspaper sent a reporter to New Zealand to discover whether revaluation was advantageous or not. He reported as follows:. The measure of the success of New Zealand's 194S, lies in tlie small increase in the country's living costs since revaluation. Statistics show that the cost of living fell after revaluation. For instance, thc New Zealand retail price index for August, 1048, was 1105. This figure fell in September to 1098, and continued to decline for some months until arrested by thc removal of subsidies. Prices, to-day, in New Zealand are only 8 per cent, higher than they were in that dominion in 1948. That fact gives some idea of the advantage that New Zealand has gained by appreciating its currency. I do not say that appreciation of the £1 w ill solve the problem of rising prices. Many other changes also must be made. In New Zealand, retailers are perfectly satisfied with the results that have followed appreciation of the currency in that dominion. I believe that the majority of Australians are in favour of appreciating the f l . However, for one reason or another no decision has yet been made on that very important subject. I welcome the Government's proposal to increase the rates of sales tax on furs, jewellery and other luxury articles, but it has not f a i r l y distributed the relief that it intends to provide in respect of this class of taxation. Whilst increases of the tax on luxury goods are long overdue, I cannot understand why the Government proposes, for example, to increase the tax on delivery vans hy 10 per cent, at a time when housewives are anxious that business shall restore home-delivery services as soon as possible. I disagree with the proposal to increase the sales tax on musical instruments to 25 per cent. That imposition w ill be detrimental tc the development of Australian culture. Members of brass bands, of which there is a number in my electorate, will have to pay higher prices for their instruments. Bandsmen usually give performances free of charge at patriotic functions, and their activities should be not discouraged but encouraged in the interests of community culture generally. A corresponding handicap w ill be placed upon members of orchestras. It is also proposed to increase tlie sales tax on radio sets. Radio entertainment has virtually become a part of the Australian standard of living. Radio broadcasting is also a medium of education. Parents and citizens associations usually provide funds for the purchase and installation of radio receiving sets in schools. I should like to know justify its proposal to increase the sales tax on such articles. Even the sales tax on bagpipes is to be increased. If we are to develop community cultural life and imbue our children with a love of music, the Government cannot justify increasing the sales tax on musical instruments. I am pleased that the Government proposes to increase the rate of the invalid mine and as the result of my experiences pension by 7s. 6d. a week. However, whilst that benefit is not to take effect until the 1st November, the Government proposes to make the increase of £500 in the salaries of justices of the High Court and the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court retrospective to the lst July last. In that respect, pensioners will be treated unjustly. I also point out that the aUowance that is paid to a person who looks after an invalid pensioner is not to be increased. At present an allowance of about 24s. a week is paid to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is caring for him. I prefer to believe that the Government has inadvertently overlooked that item. I urge it to consider the matter. I have in my hand an envelope that bears the address of an invalid pensioner who is in receipt of a pension at the rate of 8s. 3d. a week. The wife of this gentleman also receives an invalid pension at the same rate. The envelope bears the imprint, "" Save to control prices"". I should like to know how persons in receipt of so small an allowance in respect of invalidity can be expected to save anything. The Government has allocated the sum of £3,000,000 to the purchase of coal overseas. be better expended in mechanizing coal mines. At present, the coal-miners are dependent solely upon the Joint Coal Board for any improvement of their conditions of employment. That body Mr Davies. has been responsible for the improvements that have recently been effected in the industry generally. The main reason for the present under-production of coal is that in the past the coal-mine owners completely neglected their responsibility to introduce modern methods in the industry. They have been responsible also how the Government can for a large number of strikes. Personally, I should like the Government to nationalize the coal-mines. It would thus do away with the state of affairs in which there are three parties to every dispute, namely, the employers, the coal-miners and the Government. \\Extension of time granted.'] It is the fashion to blame the coal-miners for every hold-up in the industry. As a boy I worked in a coalI made two resolutions. The first was that I would get out of the industry as soon as I possibly could ; and the second was that I would ensure that my son would not work in a coal-mine. Every parent who is associated with the industry is determined to do the best that he, or she, can to prevent their children from working in coal-mines. I admit that due to the activities of the Joint Coal Board conditions in that industry have been improved considerably in recent years. In one mine, the miners who had to walk in a crouched position a distance of 2£ miles to the coal-face, pleaded with the mine-owners to install conveyors to transport them that distance, but the owners refused to grant that request. Eventually, the Joint Coal Board expended a large sum of money on the installation of conveyors in mines with the result that production was substantially increased. The Joint Coal Board has also been obliged to provide electric borers and to initiate measures to eliminate dust in coal-mines. It has effected many other improvements because mine-owners have refused to carry out their responsibilities to their employees. Mr Justice Davidson, who inquired That money could into the industry as a royal commissioner some years ago, reported that some mine owners had been making a profit of 154 per cent, but had not put any of those profits back into the industry, with the result that conditions in their mines had -seriously deteriorated. I agree with supporters of the 'Government that the pro-d'uction of coal must be increased. The best way to do so is to mechanize the mines. As the result of mechanization, -daily production in the Mount Nebo mine, which is situated on the south coast of .New South Wales, has been increased to 15 tons, by each miner, whereas the output at the same mine of those who work with picks and shovels is only 3 tons a day. Those figures give some idea -of the degree to which the production of -coal could be increased if the mines were mechanized. I assure the Government that all members of the Opposition will do everything they possibly can to encourage greater production of coal because they realize that adequate supplies of coal are essential to our industrial economy. Two novel features of this budget have escaped the notice of members of the Opposition so far as we can judge their thoughts from their utterances in this many leading members of the present debate. However, I am sure that one Opposition party during the last three of those features has aroused their envy. years have hinged upon their belief that I refer to the fact that this is the first the economic stability of the nation is budget that has been introduced in the dependent upon the compulsory direction Parliament during the last eight years of labour. that has not been socialistic in outlook. The people of Australia should be made honourable member could not make one aware of that fact, because at the polls quotation to support that statement. on the 10th December last they clearly expressed their wish that another socialistic budget should not be introduced in the Parliament. Whatever the the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) making a Opposition may say about the matter, statement to this effect, "" This country is the people are determined that so long thinks that he can hold his wife's hand as the once great Labour party persists every night and see the town clock "". That in its socialistic policy it shall never declaration is imprinted upon the minds again be given an opportunity to introof millions of Australians. Many other duce a budget.

Nevertheless, they are still strongly determined to nationalize the banks and to pursue all their other socialistic aims if they ever regain power. knows that it cannot be done. it cannot be done because the people of Australia have said that it must not be done and will continue to say so. The banks will not be nationalized because the Liberal party and the Australian Coun_ try party are in power.

218,Mr Peabce,"I could produce manyparty is to introduce a system of compulsory direction of labour. Had this been a Labour budget, it would have included some amount for the implementation of that policy. We may be sure that a socialist budget vvould not have provided for the pension increases for which this budget provides, because over the years the Labour party has disclosed a complete disregard for the welfare of pensioners. Only when they are in opposition do its members raise a pious outcry about the poor pensioners. 'When they were, in power, they refused absolutely to make any promises about pension increases. The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Davies) expressed the view of the entire Labour party when he said that he would like to witness the nationalization of the coal industry. Of course, that is a part of the socialist platform, and it is a part of the Communist platform. There is very little difference between the two programmes. creased pensions when it was in office. about pensions during the last general election campaign, and it revealed an utter disregard for the welfare of pensioners over a long period. A socialist government would not stop at the nationalization of the coal industry. It would deal with the steel industry in the same way. We know that that is so, because the main issue at the general election last December was whether Australia should be socialized or not. The Labour party made no secret of the fact that it would regard n victory at the election as the. green light to go ahead and socialize the nation and thus open the way for the Communists to come in and overthrow us all. A labour party budget would certainly not include any provision for increases of the rates of pay of members of the armed services. The Opposition has stated its attitude towards servicemen and ex-servicemen very clearly. One of thp greatest shocks that Australians have suffered from politics during the last few months has been caused by the disclosure of Labour's policy towards the defence forces and the Government's recruiting campaign. A Labour government, following the party's custom of playing into thehands of the Communists, would havegiven effect to a policy of inflation that would have caused increasing unrest,, hardship and even misery. This would have cleared the way to complete socialism and ultimately to communism. Another novel feature of the budget is that it has been presented, in the year of Australia's greatest peril. Never before in time of peace has Australia faced a greater threat to its survival as a nation than it faces now. Great forces that seek to overwhelm us are ranged about us. Many eyes are looking covetously upon our landMillions of people in all parts of the world, particularly where communism is supreme, look hungrily upon our farms and cities. The cheap gibes with which the Opposition has replied to the Government's plea for co-operation are unworthy even of the Labour party. In this time of peril, there is an urgent need for cooperation not only between political parties, but also between all individual citizens. If this nation is to survive, we must withstand a severe test during the next four or five years. I have been greatly disturbed by the attempts that have been made by members of the Opposition, I believe deliberately, to foment dissension in the community. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) talked about class hatred. If anybody treated his remarks seriouslyI do not think that he does so himselfthey would cause a great deal of harm. Those utterances were consistent with the conduct of members of the Labour party in Australia ever since the early 'twenties. Members of the present Opposition party have consistently moved amongst the people saying, ""Why should you work? The boss hates you. You hate him. You have to fight for everything"". Such propaganda has implanted in the minds of the young men and women of Australia the seeds of doubt and class hatred. Even in this Parliament, where the representatives of the people meet under a pledge to serve the nation, we hear the same stupid utterances which would cause the gravest disservice to ' Australia if people heeded them. The honourable member for Cunningham cited certain figures in a way that",61,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

220,Mr Pearce,"It made no promises-was absolutely misleading and inaccurate. Whether he did so deliberately or whether .he did not know what he was doing, I cannot say. 'impression that great price increases had -taken place during the last few months, -although he ought to know that many of those increases had occurred over the period of a decade. Such statements are made, not to impress honourable members, but to influence the electors and to f.ause dissatisfaction with thc Government aud with employers so that chaos may result. I challenged the honourable member by interjection when he spoke -about a 10 per cent, increase of the prices of panel vans. I gathered from his subsequent remarks that he was referring to the increases that would result from heavier tax charges. were completely untrue. The honourable member has some intelligence, and he should be as capable as I am of reading and understanding the information that he had in his possession. I have the facts before me now and I want to place them on record. The official document that I have, which deals with the proposed new rates of tax upon motor vehicles, contains the following explanation of the Government's proposal:The rute of tax on the following goods is increased from 8J% to 10%':Motor cars designed primarily and principally for the transport of persons, including sedans, coupes, tourers, roadsters, racing cars, taxi-cabs, station wagons and estate cars, but not including panel vans, delivery vans, utilities., hearses, jeeps, trucks, lorries or motor buses. A brief .study of those, facts will reveal the utter inaccuracy of the statements that were made by the honourable member for Cunningham. The honourable gentleman was screaming to the'housewives of Australia, in effect, "" T h is terrible Government, by increasing tax charges on panel vans, will rob vou of your bread, meat, ice, and f r u it deliveries "". Perhaps many peoplo would believe him if his statements were allowed to go uncorrected. Tliey were utterly mischievous. Another notable feature of the honourable gentleman's speech was his tirade against the profits being made by various companies. In answering his outburst, I remind honourable members of one of the greatest jokes of the last general election campaign. I believe that people still giggle when they hear the name of Abraham Lincoln, because a certain right He tried to convey the honourable gentleman who played a prominent part in that campaign was presented to the electors by his supporters, and possibly by himself, as "" the great Abe Lincoln of this century"". No t many persons swallowed that propaganda. The real Abraham Lincoln placed on record some very wise sayings. I refer a few of them to members of the OppositionYon cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. H is statements You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. How applicable those maxims are to the political party which the pseudo Abraham Lincoln temporarily leads, with his cap of office shaking upon his brow. The job that Australia is called upon to undertake to-day is to put into practice the principles that are expressed in those quotations. There must be complete cooperation hetween all sections of the community. Such co-operation is vital to the future security of the najion. We must get together and w,ork together. The jeers and the gibes that are uttered by the Onposition about the farmers are completely unjustified. Thc whole community depends upon the farmers, without whom we could not exist for a day. We are dependent upon them absolutely. one another. I am glad that the honourable gentleman appreciates it . I hope that he will tell the Leader of the Opposition something about it , because the right honourable gentleman does not understand such matters. him later. bers of the community are dependent upon the farmers, so are the farmers dependent upon other members of the community. But the requirements of the",62,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

222,Mr Pearce,That is my point.,63,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work
223,Mr Davies,I shall have a chat with,63,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work
224,Mr Pearce,"Just as other memprimary producers are not being met. In the electorate of Capricornia which I represent, farmers require supplies of galvanized iron and wire netting. They are obliged to use bad roads, and there is not a sufficient number of bridges over streams to enable them to travel conveniently to and from markets. Their transport is bad, and they need supplies of the foods that they cannot grow for themselves. The only reason why they cannot obtain their requirements is that the workers in many industries refuse to provide them. Yet those workers are dependent upon the farmers. ""Why cannot primary .producers get supplies of galvanized iron, fencing wire, agricultural implements and all the goods they need? The answer is that a few Communists on the coal-fields decide that.the coal-miners shall not hew suflicient quantities of coal for the nation's needs, and certain honourable members of the Parliament, like the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), preach in this chamber and in the Sydney Domain all the class hatred and rot imaginable. Honest workers are subject to the persecution that emanates from communism. The coal-miner is dependent upon the farmer for his food, yet the farmer lacks many of the things that are available to the coal-miner. A miner's' wife is not obliged to rise at daybreak, go to the dairy and milk cows day after day and week after week. work down the mine. that work, and he enjoys reasonable conditions of employment. No one has anything against the coal-miner personally, but I believe that until he throws off the yoke of his Communist bosses and produces all the coal Australia needs for its industries, our people will suffer, particularly those who labour from daylight to dark to supply the food that the miner needs. The necessity for co-operation extends even further than that; it extends among the workers themselves. The coal-miners are depriving other workers of homes because the shortage of coal is restricting the manufacture of roofing, bricks, cement, and other building materials. The need for co-operation exists within the unions themselves. Indeed, one branch of a union is depriving another branch of work. In my electorate, there are two branches of the waterside workers federation, the members of which are good fellows. There are no Communists among them, and they are prepared to do an honest day's work, but they cannot be fully employed because not enough ships call at the ports of North Queensland. The explanation is that the wharfiesin Sydney and Melbourne refuse to turn the ships round quickly so that they will be able to return within a reasonable time to Queensland. Shipping is delayed on the waterfront, with the result that people throughout Australia are deprived either of essential goods or ofwork. It is essential that employees shall co-operate with the wage-payers, and with those who produce their food, so that the people may have cement, -roofing tiles, galvanized iron, water spouting and other materials which are in short supply. If they do not obtain those requirements, there will be awful trouble in Australia. say "" terrible "" in a sneering tone. I do not believe that the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson) realizes the implications of that position. We are living in bad times. The Labour party is still "" blown up "" with the same ideas that it tried to sell to the people three or four years ago that we were living in a golden age. Opposition members have not yet got down to realities, and recognized the danger that threatens our country. If they did so, the spark of patriotism which is in them would impel them to exert all their influence on the workers to increase production. Many Opposition members have a great influence in the community, and they should instil in the people a recognition of the need for complete co-operation. A regrettable feature of the speech by the honourable member for Cunningham was his attack on the medical profession. We all owe a great debt to the doctors.

I recall, further, that the present Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey), who was a member of that Ministry, also supported the scheme. introduction of that legislation was hut tations indulged in by the political parties opposite. If honourable members opposite appeared before the people and told them the truth, explaining exactly what they stood for and what they intended to do, they would never win an election. It is only by means of the lies ami misrepresentations in which honourable members opposite indulge that they manage to mislead the people. One need only look at the handbook and printed propaganda of the anti-Labour parties to realize that their protestations of concern for the social welfare of the people are sheer hyprocisy. The honourable member for Capricornia referred to the attitude of Labour towards communism, conscription of man-power, and pensions for the aged. I shall not say that his remarks amounted to a pack of lies, because I believe that he is too immature politically to understand the control exercised over the anti-Labour parties by their bosses outside. of the Labour party, to which the honourable member belongs, say at the Sydney trades hall recently? ber for Canning (. Mr Hamilton) opens his mouth far too often. If he had a little more intelligence hc would not need to ask so many questions. M.r. Labour increase pensions last year? ber knows that Labour did not increase pensions at all last year. However, the increase which the anti-Labour parties propose to miiko now is most miserable and amounts to nothing more than a gesture. If honourable members opposite had any real sympathy with the aged people in the community they would increase their pensions by at least twice as much as is proposed. I listened attentively to the speech made hy the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) wheu he introduced the budget. I had hoped that on that occasion the rigbt honourable gentleman would explain the reason for the prolonged delay which preHowever, the ceded the introduction of the budget. It is the custom of Treasurers to present a sample of the misrepresentheir budgets early in September, and there was no real reason why the present Government should uot have adhered to that practice. I have heard it said that the budget was prepared in six successive forms, all of which were unacceptable to the Cabinet or to one or other of the coalition parties. However, the Treasurer forgot to tell us why he had delayed for so long the presentation of the the budget, and I twitted honourable members opposite in an endeavour to discover the reason for the delay. they give a reason? do so? When the Treasurer and his colleagues f a i l so lamentably in their duty to the people that they fall six weeks in arrears with their duty, even after they have had the benefit of a recess of three months, it is only reasonable to inquire the cause of their inaction. Were they engaged in a sit-down strike? hold up the country by obstructing vital legislation and then squib the issue? man should not be so silly as to ask such a question. I ask honourable members opposite why the Government has adopted a go-slow policy. If the coalminers, the waterside workers or the seamen of this country decided that they woulcl go slow and, as a. consequence, in with their work by six weeks, we should hear a great deal of condemnation of them from the anti-Labour parties. Of course, the matter is different when the members of the present Government adopt a go-slow policy, and their supporters attempt to defend them by asking, why should they not go slow? Apparently, there is one law for the present Government and another one for the ordinary workers. I want to know the real reason for the adoption of the go-slow policy.",66,Deputy Chaieman Each Employee Should Do A Fair Day S Work

252,Mr Beyson,"The honourable gentleDealing with the proposals in the budget, I point out that the 'budget was ostensibly intended tp correct inflation. Indeed, that was announced as the primary purpose of its introduction. However, although governmental expenditure for which provision was made in the budget introduced hy the Ohifley Government last year £556,000,000, the so-called anti-inflation budget introduced by the present Government £738,000,000. Of course, the increased expenditure will reduce the cost of living and restore value to the £ 1 ! A lot of criticism of Labour's financial proposals was uttered by the present Treasurer during the last Parliament when he was in opposition, and he freely criticized the manner in which the proposals contained in that government's budgets were presented. In particular, he complained that the last budget provided for wildly extravagant expenditure; yet he has now introduced the most inflationary proposals that have ever come before the Parliament. Of course, that is only a part of the story. After analysing the speech made by the Treasurer when he presented the budget and examining the figures it contains, it is clear that the right honourable gentleman could not balance his budget by ordinary means, so he decided to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue by extorting a forced loan of £103,000,000 from the wool-growers of Australia. If he had' decided to finance the deficit by borrowing there might have been some merit in his proposal. In an attempt to justify his proposal to penalize the wool-growers he has. stated that they will not be deprived of all that money, but that it will be used as a set-off against their future tax liabilities. Of course, some of it may be so used T sum may be used for the payment of the tax for which wool growers will be liable this year. ber for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) should stick to the discussion of rabbits because he does not know anything about the matter vvith which I am dealing at the moment. The wool sales deduction will be a forced', loan on which no interest will be paid and it will be extracted from only onesection of the community. As I have said, the sole purpose of that extraction is to enable the Government to balanceits budget. However, the financial problem that will confront the Treasurer next, amounted to year will be even greater than are its present problems, because the wool growers will then have paid in advance a proposes to expend very large portion of their income tax for that financial year, so that in the result the revenue from taxation will be reduced considerably. It is clear that the budget now before the committee will not check the present inflationary spiral, but will aggravate it more and more as time goes on. The Treasurer also said that he intended to simplify the preparation of income tax returns in the interests of the taxpayers, and that a part of his proposals would provide for the elimination of the present method of showing on taxation assessments a dissection of the total amount owing by a taxpayer so as to indicate the allocation for social services and for income tax. In future income tax assessments will merely show the gross amount payable by the taxpayers. I cannot perceive any improvement in that innovation. The Treasurer also proposes to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation to set out on the back of the assessment forms the rates of tax payable on various incomes so that taxpayers will be able to check the assessor's calculations of the amounts of tax payahle. The result of that change will be merely to encourage taxpayers to engage in controversies with the taxation authorities. Unless a taxpayer's calculations agree with those of the tax assessors he will feel an immediate grievance with the Commissioner of Taxation. Nevertheless, the Treasurer says that his proposal will be of great help to the taxpayers. It is very simple. The Government tells the taxpayer this, that and the other, but the Treasurer will still take just as much money from taxpayers as the previous Treasurer took, and their financial position will not be improved. The Treasurer has also told us that he proposes to reduce income tax pavments by about £7,000,000 a year through an alteration from the",67,Wilson B Y How Much Did A Period Of Three Months Fell Into Arrears

254,"Mr Beyson""","The honourable memrebate system in respect of allowable deductions, to the straight-out deduction system. He bas provided tables on that matter, and it is very interesting to note from them that the people who earn small wages and who cannot afford to pay taxes, will have the benefit of a very small reduction of the amount of tax that they have to pay whilst people on incomes of £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000 a year will receive great benefit. That is a complete departure from the system that we have had in operation in Australia for a number of years, which is, taxation according to ability to pay. This Government is taking care of its friends as hest as it can. I suggest that the Prime Minister has taken the "" Tragic Treasurer's"" mantle from the shoulders of the present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) and has placed it upon the shoulders of his present Treasurer. Last night the Prime Minister referred affectionately to the Minister for Health as "" Dogsbody "". I do not know why he should have given the Minister for Health such a name, but I suppose that he had to find something new for him after he had handed over the title of "" Tragic Treasurer"" to the right honourable member for McPherson( Mr Fadden). I turn now to the sales tax, which provides another example of how the Government is carrying out its promises to the people to reduce taxation and the rate of Government expenditure. I have shown how the Government has kept its promise to reduce expenditure by actually increasing expenditure from £566,000,000 last year to an estimate of £738,000,000 this year. now show how it is reducing taxation on the people by making alterations to the incidence of sales tax. The Treasurer has stated that he proposes to reduce sales tax. As a mattei' of fact he has exempted a number of items from sales tax. Those exemptions will mean a 'reduction of £1,000,000 a year in the revenue. That sounds very good. It sounds as if he is reducing taxes on the people, but when we look further we find that he intends to increase sales tax on other items so as to bring in another £7,500,000 in this financial year. Treasurer will receive from sales tax £6,500,000 more than was received last year. An examination of this method that the Treasurer has adapted to sales tax will prove interesting. I shall not mention many of the items that are the subject of proposed alterations of sales tax, but I shall mention several of them. For instance, floral tributes, including bouquets, posies, floral baskets and sheaves containing natural flowers, have had sales tax removed from them entirely. But other items that the Treasurer apparently regards as real luxuries, because the rate of sales tax on them has been increased to 33^ per cent., include body powders, deodorants and other toilet preparations that women use, such as leg tan lotion and liquid hosiery which save them the expense of buying silk and nylon stockings. Those are considered luxuries, but a wreath to be placed on a coflin or a bouquet of flowers that a man might take to his girl friend are not luxuries, according to the Treasurer, but are necessities, aud therefore are not to be subject to sales tax. Motor cars, which are used for pleasure only aTe considered by the Government to be luxuries, and the rate of sales tax on them has been increased from 8-J per cent, to 10 per cent., an increase of If per cent. Motor cars are a luxury to many people. However, we find that wireless receiving sets are apparently a much greater luxury than motor ears, according to the Government, because the rate of sales tax on wireless receiving sets is to be increased from 8J per cent, to 25 per cent. But a wireless set is not really a luxury nowadays. Such sets are used in homes all over this I shall Commonwealth, and are among the few means of entertainment that the ill-paid worker can afford. Buti f the worker is to be called upon to pay 25 per cent, sales tax on wireless sets many of the poorer members of the community will not be able to purchase them. People who need wireless sets for the purposes of entertainment or of listening to the news and thus save themselves the price of a newspaper, or of listening to a broadcast by the Prime Minister, will not be able to afford the additional 25 per cent. .Buti f they wish to buy a motor car they In actual fact the will have to pay only 10 per cent, sales tax, because according to the Government a motor car to be used for pleasure is not so much of a luxury as is. a wireless set that is to be used for the purposes of entertainment and education. Among othor luxuries listed are watches and clocks. The Government thinks that the people now should not have the means of telling the time. ' I believe from the speeches of honourable members opposite that Government supporters have the idea that the mentality of the people is so low that they will not be able to read the time by a watch or clock. However, there are still a number bf us who are able to tell the time, and I suggest that a watch or clock is not a luxury but is a necessity. How is the unfortunate worker to be able to arrive at work on time if he cannot afford to buy a watch or a clock? Also listed among the luxuries are collar-studs and sleeve-links. A collar stud is not much of a luxury when it falls on the floor and rolls under the wardrobe, and a man has to get down on his hands and knees to And it. But collar-studs and sleeve-links are a vital necessity because of the few buttons that manufacturers now put on shirts. However, as far as the Government is concerned, collar-studs and sleeve-links are luxuries and we can do without them. I turn now to several of the items that are to be subject to the 25 per cent, rate of sales tax. One item the inclusion of which in that list should interest Australian Country party supporters, is "" cowbells"". How will thc electors be able to find members of the Australian Country party who have not got cowbells hung around their necks? They will be lost forever without cowbells, so they should be raising their voices in protest about this particular item. the heavy duty on cowbells is part of the price that Australian Oountry party supporters have to pay for rhe privilege of being represented in the Government. Other items that are subject to heavy sales tax are mouthorgans and harmonicas that children like to play. ] should not mind if there ( Mr Ryan) -Order! The honourable was 100 per cent, tax on bagpipes, as gentleman's time has expired. I am not a Scotsman, but if tax-free bagilr. Bryaov. pipes were necessary to keep Scotsmen in a good temper, then bagpipes could be entirely free of tax so far as I am concerned. The items that I have mentioned provide a sample of what the country is being given in the budget. There is some humour to be found in the budget, but there is also a great deal of seriousness. The Government, which is a combination of members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party or, as I have said before, a combination of incompatibles, is treading the same ruinous path that was followed by a previous Government of its ilk, the Bruce-Page Government. It is applying a policy of borrow and bust. The Government is borrowing from a section of the people, by means of a forced interest-free loan that it proposes to take from the wool growers which it intends to use to balance its budget. It has borrowed 100,000,000 dollars from Americanfinanciersat a rate of 3-| per cent, interest, and has made preliminary arrangements to borrow another 100,000,000 dollars in America. It has put itself into pawn to overseas capitalists in exactly the same manner as the Bruce Page Government did in the late 1920's. I remind the committee that during the eight years of Labour administration, when we had to face the greatest expenditure in the history of this Commonwealth, and when the most expensive and devastating war ever fought by this country was in progress, the Labour Governments financed the whole of the war and the whole of the business of governing this country, without borrowing one half-penny overseas, either from Britain or America. NowI use those terms in a time of peace and prosperity, despite the fact that some members of the Government have been endeavouring to paint a Evidently very dull picture of conditions in Australia-a t a time when the country is more prosperous than it has ever been, when more money is available than ever before, and when we have more money than we know how to spend The TEMPORARY OHAIRMAN Progress reported.

It is all very well for the Leader of the ruling. I should have thought that when Opposition to take points of order on this matter. He would be doing his colleague and his country a better service if, instead or trying to smother this issue, he would state where the party stood and where he stood on this matter. This is not a challenge on the part of those who sit behind me in this place, nor on my part to the right of the right honourable gentleman to appear as a barrister before the courts of this land. But honourable members have the right to know the political significance of the action which the right honourable gentleman has chosen to take. He could not, even if he wished to do so, dissociate himself in the public mind from the stand that he has taken in this place. His resentment of actions which have occurred in this place is known, and his declared sympathies have been made public. He cannot dissociate those tilings from the public conception of what is going on. Therefore, it is of greatimportance and it is very desirable in tbe interests of good government that the people should know where this Parliament stands in relation to the issue which' is under challenge. I repeat the three questions which I have asked. Did the right honourable gentleman have the support of his party as a whole? If not, did he act with the knowledge and support bf his own leader ? Assuming that the answer to both those questions is "" No "", it can only be assumed that the right honourable gentleman took this course with the full knowledge of the significance which would be attached to his action, and with a reckless disregard of its consequences to his party or because he believed that what he was doing was justified in the eyes of his party. Unless these questions are answered frankly and clearly, the people will only have their bewilderment increased on this subject, and this Parliament will have no clear indication of what its course is to be in relation to the legislation undei-review. [46] the Opposition) [10.58] I have not heard in this Parliament a more disgracef u l speech than that which has just been made by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt). I raised a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, on which I do not think you gave a direct any issue was the subject of discussion by a court of the country, a Minister of the Crown would have been the last person to have raised any discussion on it, particularly a Minister of the Crown who was also a member of the legal profession. The Minister's attack is characteristic of the smear campaign, and the generally miserable and petty attitude which is being adopted by members of the Government whenever they happen to disagree with anybody whose character they can damage by innuendo aud inference. The. Minister has not had the courage to refer to a particular issue in this case. Would any honourable member of this House who had no knowledge of the particular matters which are now being referred to, understand what the Minister for Labour and National Service was talking about? He certainly would not. That is the plain fact, and I suggest that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, also have no knowledge, by virtue of your office, of matters which have not been directly referred to and stated in this House in clear and unmistakable terms. I shall say briefly what I intend to say because I do not desire to take up the time of the House in engaging in recriminations such as these, which are a disgrace to both the Government and the Minister. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) is appearing in a case in a Melbourne court, so I understand. My knowledge has been gained merely from a report appearing in an evening newspaper. As a member of the legal profession he is acting on behalf of clients who have engaged him in that capacity. He is not acting in any other capacity that I know of. The question whether the right honourable gentleman should appear in any court, in fact the question whether any honourable member of this House should appear in any court, does not seem to me to be material. Whether the Minister for Labour and",72,Adjournment

The honourable member for Bass has become a member of this House quite recently, but he endeavours to assert himself by making insulting remarks and references.

I suggest that the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) does not underclear reply to the Minister for Labour and National Service is that the right honourable member for Barton has not consulted with the Labour party at any time about any case in which he has appeared or may appear in his legal capacity, except in regard to the banking an case. I do not think that any otlier honourable member who is a member of the legal profession ever consults his party on such matters. The right honourable member for Barton is acting before the court as a member of the legal profession. He is representing clients hy whom he has been engaged ancl by whom he will be paid. There is no question of this party having discussed that representation or having discussed any action of the right honourable member for Barton in appearing in that particular case. I take the view that any member of the legal profession, or in fact of any other profession, has a complete right to practice his profession outside this House, without his motives being questioned by this Honse or by any one else. A man is entitled, as a member of the legal profession, to defend murderers ancl all sorts of criminals. I suggest that because such members of the legal profession defend accused of being in sympathy with murder. The whole thing is completely ridiculous, and I am astounded that the Minister for Labour and National Service should lend himself to an act of this character against a. member of his own profession. He knows very well that the members of that profession, or indeed of any other profession, areentitled to practice their profession without reference to their political party and without .any endorsement from anybody. That is exactly what the right honourable member for Barton is doing in this case. I remind the House that a number of other eminent King's Counsel are appearing with him in opposition to certain governmeut measures.

294,Mr Chifley,"Mr Deputy Speakerhonorable member for Barton, but nobody casts any doubt on their integrity and honesty. They are not mcmbers of the Labour party. Probably they are members of the Liberal party. The right honourable meniber for Barton is doing whatever he is doing purely as a member of the legal profession. He is not acting on behalf of his party, or as a result of any discussion with this party and not as a result of any decision that he should represent this party in any particular case in any particular court. member of the legal profession I would be the first to recognize the right of any member of my profession to appear for any client in any court in the country. But the absence of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) from the Parliament to-day and the circumstances of his absence are entirely peculiar. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Ohifley) mentioned that other eminent counsel are engaged in certain proceedings. They have not taken a leading part in the political background of the matters that are under discussion in the court, nor have they been engaged for a long time solely in political activiby the House. The other point raised ties. I think that it is correct to say that the absence of the right honourable meinber for Barton from this House to-day, in order to appear in a court, is the first occasion on which he has been absent for that purpose since he ceased to he Attorney-General. The Minister has plainly stated the political aspect of this matter. He has called upon the Leader of the Opposition to state where the Opposition stands to-day, but thc Leader of the Opposition has failed to-do so. Honourable memhers of this House and the people of Australia are entitled to know where the Opposition stands in relation to the appearance of the right honourable member for Barton in the case now before the court. In view of the complete failure of the Leader of the Opposition to answer that question, we must seek for the answer ourselves. I suggest to the House that there are three possible reasons why the right honourable member for Barton is appearing. Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) is apparently going to launch an attack on the right honourable member for Barton. Government supporters interjecting, members on the Government side, who are so consistent in their interjections, that my point of order will be heard by Mr Deputy Speaker, who I presume does not take instructions from honourable members. An attempt is being made to attack the standing of one counsel appearing in court. Honourable members on the Government side have already spoken of his identity with the legislation recently before this Parliament. That is an attempt to influence the mind of the court by lowering the status of the counsel concerned. liament is quite entitled to discuss the activities of any of its members. In 1934, there was a motion of urgency to discuss the activities of a member of the Parliament in relation to certain government contracts. A debate on that matter was permitted. I rule, therefore, that the activities of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) may be discussed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) has not yet arisen, and there i9 no need for 'me to give a ruling on it. Leader of the Opposition has completely failed to answer legitimate inquiries a.bout the political implications of tlie absence from this chamber of the right honourable meniber for Barton. I contend that we are entitled to discuss this matter and to seek some explanation of this extraordinary procedure. The first explanation that comes to my mind is that the right honourable meinber for Barton is demonstrating his disapproval of thc decision forced upon him and his party by the Opposition's extra-mural masters. As we all know, the Opposition stated again and again that it had adopted a stand on a certain issue as a matter of vital ijrinciple. We saw that stand shamefully abandoned. One possible explanation of the right honourable gentleman's actions, therefore, is that he is taking this opportunity to demonstrate his own, and his party's disapproval of the decision only explanation that suggests itself if the",74,Adjournment

300,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.13],"the honourable member for Barton. Is it not a fact that the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on a number of occasions was paid to give legal opinions to unions that had Communist officials? Was there anything improper about that? Wasi t suggested that, because the right honourable gentleman gave those opinions, he held 'Communist views or supported the philosophy of communism? This is only a pretence on the part of members of the Government calculated to cloud the issue and to create in the minds of the people the very impression that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has suggested will be created. The Minister asked what construction the Australian public would place on this act by the right honourable member for Barton. In doing so he suggested the construction that Government supporters want to put on it, which is that members of the Labour party are eager to defend the Communist party. "" During the debate on a -certain measure both in this House and the Senate, I heard legal men express some doubts about its validity. Is it not only proper that if people believe that an action by this Government is invalid, they should have the right to challenge it before the High Court? Por what reason does the High Court exist? Or, is it to be presumed that access to the court and the proper methods of defence are to be denied to people who desire to approach it because they hold certain political opinions? It woidd be a sorry day for this country if the Parliament ever accepted the view expressed by the Minister for Labour and National Service as a guiding principle in respect of our judicial system. A cowardly attack is being made upon the right honourable member for Barton in his absence. As he will be returning to the House within the next day or so, those who wanted to launch the attack could have done so when the right, honourable member was present in the chamber and was thus able to defend himself. I understand that there is a body known as the Bar Association-no t that I have much confidence in it-that is supposed to prohonorable member? Was it not only on tect members of the legal profession against unprovoked attacks upon their integrity. some attention to the action of the Minister for Labour and National Service and the honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne), and also the Minister for Supply, who, no doubt, will follow me, in their attack on the right honourable membei for Barton and 1 iu trying to establish a principle that would deny to accused persons, because of their political opinions, the best counsel that could be briefed. There is no doubt that the Government is trying to make political capital out of something which should not he the direct concern of the Parliament at all. The right honourable member for Barton is acting upon his own initiative as a member of the legal professon. He has accepted a brief that has heen offered to him. He has not sought the view of his party with regard to his act, because he has not had any need to do so. When he appears in the role of counsel before the High Court he will not be speaking on behalf of the Opposition, but will be representing a client. Government supporters are endeavouring to make a great deal out of nothing. No doubt the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) will take this opportunity to add a chapter to The Garden Path so that it may be quoted in future as another instance where it alleged the right honourable member for Barton has defended the Communist party. Judging from the expressions that supporters of the Government have uttered this evening, it is no idle talk on the part .of members of the Opposition when the latter accuse them of having fascist tendencies.

It is perfectly proper for the honourable member for East Sydney to wax indignant.

I have never witnessed a more shameful spectacle in this Parliament. I repeat that the absence of the Prime Minister from the chaniber is most, significant. Undoubtedly the right honourable gentleman is ashamed of what, is going on. This matter was left io the initiative of one of his senior Ministers, who has shamed himself and the honourable profession to which he belongs. It has been said that lawyers are very queer individuals. I propose to relate the story of an incident, which has some relevancy to the issue before us, which took place in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria many years ago. At that time the present Prime Minister hold the Nunawading seat and I had been gibing him about the fact that, for the sake of filthy lucre, he had appeared in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court on behalf of a certain union, the members of which had lodged a claim for a reduction of hours of duty and an increase of wages, and that a fortnight later he again appeared before, the same court on behalf of the Victorian Eailway Commissioners to oppose a claim by -mother union for thc reduction of hours of duty and an increase of thc rates of pay of its members.

I am sure that when the justices of the High Court read of this disgusting episode they will be ashamed that it should have been initiated by a member of the legal fraternity who may at some time in the future be himself a member of the court. I have observedthat certain honourable members opposite who served with the Australian Imperial Force have given some backing to the case that was presented by the Minister for Lahour and National Service( Mr which he usually practises, and if satisHolt). They know very well that during the course of military operations soldiers occasionally commit offences for which they are court-martialled and that the King's regulations provide that if a soldier accused of having committed an offence cannot find a soldier's friend to defend him an officer shall be appointed' to present his case. Do they contend that any reflection should be cast on the selected officer in such cases? The contemptible members and supporters of this Government would deny to a member of this House merely because of his political associations the privilege that is accorded to an officer who acts in that capacity, and endeavour to damn him in the eyes of the justices of the High Court. This is the most deplorable episode that has ever occurred in any parliament in the world. for Supply) [11.38] -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), with his usual charm, has prevailed on me to enter this debate by hurling a few insults at me across the chamber. I am delighted to do so. It is time that the issues were made clear. As far as I know, no personal attack was made on the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), but very significant and interesting questions were raised but not discussed by members of the Opposition about where the Opposition stands in relation to this matter. told. of it. I cannot believe that the right honourable member for Barton, who is tlie Deputy Leader of the Australian Labour party in this House, did not consult his party or his leader before he absented himself from his duty in this House. As a member of the profession to which I also belong, the right honourable member was quite within his rights in appearing in the court for anybody for whom he wished to appear. We ail concede that right. Indeed that is an obligation of which barristers have been very proud for hundreds of years. If a barrister is asked to appear in a case which falls within the jurisdiction in factory fees are offered to him and he is not otherwise engaged, an obligation rests on him to accept the brief. If the case is regarded by him as distasteful, it is well known that there are plenty of ways in which he may avoid accepting it. He can at least plead that he is otherwise engaged. If , however, the case is not distasteful to him, and he thinks that it is his duty to accept the brief, he does so. None of that is in dispute in this case. The question in dispute is this: Has he an obligation, first of all as a member of .this Parliament, and secondly as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, primarily to be in his place in this House? I should have thought not only that an excuse for declining this brief was available to him, ' ' but also that he had some sort of an obligation under which he might well have said, "" My primary duty is in the Parliament of which I am a member, and I am paid to attend to it by the taxpayers of Australia"". Let us have no misunderstanding about this matter. The right honourable member for Barton is appearing in Melbourne for Mr Healy in a challenge against the Communist Party Dissolution Act. Nothing that is sub judice is involved in that statement. There is no attack upon the court, and there is no attempt to influence the court. It is merely a bald, simple statement of fact. What is the inference to be drawn from that fact? I do not suggest that there is an inference against the right honourable member personally because I say, as I have said before, that he is perfectly entitled to appear in that capacity.

I think that the Parliament will be very much ashamed in future of the proceedings in. this House to-night. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has chosen to attack the right hcnorable meniber for Barton (Dr. Evatt) because he accepted a brief from a union and an individual to appear in a curtain case before the High Court in Melbourne. The Minister pointed out that he did not attack the right honourable gentleman professionally. The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) later said that he did not 'attack him personally. And so, as the right honourable gentleman has been exonerated both professionally ancl personally, the attack is now directed at the Lahour party, which is alleged to have approved of the decision of the right honourable member to appear in a certain case. The Minister for Supply has been guilty of such rudeness and vulgarity a.= to say that he does not believe the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) that iLa Labour party has never discussed the matter. That assurance, of course, is true. The Minister for Supply has said that the right honourable member for Barton ought to be in this Parliament, attending to his parliamentary duties instead of appearing in the courts of the country. Such a statement comes oddly strange from the Minister for Supply because, during the life of the last Parliament, that honourable gentleman was rarely present in this House; he was usually outside it, earning all that he could in the courts of this country. The present Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) also came to the Parliament only, on an average, once a week. He was appearing in the courts at other times and he. won for himself the soubriquet of "" Once-a-week Percy "". 1 am no lover of lawyers. I have never had any mason to love them. I am not concerned very much about their ethical standards and all the rest of the argument, but, if it be right for certain people to appear in thc courts because of their brand of politics, it cannot be wrong for somebody else with a different brand of politics Chifley Government and that he has proto do likewise. The Prime Minister( Mr mised to fix np their long servico leav-'* Menzies) himself has been revealed in some strange associations .during his long and very distinguished legal career. There was a time when he was Attorney General in the State of Victoria and the Government of which he was a member established a royal comniission to inquire into the operations of the Shell Oil Company. The Attorney-General of the State of Victoria accepted a brief from the Shell Oil( ompany to appear for it before that royal commission. There was also a time when the right honourable gentleman who is now Prime Minister appeared in rhe James case in London. He could not accept a fee as Attorney-General for the Co in mon wealth of Australia when litwas appearing for the Commonwealth in support of the High Court's decision on section 02 of the Constitution, but he did t.he next best thing and accepted a brief from the State of Victoria for which he was paid £2,000 to argue the same case, before the same tribunal. The Minister forgets tliose incidents in our history. He says that the right honorahle mein ber for Barton (Dr. Evatt) because of the circumstances which Mirround this case in which he appearing, should not have identified himself with the proceedings.

He may have lost cases before the High Court, but he has also won cases before the High Court, and what is worrying the Government to-day is that in that famous case of ""Walsh and Johnson in J 926 he succeeded in defeating the opinion of the then Attorney-General, who is now the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, and persuaded the High Court to declare the legislation invalid. It is because the validity of this legislation may be upset by reason of the. acumen and the brilliance of the right honourable member for Barton, that this attack is being made upon him. There may be a case against a lawyer who is in politics appearing in litigation of this nature, but there is no justification, said wasabove all for Ministers in a parliament, to try to prejudice the result of that litigation by attacking the character or the standing of one person. In view of all that has been said, I think it might bc u good thing to declare that all lawyers should be out of the Parliament. The Minister for Supply laughs. If such a rule were applied it would not affect him ordinarily, because, if my memory serves me aright, during the war period the Chifley Qovernment, at the instance of the right honourable member for Barton, who was then Attorney-General, kept him out of thc Bankruptcy Court with the briefs it gave to him on behalf of the Commonwealth. very well for honourable members opposite, and Ministers in particular, to be leading this campaign against the right honourable member. I point out that last week he appeared for the clothing trades unions before the Commonwealth A rbitration Court, and there was no objection taken, although it would have been equally valid to have objected then as it is now. Are we to take it from the Government's attitude on this case that it. objects to Labour lawyers appearing for trade unions in a court of any jurisdiction? Perhaps it did not want the right lionorable gentleman to appear in the clothing trades case either. It is significant that this attack is made on him. In the clothing trades case he led the Bar aud was associated with Mr Barwick, KC , of Sydney, in the fight for the unions. In the case to which reference has been made, Mr Barwick is leading the case for the Government against the right honourable member for Barton. There is no objection to Liberal lawyers having views and expressing them, but there is an attempt, not only to smear and smudge, but also to belittle the efforts of Labour lawyers and of a lot of other people. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) did not say the things that were alleged against him in the vapourings of the Postmaster General( Mr Anthony). The Postmaster-General did not quote from Hansard; he has a "" cooked "" report of his own. He refused to say that it was identical with the Hansard report. What the honourable member for East Sydney If trado unions are to uo declared under tliis bill The honourable member's time has expired. Labour and ""National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.56] -in reply -The Opposition opened its reply on this matter by a series of personal charges against those members of the Government who have had the temerity, in its eyes, to raise this subject in the Parliament. Honourable members of the Opposition talk about shameful and disgracef ul conduct, but humbug is humbug, It is all whether it is expressed in the home-spun terms of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) or in the ranting terms which characterized some of the other speeches. It is humbug because I can recall other occasions in the life of this Parliament when the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was made the object of the most bitter and personal attacks by honourable members who are criticizing members of the Government here to-night because he had appeared in court ou issues on which they thought he should not have appeared at that time. But now it becomes shameful and disgraceful on our part to make any reference to such matters.",82,Adjournment
345,Mr Deputy Speakeb,Order!,83,Adjournment
346,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forComing to more recent times, I can remember that tbe right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) challenged the propriety of two judges of the High Court sitting on the Banking case. There was no regard paid to the shameful or disgraceful character of that conduct. I should like to clear up one or two matters which have been left in the air as the result of the discussion that has taken place. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said we have chosen to make this attack, as he calls it, on the right honourable gentleman in his absence. It is not of our choosing that he is absent, and if the Government could usefully have deferred discussion on a matter which is of such lively public importance it would have done so. I at least can claim that I did the the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in next best thing. I do not act in this House without some sense of responsibility, nor have I made it a practice in this House to make personal attacks on members of it. BeforeI raised this matter at all I went to the Leader of the Opposition and told him that I was proposing to do so. I also indicated to him my reason for doing so. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) something that is being done without the knowledge of the Prime Minister, and something of which the Prime Minister would be ashamed. as I had some sense of responsibility in the one direction, I also had sufficient sense of responsibility to notify the Prime Minister, who is attending an official engagement, of what I intended to do and my reasons for it. The Prime Minister, while stressing that the Government does not challenge the right of any member of the legal profession to appear in the courts of the country, entirelv endorsed the political aspect of this matter to which I drew the attention of the House when I embarked on what I had to say earlier to-night. So, on those counts, we on this side of the House have acted with a sense of responsibility, and we have not endeavoured to "" put over"" the Labour party something that it has not had a reasonable opportunity to analyse. We set out by asking a number of questions which we Mr Holt. considered that the Parliament and the country were entitled to have answered, and this discussion at least has had the useful purpose of bringing out into the open the fact that the right honourable member for Barton, who is the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this House, in involving himself in an issue of this character, did not seek the approval of his party, acted without its knowledge and did not have its support in doing so. That point at least has been answered. ' I now wish to direct attention to the second aspect. The right honourable member for Barton is not a novice in political matters. He is not so unintelligent that he does not realize that when he goes into this particular case, not merely as a barrister but being at the same time this House, he must inevitably implant in the mind of the public the belief that he is acting in a way of which his party would approve. Knowing that, the right honourable gentleman, either reckless of the consequences, or hoping that the public will believe that, although the Opposition in the action, is hoping that the public will believe that although the Opposition was not able to carry the day in this Parstated that this is liament against the decision of the executive of the Australian Labour party, it will be able to carry the day by a challenge in the courts. The Opposition canJust not have it both ways. Eitheri t has endorsed that action or approved it, or its Deputy Leader has gone into this action, recklessly involving his party in the consequences of what he is doing. He is no novice, and honourable members opposite are men with some political knowledge of these matters. I shall conclude by referring to the action of my own leader, the present Prime Minister, in a somewhat comparable case. The Chifley Government's banking legislation was under challenge. As members of the Opposition at that time, we had attacked it most vigorously in the Parliament and the act finally came before the courts. Becanse our leader is also a man who is not without some forensic skill and reputation in this country, he was one of the first persons approached with a view to ascertaining whether he would go into court and argue the case against the Government's legislation. The right honourable gentleman not only refused to take that course, but also diseussed the proposal f u l l y with his colleagues in his own party. I find it almost incredible that, in a matter of this kind, the Deputy Leader of tbe Labour party should involve it in the political repercussions which must inevitably flow from his action without having had the common decency to notify his colleagues of his proposal, and to seek their endorsement of it . Question resolved in thc affirmative. The following papers were presented :Commonwealth Public Service Act-Appoint ments-Departmen t of Works and Housing -N . I . Davey, D. W. Hancock. Dried Fruits Export Control Act-Twenty sixth Annual Beport of thc Dried Fruits Control Board, for year 1946-50, together with Statement -by the Minister regarding the operation of the Act. . Lands Acquisition Act-Land acquired for postal purposes-Bathurst, New South Wales. Northern Territory'(Administration) ActRegulations-1950--No. 8 (Darwin Administration Ordinance). House adjourned at 12.3 a.m. (Thursday). The following answers to questions were circulated:the honourable member for Ryan( MT . D r u r y ) asked a question concerning the desirability of attracting more tourists to .Australia. The whole question of the Commonwealth's interest in tourism is at present under consideration, and the suggestions of the honourable member for the holding of a national tourist week w ill be kept in mind. honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) addressed to me a number of questions, seme of which I answered for t h w it h; two of them, however, I requested the honourable member to place upon the notice-paper. These questions were1. Will the Minister inform the House of the tota) number of migrants who came to this country up to tlie end of September, 1950, furnishing details of the numbers of British nnd non-British migrants? 2. Is the honourable gentleman able ' to provide precise information concerning the number of migrants that is expected in 1951 and the countries from which tliose migrants will be drawn ? I now wish lo furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. The number nf permanent new arrivals from October, 1945, to the end of June, 1950, was 380,580, made up as follows i-r-British, 189,718; non-British, 190,842. Another 30,000 persons arrived in Australia during the quarter ended September, 1950, but details of their nationalities are not yet available from the Commonwealth Statistician. A point worth noting is that Australia is obtaining a greater proportion of British .migrants tlian any other country. For example, in the first seven months of this year only 7,945 Britons emigrated to Canada, whereas 43,000 came to Australia. 2. It is not possible to furnish precise information concerning the number of migrants Australia expects to receive in 1951 or the countries from which thoy will he drawn, since this partly depends on the outcome of negotiations, which u-re now proceeding. It is, however, the Government's aim to increase the population of Australia by at least 2,000,000 people Avithin the next ten years by large-scale immigration, and every effort is being mode to ensure that the numbers arriving during 1951 will bear a proper relation to this aim. As the International Refugee Organization wi\l pease operations in 1951., it has been necessary to investigate new sources pf migration in Europe to replace thc displaced persons who have' in recent years comprised the bulk of our 18th October, non-British migrants, and it is now clear that the best prospeots of obtaining new settlers in the numbers and of -the types we require He in Holland, Western Germany, Austria and Italy. Immigration from Great Britain is foremost in the Government's policy, and top priority will, as in the past, be given in 1951 and subsequent years to the migration of British people. A« I mentioned in this House only a day or two ago, we are now providing more shipping for them than ever before, nnd while, as the result of these efforts, we expect to receive a record number of British migrants this year, the figure should be even greater in 1951. A detailed statement of the number of migrants that we expect to receive in 1051, and the countries from which they will be drawn, will be furnished as soon as practicable.",83,Adjournment
