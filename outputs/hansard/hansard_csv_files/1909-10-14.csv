I do not pose as an expert; my knowledge of military matters is due to the fact that when the country called I , in conjunction with thousands of others, answered. answering I was privileged in various positions to obtain some little insight into military matters, and it may be taken for granted, I hope, that I subsequently maintained in them perhaps a greater interest than the average citizen. What little knowledge I have gained by actual experience, added to that which I have acquired in public life, tells me at once that this Bill is the young men of the Commonwealth. only a partial contribution to the nation's military requirements. Its provisions seem to stamp it as a Bill which is the best possible work of experts with the limited material placed at their disposal. light of the Bill introduced last year by the Deakin Ministry and the statements that we have heard from the present Minister -of Defence, it appears to me that the paucity and the class of material offered is due entirely to the influence of the Minister of Defence and of that section of the Fusion which more directly supports him. The Bill is in the nature of a compromise. It is based more on what the Minister of Defence committed himself to prior to a consideration of the subject than on what he, perhaps, knows now it ought to be. It is not based on any settled plan. It is devoid of thought as to the future; it gives no indication of any desire-despit e the eloquence of the Minister to the contrarythat an effective defence force shall* be raised and maintained. It is one of those compromises which on being submitted to the public require a plethora of words from the Minister, and an examination of which discloses a minimum of usefulness. In others words, it is a shaky bridge of boats hastily thrown across the wide and turbulent stream which divides the Minister of Defence, with his "" no compulsion,"" from the Deakin section of the Fusion with their proposals for universal service. it cannot please either party to the bargain, and must be a severe disappointment to members of the community who were looking forward to the introduction of a Bill that would provide for raising and maintaining an effective defence force such as I am convinced Australia requires. There is not embodied in this Bill, so far as it relates to training, the opinion of any one military expert in Australia. In no direction does it carry the stamp of expert knowledge; no portion of it dealing with the training of our young men carries with it the approval of any military expert in the Commonwealth. When, in moving the second reading of the Bill, the Minister informed us that it was the policy of the In so Government that there should be compulsory training, but that he was guided in framing the details of the Bill by the experts of his Department, he must have known that it is utterly impossible for him to give the name of one military officer under his control who would write his approval of it as being adequate to provide for the training of The Minister, with a foresight that might almost have been called ingenious, but certainly was not ingenuous, stated that experts differed from time to time in their In the views, and that military science seemed to be practically the only indeterminate one. I have no objection to experts who change their views-that is essential as improvements are made in many directions-bu t I do object to that .class of expert who will change his views with every change of Ministry, and always, as is the custom of one or two, take the line of least resistance, which may open up to them opportunities of personal advancement and gain them the approval of the reigning Minister. That class of expert is to be deplored, and his advice should be put upon one side; but only that class could possibly have supported the Minister in framing this Bill. The more we examine it the more we see signs of hasty preparation with a poor class of material. It shows an entire absence of foresight, and a lack of cohesion. The parts do. not dovetail. There is no continuity in it. There is no provision for raising an effective military force, or for the continuation of training after the age of twenty years. It contains no provision for a force other than that whicli now exists, unless it be that the present force, inadequate as the Minister informed us that it was, is to be strengthened by As such some 5,000 recruits. The Bill seems to have been framed in parts, and the draftsman intrusted with the final putting together of those parts apparently recognised the heart-breaking task put before him, because he has sought refuge in the words "" as may be prescribed."" We see that phrase running through the Bill. Practically three-fourths of it is left to the future, to whatever Minister may have control of the Department-in short, .to the varying views of politicians and the exigencies of particular parties. It is time that -we settled upon some firm foundation of a system of military defence, instead of the subject remaining, as it has .been in the past, a mere plaything of whatever Minister or party happens, for the time being, to have control. This is a boys' Bill, and there seems to be so much "" prescription "" in it that ere the boys arrive at manhood they will have been siclcened, if not killed, in a military sense, so that in the later stages we shall be in a far worse condition -than we are at present. The dominant note .in the minds of the Ministry must have been that it was their duty to at least put something before the House. They found it utterly impossible to reconcile the many varying views of their supporters, and they left it to the eloquence and ingenuity of the Minister to present this final something in such form and language as might possibly make it acceptable to those who did .not look deeply into it, or who, perhaps, were ready to accept anything as an instalment. I know that the Bill has been received in certain quarters with acclamation. I have read the cabled reports of what has appeared in the English press. I know also that a great proportion of the Australian papers have received it with open arms, acclaiming it as a measure worthy of consideration, and have showered their congratulations upon the Minister; but I believe they have done so because, in the first place, they know that in the past the word "" compulsion "" in relation to military matters has been repugnant to Britishspeaking peoples, because they are strenuous in their efforts to introduce compulsory training in some part of the Empire in the hope that other parts will rapidly follow, and because, in consequence, they are in a condition of mind . to accept even the smallest instalment in that direction as establishing a principle, in the hope that it will grow. If , however, they understood Australia and its natural requirements, as those living in it ought to do, or had some military knowledge, or obtained the opinions of military experts, not one of them would aver that this Bill meets Australian requirements, even in the matter of military training. The opinions of newspapers in this respect ought not to influence us in dealing with the details of the Bill. We ought to recognise the necessity for an effective force-and if we are to have any kind of force, it ought to be effective-and we ought to put into -the Bill such provisions as will make it effective. But when we lose sight entirely of the youth at twenty years of age, no indiMr Roberts^ vidual with a knowledge of military matters will dare to say that that youth is then an effective soldier. He may be merely the material out of which a soldier can be made, but he is certainly not a soldier in the sense in which the Minister used the term. Even six or seven or seventeen years after receiving the two eight days' trainings, he cannot be regarded as a well-drilled, well-trained, and effective soldier, fit for the defence of Australia. The Bill seems to have three great defects. The first lies in a misconception of what should be done with the boys in the cadet corps, how they should be organized, and to what extent they should be trained. 'The second lies in the entire absence of provision for educating the corps of instructors who will be required to deal with the men who are to be compulsorily trained, while the third lies in making absolutely no provision for an effective first fighting line. If I understand the mind of the Minister aright, his administration, so far as regards the education of instructors, will be a lamentable failure. Our present force is inadequately officered. There is a shortage in nearly every branch of it. Even the permanent force is some seventy below its establishment, eight of them being officers; the militia is 1,154 below its establishment, 167 of them being officers; and the volunteers are 762 short of the establishment, 63 of them being officers, a total of 238 officers, and 1,748 of other ranks, short in our Permanent, Militia and Volunteer Forces, the grand total short anf&unting to nearly 2,000. Yet the Minister, with airy indifference, proposes to make 2,000 of the present officers and sergeants instructors. He should know that it would be impossible to obtain 500 who are competent to do the work of instruction. The present' force, although now 2,000 below its establishment, is to lose 2,000 more of its best men, which will make it 4,000 below its establishment. The Minister, however, proposes to raise its strength from '25,000 to 29,000. In other words, he proposes to add 9,000 recruits to a force which is now nearly 300 officers short, and will then be about 1,500 officers short. Colonel Legge-and , as he is now the special expert adviser of the Minister on military matters, his opinion may be quoted with some emphasis-state d recently that some 8,000 of our present militia are mere recruits; that a large number are physically unfit, and that not 10,000 are fit for service. Further, we have been told by the Minister that it is estimated that, during the first six months of a war, the wastage amounts to about 80 per cent., so that were we put to the necessity of defending the country, it would not be long before Australia would have only 2,000 or 3,000 effectives. Yet the Minister says with the fullest confidence that under his scheme we shall have a well-trained, well-drilled, capable fighting force, on which we can rely. Our first business is to establish a school of instruction, picking out from the present force those who show a gift for instructing. We should set to work to impart to these picked men, during the next twelve or eighteen months, instruction which will fit them to take charge of classes of boys or men. For the cadets, we shall need special instructors. train adults cannot always teach boys. At the present time, we have not the men to draw on for this work, and it is not likely that we can obtain them from abroad, because in Great Britain the training of the Territorials is already taking from the regular forces more qualified instructors than can well be spared. Leading experts there have declared that it would be madness to attempt to train the Territorials with men who have not served for at least from seven to fourteen years in the regular army, and show the possession of a gift for instructing. When under the instruction of Sergeant-Major Ryan, who, I think, has now retired on a commission, I learned more in a week than I could have learned from the militia non-commisioned officers in a year, because he had been specially trained for his work, and had a natural gift for it. We should take some hundreds of young nien, and put them into a school of instruction. When their training was finished, we should pick out those who were specially gifted for teaching boys, and detail them for the training of the cadets, leaving the others to instruct the recruits. To take a few hundred men from the present militia, and use them as instructors, without first giving them a special training, will go a long way to spoil our Defence Force. Yet the Minister saysWe propose to take 2,000 officers and sergeants from that force (namely, the militia), for the purpose of officering and training the ferences have been held to discuss how the second line. instructing them. no qualification. He apparently intends to continue the existing organization of the militia, which, he said, is totally inadequate. would continue it in its present form. fication. We have no indication as to what is intended with reference to the training of the cadets. my speech I referred to the need for educating officers. give a semblance of decent training to our forces, it will be necessary to at once establish a school of instruction, in which some hundreds, if not 1,000, men may be trained for a year or eighteen months for the work of instructing others. Those who can successfully administration, to be provided for on the Estimates ? been provision for it on the Estimates. As no such provision has been made, and as the Minister has not referred to the matter, I feel bound to call attention to it. It will be impossible to train the cadets or the recruits with the officers and sergeants of the present militia. A few of the latter may have the gift of imparting instruction, but I do not think that there are many who would say that they possess it. One may be a good officer, capable of leading his men in time of peace, or even in time of war, and yet be unfitted to instruct others, particularly the young. We do not wish to damp the ardour of our boys. We should make them enthusiastic, so that they will long for the time when they will pass into the militia, and from it into the reserves, which will be effective, if ever needed for the national defence. Buti f we place over them men unfitted to give instruction, we shall not make soldiers of them. Apparently there has been no conference with educational authorities regarding the best way to deal with the cadets.

No; provision is made in the Bill for the training of the boys who leave school before they are fourteen. Whatever knowledge of calisthenics and preliminary movements they may have gained as junior cadets will be forgotten before they are called upon to join the senior cadets. assumes that the training of the junior cadets will take place only in the schools. based on a reply to a question put to the Minister. at the schools as much as possible. We shall follow those who leave before attaining the age of fourteen years. power to do so. will have to provide a third set of instructors. At present he proposes to provide one set to teach the junior cadets, and another set to teach the senior cadets. A third set will be necessary to instruct the boys who leave school before they are fourteen. thirteen-year-old boys with eighteen-yearold boys. That would mean chaos and spoiling the work in both directions. At present, however, that is what is provided. Had the opinion of educational experts been taken, the ages at which the various cadets are to be brigaded would be different from what is proposed. The junior cadets are to be given during school hours, 120 hours' training per annum. That amounts, approximately, to thirty-three or thirty-five minutes per school day. a day. a period of training for a boy unless it is to be divided into two sections of fifteen minutes per day. It is far too much also to expect of the teachers, who will be called upon in the main, to give this instruction Many of them have qualified, or are qualifying, for the avork, are showing much enthusiasm in it, and are better fitted than are many of the military instructors for this special class of instruction. This, however, -will be too much for the teachers, and instead of raising enthusiasm amongst them we shall raise objections, and practically kill the moveI believe ment at its inception. I am convinced, after conversation with men in the Education Departments, that one-half of the time proposed would be quite sufficient to devote to this work in addition to the ordinary training which the lads receive at school, and which is designed largely, I admit, to develop a type of character rather than to develop physique. Fifteen minutes drill for lads up to thirteen years of age is all that is necessary as a preliminary to their undergoing a more severe course. It would be more effective and less costly to divide the cadets into three instead of two sections. It will be a failure to brigade boys of fourteen with lads of eighteen. It will not be conducive to the good of the younger boys; and it will tend to spoil very largely the esprit de corps and enthusiasm of the elder. To say that on the average a lad of eighteen is a fit companion for one We take of fourteen is to show a misunderstanding of the boys of Australia. It will be hurtful to both sections if they are thus brigaded. It would be preferable and more beneficial to divide the cadets into three sections: the first comprising boys of from ten to thirteen years of age, who would receive instruction in the main at school; the second consisting of boys of He would not dream of brigading from thirteen to sixteen years of age, who as junior cadets should be provided with miniature rifles, belts, and possibly gaiters, but certainly not uniforms; and the third 'section comprising senior cadets of from sixteen to nineteen years of age, who should be supplied with uniforms, and be permitted to take up the ordinary rifle such as is used by the militia. The proposal of the Minister that lads of fourteen should join the senior cadets, and be given uniforms, means entirely unnecessary expense. At sixteen years of age each of those lads would require another uniform. numerous protests because boys of between twelve and fourteen years of age are not to wear uniforms. Boys like the uniform, and mothers like to see their sons in uniform. My own son was exceedingly proud when, sixteen months after we had paid for his uniform-, and fourteen months after he had been measured for it, he returned home with it.

What we want to do is tq make of our boys, at the least possible cost, material from which soldiers can eventually be turned out. The present proposal means an entirely unnecessary expense, since boys of fourteen who are to wear uniforms will require new uniforms when they reach the age of sixteen or seventeen years; and, when eighteen vears of age, will pass on to the Citizen Defence Force, and will require yet another. By dividing the Cadet Forces in the manner I have suggested, only one cadet uniform will be necessary; and before it becomes unserviceable, the youth will have passed into the Citizen Defence Force, and there be given a militia uniform. has spoken of nineteen years as being, in his opinion, the maximum age for senior cadets. What would his next class be? reaching the age of nineteen years, vouths should at once enter the militia. They should remain in the militia for five years, and undergo not less than twelve days' training per annum. Subsequently they should pass for five years into a first reserve, and undergo not less than six days' training per annum. Only then should they pass into what might be termed outer reserves, which should be organized and recognised by the Government. should then pass out finally as men, who, in times of emergency, could be called upon to undertake the defence of the country. The third and worse failure of this Bill is that it makes no provision for a continuation of these trainees in the militia. shall be glad to be corrected. As I understand the Bill, it provides that boys shall pass out of the Cadet Force on reaching the age of eighteen years with no training worthy of the name, so far as the making of an effective soldier is concerned. They are then to go into what is called the Citizen Defence Force and to remain in that force for two years.. During the first year they are to have eight days' training in camp, organized into units by themselves, and in the second year they are to be organized with the militia for another eight days' training in camp. Their compulsory training will then end, except that for the next six yearsthey will be called upon either to register once a year, or to attend what is called a muster parade. Is it not correct that for all practical purposes they will then be free from military service? Bill fails so utterly in that respect, and' that it does not provide for the continuation of these trainees in the militia. so far as I am aware, has not been embodied in any previous Bill. tleman has behind him a Parliament which is practically unanimous in favour of the training of our youth, and, subsequently, the young men of Australia, to such a reasonable extent as will make them effective defenders of their country. If he does not seize the opportunity, the blame must rest entirely with him and those directly behind him. What past Ministers of Defence may have proposed, or what future Ministers may suggest, is at this moment of no concern. I trust that the Minister will seize this favorable opportunity, for it may not offer again. We have yet to learn how the system of compulsory training will be received in the constituencies; and since there has been no overwhelming expression of opinion in favour of compulsory training, the Minister should avail himself of this opportunity of familiarizing the people with the proposal to build up an effective force. But just where every military man. They will assure the Minister that the real work of. a young man should begin, this Bill ends. We are to let the youths go after they have been merely played with for two years. The opinion of the Empire's greatest soldier need not be again read during this debate; it was aptly quoted yesterday by the honourable member for West Sydney, and should have some weight and influence with the Minister. He proposed a training of forty days in the first year, whereas this Bill proposes eight days' training for those nineteen years of age, and another eight days' training for those of twenty years of age. the prescribed trainingshall be, in the Citizen Force, sixteen whole days or their equivalent. Our youths are to remain in the Citizen Force for .two years, so that they will have eight days' training during each of those two years. sixteen days' training.",19,Defence Bill Second Reading

The night drills and the alleged half-day drills are merely a waste of time. The training must be given in whole-day drills.

Only after very grave consideration did Field Marshal Lord Roberts approve of so short a period of training as four months, and he, in arriving at that conclusion, had in view the fact that that training should, as far as possible, be carried out in camp. the Minister not to confuse night drills with real training, and not to suppose that if one-half of this period of sixteen days is to be devoted to squad drill on, small training grounds in various centres of population, our young men will secure an effective training. the four months' period of training only on condition that it should take place under the direction of members of the regular army-me n who had served from seven to fourteen years continuously, and had perhaps seen active service.

At that time he .is a mere youth, lacking stamina, perhaps lacking even a desire to become a soldier, and lacking the ability to do the work he will be called"" upon to da With his little training, he will be more amenace to the present militia than a service to the country. .As an indication of what is considered sufficient training in a country such as ours, where the people are the army, and. the army is' the people, we may glance for a moment at the training carried on in Switzerland. The Swiss soldier receives his training first in a school of recruits, which turns him out a trained soldier, fit to take his place in the ranks. This Bill is going to turn him out a fit soldier before he is a recruit. According to the Minister he is to be well trained, well drilled, and well everything else after he has had his second year's alleged training. member seriously say that a young man of eighteen, who has had four years' training, will not be as good as if he went through a recruit's course? the young man of eighteen who has had four or six years' training in the cadet corps will not come reasonably under the heading of a trained recruit. Because of my association with the military, I have watched with more than ordinary interest, and even with a; fatherly interest, the 1 cadets from the time of their inception, and I must say that, but for an exceptional case of a brilliant youth here and there, they will be, at eighteen, after their four years' training in the cadet corps, utterly unserviceable as soldiers, and only the beginning of the material out of which soldiers can be made. They will require from three to four years then in the militia, with from twelve to sixteen days' I ask training, before we ought to put them in the first or fighting line. agree with the honourable member. the Minister does not quote the experts. Lord Roberts approved of We on this side of the House are able, but only with a desire to improve the Bill, to quote experts to the contrary. I have been reading, in regard to the Swiss system, the report of Colonel Bridges, one of the best officers that we have had in Australia, and I regret very much that he should have been spirited away to England. His report is an excellent one.

What is the recruit course in Switzerland ? It used to be forty-seven days' continuous training, while the man was still a recruit and unfit ""to be put into the ranks of the first or fighting line. After many years of practical experience of that system, the Swiss Parliament recently raised the length of service from forty-seven to sixty-five days. All the military experts suggested seventy days, but Parliament made it sixty-five. Thus they increased the first year's course, when the lad was plastic and when he ought to be made into a soldier. Then, and then only, is he allowed to take his place in the militia or fighting force. But the Minister assures us now, and actually asserts that he has the opinions of experts to support the viewI should like to see those opinions-that after two periods of sixteen days in his nineteenth and twentieth years, the youth is to be turned out as a well-trained, well-drilled, well-disciplined and effective soldier. member keeps mixing things up in such a way that 1 cannot follow him. in a dilemma, ought not to make such interjections. He says that he has the opinion of experts to support the view that he enunciated when moving the second reading of the Bill. I hope my tone is not offensive, but may I suggest that if he maintains now a similar demeanour to that which he assumed when introducing the Bill, there will be a possibility of improving the measure, but that there will not be if his interForces, and he is incessantly complainjections are merely of a political character. After sixty-five days' training the man in Switzerland is turned out as a trained recruit. During the next few years he has to undergo seven annual trainings or repetition courses' of eleven days each, and five inspections of arms in the years that he has no annual training. After he arrives at the age of thirty-three, and from then until the age of forty, he has one annual training of eleven days, and seven annual inspections of arms of one whole day each. That is the Swiss system, arrived at after manv years of practical experience, and to which the whole nation cheerfully conforms --the only system which, in their opinion, can turn men out fit to undertake the duty of defending their country. I can reasonably put that, and the opinions expressed by Lord Roberts when moving the second reading of his Bill in the House of Lords, against the opinions of the Minister and of the experts with whose names he has not yet favoured us. member seriously suggest that I should tell him the name of every expert who has given me advice, so that he may begin to ""go for "" him? for "" any expert. If I were leaning in that direction-bu t I do not intend to take advantage of my Parliamentary position to do soI could, perhaps, castigate one or two; but it is the Minister's duty to find out which officers are valuable and which are not, which are self-seekers and which are devoting the whole of their lives to perfecting the forces; which change their views with every Minister who comes into power, and those to which personal advancement is far more important than the training and maintaining of an effective force. I do not intend to pursue inquiries in that direction, in the present circumstances, and, therefore, the Minister's gibe is in no way COOK -The honourable justified. The honourable member was asking for the names of experts, and I said it would not be fair to give names. Parliament ought to know by whom it is being guided. We need guidance in matters military. They have been in a condi tion of chaos for many years. There is on the Ministerial side but one member who has had practical experience of the Military ing, but, strange to say, he is to be silent on this Bill. When honourable member j asked yesterday if he intended to address himself to the measure, the reply was an emphatic "" No . "" The Defence Forces have been lacking in efficiency for years. It is no fault -of the men. It is no fault of the citizen soldiery or of the militia officers. Throughout every report and every statement we find references deprecating the inefficiency of the forces and their general lack of effectiveness for war purposes. Recently an ex-Minister brought a friend of his from Sydney to put everything right, and that gentleman's statement was that, although we had 23,000 militia, not 10,000 of them were fit for war.

Each young man will be called upon to spend an average of sixteen days per year, not in drill-rooms or on parade-grounds, but in local camps, devoted wholly and solely to continuous practical instruction. This Bill differs widely from that of the honourable member for Richmond, and is inferior to it. I wonder what the Prime Minister will say if called upon to defend it. speech on the other BillUltimately we may see the time arrive when, reckoning men under forty, we shall have 800,000 who are either in, or have passed through the ranks. We estimate that these men can be obtained, disciplined, drilled, and made efficient for ,Â£1,200,000, as against the present -defence expenditure of ^800,000. The present Minister purposes to create a force of 206,000 by expending a little over ,Â£500,000 more. I make the quotation to show how different are the proposals of the present Deakin Ministry, by reason of the influence of a section of the Fusion, from those of the former Deakin Ministry. Another matter to which I ' wish to refer is the need for taking our officers from the ranks. The officers should not be a class to themselves, or drawn from any particular section of the community. Our present force suffers from the way in which officers have been chosen because of their social importance. I have known men to be made officers without consideration of their military qualifications or training. Because of their position in society, they have been appointed to the exclusion of qualified men who did not move in the same circle. I have seen officers who could not sit a horse appointed to field rank. 1 have seen men in command who could no more exercise a mixed force than they could fly across the Channel without the help of a machine. Apparently, the Minister desires to continue this iniquity. According to the Age of 29th July, Dr. Barrett, speaking for a deputation from the Melbourne University, informed the Minister thatThe Council desired that if the Government instituted a system of compulsory military training the University of Melbourne should be enabled to form a separate corps. If , on the other hand, the Ministry did not propose compulsory training, the University desired a volunteer corps formed in its midst. There we have class distinction. member call the University a class instituing them in calisthenics, and in simple tion? Mr Roberts. the universities who are as democratic as is any honourable member of this House. professors term themselves Socialists, and, in politics, do not support the party of the honourable member. But 95 per cent, of our youths do not enter the universities, and, for the most part, the University Continuing my quotation from his students are drawn from; a small section of the community. If we permit the universities to have corps of their own, we shall be creating class distinctions, which should not be tolerated. Dr. Barrett went on to sayThe matter had been under discussion before, and some of the officers of the Department had suggested that the University should do something to train men for the duties of military officers. To that the Minister replied thatHe was glad to learn that their idea was to turn out as many officers as possible in connection with a University Corps. tinuedThe idea was that after the men had served two years, and passed their examinations, they should be appointed second lieutenants. To that the Minister replied that it was a very fitting thing. If the Minister's opinions are carried into effect, they will go a long way towards spoiling our Military Forces. He would create a class of officers who would not pass through the ranks, and would, therefore, not know or understand the men whom they would have to control. It is disheartening to men to be under the command of individuals who have been made officers, not because of their qualifications, but because of their social standing. The ability to command is not possessed solely bythose who have passed through the universities. I have known university men to be abject failures as officers. The ideas of the Minister are at variance with the democratic opinion of the community, and dangerous to the welfare of the forces. the inadequate proposals of the Government, may I suggest a scheme which I think reasonable, and which I hope will find favour with our military and educational experts.

From the ages of sixteen to nineteen, they should be drilled as senior cadets, uniformed, and armed with the ordinary rifles used by the militia. From the age of nineteen onwards, they should have four or five years' training in the militia. gradually disappear. Those who qualified for instructional work in the permanent forces might be kept, if they so desired. The militia would be recruited each year from the cadets who had reached the age of nineteen. Only those who had four or five years' training in the militia, should be deemed to belong to the first fighting line. The reserves should be called out long before the attempt to call out the boys. On reaching the age of nineteen years, the youths should pass into the militia for four or five years, and undergo from twelve to sixteen days continuous training every year. They should then pass into the first reserve for four or five years, and undergo from six to eight days training per annum. Only then shall we be able to say that we are reasonably training the male population of Australia to effectively defend it in time of need. I view with horror the idea of a standing army. I want to see the whole male population of our own countrytrained to effectively defend it should occasion arise. I want to see Australia a nation where the whole people shall be the army, and the army shall be the people, rather than a nation where the larger number shall be paying the few to do their fighting for them.

[Quorum formed.""] [4.25] -In common with most honourable members, and, J. believe, the people generally, I think it necessary that we should increase both our naval and military strength and efficiency. There are some [ l 6 ] -2 4 features of thisBill with whicb I disagree, and others with which I am in accord, but no one-no t even an immediate supporter of the Government-coul d be expected to approve of it as a whole. 1 do not wish to be charged with slavishly following the opinion of a particular newspaper when 1 express the opinion that we should take care to so frame this Bill that Thus the volunteers would it will not be possible for our shores to be left, at the will of the British Admiral on the Australian station, without the protection of at least & proportion of our fleet. As a matter of fact, I have previously expressed that view, and wish now to emphasize it. I recognise that a decisive blowstruck at the navy of the enemy in either the North or the China Seas would tend directly to the defence of Australia, and I do not deny that the powers that be in the Old Country would in time of war display some consideration for our safety. I am convinced, however, that during hostilities the defence of the most isolated parts of the Empire are not likely to be considered of such vital interest as is the defence of the heart or the home of the Empire itself. History must lead us to that conclusion. It would matter little to a nation if some of its outlying Dependencies suffered, provided that it won the day. We do not want to be made a scapegoat for the Empire, and we must take care that we shall have at all times here a navy sufficient to protect our shore from sudden raids. If in time of war one or two vessels of the enemy succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the British Navy they could make a raid on our coasts, shell many of our coastal towns and cities, and do immense damage. I repeat, therefore, that the House should take care that the Bill is so framed that no vessel of the Australian Fleet will be absent from our shores in time of war. Let me say, at the same time, that I am fully in agreement with the statement made by my leader on behalf of the late Government, that at all times the resources of the Commonwealth are at the disposal of the British Government. I should like to see more evidence of an intention on the part of the Government that the greater part of Australia's Navy shall be built in Australia. It may be said that we cannot construct warships here, but I hold a different view. I recently read in a Sunday newspaper published in Sydney a satirical article dealing with the statements of representatives of Victoria as to its ability to do certain",25,Defence Bill Second Reading
95,Mr Frazer,I think that we ought to,26,Defence Bill Second Reading
96,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"things. It suggested that if an eighty-ton . istry ought, therefore, to give effect to it. gun or a Dreadnought were wanted, Melbourne could, of course, supply it. But after all, if we desire to be able to build a Dreadnought, we must make a start, and the ill-timed sneers of the newspaper to which I have referred apply with equal force to New South Wales. Our desire is that we shall have an opportunity to make a start in this direction, so that we may be able thereafter tb provide locally for the construction of our own warships. I recognise that there is a majority in this House in favour of the local construction of our Navy, but that does not necessarily mean that it will be constructed here. Most of the vessels that are to form the fleet should be constructed here; and it is quite possible we should find, if we tried, that we could construct every one of them. A private firm would riot undertake to lay down the plant necessary to enable it to build these vessels, but Australia, having regard to its isolated position, must necessarily be self-sustaining, and the Government should undertake their construction. Even if they cost more, no one could complain. cost of one of these vessels is paid away for the Military Forces will be far better in wages. if the cost of constructing these vessels in well remember that whenever a small war the Commonwealth were greater than it broke out the supplv of clothing sent out would be in the Old Land, there would be to the troops was invariably of inferior no loss in the true sense of the word.

Unfortunately, many Governments in Australia are content to import what they want, not from Great Britain, but from foreign countries. It is strange, to say the least, that Government Departments, both State and Federal, should go out of their way to give a preference to imports from foreign lands. In Victoria, notwithstanding that it has been insisted that only Australian or British materials, shall be used by Government Departments, German brushware has been purchased by them, and we have heard of Federal Departments using imported materials when equally good Australian manufactures were available.

107,Mr Batchelor,"It is the only atenough money to give effect to them. It deserved the criticism which it received from the Opposition of the day. I admit the force of the speeches delivered by tbe honourable members for West Sydney and Adelaide regarding the present measure; but 1 think that the Minister has done well in not attempting too much. If we try to force the compulsory principle on the community before it is ready for it, there may be re-action, and the repeal of our legisbetter for our own defence. This should lation may follow. Buti f we commence with the training of cadets, we may establish a system which can afterwards be extended. I shall not make up my mind regarding the various amendments which have been proposed until I have heard them discussed. The Minister need hot fear criticism on party lines. Those who have already adversely criticised the Bill are members who have paid great attention to defence matters, and, perhaps, have studied them for a longer period than even he has done. Tf the Bill can be improved, ,as they suggest, party feeling should not be excited to prevent it. I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the measure. If he succeeds in carrying it through Parliament this session, he will have achieved something of which he should be proud. I do not profess to be an authority on defence, or to be able to speak positively regarding the details of the Bill; but, as the measure will greatly affect the social life of the community, and largely increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth, it must seriously engage the attention of all of us. I have, therefore, endeavoured to fortify myself by a study of the questions it involves, and intend now to express the opinions which are the result of my investigations. It may be safely asserted that Australia has no desire to be aggressive or defiant. What our community wishes for is a system of military training which will provide healthy exercise for our citizens, making them strong, vigorous men, and fittingthem for the defence of the Commonwealth, and the Empire of which it forms part, should we ever be attacked by a foreign foe. There is no warlike spirit abroad. Our military preparations are not prompted by the desire for blood, conquest, or glory. The Minister was disposed to discredit the military policy of the Fisher Government; but I do not think that he rightly voiced the wishes of Australia regarding its relations with the Mother Country in respect of defence. He made it appear that we wished to depend wholly on the Mother Country, that we have been shirking our obligations, and that the time has arrived when we should take our share of the task of defending the Empire. He seemed to forget that, in developing this great continent, we have'done as much for the Empire as we should have done had we spent our money on contributions to the Imperial Navy, or in providing be credited to us; and I believe that the Old Country will acknowledge that we have done good service for Australia and for the Empire. But, as an outpost of the Empire, this continent must be defended. In this community, there have been those who held that, for naval defence, at any rate, we should subsidize the British Navy, throwing the whole burden on Great Britain In accordance with that view, we, some time ago, ratified what is known as the Naval Agreement. Another section of the community thinks that Australia, in addition to providing for land defence, should give attention to coastal defence, and the defence of her commerce, which is valuable, not only to us, but also to the Mother Country. Those who hold the latter view were at one time spoken of as disloyal. They were represented as desirous of cutting the painter. Now, it is admitted that their policy is the right one. The honourable member for Lang and a few others still drag in the rear, but even the rank, and file of the Ministerialists, as a whole, are prepared to look at the matter from the point of view of those to whom I refer. Hence we have submitted to us a measure, not to subsidize the British Fleet, and to limit the Commonwealth control of defence, but to provide for a greater measure of defence than could be provided for at the outset of Federation, or was thought likely, a short time ago, to be provided for so soon. The Bill has been framed by those who were at one time disposed to adversely criticise the opinion that Australia should do more to defend itself. Many of its proposals have been advocated by the Labour .party, and formed part of a skeleton measure drafted for submission to Parliament. I shall assist the Government in carrying the measure, but, in saying so, do not wish to be charged with being desirous of promoting militarism. Although the nations of the world still spend enormous sums on armaments, and in devisingand purchasing the most destructive implements of warfare, there are to-day forces",29,Defence Bill Second Reading
108,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [5.5].,"which make mightily for peace. In modern times, communities are in closer correspondence than formerly. Should a disaster happen to-day in some remote part of the world, the news of it would to-morrow be flashed all over the civilized globe, exciting tbi sympathy' of far-distant people. This constant intercourse and fuller knowledge tends to promote peace among the nations, and there are still more potent factors. The sense of oneness of interest, irrespective of country, is growing among the toiling masses. As Cowper has saidwar's a game which, were their subjects wise,' Kings would not play at. In years gone by, it was the wearers of crowns, and those who surrounded them, who were responsible for the wars which desolated the earth. Of later years, the power of kings has diminished, but there have arisen kings of finance who, to increase their accumulations, have often lent themselves to the fomenting of disputes between nations. As the power of government gets more and more into the hands of the average man and woman, as social conditions improve, and the understanding between nations becomes clearer, national animosities and jealousies will disappear, while workers' combinations will be even a mightier power for the promotion of peace. International differences, instead of being settled by an appeal to the sword, will be settled by arbitration, and the appeal will be to justice and reason. That' being so I think the Commonwealth while making reasonable provision for its defence would do violence to its aspirations in the direction of peace, and to its ability to work out its own salvation, if it decided to so magnify militarism as to declare that a very large sum should annually be appropriated to these purposes. Amongst the most progressive of the nations of the Old World to-day militarism has become a kind of octopus which is drawing out their very life's blood. The breaking point, however, is not far of f . The masses of the people in those countries are being ground down and kept in poverty and degradation by this incubus. It is an expense which continues in time of peace as well as in time of war. It is .a means of consuming wealth without offering any adequate return. I am anxious that the Commonwealth and its free, '--berty-loving people should not have such Â«n experience as has fallen to the lot more particularly of Continental countries, and therefore, whilst holding that we should make provision for our defence, I think Mr Thomas Brown. that that provision should be within reason, and should not be burdensome upon the taxpaying portion of the community. It should be regarded more in the light of an insurance, and the interests which derive most benefit from it should be called upon to pay a fair share of its cost. than property. hear the honourable member give expression to that dictum, for in a good deal of our legislation property has been dealt with as if of more value than life. The Labour party desire to give both life and property their true value and importance, and to bring about, a change, in the condition of affairs which has obtained so long, that will mean a greater measure of equality and justice for the people. Whilst reasonable provision is made for the protection of life and property the whole burden of that protection should not fall as it does in the countries of the Old World -no t even excluding Great Britain-upo n the great toiling masses. At the present moment Great Britain is experiencing one of the greatest political struggles which the Empire has had to endure, and the object of the struggle is to secure greater consideration for human life than has hitherto obtained. We want to hold the balance evenly, and that is one reason why I consider that the Brisbane Labour Conference was wise in stipulating that a fair proportion of the cost of defence should be levied upon property. Military development in the Old World has been in the direction of creating a distinct caste. It has tended to draw men from the ordinary avenues of production and the civil walks of life, and to set them apart as a special class for warlike purposes. In that way there has been created a division presenting many aspects that we should endeavour to avoid. On the military side we have the man who despises the civilian, and thinks that he has nothing in common with him. He becomes practically a fighting machine, and the great purpose of his life is to be ready to obey orders. At the command of the authorities he is just as ready to turn his bayonet and musket on his fellow citizen as he is to turn them on an enemy. As the result of that system the dominant few have been able in the countries of the Old World to hold in check the great mass of the community. It is neither desirable nor necessary that that condition of affairs should be repeated in Australia. We need only to give to every citizen that measure of",30,Defence Bill Second Reading
109,Mr Bowden,Lif e is more valuable,31,Defence Bill Second Reading
110,Mr Thomas Brown,"I am glad totraining and military knowledge which will enable him to defend his country and become a fighting factor in the Empire. In acquiring that training he should not be drawn away from the ordinary avenues of production; his common citizenship .should not be destroyed, and he should still remain, so to speak, part and parcel of the community. If that be done, he will not feel that he is merely a fighting machine, having nothing in common with the civil section of the community. At the very outset the policy laid down in this Parliament was that we should encourage our citizen soldiery as against the professional side of our military system. We have endeavoured to do so, but the success .achieved has not realized our expectations. There are various reasons for this want of success, and one is that the administration of the Department in relation to the citizen .soldiery has not been all through in sympathetic hands. There has been manifested a feeling favorable to the Old World ideals; and everything has been done to promote the professional side, whilst numerous obstacles have been thrown in the way of the development of the citizen soldier. I need not cite instances in support of that statement. Cases in point are 'known to honourable members generally, nnd particularly to representatives of country electorates where people have been -struggling for years to secure permission from the Department to form squadrons of the Australian light horse. experience is that the authority of the Department has been against anything in the nature of a substantial development in that direction. _ I trust that the Minister, under this Bill, will see that the possibilities of developing our Detain. If this scheme will do something to fence Forces in the direction I have indicated will receive that consideration which they have .hitherto been denied. If he does, he will give expression to the desire of the people that the citizen soldier shall be developed as a means of defence, and he will certainly obtain in country districts been recognised in South Africa, and reliable material. It is not in the large -centres of population that the best material for our Australian light horse is to be -found. In large cities and towns those -who offer themselves for service in that -branch of our Defence Forces are engaged -in occupations which do not call for skilled -horsemanship. For the most part they keep a horse merely for exercise, and when hy reason of drought or other cause fodder becomes dear, they either sell it or turn it out. The result is that the efficiency of the city corps or sq Madrons cannot be maintained as.they should be. In country centres, however, men on farms and stations almost live in the saddle. Horses and saddles form part of their means of livelihood, and there the Minister will find the best material for his light horse. Hitherto the tendency of the Department has been to discourage the formation of squadrons of the Australian light horse in country districts, largely because of a belief that they could not be properly supervised or brought rapidly to the points at which they would be of service. During the South African war, however, our volunteers came mostly from rural districts. The best men offering undoubtedly came from the country, but this wide open field for securing defence material has been left unexploited. In one centre, in my electorate, a company was formed about six years ago, largely by men who had returned from South Africa, where they had seen active service, and had risen in the ranks, and desired to continue the military training they had received there. If the Department had specially set itself the task of determinedly resisting the registration and encouragement of that company, it could not have succeeded more successfully than it has done. Every obstacle has been thrown in its way, and, although ""on a railway line, it still remains unregistered. Despite the Our hostility of the Department, however, it is still able to carry on the regular course of training that it entered upon. This is an illustration of what can be done if something like elasticity and adaptation to Australian conditions is allowed to obencourage men in country centres to form themselves into companies' of light horse it will be welcomed, and I dare promise the Minister that he will find in such companies the best possible defence material. The value of this arm of thc service has should be recognised in every scheme of territorial defence. I do not regard compulsory training in the light of conscription such as obtains in some countries of the Old World. It can be made a useful means of giving our youth physical development, and will also be of value in teaching them the rudiments of training for defence purposes. By providing that the system of training shall commence with the boys at school, and that it shall continue to apply to them as they are compelled to go out 'into the world to earn their living, good work can.be done. At the same time, I do not think it would be wise to apply the compulsory provisions of the Bill to the whole of Australia. Judgment and reason must be exercised in their application. There are remote far-away centres where it would be a hardship to bring youths into touch with the centres where training is to take place. The Minister therefore would be well advised to ""gang warily "" in this connection, and to make these provisions apply where they can reasonably be made to. It would, however, be contrary to the desire to secure effective training if the Minister put these provisions in his Bill and at the same time did nothing to provide reasonable facilities for men to be trained. I hcjpe, therefore, that the proposal will not remain a dead letter, but that the spirit of the Act will find expression in its administration. I wish to congratulate the Government on their attitude on the question of naval defence. I understand that our naval unit is to be in spirit and in fact an Australian unit, maintained and controlled by Australia, and that in it Australia's sons will find .an opportunity for training and advancement. I see from an interview which the honourable member for Brisbane, who represented the Government at the Imperial Defence Conference in the Old Country, gave to the Review of Reviews, that the unit is to consist of one large cruiser of the Indomitable type, three cruisers of the Bristol type, six torpedo-boat destroyers, and three submarines, with a complement of 2,300 officers and men, and is to cost, on a liberal estimate, ,Â£750,000 per annum for maintenance. The honourable member for Brisbane, referring to the work of the Conference, saidThe result is very satisfactory. We did not perhaps get all we wanted, but still we did very well. Perhaps the Minister will take us into his confidence as to what the Government desired, but did not get, at the Conference. -However, it is satisfactory to know that so much was secured. The honourable member f<>r Brisbane was asked by Mr Stead, who interviewed himUnder this new scheme the Admiralty will save monev, will it not? And repliedYes; and in addition it will place at the disposal of the Admiralty a far more efficient fighting unit than the present Australian Squaddefence for Australia. ron. At present the upkeep of the Pacific fleet Mr Thomas Brown. probably costs the Admiralty from ,Â£800,000 to Â£900,000 a year. Towards this Australia pays Â£200,000. Great Britain will save Â£350,000 after giving Â£250,000 towards the upkeep and general cost of the new Australian Fleet. I should prefer not to lay any part of this burden on the Mother Country-no t even to the extent of the ,Â£250,000 per annum mentioned. I would prefer that Australia should provide all the money herself if she can manage to do so. If we found that it was not within the compass of our means at present, it would be better to reduce the total cost rather than to ask the Mother Country for a contribution. With respect to the allegations of the honourable member for Lang, that the members of the Labour party, who are working for the establishment of an Australian Fleet, are at heart disloyal to the Mother Country member would quote some of the speeches made from his side of the House upon the Naval Agreement. and voted against the Naval Agreement because I wanted an Australian Navy, but I defy the honourable member to charge me with disloyalty, or to prove any such charge from my speeches. honourable member.

The honourable member for Brisbane has been more generous in his treatment of Australian aspirations. Apparently similar -criticisms and innuendoes have found expression in the Old Country, because Mr for lifting this question out of the rut into Stead asked our representativePeople say that your new and independent Navy is only a preliminary step towards cutting the painter ? And he repliedThat is absurd. Such an idea is not seriously quite compatible with a spirit of Imperial -entertained by any true Australian. In fact, throughout the British Empire it is remarkable that the greater the independence and the freer the hand, the more loyal the Dominions become. In that I think the honourable member for Brisbane struck the key-note of the position. When the Mother Country gave us r full control of our territorial defence the fear was expressed that it would be inimi-cal to the best interests of the Empire, but it did not prove to be so. Those who talked in that fashion were false prophets. When the Labour party came forward with its programme of local naval control, similar croaking was heard and charges of disloyalty were made; but I am glad to learn that the special representative of the Fusion Government in the Old Country appreciated the real trend of Australian sentiment and patriotism, and was not afraid to say so. patriotism conflict with Imperial patriotism? that side to say, because some honourable members sitting there hold that it does. No honourable member upon this side believes it.

The expense should be reasonable, and we should insure that the taxpayer gets the best return for the money that he is asked to contribute for the purpose. rise to address myself to this Bill because the subject is important, and also because the conspiracy of silence upon the other side seems to have become chronic. honourable members on this side feel that it is a Committee Bill. that every Bill submitted by the Government is a Committee Bill. It is remarkable that they refuse to talk either upon the motion for leave to introduce a Bill or upon the motion for the second reading, no matter how important the subject may be. I can remember the time when only a hint on matters military was required to make the honourable member for Wentworth talk for hours at a stretch and give us the benefit of his extensive knowledge of 9.2 guns, and other scientific and practical aspects of the question. found that he does not understand the question. able member for Adelaide is right. Apparently, as the honourable member for Wentworth has grown older he has got more sense, and realized that amateurs should not interfere with important technical matters. He seems to have discovered that the less he says about defence the better it will be for him amongst the electors who happen to be members of our Defence Forces. NeitherI nor any other patriotic Australian can demur to the principal of compulsory training underlying this Bill, or deny the necessity for making provision for the defence of Australia in time of need, now that we know the scheme is to be strictly -upon Australian lines,"" and that in military as well as naval matters we are at last to give effect to the policy which the Labour party put forward in the early stages of this Parliament. jected to the expenditure of large sums of money on gold lace and frills. We objected to the Government spending money without having a definite scheme which would be of benefit to the people. Reference has been made by some honourable members to the views expressed by the Labour party on this question since the establishment of the Federal Parliament. The service rendered by the Labour party in cutting down the military vote at a time when no proposal for improving the system had been put forward speaks volumes for its patriotism. The present scheme would not be possible, had not that action been taken. Had the Labour party voted for the proposals of the Government of the day, a military system would have been perpetuated, which it would have been very hard to supersede by any more modem and more useful, organization. In the past, the man who has been ready to volunteer for the defence of his country has had to bear the whole burden; the man who has devoted his time and energies to the amassing of wealth"" has been ready to allow the volunteer to sacrifice his interests and, should the occasion call for it, his life. That iniquity is to be removed by the proposed system. I feel strongly that the rich as well' as the poor should help to defend the country. In the past it has been the poor who have faced the cannon's roar, and laid down their lives for their country, leaving their widows and children penniless, .or, where they have escaped death, who have had to accept, as the reward of their heroism, pensions amounting to a few paltry pence per diem. The people are now demanding that the sonsof the wealthy as well as the sons of the worker shall assist in defending the country, a claim the justice of which appeals to me as a Democrat. Unfortunately, however, under the financial scheme proposer} for our acceptance by the Government, which we have lately been discussing, the Commonwealth will be prevented from doingwhat has teen done by the Mother Country.

I should not have done so except that last week we had a representative of South The present very Australia praising the Northern Territory as if it were a second paradise, and a New South Wales representative, the honourable member for Gwydir, speaking of it as if it were almost a desert. I do not mean to say that a visitor who was there for. no more than twenty-two days can pretend to speak authoritatively with regard to the country. I shall not commit so gross an impertinence. But having visited the Territory and carefully studied all the information put before us, I am to that extent in a better position than are other honourable members who have not been there, since they can merely speak from what they have read. I do not think that it is necessary either to decry the country or to over-praise it. I feel very sorry indeed that the honourable member for Gwydir thought it necessary to give such an unfortunate description as he did of any part of Australia. My visit to the Northern Territory completed my round of the States. I hare travelled through Australia as far as a man could consistently with attention to his duties as a member of Parliament, and to his own business in life I was glad to have the opportunity of seeing this northern portion of Australia. I may say at once that the travels of the party which I accompanied, included a visit to the Victoria River, going up to Timber Creek and Shaw's Creek, and also forming an acquaintance with the country adjacent to the Douglass, the Adelaide and Katherine Rivers and Brock's Creek.

The land seemed to be well grassed, and, what to me was particularly refreshing, great rivers which run throughout the whole of the north. rivers, and the Northern Territory possesses rivers. At no time is one at any great distance from a fresh water lagoon or a fresh water stream. That seemed to me to be the best feature of the Territory. the honourable member go ? I think, the furthest distance we went into the country. able member go as far as Pine Creek? Brock's Creek. I confess that I expected to see something altogether different. I had made up my mind that I was going to see a desert, with plenty of sand. But I saw nothing of the sort. My ideas as to what the Northern Territory was like were absolutely changed in the most favorable direction. I am convinced that the Northern Territory has a great future. But the question which I frequently asked myself was-Ho w is it that the white population is increasing so slowly? Before we attempt to answer that question we must remember, in the first place, that the future of the country is now pretty well assured, even if the Commonwealth dees not take it over and develop it. If South Australia continues to hold the Territory, great as the tax may be upon her resources, it will, I believe, prosper. It has now turned the corner. A few years ago, I was told, the pastoralists could get no more than Â£ 2 per head for their cattle. But recently well-establishedfirms-Messrs. Durack and O'Conor, Messrs. Kidman Brothers, and Messrs. Forrest Emanuel and Co have been competing to such an extent that the pastoralists can get from seven to eight guineas per head for their cattle. therefore, that the first step towards the settlement of the country has been made. Pastoralists are spreading over the Territory. Mr Justice Herbert, whom I regard as a very fine public servant, is also doing his best with enthusiasm and energy. He has so much faith in the future of the country that he has put his own two sons on to a small pastoral station. Perhaps the best evidence of a man's faith iri a country is that he puts his own family and money into it. l n fact, as the Territory has reached the stage of prosperous pastoral development, the industry of cattle rearing may now be considered to be established on a firm basis. The next industry deWhat Australia wants is manding consideration is that of mining. I saw plenty of tin mines, but it seemed to me that they were being worked in rather a spasmodic manner. I saw also copper mines into which English capital had been put, but it looked as if too much money had . been spent on such things as pianos, library, music-rooms, and billiard-rooms, and all sorts of expensive things rather _ than in serious attempts to extract minerals from the earth. It is not wonderful that under such circumstances the shareholders have ceased to pay calls, and leases have been abandoned. But I met there Mr Playford, a son of ex-Senator Playford, who is the mining warden, and who has a thorough belief in the future of the Territory from his own point of view. We were told of certain paying mines, but what struck me more forcibly than anything else in this connection was that every one connected with the mines .seemed to be anxious to get out of.them. That was certainly a feature that I did not like. As to agriculture, many places were pointed out to us along the rivers which were described as great rice-growing '. areas, where tropical culture could be highly developed. This leads me to mention another great Australian public servant. I refer to Mr Nicholas Holtze, who is carrying on Tropical Botanical Gardens at an expenditure which seems ridiculously low to us who are apt to fancy that a public servant cannot do work unless he has a large amount of money at his back. I believe that Mr Holtze carries on his work with, about ^250 a year, with the assistance of certain prison labour. He has been able to show that it is possible to develop all kinds of tropical productions in the Northern Territory; and what he has been able to do is marvellous conI t seems to me, sidering the small resomces at his disposal. Mr Holtze has a firm belief that the Territory is capable of great agricultural development. The question arises, however, whether it is possible to carry on tropical agriculture by means of highly paid white labour, which I think it is admitted is the only labour which can be allowed in the Northern Territory. But having said all this about the country, having admitted that it is no",38,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill Second Reading

188,Mr Crouch,"No, only as far asmean part of Australia, and that indeed it is a country of which we can feel as proud as we are of any other part of the Commonwealth, I nevertheless intend to vote against parts, unless, indeed, the Prime Minister the second reading of this Bill. 1 will explain why. I understand that one reason why the Prime Minister entered into this agreement with South Australia was largely his desire to bring immigration into the northern parts of the country. The Prime Minister felt, I understand, that being blocked in any attempt to introduce immigration into other parts of Australia, because of the inability of the States to meet his desire to supply immigrants with land, he should do his best to people the north. That, at any rate, was one of the reasons which the Prime Minister gave for asking this Parliament to ratify the agreement. Another reason was that the Prime Minister considers it desirable that the Northern Terout by means of assisted passages were ritory should be peopled by the white race as a safeguard against the yellow races. Indeed those are the only reasons which could, actuate the Prime Minister in going out of his way to select the Northern Territory rather than any other part of the north of Australia for development by the Commonwealth. We have to realize that if we take over the Territory it will mean a large .expenditure for some years to.come; because the financial side of the matter is the most important which the Commonwealth has to .face. Nevertheless, the financial aspect is secondary to two other considerations which I have mentioned-namely , making provision against danger from the yellow .races and settling the' north with a white population. I do not know that either of those results will be brought about. The experience of the Southern States of the TJnited States shows that the tropical regions were developed gradually, only after the white race had filled the temperate parts. We can expect no different course of development in Australia. So long as immigrants can find room iri the jtemlperate parts, such as New South. Wales, Western Australia-wher e recently an area as large as France has been shown to have a rainfall of 23 inches, and where what was regarded as the desert is (receding before settlement every year-and there is still land open for settlement in Queensland,_ it will be against the tendency of the white race for them to go to semi-tropical or tropical . parts of this continent. fore, cannot expect to people the tropical regions of Australia with the white race for some time to come. That can only take place gradually, as population overflows from the temperate proposes to bring out immigrants to the Northern Territory, on condition that they stay there for a certain number of years. Nothing, however, could be more repugnant to British instincts than compulsion of that kind. If immigrants entered into such an agreement, they would afterwards feel that the country to which they had been brought was the one from which they most ardently longed to get away. placed in every Land Act in Australia. ago Queensland introduced immigrants under similar conditions. Those who came not allowed to leave Queensland within a certain period. more than half of them gradually came South. because the compulsory residence condition was most irksome. Although Queensland offered at that time, as I believe she does now, the greatest inducements to immigrants-and , personally, I think that she will yet be the greatest of the Statesand although those immigrants would have, perhaps, done best to stay there, they immediately tried to get away because of that galling condition. were imprisoned for leaving there. the Government had that power. and brought back. firms what I have said. We cannot get people to go to the Northern Territory voluntarily until the temperate parts of Australia overflow, and we cannot send them there under compulsion to stay for a certain length of time. Such a system of immigration would do the Northern Territory no good, and would be doomed to failure. Let us ascertain what future the Northern"" Territory is likely to have. I believe the pastoral industry is firmly established, and that it will be followed We, thereby the settlement of agriculturists in suitable districts, as soon as there is a market, because we are told that the soil is",39,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill Second Reading

We cannot get men to take up small holdings unless than they can be assured of a market for their produce. turists are now pouring into Western Australia, because the gold-field centres have provided the necessary markets. Agriculture in the early days of Victoria followed the mining inrush. The runs were cut up, and the small farmer appeared in areas which, it had been previously claimed, could only carry sheep. One of the great advantages which Australia has is the existence in every State of a mining community which provides a market for agriculturists. They settle and prosper, and afterwards band together to export their produce even if the mining industry goes down. I think that the future development of the Northern Territory lies in that direction. The pastoral industry *s established already.

But after the great Agriculcompliment which has been paid to meevidently I am a man whom the House delighteth to hearI do not feel inclined to emulate the honourable member for Gwydir and make a speech lasting for nine hours and forty minutes. In every State of the Commonwealth, the development of agriculture has followed the discovery of gold or other precious metals. That has been particularly noticeable in Western Australia, whither large numbers were attracted by the discovery of gold at Coolgardie and in other parts of the State. Agriculture is at present impossible in the Northern Territory, because of the absence of a market for produce grown there. The development of the Territory can best be commenced by the vigorous exploitation of its mining resources. Parties of working miners, as in Papua, should be sent out to make discoveries, and geologists and other experts should also be engaged in a search for deposits of gold, copper, tin, and other metals. We have been told by the mining warden there that the country is highly metalliferous, and were payable deposits of gold, tin, or other metals to be found, pastoral and agricultural development would follow close upon the enterprise of The House divided. the miner. I shall vote against the second 4 reading of the Bill, because I do not think 37 it is in the public interest that the Commonwealth should take over this Territory. 33 We cannot force its development.

I agree with the honourable member for Corio that the Northern Territory is to be developed by the efforts of the prospector. Undoubtedly it has great mining possibilities. state of our finances, we can hardly undertake the enormous responsibilities imposed by the agreement, which, in my opinion, is one-sided and undesirable. However, if it be possible to modify it by amending the Bill in Committee, I am disposed to consider it further. I cannot imagine that the South Australians ever expected to secure all that they ask for. Sooner or later the northern parts of Australia will have to be dealt with differently from the more temperate areas, because of the great difference in conditions. Possibly the Commonwealth will have to establish a tropical State or Territory. member advocate the employment of coloured labour there? a White Australia as is any honourable member. But the development of our tropical regions requires the consideration of their special conditions. If white labouris asked to do hard work there, our children, and children's children who go there, may become more and more feeble, until .the enervation produced by the climate has quite incapacitated them. The policy of a White Australia means more than merely populating the continent with persons possessing white skins. Our aim must be to rear a virile and robust white race. in the cane fields, in a climate as hot as that of the Northern Territory. determined. The agreement cannot be .adopted in its present form. I fail to see what justification our South Australian -friends have for making such an offer. The Commonwealth is not ready for the -transfer, and has many functions which it is not yet required to exercise. The suggestion that has been made to raise trie -southern boundary line is certainly a good one, but the proposal that the Commonwealth should accept obligations in connection with railways in the Northern Territory, and take over liabilities with regard to the payment of debts and compound interest on expenditure is unreasonable, however meritorious it may be from the point of view of bargaining. thought that the agreement was a good one. In the present unsettled negotiations for the transfer of the Territory he doubtless thought that there would be a speedy settlement of the financial relations of the States and the 'Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is at present quite unequal to the burdens which it is asked to carry in this respect, and will not be prepared to shoulder them until the whole financial problem is settled. I am sure that honourable members .generally are glad that the honourable member for Kooyong has so far recovered from his recent illness as 10 be able once more to address the House. I cannot quite follow the position taken up by him, howhonorable ever, with regard to the development of the Territory. The honourable member said that he was strongly in favour of a White Australia, but that the tropical regions required to be developed under special conditions. He declared that he would be sorry to see white men and white women working in those regions, and since he is also opposed to the introduction of coloured labour it is difficult to understand how he would develop the Territory. tempted to develop it would become physically degenerate. member also thinks it would be wrong to introduce coloured labour, the outlook for the Northern Territory would appear to be somewhat gloomy. He did not find fault with the action of South Australia, but he suggested that the Government of that State had got much the better of the bargain, and had been extremely successful in the negotiations for the transfer. He did not particularize those points of the agreement with which he disagrees, nor did he tell us what kind of agreement would, in his opinion, be fair.

210,Mr Batchelor,"But the honorbecause he did not think the Territory should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I followed him closely, and he certainly seemed to make out an excellent case for the transfer of the Territory. white men and children were doing well there. totally different reasons he arrived at precisely the same conclusion as did the honourable member for Kooyong. As a South Australian and a supporter of this Bill, I feel that the House generally, whilst showing a prejudice against some of the provisions of the agreement, has, with one or two exceptions, dealt fairly with the Territory. It is unfortunate that honourable members should either laud the Territory to the skies or seek to depreciate its value and importance. I listened with regret to the speeches made by the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Gwydir, both of which suggested.an intense prejudice against the Territory and everything connected with it. The objections raised by the honourable member for Denison showed an entire want of knowledge of the Territory on his part. The honourable member said, for instance, that it was no country for white men, and that it was waterless and arid. That was a most extraordinary statement to make, having regard to the figures which have been supplied by the Government Meteorologist, and which prove conclusively that the Northern Territory is absolutely the best watered part of Australia. The area of the Northern Territory with an average rainfall of less than io inches is only 6,300 square miles, as against 81,144 square miles in New South Wales, 135,600 square miles in Queensland, 306,663 square miles in South Australia, and 408,300 square miles in Western Australia. The area with an average rainfall of from 10 to 20 inches in the Northern Territory is 213,430 square miles, and in Victoria 36,300 square miles. Then, again, we find that in the Northern Territory there is an area of 96,790 square miles with an average rainfall of from 20 to 30 inches, and that it has an area of 120,600 square miles with an average annual rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches, as against 58,700 square miles in Queensland, 39,100 square miles in Western Australia, 20,414 square miles in -New South Wales, and 18,770 square miles in Victoria. Territory has also an area of 86,500 square miles with an average annual rainfall of over 40 inches; Queensland 47>5oo square miles, New South Wales 14,541 square miles, Victoria 4,914 square miles, and Tasmania 9,424 square miles. These figures clearly show that the Territory is marvellously well watered. In Australia, only land with a rainfall of between 5 and 6 inches may ibe described as waste country, and in the Northern Territory no such area is to be found. There is not a foot of land there where the rainfall is insufficient to permit of successful pastoral occupation, and there are only a few thousand miles of country with too small a rainfall to permit of the growth of cereals. I do not suggest that the rainfall throughout the Territory occurs at the right time for cereals, but it is certainly magnificently watered. Any one who has travelled : for a distance of 200 or 300 miles south from Port Darwin knows that every few miles running streams or lagoons are to be encountered. There is no better watered territory to be found in Australia. Capital site area. the Northern Territory, has suffered by reason of statements as to its being a. waterless country. The honourable member for Gwydir drew an extraordinary picture, which had certainly nothing to do with the Territorv, or any other part of Australia. The honourable member was one of a Parliamentary party which visited the Northern Territory, but had no opportunity to see the country. Nearly aU those honourable members who went to the Northern Territory-wit h the exception of four or five, who went on a riding trip from the Katherine River to the Dalysaw nothing of the country at any great distance from the railway line. Those who merely travelled along the Pine Creek railway certainly saw very little to justify them in believing that there was much fertile land in the part that they visited. The reason for that is that the railway, front Port Darwin to Pine Creek runs along the mountain ridge, so as to keep clear of floods. The country has a very heavy rainfall, and the desirableness of keeping the line out of the reach of flood-water is obvious. But in no part of Australia canthe country be judged from a railway line running along a ridge. It must be recollected that the Northern Territory is a The Northern huge tract, constituting nearly one-fifth of the entire continent of Australia.

214,Mr Batchelor,"That area, likeimmense area there are all kinds of soils and climates. It is absurd for anybody who has merely travelled in a railway train along a straight line for 100 miles and gone back on the same route, to talk about what he has seen, or to describe a country, comprising 500,000 square miles, from the small area inspected in so cursory a fashion. tion has been asked-Ho w is it, if the Northern Territory is so valuable, that South Australia has not been able to develop it, and that the white population is not increasing ? It is very difficult to give an answer to a question like that. answer will account for the facts. In the first place, it must be remembered that the tropical areas of Australia are necessarily less rapidly developed than are the temperate areas. The British race naturally "" takes on "" the places which can be most rapidly developed. That factor has had a great deal to do with retarding settlement in the Northern Territory. Another consideration is that there have been frequent attempts to introduce coloured labour. The Territory had the reputation -as had Northern Queensland until quite recently-of being a coloured man's counsons, who preceded Judge Herbert, was a strong believer in coloured labour, and reported over and over again that the Territory could only be developed by such means. South Australia appointed a Royal Commission which came to the same conclusion. journey to the North, pronounced a similar view. Ex-Senator Playford, not very long ago, declared that the Territory could only be developed with coloured labour, and he actually went over to India with the object of inducing natives of that country to come to Northern Australia. But the South Australian Parliament determined to keep the place for the white race. The consequence is that that State is now offering to the Commonwealth a Territory in which there is no racial trouble. Admittedly it would have been much easier for South Australia to bear the burden, had she chosen to accept the advice of many people, who considered that coloured labour was essential. Honourable members ought to recollect that it is largely on account of the constant attempts to introduce coloured labour, and the possibility that at any time these attempts might succeed, that the development of the country has been retarded. A chance majority in the House of Assembly would have had the effect of introducing coloured labour. Had there been in power a Government bold enough to take this step, the same result would have followed. It has for many years been within the power of any Government in South Australia-that is, until the passing of the Immigration ReThe quesstriction Act by the Commonwealth-to introduce coloured labour. An Act for the purpose has been on the South Australian statute-book for nineteen years. But it has never been enforced. No one in mind to the everlasting credit of South Australia. still that is one important reason why the country has not been developed. There has always been a state of uncertainty.. White people realized that they might some day have to compete with coloured labour, and no man in his senses would take up land there with that possibility in view. On the other hand, capitalists would not be inclined to invest money in a country, when there was always the hope that next year, or a year or two later, they might be able to import coloured labour, and work their properties more cheaply. Again, although prospectors have frequently been on the point of making important mineral discoveries, the stage of carrying mining development to any great depth has not yet been reached. The one exception is Mount Governor le Hunte, after a Wells. But we must not judge of the mining possibilities of the Northern Territory, from what has happened in the past. For many years, Western Australia-the Cinderella of the group, as she was called -wa s apparently as impossible of development in this respect as the Northern Territory is to-day. Prospectors had frequently passed over areas which have since been discovered to be marvellously rich in gold. The history of Australia teems with the names of men who crossed such rich mineral areas as Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie, and Coolgardie, without making discoveries. It is idle to suppose that because no rich gold mines or other mineral deposits have been discovered in. the Northern Territory so far, the wealth of the country has been properly exploited. Much could also be said with regard to the possibilities of agricultural development. process will make large portions of the Territory available for cultivation.",43,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill Second Reading

The honourable member for Kooyong suggested that she was making an excellent bargain, but the truth is that she is offering the 'Commonwealth one-fifth of the territory of Australia, consisting of virgin land, free from racial difficulties, and difficulties of climate or accessibility, as has been made, to pretend to develop such as beset the greater part of the unoccupied areas of the habitable globe, for what it has actually cost her. country of great possibilities, comprising the best-watered part of the Commonwealth, and certainly not worn-out, exhausted land.

Downs, and the Adelaide River plains may be as valuable as the Darling Downs, although I do not know that they are capable of being so readily cultivated. The extent of this area is not often appreciated, but it is an immense territory, and is offered to the Commonwealth for the actual cost of the development that has taken place. I do not think that South Australia is asking anything unfair, or trying to induce the Commonwealth to pay for its bad bargain. It is true, as the honourable member for Corio has said, that South Australia could What she develop the' Territory herself, but the money which she can afford to expend upon it would not permit of its development being so rapid as it would be if it were taken over by the Commonwealth. We need a more rapid development than the honourable member for 'Corio suggests, if the idea underlying the transfer-that it should be peopled as a defence against attacks by Eastern nations-is to be realized.

If the agreement is not accepted, or if proposals are made to vary it, South In that sense, the honourable Australia will cheerfully shoulder the burden herself. She does not believe that she has run a hard bargain with the Commonwealth. On the contrary, the people of South Australia, almost without exception, believe that a fair offer is being made, and one which, in the interests of Australia, the Commonwealth should accept. They are not prepared to hand over the Territory under conditions that would preclude them from participating in its future development, and no proposal, such the Territory by running a railway.at the nearest possible point out of it, will be It is a accepted by them. When representatives of South Australia say that if this opportunity is not accepted, the Territory will not be offered again, they do not desire to make anything in the nature of a threat. I honestly believe that if this agreement be rejected, South Australia will not make a further offer, and my great fear is that pressure of circumstances will bring about the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek on the landgrant system.

Although we heard so much about what the soil would produce, we could not get a piece of meat fit to eat; we could not obtain a bit of fresh butter, but had to consume butter imported in tins; we could not get a drop of fresh milk, but had to be served with condensed milk; we could not get a fresh vegetable; nor could we get any but imported fruit. Even at the hotels, which possessed large areas of land, they did not attempt to cultivate so much as a vegetable patch. These facts speak volumes as against the rosy-coloured statements made by local inhabitants regarding the wonderful productivity of the soil, on whicli we could not detect the sign of a blade of grass or even of common varieties of weed. of the country, we have the remarkable fact that the revenue on the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek has dropped in the course of a very few years from .Â£3,000 to ,Â£400 ..per annum. These figures show that instead of population being attracted to the Territory the people who have gone there have not remained. We learned that even the Chinese population, who are always the last ' stickers'' in any place, and who can live 1 where other people cannot, are leaving the Territory. A statement was made by the honourable member for Wakefield in refutation of an assertion by the honourable member for Parkes, relating to the loss on the Oodnadatta line. The honourable member for Parkes said that the loss was about ,Â£80,000 per annum. The honourable member for Wakefield corrected him, and said that the loss was between ,Â£60,000 and ;Â£8o,ooo. I find, however, on turning to a report of a speech in the South Australian Parliament by Mr O'Loughlin, the Minister in control of the Northern Territory, that he said, as reported on page n of the pamphlet:That line, being only a portion of a trunk line, naturally did not pay, and South Australia was losing on the line alone to the extent of between Â£80,000 and Â£90,000 a year. So that we have it acknowledged by the South Australian Minister responsible for the Territory, that the loss on the line is from ,Â£80,000 to ,Â£90,000 a year-no t ,Â£60,000 as the honourable member for Wakefield said. I do not doubt the sincerity of the representatives of South Australia when they state their belief as to the possibility of developing the Territory. Nor do I doubt the sincerity of their desire to serve the best interests of their State by inducing the Commonwealth to take it over. But when they tell us that we must accept this agreement in its entirety and without any modification, regarding it as South Australia's irreducible minimum, and assure us that this magnificent offer will not be made again unless we snap at the present chance, I reply that they are overdrawing the picture and protesting altogether too much. I venture to add that there are other reasons which actuate the people of South Australia in their desire to rid themselves of the cost of developing this Territory, which has proved such a white elephant to them. As to the development tion ! What does the honourable member say animated them? member questions it I will not offer it as my own view, but will quote a concrete expression of opinion by Mr O'Loughlin. He puts the matter in this wayTo us it appears that the relief from the burden of the unprofitable railway to Oodnadatta, added to the assumption by the Commonwealth of the responsibilities for the Northern Territory deficit, is one of the strongÂ»st points in the compact. If we are to believe honourable members representing South Australia in this House, they are only anxious for us to refuse to take over the TerritoryThe sum of Â£82,000 per annum saved by this bargain will be available to pay interest on loans required for the construction of other railways in the State. Let me deal now with the question of the suitability or desirableness of the Northern Territory as a place of residence for a .white population. I am a firm believer in developing all our resources by means of white labour, but as against the opinions and word-pictures of representatives of South Australia in this House who have not resided in the Territory, I should like",49,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill Second Reading

263,Mr Johnson,"If the honorableto set another picture drawn by a resident of over thirty years' standing. Mr C. J. Kirkland, who presided at the banquet given to the Governor General and members of the Federal Parliament, is reported in the Nortliern Territory Times and Gazette of 7th June, 1907, to have ' saidNo matter what arguments may be brought forward going to show the healthiness of the Territory as compared with other tropical countries, the fact remains that throughout the greater part of the year the climate is oppressively hot; that, with few exceptions, those resident here are living in hopes of some day being in a position to remove themselves to a more temperate climate; and that there is not, and never-has been, any general desire to take advantage of ihe inducements offered. under the most liberal land laws to settle on the land and form permanent homes here. seem a pessimistic view, but it is the position ns it presents itself to me after nearly 30 years residence here. with him. He was a noted croaker. speech he tried to soften down that pessimistic view by saying that perhaps under different conditions, when the Commonwealth took the Territory over, and the population increased-as if the mere fact of the Commonwealth taking it over would have such a result-residenc e there might be made more tolerable, but that that remained to be proved. I saw when in the Territory a girl employed by the Governor of the gaol, in the capacity of nurse. We were told that she had come out from England a couple of years before, and that when she arrived she was a fine, healthy, buxom, rosy-cheeked girl. When we saw her we could not possibly imagine that at any period of her existence she had answered to such a description, for she was emaciated, pale, attentuated, and anaemic. That was the effect upon her of two years' residence in that "" magnificent '' climate. We are told that we must take the Territory over on the terms of the agreement or lose all chance of dealing with it. I realize that it might be advisable for the Commonwealth, for national reasons, to accept the transfer, but certainly not upon the terms proposed by South Australia. The Commonwealth is not in a position to saddle itself with the responsibility of a large expenditure for the construction of railways which are not likely to pay for the next fifty years. It is not at present in a position financially to borrow money and incur an enormous annual interest burden for non-paying lines. The honourable member for Wakefield painted a beautiful picture of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta -He said it was a magnificent work, consisting of splendid steel rails which had been laid for a number of years, and were really better now than when first laid down. All of which, on its face is the purest nonsense. He asserted that trains travelled over the line at about 40 miles an hour. The course must be very straight, and the road very level for such a speed to be at all safe on such a narrowgauge railway. At any rate, on the Pine Creek railway it takes from 8 o'clock in the morning until after 5 o'clock in the evening to accomplish a distance of about This may 145 miles. Nobody can call that a terrific rate of speed. I do not profess to be an authority upon soils, but when in the Territory I was accompanied by members who claim to understand that subject thoroughly and they had a very poor opinion of the soil capabilties of the country that we passed through. There are some patches of country further inland which are, however, very suitable for pastoral purposes. able member go to see any land? beyond the terminus of the railway because the country was apparently so poor that they could not raise enough horses for even the small party that accompanied me. honourable member went down the line at night and came up next day? daylight, stayed over night and travelled back next day. No one would want to stay there longer. There was nothing to do but stare, at ant-hills. I had been staring at them all day long, and I saw them all the way back next day. One can get too much even of ant-hills. No one can deny that the coastal areas are oppressively hot, and that the temperature is steamy either in mid-winter or midsummer. There is said to be a more temperate area further inland, lying between the headwaters of the Roper, Adelaide, Fitzmaurice, and Victoria Rivers, but even that is in a sub-tropical climate, similar, as I am informed, to that obtaining at Bourke, Cobar, Nyngan, and Broken Hill, and at Kalgoorlie in the summer time.

Probably something could be done in that way, if railways were made from districts like those in which the Wave Hill and Victoria Downs stations are situated to the nearest ports, and there was also regular steam-ship communication between those ports and other countries, which at the present there is not. But, in my opinion, Queensland would always be able to compete successfully in the meat industry against the Northern Territory, because she has, already constructed and in use, railways from the interior to ports at which steamers call regularly, while the competition of several lines keeps down freights. Although honourable members describe the Northern Territory as in every way fitted for settlement, and crying out for population, no one seems to wish to go there. Its existence has been known to the civilized world for centuries, and yet it still remains a vast empty space. Were it what it has been described to be, the early settlers would have made known its possibilities to their friends, and a steady tide of immigration would have set in. Its present condition of emptiness of population gives an opportunity to those who believe in the Socialistic State to take possession of it, and create in it a separate self-governing State, inviting there the 6,000,000 Socialists which there are said to be in the world, to develop it, under a. system of government of their own.

Question resolved in the affirmative. POST AND TELEGRAPH (RECORDING MACHINES) BILL. Debate resumed from 12th October (vide page 4406), on motion by Sir JOHN That this Bill be now read a second time. [10.28] -In my opinion, the recording machines whose use it is proposed to legalize can be tampered with, and thus great loss of revenue may ensue. difficulty migh't be got over by allowing them to be used under the supervision of an official, at the General Post Office or local offices. All the advantages claimed for their use could thus be obtained, and the possibility of fraud prevented. While it may be true that the machine tried by the Department of External Affairs seemed to do all that is claimed for the invention, that does not prove that fraud could not be committed were one used without the supervision of a Government official. been in use in New Zealand for some years. have been, and fraud may not have been perpetrated there, although the possibility of fraud in New Zealand is as great as it is here. has been detected should be a good argument in support of the Bill. use for only a little more than twelve months, so that there has not been much opportunity for frauds to be perpetrated in connection with it. no fraud has been discovered in connection with its use does not prove that it cannot be manipulated. There was once in use in America a voting machine which was said to be absolutely perfect. The inventor, who declared that it could not lie,, was offered a big premium to prove that it could be manipulated, and he replied that I have alif the premium were made large enough he might be able to do something in the desired direction. It was made large enough, and he then showed that in the hands of a man who understood its mechanism the maI chine could be made to lie. And so with this machine. It might be so manipulated as to occasion a great loss of revenue. I believe that the inventor, in reply to the criticism that has been offered, points out that we are now using in the Department a stamp that might easily be produced by any ordinary printer, but that no fraud has yet occurred in connection with it. That is certainly a very strong argument, but there is only one answer to the criticism that has been offered, and that is that these machines should be under official control and observation. If the Minister caused them to be available for use in a public Department, bundles of letters could be brought there to be stamped, and the work would be carried out just as readily as if The the machines were distributed amongst warehouses or other business establishments. If they were kept in a Government office and under Government supervision, they could not be tampered with. I believe, however, that under the present arrangement that could not be done, but some agreement might, perhaps, be made by which the machine could be given a fair trial under offiqial supervision. I shall support the Bill as introduced by the Minister, believing that, since he is willing to take the responsibility for the introduction of the machine, I should not stand in his way. think that the honourable member for Robertson would find rather impracticable his proposal that all the machines should be placed in a central office under the supervision of the Postmaster-General. machine of its value. the inconvenience to the user which would result, the Department itself would be put to considerable expense in housing the machines.

There is danger of fraud, however, in connection with almost every new device. The honourable member for Robertson has himself pointed out that stamps can he printed on envelopes by almost any printer, and that there is, therefore, room for fraud in connection with their use. But the reward of fraud in this case would be so trifling that no man would jeopardize his liberty and reputation for the sake of securing it. Just as no man risks his liberty and his reputation by causing stamps to be printed on envelopes by a private printer, so I think that no reputable firm-and it may be apprehended that none but a reputable firm would be permitted to use these machines-woul d risk its .reputation by endeavouring to manipulate one of them. a reputable firm? issued only to firms of established reputation. Some institutions require as many as seven, and they would scarcely abuse their trust seeing that, if fraud were practised, they would be at the mercy of their employees. In exoneration of the action of the Minister in inviting the House to resume to-night the consideration of this measure, I desire to say that it was at the request of myself and several other honourable members that he did so. It is not a controversial measure, and I did not think there would be any objection to passing it to-night and getting it off the business-paper. gentlemen who are interested in the patent are ready to proceed with the manufacture of the machines in the Commonwealth, and in that way employment will be found for a considerable number of men. .being so, by delaying the passing of the Bill we shall only stand in the way of the establishment of the industry. If we can do anything to facilitate its establishment at once rather than run the risk of a mishap that might prevent its continuation here, we shall do well. The Government are in no wise blamable for the action they have taken, and I hope that the House will recognise that this, being a non-contentious measure, should be passed without delay. The machine has been tried in New Zealand, where it has worked satisfactorily, and it has the approval of the responsible officers of the Postmaster-General's Department. had an opportunity to examine this machine carefully, and it seems to me that provision has been made to guard against the revenue being defrauded in any way by its use. The Postmaster-General has acted wisely in proposing its introduction. have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] chine will put a stop to the petty frauds that are sometimes committed by . junior clerks in charge of stamps in big offices. Youngsters are continually being dismissed from their employment and sometimes put on trial for frauds in connection with stamps placed under their control, or for the misappropriation of money given them to pay for telegraphic messages. The machine has been tried and. proved successful in New Zealand. The Australian Mutual Provident Society, the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand, and other large companies have used it, and have found it absolutely satisfactory. Having regard to all the circumstances, 1 think that we should give it a trial, more especially as the Postmaster-General will have supervision over the firms to whom the machines are issued, and that he can, at his discretion, refuse a request for the use of one. member think that the Commonwealth should have the sole patent rights of the machine ? it is a New Zealand invention, and I unThe derstand that it is the intention of the inventor to take it to other parts of the world, where it may also be successfully used. We should have to pay a very big sum for the patent. I see no objection, in the fact That that the patent is held by private men, to its use by the Government. The Minister and his Department have done well in recommending its use, and I shall certainly vote for the Bill as it stands. prepared to vote for the second reading of the Bill, but certainly think that if it is passed the machine should become the property of the Government, and that the making of the dies should be solely in the hands of the Department.

While the honourable member for Robertson was speaking I made an interjection to the effect that the' machine had been in use in New Zealand only since 1908. In that I was .in error. I see that it is tbe Commonwealth Department of External Affairs that has used the machine since 1908. New Zealand since 1906. been fairly satisfactory in New Zealand, and that there is no danger of fraud. It has been stated that it would be as easy to make a die for printing ordinary stamps as to make a die such as would be used in a recording machine. with his knowledge of printing, must be aware that the workmanship displayed in a die for printing stamps is of a much higher quality than that required for making such a stamp as is used in a recording machine. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has remarked that it would be possible to use an ordinary rubber stamp to imitate the stamp of a recording machine; but probably the ink used in a machine would be different from the ink used with an ordinary rubber stamp. I have no objection to the Bill being read a second time, but I am certainly of opinion that it would be better for the Commonwealth to buy the patent rights. We know that extensive frauds have been committed in the direction of imitating Government stamps. We all remember the Adelaide Customs case, which cost the Government of South Australia a loss of .Â£60,000. If it is possible to amend the Bill in the direction I have suggested, and if the honourable member for Hunter who has made a suggestion to that effect takes action in Committee, I shall be pleased to support him. opens up new ground, and marks a big departure from the principle which has we consent to do what is asked, it seems to me that we should have more authoritative information. All that we know at present is that the use of the recording machine is recommended by the New Zealand Government. Hitherto the Commonwealth used for postal purposes shall be manufactured in the Government Printing Office. So far we have not allowed any private firms to engage in the production of stamps in any way. The introduction of the stamping machine will upset that principle. It is contended that the machine will place on postal articles stamps sufficient to cover the postage, and will accurately register the value of the stamping done. We are also assured that the provisions against fraud are ample. Upon that point, however, I am not satisfied. In New South Wales, in connection with the tramway system, a mechanical contrivance was adopted, by means of which every fare collected was registered by means of the ring of a bell. The number of rings was also registered, and passengers were requested by the Commissioners, when they paid fares, to see. that the guards of the trams made the proper rings. The Commissioners thought they had a perfect piece of mechanism. But it was discovered that there was a marked difference between the fares recorded and the number of passengers travelling. An examination was made, and it was discovered that by a very simple device guards who were inclined to be dishonest were enabled to cheat the recording instrument. As a consequence, considerable monetary loss was sustained by the Department. What guarantee should we have that a similar fraud might not be perpetrated in connection with these machines? Tramway Company still use recorders for tram fares? they also use check tickets, and have examining inspectors. The New South Wales",54,Quick
