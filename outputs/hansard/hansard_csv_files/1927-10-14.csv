That loss is brought home very closely to honourable members in this House because one of the killed was a brother of the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell), with whom all of us are sincerely sympathetic. The Adelaide was despatched in response to a request by the British Government that a cruiser should be sent to the Islands for the protection of life, and to assist the British representative in -the administration of the Islands.

That was an exceptional case. Ordinarily this Government is solely responsible for any action that may be taken by any ship of the AusThe Government's policy in tralian navy. In the present instance the cruiser Adelaide has left for the Solomon Islands, and the British Government is now in consultation with the High Commissioner for the ""Western Pacific as to what action is necessary. On the conclusion of that consultation, it will, no doubt, communicate with the Australian Government, and if it thinks fit, make a definite request to us. It will then be for the Australian Government to decide whether it will agree to such a request. MEAT INDUSTRY. the meat industry?

39,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [11.24],"the people. The Eederal Capital has been designed on modern lines, and the areas therefore are somewhat scattered. Areas for business, for residential purposes,for officers and so forth, have been provided, and consequently it will entail considerable travelling on the part of the residents to move between those areas. The Eederal Capital Commission is in control of the capital, and up to the present has been in control of transport arrangements; but it is now about to enter into an agreement to hand over the transport service to a private company. It appears that some time back tenders were invited for this service, but those received were unsatisfactory, and now an arrangement is being made for a private company to take over the service as from December next. According to the statement made by the Minister for Home and Territories last night, the reason given by the commission for this step is that it is making a loss of 6.5d. per bus mile run. It is obvious that any service running in the territory must be a losing proposition until the population grows. I want to know on what period has the commission based its estimate of loss?-Sinc e the Eederal Parliament has been functioning at Canberra, the population has increased considerably, and it is likely to continue to do so. More revenue must have been received from the buses during the last two or three months than in any corresponding previous period. It would therefore be hardly fair to take as a basis for the loss, the revenue received during the last three or four years. The commission, in answering a question asked by Senator Findley, gave a different reason for handing the transport service to a private company, and perhaps it would be as well to place it on record. No reference was made to the loss on the service. Probably the commission realized that that was unavoidable. The following is a portion of the reply of the commission :The conunission already has heavy responsibility in operating such municipal services and facilities as water supply, sewerage, lighting, power, roads, brigade, abattoirs, and similar activities, in addition to the administration of many important matters that are outsde the ordinary municipal sphere, and it was felt that, as private enterprise had not taken a very active Mr Charlton. part in the development of Canberra, the necessity to conduct a more extensive omnibus service afforded a fitting opportunity for its co-operation. A ll transport services in the other capital cities are under either Government or municipal control, and railway commissioners and other authorities have now realized that it is necessary to run omnibus services as adjuncts to railway and tramway systems, provided that good roads are available. The day has arrived when both governmental and municipal authorities will have todetermine whether in the event of additional transport arrangements being required, it would be more economical to build rail""' ways and tramways, or to construct good roads for the use of motor traffic. A large amount has already been spent in making good roads in the Federal Capital Territory, and apparently these are now to be used by a private company which is to provide an exclusive trans1 port service which, in my opinion, should be provided by the commission itself, so long as it exists, and then by the body which supersedes it. I trust that the day is not distant when Canberra will have a city council elected by the people to deal with these matters. We cannot quietly acquiesce in the adoption of the policy upon which the commission has determined respecting transport facilities for this city; otherwise we might find it in a week or two applying the same policy of the lighting, the abattoirs, ancl other public utilities of the city. land. this precedent is allowed to go unchallenged the commission may assume that it is entitled to hand over almost all its activities to some other body. I do »i not think that Parliament would agree to that. We should, as a matter of fact, have far more control over the commission than we have. It should not be able to make ordinances with an entire disregard of Parliament. stormwater _ drainage, fire We should have had no information ( whatever about the proposed new transport service had we not asked questions about it in the House, or read reports which appeared in the press. We have",17,Canberra Transport Service
40,Mr Bkennan,And last of all to its,18,Canberra Transport Service
41,Mr Charlton,"That is so. I fbeen told that tbe Government has acquiesced in this arrangement. If that is so, I submit that the Government should first have ascertained the mind of Parliament on the matter, for we can no longer be ignored in the development of the Federal Capital Territory. At least until such time as a city council is elected to manage the affairs of this city, Parliament should be consulted upon all matters of principle. It may be said that the provision of transport facilities has caused the commission a good deal of difficulty, but that was only to be expected. There must be difficulty and discomfort in the establishment of a new city. Honourable"" members, and I think the residents generally, are quite aware of that, and they are cheerfully submitting to many inconveniences knowing them to be unavoidable The conditions under which this' bus service is to be inaugurated are, that the private company concerned will be subsidized during the first year of its operations to the extent of 4d. per mile, which is a very big subsidy; next year the subsidy is to be 3d. a mile; then 2d.; and finally, l d . In the following two years it appears that the company will conduct its operations without a subsidy, but also without any control in respect of the dividends it may pay its shareholders, though it is provided that after the sixth year of its operations its accumulated dividends shall not exceed 10 per cent. Mr E. B.iLEY -'-It could easily water its stock. could increase its rolling stock, or condemn vehicles which were quite satisfactory for the service and sell them to other companies. In spite of the comniision having stated that the public interest : itore are many ways in which the company could defeat the purpose of this clause in the agreement. informed by both the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Marr) and the commission itself that the company will provide a service of twelve buses to begin with, and have available additional vehicles to provide for peak periods and special occasions. I estimate that each of the twelve buses will run two shifts of eight hours a day, making sixteen hours in all. That is a conservative estimate, for some of the vehicles will begin running at 6 o'clock in the morning, and run until midnight, which is eighteen hours. For the sake of this computation, however, I have fixed a period of sixteen hours. The trip from Eastlake to North Ainslie and back Avill cover a distance of S£ miles, and it is estimated that it will occupy one hour. Therefore, each bus, running for sixteen liours, at 8^miles an hour, will run 136 miles a day, and at a subsidy of 4d. per mile will earn £2 5s. 4d. a day. or £27 4s. a day for the fleet. In the first year the subsidy will amount to £9,92S. That calculation is made on a conservative basis, for I am convinced that the total mileage will exceed my estimate, as I have made no allowance for peak periods or special business on the occasion of, important public events. In the second year the subsidy, assuming that the mileage is the same, will amount to 25 per cent, less .than £9,928. In the following year there will be a further 25 per cent, reduction, again assuming that the volume of traffic is the same; and in the fourth year there will be no subsidy. Apparently, after the fourth year, the company ""will be permitted to make whatever profit it pleases for two years. tract. we are not justified, in any circumstances, in making a contract for such a long period. signed ? to;. but the Government should take steps will be safeguarded, ""to prevent the documents from being signed.

47,Mr Coleman,"Wer e public tendersunderstand that this arrangement has been made because ihe tenders received were unsatisfactory. I have mentioned that uncier the terms of the agreement the rate of subsidy payable after the first year would be reduced, but it is unlikely that the total amount would be lower, for the population of this city will undoubtedly increase considerably with the passing of every year. I believe that the city will develop at a considerably faster rate than some people estimate. The plan of Mi. Walter Burley Griffin is elaborate, and we may expect that this place will become, in the near future, one of the finest residential cities in the world. It is tlie more necessary, therefore, that Parliament should keep a close oversight of the work of the commissioners who have been appointed. In my opinion they should be allowed to operate only such ordinances ancl regulations as have the approval of Parliament. should be supreme. that opinion, particularly as Parliament is now meeting here. No three honourable members of this chamber would be permitted to wield the power that these three commissioners are exercising. Many of rhe functions which they are discharging should rest only with representative bodies sueh as municipal councils. are developing here. monopoly, and until an element of competition is introduced, the cost of living must remain high. The agreement provides that this private company may operate without competition for the next ten years. like the Minister for Homes and Territories to indicate how any other company may compete with it. The conditions here should be as free as possible. It has been said that the agreement has been made to enable private enterprise to assist in developing the city; but certain services should be conducted only by a government or municipal authority. I have no objection to private enterprise being encouraged to carry on business which properly belongs to it, but in this enlightened age we surely canuot sit down quietly and allow the commission to revert to practices which have been discarded in some places for quite a century. No one can estimate how . rapidly the population of this city will increase. It must always be a resort for tourists ancl official visitors. I shall not at the moment make a long speech ,aboutthe commission, but will content myself with saying that if it is capable it should be able to conduct a satisfactory transport service for the residents here; if it cannot do so, it should be dismissed. I do not desire to condemn the commission, but I am obliged to say that I disagree with its policy in this regard. This transport service sliould be publicly conducted, and no three men in Australia should have the power to place it in private hands. Homes and Territories) [11.44] -The subject which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has been discussing is of great importance to the residents of the Territory, and the decision which has beeu reached and to which he objects was not made after only five or ten minutes' thought, but after a very great amount of consideration. The question is whether everything in this national city of Australia is to be nationalized, run on socialist lines, or whether we are to do what was recommended by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), ancl create competiton by the introduction of private enterprise. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the only way in which we can make Canberra successful is to decrease the cost of living by introducing competition, and that is the very thing that the commission is endeavouring to do. It is the policy of this Government to allow private enterprise to enter into competition with the Government in the matter of transport and other facilities, and the policy governing the conduct of the national city of Australia will not be any exception to that general policy.

In the interests of public health, Government supervision is necessary. the commission, one may expect anything. never countenance anything like that. Those are essential public services, and necessarily controlled by the Government. The commission has done excellent work, and all that it humanly could be expected to do.

We do not subsidize the service to Goulburn, or the trips to the Cotter River.

A service will be run to Queanbeyan, and the company will conduct a service anywhere that there is a chance of making a'profit, subject always to the sanction of the commission. increased. The Government has stipulated that, in the event of the company making a profit of 10 per cent., the fares shall be reduced. I do not anticipate that there will be very much profit at all in the venture. Officers who now go home to their lunch and spend, say, Is. a day in bus fares, have to pay 6s. a week for travelling; but the company proposes to issue a weekly ticket for 4s., entitling the holder to 22 trips in any part of the city. If the commission decided to continue the present bus service, the fleet would have to be more than duplicated. The commission is now losing 6-Jd. a bus mile, and no doubt the loss would be doubled if twice the number of buses were run. It would also be necessary for the Government to supply the commission with further funds to build a huge garage and workshop for the housing and repair of the vehicles. the Minister's time has expired. sorry to note the pessimistic tone adopted by the Minister.

89,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [12.1],"I waslearnt, it is that no city can be developed by handing transport arrangements over to private enterprise. ""What would be the pjosition of the Australian nation to-day had that course been adopted in opening up new territories? private concern will provide transport facilities unless there are profits to be gained by doing so. The Minister pointed out that the commission had not conducted shops and would willingly give up the hotels; but even an anti-socialist could services for a solitary mile until good more easily justify the nationalization of transport than of hotels and shops. The Minister asked if everything in the Capital was to be run on socialistic lines. Canberra belongs to Australia, and the land is owned by the nation. One of the principles that justified the establishment of the city was that tbe Government was to retain the ownership of the land for all time, and obtain the benefit of the increment in value. Now Parliament is asked to make a most undesirable precedent. The Minister stated that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) claimed that the only way to obtain good transport was by providing for competition, and that was what the Government the Minister said, proposed to do. What the Leader of the Opposition really said was that, if private enterprise was to undertake the service, there should be competition. Under national control, monopoly is possible, without the people suffering; but private monopoly necessarily involves high travelling costs. I challenge the Minister to show that competition is possible under the Government's proposal. for? that competition will take place. Under doubled ? the proposed agreement there is a ten years' guarantee regarding certain specified routes, and the only competition that can come will be over other routes which will be unprofitable, and where no private has become the greatest pessimist I have company will wish to run.

Of course government buses are in operation in Victoria and South Australia. It was found in Melbourne that until No national control of transport was obtained through the State Parliament the outlying parts of the metropolitan area could not be properly developed. The private firms concentrated on the profitable areas, and would not extend their dividends were assured. buses, not tramways. owners in Melbourne did was to duplicate the tramway service, picking the eyes out of the traffic and tearing up the roads. They are a menace to great cities, and, if Canberra is to be properly developed, private buses must be kept from the roads. There has been talk of the commission shirking its responsibilities. I am not blaming the commission, because I believe that the proposed agreement is the result of Ministerial actien. It is in accord with the policy the Government has enunciated on all matters. This Ministry will hand over everything it can that is likely to be profitable to private enterprise, allowing the Government to attend only to those services from which no profit can be obtained. The Minister said that for a considerable time the buses in Canberra had been losing £400 a month and giving half the service required. If the service were doubled the loss would be exactly the same as the amount proposed for the first year's subing no allowance for increased business. Does not the Minister anticipate that the years.

Why does not the Minister give a direct answer when he is asked to name the persons who are to be given transportation rights over the public roads? Has any deposit been paid by them?""What are the guarantees? What is the agreement? Why were honourable members left to hear rumours from pressmen? Why was not Parliament taken into the confidence of the Government before definite steps were taken? Surely we have some voice in regard to the future of the capital. Instead of laying the foundations of the city on sound lines, by retaining Government control of transport facilities, MinMinister's constituency. If the Federal isters talk about co-operating with private enterprise! We owe something to future generations. We should maintain in this city the principle that has been accepted in every otlier capital city by the Government, it is not worthy of of Australia, where it is recognized that public transport should be in the hands of the people themselves. I anticipated that words of protest would be heard from the Ministerial side. The Minister's reply was exceptionally weak. I thought the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) would have risen as soon as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) resumed his seat. The information supplied is of a most meagre character. The Government has handed over many of its responsibilities to a great number of commissions, and now we find some of those bodies, notably the Federal Capital Commission, passing its responsibilities over to private enterprise. To my mind it is one of the worse things that could happen to this Territory. The Minister appears to be ill-informed as to the activities of government and. tramway boards in transport matters i u the great cities of Australia. It is well-known that in Victoria the Government has placed buses on routes where no railways had been laid down. .Even where private enterprise was giving the public a fair service, the Eailways Commissioners in Victoria introduced buses, showing that they were far-sighted in the matter. vate owners after the latter had proved the routes. the kind. The Government, with the taxpayers' money, had built a splendid road between Melbourne and Geelong. Then private enterprise came along with its buses, and took from the Railway Department many of the passengers that formerly travelled by train. It also wore out the road, and to-day Victoria is spending thousands of pounds in putting it into proper repair. The Railway Department now runs its own buses on that route, and it has reduced the fares considerably. Government buses are also plying between Flinders-street railway station and Portsea, in the Prime Capital Commission has acted under duress, the responsibility is its own. If it can be proved that the commission was so weak as to adopt the policy dictated its position. I am wondering how the bus employees will stand. Some of them have come from various parts of Australia because they believed that they would obtain employment in connection with a government instrumentality. Will they be handed over to private enterprise, or will the company engage its own motormen and throw on the unemployed market the men now in the service of the commission? that small detail, he should know some of the major facts concerning this contract. The Loan Bill passed by the House a few clays ago included a sum of £2,000,000 to be handed over to the commission; yet this Parliament, which provides the commission with money, cannot be told some of the major points of a very important, contract. some further action will be taken. quietly to this sort of thing. member show that the proposed business deal is not in the interest of the people? the commission's buses when handling the present meagre traffic could be converted",23,Canberra Transport Service

The Government's action is so unaccountable that one cannot help being suspicious of it . The facts indicate that it is not a legitimate business deal, but is part and ' parcel of the Government policy of surrendering to private enterprise anything out of which money can be made. The taxpayers who w ill provide the funds for the subsidy w ill demand an explanation. The present Ministry is only temporarily in office, and one of the biggest tasks of its successor w ill be to undo many of the iniquitous things that have been done during the last six years. This House is the custodian of the public purse; the Federal Capital Commission is an instrumentality of the Federal Parliament, which from time to time provides it w i th funds for the carrying on of its operations. ""We are entitled to know the name of the company that is to get this contract, its financial standing, and what deposit has been, or w ill be, paid as a guarantee that the contract w ill be carried out.

""Why should of their principals, transfer their responsibilities to private enterprise. rise to express my dissatisfaction w it h the action of the Government. I can conceive of no reason for it other than that somebody in an official position is in terested in the transaction. I know that Mrs. Barton, who conducts a bus service in Canberra, has for the last two years been trying in vain to get security of tenure, although she has not asked for any subsidy. MrM c GRATH I am assured that she has not. She asked to be allotted a permanent route and was denied it . Now a private company, of whose shareholders and directors we are ignorant, is to be given a monopoly and a substantial subsidy. Since Parliament has been meeting in Canberra, honourable members have heard many sinister rumours regarding the interest of certain individuals in local industries. I have just received an anonymous note. MrM o GRATH I shall read it , and those who are accused can make their own defence. It is as follows:Every bit of private enterprise in the Territory has leading commission officers mixed up in it. For example, the secretary of the commission is a shareholder in the Steam Laundry Company, and the commission sends its towels and linen to this company, which charges exhorbitant prices; all the hotel and hostel washing goes to this laundry. A leading company-tli e Canberra Land Investment Company-ha s leading officials as shareholders. For example, at a recent sale of land here the auctioneer, the Lands Officer, and the buyer of choice blocks were big shareholders in tlie same company. These share lists were published in the Sydney press last July, but the commissioners apparently saw nothing is a bad beginning, and I hope the Gowrong in it. This is happening with private enterprise, and these are only two examples. W ill the How do we know that the same thing will not happen with the'bus company? When the Government is doing things "" under the lap "" honourable members have to learn from the daily press that a heavy subsidy is to be paid to a private bus company, it is little wonder that we are suspicious of transactions in this Territory.

108,Mr Mabe,"Treat it as it deserves.excuse for the Government's action, but everywhere transport is recognized as a public utility that should be owned and controlled on behalf of the people; yet in this new model city a monopoly of certain bus routes is to be handed over to a private company which is to receive a subsidy of £9,000 a year, based upon the traffic for the last five or six years, during which the population of the Territory was very small. Contrary to the opinion of my Leader, I do not think that Canberra will ever have a large resident population, but the meetings of the Eederal Parliament here, and the beauties of the city, will attract large numbers of tourists. We are at least assured that the population will never be less than it is to-day. Yet the Government is handing over to a private company the franchise of the roads that are being constructed with the money voted by this Parliament. I enter my strong protest against that policy. I congratulate the Federal Capital Commission upon the step which it has taken, and I feel confident that the inhabitants of Canberra will be greatly relieved to learn that a private company is to take charge of the bus service. The commission's buses have maintained a very infrequent service, and civil servants who are quartered in widely-scattered suburbs have suffered great inconvenience. Even when the buses were carrying ful l loads, the service was still losing money. of Canberra will increase, and so will the work of the commission. It is wasteful to have the commissioners engaged in the conduct of' services such as the running of buses, when they could be attending to more important duties. I cannot understand why they did not endeavour some time ago to dispose of the bus service, which has been a worry and a nuisance to them. We know that the commission wishes to present each financial year as satisfactory a balance-sheet as possible, and at the same time to provide an adequate transport service, but under existing conditions that is impossible. We look for an increase in population. I venture to say, that within six months the population of this locality will be increased by 3,000. That is not guess work, because I am basing my estimate upon movements that we know of in and around the Federal Capital City. After that period progress may not be rapid, but it will be sure. I congratulate tbe commission on the step that it is now taking. Mention has been made of the fact that certain officers of the commission have shares in private companies in Canberra, but I can see nothing dreadful in that. If the secretary of the commission likes to invest his money in a steam laundry, he has a perfect right to do so. There is nothing to prevent honourable members opposite from investing their money in a rival establishment and participating in the profits that they have referred to. A few years ago' in the City of Sydney a movement in which many members of Parliament were concerned, was instituted to induce the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales to take over the running of buses in Sydney, but they would have nothing to do with it, believing that the omnibus service would be better left in the hands of private enterprise. Whether they were right or wrong, I cannot say, but in a young city like Canberra surely the commission has sufficient work on its hands without being required to control the transport service. Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Marr) has not advanced any sound and satisfactory reason for embarking upon The population a serious change of policy in the Federal Territory involving the transfer of the control of the omnibus service from the commission to private enterprise. He has stated that the loss on the present service is about £400 a month. If the new service travels about 120 miles a day, as is proposed, a subsidy of 4d. a mile would represent twice tbe amount of the loss. The loss on operations should not be permitted to influence the provision of transport services. Had that influenced State Governments, or even local governing authorities, we should not have had many of the railways and tramways that are now serving our capital cities. It is indeed amusing to know that the Minister is apprehensive about a loss of £400 per annum in a city which is in its initial stages. I should like to remind honourable members that in connection",25,Canberra Transport Service

Riley (Cook) [12.33.],"Th ewith, the building of the Secretariat, the architect is being paid a fee of £60,000 for supervision, yet the Government is objecting to an insignificant loss on the transport service. The transfer of that service to private enterprise is a retrograde step unparalleled in the history of Australia. Where will this policy end? If it is right to hand over the transport service to private enterprise, why not transfer other public services rather than permit them to remain under the control of the commission and its officers? This drastic action certainly emphasizes the necessity for the whole of the commission's activities being reviewed by this Parliament. This Parliament has an opportunity of reviewing ordinances that bring about changes of administration or policy in other Commonwealth territories, and it is competent for honourable members to disallow them. practice should also be followed in respect of the administration of the Seat of Government. It is dangerous to allow three commissioners to effect serious alterations of administration without this Parliament having an opportunity to review their activities. It seems to me that the only function that this Parliament exercises respecting the Pederal Territory is the provision of the necessary funds to enable the commission to administer its affairs, and that it is considered no business of ours to inquire in what way the money is being expended either in subsidies or other directions. Parliament when it established the Pederal Capital Commission expected it to control the activities of the Federal Territory, and its attempt to hand over a portion of its responsibilities ^to private even there that existing licences to enterprise should meet with the unanimous disapproval of honourable members. If the Government considers that the intrusion of private enterprise into our transport services is justifiable, I should to face facts, and it is a fact throughout like to know whether private enterprise is also to meet the Government's requirements in respect of taxi-cabs and motor cars. At present we are maintaining a costly fleet of vehicles for the conveyance mented. of Ministers and commissioners in and about the Federal Territory. ceive consideration. commission, which has been endorsed by the Government, emphasizes the necessity for this Parliament to establish at the earliest possible opportunity some local governing body in the Federal City, and thus give the residents an opportunity to register a protest against any attempt by private enterprise to exploit them within, the Territory.

It is well known and has been admitted that, although we have adopted That the principle of State ownership of railways and in the vast majority of cases, of tramways too, nearly all omnibus services are in the hands of private individuals. the State of New South Wales, which I know. able gentleman name any omnibus, service that is subsidized? throughout Australia are in the main-, owned by private companies and, therefore, the step that we are now taking: ini the Federal Territory is not an innovation. In Sydney the problems of trafficare tremendous, and. it is not suggested private bus owners should be cancelled. I know all that can be said against the use by private enterprise of roads that are paid for by the people. But we have Australia that the present means of transport owned and controlled by State and municipal authorities have proved inadequate, and have had to be suppleI believe in the control of transport by public bodies, but in this case we have placed the Government of this Territory in the hands of a commission, and something has been said this",26,Canberra Transport Service

This is a matter upon which he had very definite opinions a few years ago. his bricks he would be taking a different stand. matter introduced by the Leader of the Opposition rests upon tittle-tattle. It is a matter of importance; but tittle-tattle inspires a good many statements regarding matters brought to the notice of this National Parliament. A few days ago an honourable member on this side of the chamber inquired how many feet of dirt a man shifted per day in this Territory, how many hours he worked, what wages he received, and so on. Inquiries of that kind are all right in their place; but their place is not here. If any big question of principle needs to be determined, it is proper for it to be discussed here. Apart from matters of that kind, the commission should be allowed to continue And we all its work without hindrance. I trust that the Leader of the Opposition will make no mistake as to where I stand. I am in favour of the ownership and control of transport by public bodies. But the commission should be allowed to continue its work without being continually harrassed and hampered. In this instance it has recommended that the transportation service be leased to a If Lenin or Trotsky had private company. Nothing in that action conflicts with any democratic principles whatever. This is not an American franchise, and the Government is able to keep its hand upon things. As to the merits of the case, I have nothing to say.

We have seen this place grow from nothing at all to a fine city, and we have the promise of still better progress in the days that are to come; but because a bus service into Queanbeyan and round the city is to be leased to a private company it is said that everything is going wrong.

If the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues regard this as a vital principle it and lay down the lines upon which the commission should work, and leave the commission alone. The criticism which the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has levelled against the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) seems to me to be most illogical. Moreover, it is an invitation to Parliament to lay down an entirely new principle. Surely it should be competent for this House to discuss any matter of policy connected with the development of the Federal Capital Territory! The Leader of the Opposition did not attack either the personal character of the commissioners or the motives which prompted them to agree to make this contract. All he did was to question the wisdom of changing a policy which, throughout Australia, is regarded as the best for carrying out public utilities, and that is a matter upon which Parliament might well express itself. The right honourable member tried to establish that public utilities of this kind derer should not incur a loss? The right could be controlled by private enterprise in the Federal Capital Territory without abrogating any democratic principle; but he dismally failed to make out his case. It is recognized, not only in all the under commission control and that capital cities of Australia, but throughout the world, that utilities of this kind are best controlled by municipal or other public authorities. I know that, heretofore, bus services have been operated in some of our cities by private enterprise; but the tendency everywhere now is for municipal authorities or other public bodies to assume control of them. In this case the very reverse of that is proposed. Here we have a public authority whioh has been controlling the transport service surrendering it to private enterprise. It is possible that even that might be justified if it could be Opposition said that he looked forward shown that the commission could not run to the day when Canberra would be such a good service as private enterprise, governed by a local council. or that the cost at which it could do so was prohibitive; but that has not been established. After all, this city is only sibly this Government might later on alter in the initial stages of its development. It is far too early to determine that public control of its transport facilities has failed. It is even too early to say that the loss that has been incurred in conducting the service up to date is such as to make it advisable to surrender it to private enterprise. vate buses have been running here for a number of years. competition from that aspect has not been introduced into this discussion. It would have been a different thing had the commission taken steps to prevent any competition with the service that it was running; but it is proposing to surrender the service completely and to allow a private company the monopoly of certain routes. If such a policy can be justified in regard to transport, it can also be justified in regard to our telephone service. It might be said, even without the production of the balance-sheets, that our telephone service is being conducted at a loss; but will it be suggested that on that account we should call for tenders from private companies for carrying it on, and offer a subsidy to ensure that the lucky tenhonorable member astonished me by drawing invidious distinctions between the development that has occurred in the Federal Capital Territory which has occurred in certain small country towns which are controlled by municipal councils; but there was no common ground on which he could properly make such a comparison. The Federal Capital Commission has been carrying on with the prestige and money of the Commonwealth Government behind it, and with a noble design upon which to base its operations.

HadI included the thousand-homes scheme which the Labour Government of South Australia completed in 1926, the statements of the honourable members for Wakefield ( Mr field followed Holder, Kingston, CockPoster) and Barker( MrM . Cameron) would have been shown to be baseless. Those are the facts, however much honourable members might desire to sidestep the issue. The activities of the Gunn Government are now world renowned. When the recent British Empire Parliamentary Delegation visited Australia, it inspected the houses that had been erected by the South Australian Labour Government, and was profuse in the encomiums it heaped upon that Government. Lord Burnham and many other eminent members of the Delegation expressed surprise at what had been achieved, and it is of no use for honourable members opposite now to endeavour to belittle the efforts of the medial legislation. When there was Labour Government in South Australia. It is unnecessary to harp upon the fact that the working classes in Australia have been the victims of the landlords of the country. ated the housing proposition ? member wish me to repeat the story? It is well known that the South Australian Government initiated' the thousand-homes scheme, called for tenders, and set the successful tenderer to work on it. The banks foreclosed on the builder, but the Government, nothing daunted, successfully took upon itself the task of completing the work. tion of the housing scheme. for Wakefield was a member of the Parliament which evolved it. He knows that when the State Bank was suggested in the South Australian Parliament, it was'opposed as bitterly as was the inauguration of the Commonwe'alth Bank in this House its opponents bitterly exclaiming that the government of the day was duplicating existing facilities. In spite of all opposition, that State Bank was established, and has justified itself. Now it is being enlarged. Holder was its originator. erick Holder was the force of the Labour movement, which subsequently came into power. The honourable member for Wakeburn, and other Liberals, and he must admit that it was the driving force of Labour that compelled them to take these actions which have proved so beneficiaL to the working man. but it was then impossible to distinguish between Labour and Liberal. pediency. When the parting of the ways came we know who jumped to the Labour, and who jumped to the Liberal side. These reforms were forced upon the Liberals by the Labour party, who have been responsible for the bulk of our rea South Australian wine depot in London the Labour party turned it into a produce depot, which has been a god-send to the producers. Labour was not in office; but it was the driving force that made Liberal politicians do what they would not otherwise have done. That statement is irrefutable. When the Galway suburb was opened at Richmond in my State, Mr Gell, who often stood in the Liberal interests, was manager of the State bank. I heard him on that occasion read a panegyric upon the activities of the State bank, which he described as a wonderful institution for supplying workmen with homes. When it was found that the deposit asked for was too large, Mr Gunn, the Leader of the Labour party in South Australia, brought it down to £25, allowing the worker, if necessary, to pay that amount in weekly instalments of 5s. Even that was not sufficiently generous, and Mr Gunn, on assuming power, initiated the "" thousand homes "" scheme. The history of housing is bound up with the history of the Labour party; but the present bill' does not provide for the scheme which the Labour party realizes is necessary to-day.

Sir is designed to prevent over-lapping of the work of existing State organizations. as those bodies may need assistance financially, I am in sympathy with the bill. I have no objection to every facility being given to members of the Public Service, even those on the higher salaries, because our housing legislation should have a general application; but this bill means thft> separation of the Savings Bank department from the general bank. The State Savings Bank of Victoria has erected mammoth buildings in Elizabeth ancl Swanston streets, and these are even provided with flood lighting, so that they will not escape attention at night. During last year, I think, two mergers took place among the associated banks. They are not breaking up into factions. Their intention is to function as one body, and eliminate the waste due to over-lapping. I shall quote from the bible of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), by reading an extract from a sub-leader published in the' Adelaide Register of the 10th OctoberThe separation of tlie savings and general hanking functions of the Commonwealth Bank is in accordance with the Government's central bank policy, but there is some truth in the complaint of Mr Scullin, .M.H.R., that tlie Ministry is over-loading its institutions with highly-paid directors and officials. One governor or manager of the separated Savings Bank could surely discharge all the functions which it is proposed to vest in three commissioners, in addition to whom a fresh swarin of officials w ill doubtless be required official figures do not show it. If honorto administer the details of the housing scheme. The Liberal organ in South Australia considers that the measure is not needed. Its effect would be to destroy the efficiency of the Commonwealth Bank, and thus provide an excuse, perhaps, for further hamstringing it, if not wiping it out of existence. The honourable member for Wakefield said that the bill was inopportune, because the pastoral industry was in such great difficulty that it was hard to find employment for those engaged in tbe industry, and the West Coast lands of South Australia were crying for fuiv ther settlement. The honourable member should realize how valuable the pastoral industry is to Australia, instead of declaring that the country is going to the clogs. I recently took out a few figures the Commonwealth Statistician, and they somewhat staggered me. In 1915 there were 9,931,416 cattle in Australia, and, in 1925, 13,279,7S5. There were 73,146,460 sheep in the Commonwealth in 1915, ancl ten years later the number bad increased to 103,563,21S. The largest number of sheep ever held in this country was in 1891, when there were 106,421,068. stocked both then and in 1925. the pastoralists do not know how to conduct their own business; I leave that aspect of the matter to the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen). I am concerned about the actual productivity of Australia, and not the methods of those engaged in the pastoral industry. In 1915 there were 735,695 pigs, and in 1925 no fewer than 1,128,370. the severe drought of 1914 our stock had been seriously depleted. clined to think that the figures I have quoted show a gradual increase. In 1891, half a sheep could be purchased for Is.. 3d., and in those days the worker benefited by the low price. But the total number of sheep carried in 1925 was within 3,000 of the record established in 1891. I do not know how one is to prove that the pastoral industry is successful, if the able members wish, I am prepared lc examine banking figures. anything. anything to the satisfaction of the honourable member. ThenI could take land values. Is there nothing that will convince the honourable member that the Commonwealth is not on the brink of disaster ?

188,Mr Yates,"There is a good Arbithe miner amongst the primary producers; he is usually grouped with the town labourer. The Country party is never heard demanding an increase of wages for the producers engaged in mines. The total mineral production in 1915-16 -was worth £22,060,361; that total had increased in 1925-26 to £24,592,620. Again there was an increase, but not so great as in agricultural and pastoral industries, because in mining a good season does not help production; if a rich patch is worked out that is the end of it. In 1919I am quoting the only figures that the statistician has supplied-the silver production totalled 6,696,788 oz.; in 1925-26 it was 8,946,218 oz. The output of lead pig was 82,732 tons in 1919, and 150,460 tons in 1925-26; and of zinc, 6,544 tons and 47,356 tons respectively. Yet the BrokenH ill Company's works at Newcastle are closing down because the prices have dropped slightly! company going to put over some scheme by which the men engaged in the production of those minerals will lose their all? As soon as the price of wool drops it is said that the bottom is falling out of the Commonwealth; but the only effect of the fall in the price of minerals is that the workers are thrown out of employment. The managers of the mines concerned immediately advise that production operations should cease. They care very little about what happens to the men who, in consequence, lose their work. yield? able member that, but first let me call his attention to the output of native timbers from our sawmills.

I regret that my returns refer only to South Australia. I abstracted them, to use in a speech that I made in that State. Buti t may.be taken that the position in South Australia is largely the position in the other wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth. In 1915-1916 a total of 34,134,504 bushels of wheat was produced in my State, the average being 12.46 bushels per acre. In 1925-26 the total production was 28,603,101 bushels and the average yield 11.60 bushels per acre. decline. the average yield for the ten years was 29,402,288 bushels, the yield per acre being 12.44 bushels. It will be seen, therefore, that we practically held our own last year. I am quite satisfied from my knowledge of Australia that we shall be able to maintain and even increase our production in the next ten years. I could give honourable members equally satisfactory figures respecting barley, oats, and hay. I come now to our production of potatoes and onions. In 1916 our onion crop averaged 6.11 tons per acre, while in 1926 the average was 7.57 tons per acre. The average for the ten years was 7.44 tons per acre. The total yield of potatoes in 1916 was 12,991 tons, the average being 2.99 tons per acre, while in 1926 we produced 10,764 tons at an average of 3.72 tons per acre.

In spite of it being .one of the few 1919, when Sir Joseph Cook was places on the earth that has been blighted by Labour rule, it is a desirable place in which to live. It is both wealth and health producing. As for this housing scheme, the most I dare to hope is that the Government will do the fair thing by those who expect to benefit by it. But I sincerely trust that in carrying out its policy the Government will not tear the Commonwealth Bank asunder, by severing the savings bank from the other branches of the institution. -The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) has precipitated an avalanche offiguresupon honourable members, but whether he has convinced them of the soundness of his views is open to question. I think he gave himself away badly when he said that he was a city man and could not be expected to discuss in detail the production and marketing of the commodities with which he was dealing. I regard this bill as a machinery measure, and as such it is more suitable for discussion in committee than at the second reading stage. It has been suggested by honourable members opposite that the Government in introducing the measure has been actuated by a sinister desire to destroy the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Bank. I entirely disagree with that view. I do not think that any government would dare to do anything to minimize the power of the bank, or to damage its prestige in the eyes of the world. It is advisable that the two spheres of activity of the Commonwealth Bank should be separated. is not controverting my figures, as he set out to do. MrM . CAMERON I shall do so later. It has been contended that this measure is a blow aimed at the present administration of the Commonwealth Bank, but I do not share that view. In 1912 the Commonwealth Bank absorbed the Tasmanian State Savings Bank, which had deposits to the extent of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000, and in 1916 the Commonwealth Bank had to its credit deposits amounting to £41,354,050. That year Labour went out of power in the Commonwealth sphere, and it has not since regained supremacy here. In. Treasurer, the Commonwealth Bank absorbed the Queensland Government Savings Bank, and in 1920, when Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer of Australia, the Note Issue Department was transferred to the control of the Commonwealth Bank. The amount to its credit in 1920 was £134,960,568, and that credit has since been augmented. Honourable members will appreciate the tremendous increase that has taken place in the activities of the bank since Labour was in power in 1916. My opinion is that the present action has been taken after consultation, and with the concurrence of the governors of the Commonwealth Bank,°in order'that the institution may the more effectively deal with the measures proposed in this bill. The bill provides that the bank shall extend its operations in a way that must be'to the advantage of the people of Australia. It is argued that the Government is creating unnecessary boards and commissions, but I consider that the gentlemen now in charge of the Commonwealth Savings Bank will be iu charge of the new branch, and that the increase in administrative expenditure will be infinitesimal. At the same time. I regret that the salaries of those concerned have not been set out in the bill. It is satisfactory to me that the Government has honoured the promises set out in the Prime Minister's policy speech regarding the housing scheme, and this measure has my wholehearted commendation. We can give no greater advantage to the people of our country than the making available to them of facilities to obtain money with which to establish their homes. It is contended that this is not an opportune time to advance money for the erection of homes, . but at the same time the Commonwealth is to.be congratulated upon the fact that",37,Elliot Johnson Th E Measure Fr M The Quarterly Summary Supplied By

That will be the task of State governments, the finances being provided by the Commonwealth Government. ments have experienced men in charge of their home building operations, who will see that no inflation of values takes place. given, from £400 to £600, but probably the As to the 90 per cent, advance; at present. the South Australian State Bank advances 95 per cent, of the value of the homes it constructs, and has not experienced any difficulty, therefore I do not see why one should anticipate any danger in the advancing of 90 per cent, under the provisions of this bill. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) supplied an extraordinary set of figures to this House, but failed to state exactly how many of the 1,000 homes proposed to be erected were constructed by the South Australian Labour Government. 1923, the last year of the Barwell administration-a n administration which is anathema to honourable members opposite-the State Bank had constructed 1,1 S2 houses. In 1924 the Gunn Government came into power, and decided to do something that had not previously been attempted in Australia, to construct 1,000 homes in one year. It proceeded with tlie scheme, but unhappily made the serious blunder of letting the whole contract to one builder, so congesting the building trade, with the result that not even 100 of those thousand homes were completed that year. The cost of the homes was to be between £750 and £800, but, due to the muddle created by the bad management of the Gunn Government, it proved to be considerably higher, and the difference between the anticipated and actual figures had to be met by the taxpayers of the State, a procedure which I strongly deprecate. ber seriously contend that only 100 houses of those' 1,000 were completed ? MrM . CAMEBON -Yes, in the first year. sion to advance money on approved securities for the erection of warehousing or storage facilities for primary products. I am not aware whether that covers the building of silos, but we shall secure that information when in committee. I regret that the scheme was not made even more generous, The various State governto provide an advance up to about £2,500 on farm property. It increases the salary range of those to whom assistance will be man above that salary experiences just as much difficulty in building a home as does the man on the lower salary. It has been stated that our rural activities are on the increase, but the actual position is that the cities are everywhere encroaching further on the resources and population of the country. People are leaving the country because the conditions in the city are much to be preferred. The small. farming community has been recruited from the best class of working men; but, owing to the financial stringency, the farmers are finding the land unattractive. We cannot successfully populate the rural In the year areas until we adopt a scheme to give more financial security than can be obtained from the private financial institutions. cier system available to small landholders ? States. They want assistance under which they can repay their loans in the same way as under the housing scheme. E support the bill, and congratulate the Government on having given effect to a plank of its policy in which I have great faith. -Strangely enough, this measure is opposed by supporters as well as by opponents of the Ministry. It is hard to understand why the Labour party resists a measure dealing with housing. During the last election campaign I was asked when the Government would redeem its promise to provide £20,000,000, for housing. The only answer I could give was that the pledge would soon be honoured. Now the Government has come forward with its scheme only to This bill also makes provifind considerable opposition to it. There can be no question as to the necessity for the measure.

I could understand the opposition to the measure if .it were proposed to build up a new and expensive department; but the intention is to utilize the State machinery already in existence. The State institutions have many outlets for their funds other than the provision of houses and by this bill the Government proposes to make £20,000,000 available for the sole purpose of building homes. In 19-24, Dr. Purdy, Metropolitan Health Officer in Sydney, saidHousing is the key to the whole problem of improving the public health. The sanctity of home life and the upbringing of the children of to-day must be carefully safeguarded, for the children of to-day are tlie men and women of to-morrow. The problems of housing, therefore, affect and involve the very basis of the social welfare of .the community. The only aspect of the bill that seems to be debatable is the question whether the Commonwealth Bank should continue under one administration or whether the Savings Bank department should be separately managed. In New South Wales, Mr Lang thought that three commissioners were not sufficient, and he proposed five. It seems to me to be wise to separate the two departments. No large banking institution would attempt to carry on two classes of banking business in one department, and the Government is to be congratulated on its proposal. No doubt it has been guided by expert advice from the present directors of the bank. The scheme is decidedly liberal, in that 90 per cent, of the money required for a home is to be advanced: but I know of building societies in New South Wales that have advanced, in some cases, even up to 95 per cent. They have looked upon the matter not merely as a commercial proposition. exhaustive inquiries as to the character of the applicants, and I have no doubt that similar action will be taken under the government scheme. If the intention were merely to advance 60 per cent, of the money required, only a limited number of persons would benefit; but the proposal is intended to help the poorer section of the community, and, therefore, it ought to be supported «by every party in Parliament. The Government is in a difficult position in having to fight opposition from its own followers, not Mr Perkins. only on this measure, but on practically every proposal it has brought down. Although members of the Labour party take credit for the inauguration of the Commonwealth Bank, I find, from a small pamphlet published by Mr King O'Malley, that he does not give any credit at all to that party. He had to fight his party tooth and nail in connection with the bank's establishment. I was pleased to notice that the man to whom the pamphlet was dedicated is the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). When a conference was held at Brisbane in 1908, three of the gentlemen present supported the establishment of the bank, and, strange to say, they are not to be found to-day in the ranks of the Labour party, but they have become members of the Nationalist party. Therefore, my party has just as much right as the Opposition has to take credit for the establishment of the institution. Both in town and city, in New South Wales, many more homes are badly needed. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned.' i That the House at its rising adjourn until Wednesday next at 3 p.m. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.44] I move That the House do now adjourn. I promised honourable members a week ago that I would try to indicate this afternoon what business would probably be They have made taken during next week, so that they could make their arrangements accordingly. I anticipate that the Commonwealth Bank Bill and the Housing Bill will be proceeded with, and the budget debate may be initiated. In addition, there may be one or two second-reading speeches; but the general debate on the bills thus introduced will not be proceeded with. No measures, other than those I have indicated, will be brought forward. Question resolved in affirmative.
