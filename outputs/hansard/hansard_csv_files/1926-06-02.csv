12,Mr Brtjce (Flinders,"Prime Minis(ADMINISTRATION) BILL . In committee (Consideration resumed from 28th May, vide page 2461). Clause 3Section 11 of the principal act is repealedScciioii proposed lo he repealedNo Crown lands in the Territory shall be sold or disposed of for any estate of freehold, except in pursuance of some contract entered into before thc commencement of tnis act. The honourable inember for Warmon( Mr Rodgers), when supporting the freehold system, said that honourable members of the Opposition, who believe in the leasehold principle, are taking the side of the city against the country. That accusation is narrow"" and unjust. Every common-sense person knows that the interests of the city and the country are so interwoven that, in the scheme of national development, both are equally important. Many years ago a. La.bour government applied the leasehold system to the Northern Territory, and. because I think it more beneficial to the community than freehold, I am opposed to its withdrawal. Honorary Minister defended this bill by saying that men in the Territory should have an opportunity to acquire a piece of land on which to build a home. The evil of unearned increment is not so serious in connection with building blocks as in connection with business areas and broad acres. But, in any case, the freehold of building blocks is already obtainable in the Northern Territory :tnder the system of land tenure established by the South Australian Government. For every block of land bought in Darwin, at an almost nominal price, the purchaser was given 640 acres of land in the country. Those 640-acre blocks can be purchased to-day for £5 each. That apparently is their value under present conditions, and under this b ill the fee-simple of large areas w ill be disposed of by the Commonwealth at equally ridiculous prices. But in time the Northern Territory w ill develop, and the nation w ill then be obliged to buy back this land at exorbitant prices for closer settlement. raised during this debate was that a man going upon leasehold land cannot raise money. The Minister said that some of this land is worth 2s. 6d. an acre. If that is so,a man would require about 5,000 acres in order to get a bank overdraft of £ 1 0 0 . not on the land, but on the improvements. sufficient money with which to carry out improvements he has no need toborrow from the bank. The argument that the freehold is a 'better security upon which to borrow does not apply to land in remote and undeveloped areas. does not understand the difficulties of the man who is trying to develop a holding out-back. that those difficulties are increased when the freehold system has inflated the price of land. In the dairying districts of New South Wales land is so expensive that a man who is able to buy a block has no need to do so, because he is already wealthy enough to retire. Those who do buy find that their produce is not sufficiently valuable to pay a. return on the capital cost of the land. ' The freehold system forces the landholder The into the clutches of the banks and other money-lenders. Under the leasehold system a man with a small amount of capital can take up land, and commence to make a living almost 'immediately. Freehold is a good proposition for men who can buy to-day, and wait for the unearned increment that follows development. In illustration of the amounts expended by governments in the repurchase of land unwisely alienated years ago, I draw the attention of honourable members toa statement in the Gommonwealth Year-Booh, that the value of farms allotted betwen the years 1919 and 1924 inclusive isi New South Wales under the closer settlement policy is £54,624,921, and the total -cost to date of the area acquired by the Government of Victoria during the sarnie period is £24,590,399. Much of that money was expended by the State Governments i u the repurchase of land t h a t was sold years ago at almostnominal prices. I admit that money spent in the repurchase of estates for closer One argument settlement is not a permanent addition to the. national debt, but is repaid by the settlers. Nevertheless, huge sums of money must be borrowed before land can be made available to the settler, who, in turn, is burdened at the outset by a",17,Electoral Law

I agree with the views expressed by the last speaker. The amount of money which is being spent by the New South Wales Government on the resumption of land is enormous, but the price of the land is so high that those who are being placed upon it will never be able to own it. A t a recent sale of leasehold land at Cauberra, the difference between the upset price and the price at which the land was sold was as much as 150 per cent, for some of the blocks.

The anxiety of believe there are other avenues of taxathe Government to abolish the leasehold tion than the land. system has some connection with the proposal to construct a railway through the next 25 years. Whoever guessed, when Territory. The railway is not the only the leasehold system was adopted for the developmental scheme in the hands of the Federal Capital Territory, that so-early Government, for the Public Works Committee is now investigating a proposal to improve the wharfage accommodation at Darwin. If the Government carries out public improvements, the owners of the freeholds will need to do nothing, but pocket the unearned increment. If the land granted to our forefathers in Australia years ago, had been merely leased, the income from it to-day would enable the whole of the pojralation of this country to travel on the railways free of cost, and pay for their construction. Why should there be so much anxiety to abolish the leasehold system ?

If honourable members had taken sufficient interest in the land question, they would have known that, as far back as 120 years ago, the titled owners of land around Belgrade Square, in London, refused to part with the freehold of it . They leased the land, and every year now fine blocks of valuable building's that have been erected on it , are falling into the hands of their descendants. would belong to the Government under the leasehold system. The Duch^of Cornwall, from which the Prince of Wales receives a large income, is maintained on the leasehold system. The adoption of the freehold system for the Northern Territory will hinder development there. If people with, say, £1,200 to £2,000 capital, can get a lease of land there for £ 3 0 a year, it is to their advantage, for they w ill to use the remainder of their capital to build a home on it and stock it. their money on ' land they will have nothing left for developmental purposes.

If the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) had read the bill he would not have talked as he has They done. He has accused the Government of desiring to alienate all the lands in the Northern Territory, but it would be impossible to do so under this bill. The honourable member suggests that the Government has ulterior motives in what it proposes to do, but he measures it with his own bushel and attributes to it the action which he would take himself.

I challenged honourable be able members opposite to produce figures to show that the system has increased progress in Queensland, but they have not But if they have to spend a l l clone so.

In 1915, when the Nationalist party in Queensland went out of office there were in occupation in Queensland 360,049,079 acres. A f t e r the leasehold policy had been in operation in Queensland for nine years, it is proved by the Statistician's figures that there has been a decrease in the area under occupation in Queensland of 25,821,740 acres. These figures knock the bottom out of the contention of the Labour party that the leasehold system is the best system for honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) said that the Government does not know its job.

The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) knows very well that the tropical lands cannot be subdivided and sold to settlers in small blocks.

In the case of town lands and garden lands, the occupier must fence and erect a residence, or improve his holding to a certain amount per acre before he can obtain a freehold.

This is a short bill to amend the A u d it Act 1901-1924. The reason for urgency in its consideration is the recent death of the late Auditor-General. I am sure that every member of the House deplores the death of Mr Israel. All who were associated with him recognize that he was of the highest type of public servant, and performed the duties entru.sted to him with credit to himself and to Australia. He carried the great responsibilities of his high office in a manner which won the approval of succeeding Parliaments of the Commonwealth, and, had his work been better known to the people generally, would equally have won their approval. It is necessary that this b ill should be passed before steps can be taken to appoint his successor. It is contemplated to make considerable change in the conditions under which the office of Auditor-General w ill be held. When the There is provision in the existing act for the appointment of an acting AuditorGenerali n the case of the illness, in capacity, suspension, or absence of the Auditor-General; but there is no power under the .act to appoint an acting Auditor-General when there is no A u d i tor-General.

27,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Ministernew Auditor-General, and this must be done at once, because a great deal of work has to be done by the Auditor General to enable the financial machinery of the Commonwealth to operate. Consequently, the passing of this measure cannot be delayed, and I have to ask the House to regard it as an urgent measure. By the existing A u d it Act it is provided that^The Auditor-General shall hold his offiee during good behaviour, ,and shall not be removed therefrom unless an address praying for such removal shall be presented to .the Governor General by tlie Senate and House of Bepresentatives respectively in the same session of the Parliament. There is no other provision for the removal of the Auditor-General, and that provision would be applied only if the conduct of the Auditor-General were such that both Houses of Parliament felt that he should be removed. But honourable members are aware that when a man has given long and valuable Service to the Commonwealth, and his powers are f a i ling, from his office, because to do so would appear to be a reflection upon him. No honourable member would desire to take action to remove from office an honoured and tried public servant because his powers were declining and he himself was not cognizant of that fact. The difficulty for which we must provide regarding the Auditor-General has occurred in other countries where high appointments are held under life tenure. For example, members of a judiciary have remained on the bench beyond the period of their usefulness. To remove the possibility of this in regard to any occupant of the office of Auditor-General, the amending bill provides that he shall cease to hold ofiice on attaining the age of 65 years. This alteration of the act w ill in no way l i m it the absolute freedom of the Auditor-Generalf r o m in terference, or place any sort of political control on him. He w ill still be removable from office only when an address praying for his removal is .presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Representatives in the same session of Parliament. instead of having a life tenure of office, he must retire at the age of 65 years. Under the A u d it Act there is no provision for a. pension for the Auditor General, and it is not proposed to alter the law in that respect. The Public Service superannuation scheme was brought into operation many years after the Audit Act was passed; but, in future, those holding the position of Auditor General will be public servants, (subscribing to the Superannuation Fund. Future Auditors-General will be i u the same position as other Commonwealth civil servants. Theb i ll provides for an increase of the annual salary of the Auditor-Generalf r o m £1,500 to £1,750. The original act provides that the Auditor-General shall receive a salary of £1,000 a year. In 1920 a new item appeared in the annual Estimates providing for the amount of £500 to be' paid to the AuditorGenerali n addition to his statutory salary. In 1924, after the present Government came into office, the A u d it Act was amended, increasing the salary of the Auditor-General from £1.000 to £1,500. As I have already explained, the Auditor-General sliould not be subject to Government control, and it is therefore not it is difficult to remove him desirable that this officer should have one-third of his annual remuneration provided for in the Estimates presented to Parliament by the Government. The suggestion was made in 1924, when the amending bill was before the House, that there should be an increase in the remuneratiion pf the Auditor-General, but it was then felt that as the salary of the gentleman then occupying the office had been increased from £1.000 to £1,500, and as he had a life tenure of the position, there was no immediate need for an alteration. Now that the life tenure of the office is to be abolished, and its occupant is to retire at the age of 65 years, the Government feels that some increase in his remuneration should be made, and it is now contemplated to increase the salary from £1,500 to £1.750 a year. When the salary of £1,000 was fixed, the total expenditure to be audited by the Auditor-General's Department was something like £11,000,000. The Auditor-General to-day is faced with an expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue of about £70,000,000, a tremendous increase. In addition, the CoonmonBut, wealth has taken over a great number of activities, such as navigation, lighthouses, quarantine, the Northern Territory, and the administration of the old age and invalid pensions system, which it did not control when the original act was passed. This, of course, greatly increases the resjjonsibility of the Auditor General. The war. also, has left to us many legacies which place a great obligation on him. Those include war service homes administration, repatriation, soldier settlement, war pensions, and theadministration of the mandated territories under the Treaty of Versailles. Then there has been an expansion of the Commonwealtli railways; the accounts of the Commonwealth Bank are audited by the Auditor-General, and so, too, are those of the Commonwealth Shipping Line and the Cockatoo dockyard. tion of a permanent head of a department can be reviewed any year upon the Estimates, if there has been an expansion of the activities of that department which greatly increases his sibilities; but the salary of the Auditor General is a statutory appropriation which cannot be varied without au alteration of the law. honourable members for having to rush this bill through the House; but if a new Auditor-General were appointed before the bill were passed, he would have the right to hold office for life, and uo outside arrangement made with him would be binding upon him or upon the Government. I agree with bhe right honourable the Prime Minister that this is an urgent measure. We all regret the circumstance that has made it so, because the late Auditor-General( Mr Israel) was a good and f a it h f u l servant of the country. He carried out his work fearlessly and without favour, and his reports have, on various occasions, been of considerable help to honourable members. This bill provides for an increase of the salary o.f the Auditor General, and for his retirement at the age of 65 years. The Prime Minister has given very good reasons for increasing the salary of the office. He pointed out that, hitherto, the Auditor-General has enjoyed a life tenure of office, and could be removed only after both houses of Parliament had passed addresses praying the Governor General to remove him. generally deprecate increasing the salaries of high officials, it seems to me that in this case it is justified. The person appointed to this office may not have many years to bold it before reaching the age of 65 years, and we should make the salary commensurate w it h the work performed. Very few officers in the Public Service have greater responsibilities than the Auditor-General. The concerns of the Commonwealth Government have grown enormously since the war, and of necessity the .responsibility of the A u d itor-General has been increased. The Government's decision to provide for the retirement of the Auditor-General at the age of 65 years is wise. It is a great mistake to permit men to remain in office when they are no longer capable of performing their duties. I am entirely in The remuneraagreement with the b ill .

A f t e r our experience during the last few years, especially since 1919, I am confident that if those who were responsible for the original legislation had anticipated the trouble it would cause, they would have preferred to increase the rate of income tax, rather than meddle w it h this very complicated for m of taxation. I do not think there is any other act on the statutefor misbehaviour book so complicated in its various forms as the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act of 1917, particularly the secAlthoughI tions relating to the primary industries. However applicable such legislation may be to manufacturing and other settled industries in the cities, which are not subject to extreme variations of trade, it has been found almost impracticable to apply",21,Second Reading

30,Mr Hunter (Maranoa) [4.20],"it to the pastoral industry, for the reason that very few pastoralists, other than incorporated companies, kept books prior to the passing of the Federal Income Tax Act in 1915. The War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act made it necessary, in some instances, to get particulars of income as far back as 190S, but of the pre-war years there was practically no record. Othei' factors that hinder the application of this for m of taxation to the pastoral industry droughts, business. is every second year, w it h the result that in one year the income is small, and in the next year big. In all rura l industries, long periods of depression are sometimes followed by a rise in prices for two or three years. Many hardships have been created by this taxation. number of primary producers made a great deal of money during the war, but they were mainly those, who sold out and retired. Few who are engaged in a paying industry feel disposed to sell out: the more the money they are making the longer they hang on. Those men who did sell out escaped with their profits, but the men who bought in at high prices have been sorry ever since, and have suffered, most severely from the slump in the markets for primary products. Of course, when they bought, they expected to make big profits, but the high prices which prevailed during war-time were not maintained, and all the profits made during the few prosperous years disappeared in the years following the wav. As a result of the H i gh Court judgment in the Cameron case, the standard values of stock fixed by the Commissioner for the different States were declared illegal, and every assessment in respect of income became null and void. in which himself complexities of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act, whjch was so little understood in or out of the department, that during the year in which it was first imposed very little could be done to put it into operation. I speak from practical experience. PerhapsI may claim to have as good a head as the average man in my profession, and I admit that I never properly understood the act: very few men did. Indeed', it was not comprehended by the taxation officers in tbe capital cities, and those who had to do business with the department could never get down to bedrock. In the circumstances those like myself who were engaged in making up assessments, did the best they could in the interests of their clients, and simply told them that the best thing they could do was to pay. are the occurrence of And most persons did pay. The judgand the fluctuations of ments given by the High Court in the In the cattle industry it various appeal cases exposed the act in a not unusual to sell only in new light. Taxpayers ancl departmental officials began to get a better idea of the meaning of its complicated provisions. One effect of the judgments was to disclose that some people had been assessed wrongly, that some should not have paid any tax, and that A large others were liable for less than the amount they had been required to pay. This necessitated those considerable refunds to which the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) referred. The classification of the act happened only after all the assessments had been . issued and most of the taxes had been paid; consequently, the refunds had to be made in subsequent years when very little money was being collected! That explains the apparent anomaly mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra that more money was refunded in one year than was collected. The act of 1924 enabled many people to' have their assessments reopened. Had the time allowed for objections not expired, many people would have protested against their assessments and obtained refunds in the ordinary course. But the amending act, by giving them an opportunity to make a new valuation of their stock, enabled them also to take advantage of the legal benefits which the High Court judgment and war-time profits tax had conferred. As the old standard The quandary values had been declared illegal, the 1924 the Commissioner found act gave taxpayers the right to have their was accentuated by the assessments altered by electing to have their stock taken into account at a valuation to be electee] by them within certain limits. If they did uot so elect, the valuations were to be taken at the old assessments. The limits were those imposed in the Income Tax Assessment Acti n respect of bred stock, but were extended to apply to all stock, whether bred or bought. There was an implied option of the existing value or valuation within certain limits. Taxpayers were allowed only four months after the passing of that act in which to make an election as to the method of valuation they would accept. Thisb ill allows all those who made no such election to do so. The commission is continually sending ont assessments to newly-found taxpayers who had not previously been assessed. section IB provides that in respect of such new assessments, the commissioner may call upon the taxpayer to elect to have his stock valued within certain limits. If a person entitled to elect under subsection IA does not make an election, he shall be deemed to have accepted the existing assessments, and under proposed section 3A, if a person entitled to elect under sub-section IB fails to make an election, the stock shall be assessed at the market selling value. I shall now reply to some of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) last Friday week. I compliment him on the studious way in which he examines all taxation bills, but I think he made a few mistakes in his criticism. He said that the bill dors not exfceud the provisions of the 1924 act. The 1924 act gave all taxpayers, up to the date of that act, the right to assess their stock at elected valuns. The bill gives the right to all who, b\ lapse of time, may have missed the benefiU of the 1924 act, to have thenstock taken at elected valu%s. Taxpayers assessed after the passing of the 1924 act, and before the passing of the bill, w ill have the same right of election, as those assessed under the 1924 act. the matter of election, therefore, the provisions of the 1924 act are the same as those of the bill, but there is one seemi n j : difference. If no election was made under tbe 1924 act, taxpayers were decnned to accept the existing values j but in ihe bill it is deemed that those who have been assessed accept the existing values, while those who have not been assessed cannot be deemed to have accepted the existing values, because they cannot be deemed to have accepted an illegal value. sioner will assess their stock at market value. The so-called "" market value "" is not an option, unless it may be termed an implied option. Seeing that the commissuner cannot impose values that are. illegal, although they may be fair, we Mr Hunter. may assume that in fixing so-called market values for new assessments he w ill generally fix values which have passed muster hitherto. If a taxpayer objects he will have to prove that what the commissioner says is the market value is. not the market value. The honourable member for Yarra also said that certain clauses of the bill are contradictory. I Proposed subdo not agree that that is so. He referred to certain differences between the minimum and maximum values under the act and in the b ill . He should not have used the words "" m in i m u m "" and "" maximum,"" but rather "" highest in one State"" and "" lowest in another State."" the honourable member have the same meaning as those used by me. same meaning, because to those unfamiliar with the act it would appear from the honourable member's words that something unfair was intended. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) did, in fact, make an interjection that showed that he thought something unfai r had been done by the introduction of fresh so called minimum and maximum values. The varying values taken by the commissioner really made no difference. If we apply these so-called minimum and maximum values to any one State, we see that there is not much disparity. In Queensland, for instance, the old minimum for sheep was 9s., and the new minimum is 2s. 6 d . ; the old maximum was 9s., the same as the minimunj, and the new maximum is 10s. For cattle, In the old minimum was £ 3 , the new minimum 10s.; the old maximum £ 3 , and the new maximum £ 5 . For horses the old minimum was £ 4 , the new minimum 15s.; the old maximum £ 4 , and the new maximum £ 3 . For pigs, the old minimum was 15s., the new minimum 5s. ; the old maximum 15s., and the new maximum 20s. There is a greater disparity under the b ill between the minimum and maximum values than there was previously, because previously the maximum and minimum values were In such cases the commisalike-9s . for sheep, £ 3 for cattle, and £ 4 for horses. The value of sheep under the bill may vary from 2s. 6d. to 10s. The bill gives a much wider range of values.

Yarra( Mr Scullin) said that as market value could be taken for income-tax purposes, it should also be possible to take it for war-time profits tax jmrposes. practice market values are not applicable in war-time profits tax administration the country. for the city, where businesses go on year after year without a great deal of variation ; but in the country the market value may be at one figure to-day and at quite a different figure in a week's time. Income Tax Assessment Act gives the taxpayer values; taken plus an allowance for the increase at a certain value. why the market value proposition be adopted for war-time profits tax purposes, as it can for income-tax is that the income-tax period only goes back to 1915, whereas the war-time profittax period covers, for the purposes of comparison, before the war. It would be absolutely impossible to find out the market of stock over those three years. If taxpayers were given an option in the Mr Hunter. matter, as suggested by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), him. not many would take advantage of it . To show how impossible it would be to fix a satisfactory market value for stock in that period, honourable members need only for him, immediately consider for a moment the relative value he had bought his property of stock in the f a r north-west of Queensand the slump came, and land and in thc more favoured parts in himself with a £40,000 the south-east where I live. and a property valued at the owner to put a market value on his It is a own stock? to do he has to stick to, and he has to The great majority of prove that the value he has set down as the market value is the market value, I think I may say that the which it is almost impossible for him to do. Differences in districts is not the I speak from practical experience. only difficulty. There are differences in the class of stock. It may suit one man to say, "" My stock are worth £ 2 a, head,"" accuwhereas the next man may say. "" My If a man makes £1,000, £2,000, stock are worth, only £1 a head."" Differences in age have also to be taken info consideration. People w ill pay more for £2,000, stock at some ages than at others. Then, again, sheep which are worth 35s. a head in f u l l wool are not worth so much The honourable member for just after they have been shorn. During the war period the wool on a sheep was worth 20s. If the carcass were worth 15s., it would not be so very wrong to take But in 10s. as the value just after shearing. So many different considerain tions enter into the matter that it is The basis may be all right almost impossible to fix the market value. A t present people who have sheep in the north-west of Queensland would probably give them away to any one who would The undertake to do anything for them. But, notwithstanding all the difficulties the option of taking market in fixing market values, I think the but the real value may be Treasurer might stretch a point and allow the option, so that the conditions could be The reason uniform w it h the Income Tax Act. X o cannot difficulty would be caused by allowing the option. I am sure that no one would purposes, accept the market values basis, for ihe simple reason that, before the war, there was a long period of depression when values were very low; and, if the taxthe period of three years payers elected to lake the war-time value, fhey would also ha.ve to take the pre-war value value, aud, in consequence, pay a considerably larger tax.

40,"Mr Hunter,","Whateve r he electsmight appear to persons who are not familiai' with the subject that the contention of the honourable member for Yarra that the conditions applicable to income tax assessment should bo applicable also to war-time profits tax assessment, but you cannot have uniform conditions, for you cannot get the same basis of comparison. A t least, there is only one way by whicli you can get it , and that is by arbitrarily fixing the value of tlie stock. Seeing that the great majority of persons assessed for income tax. and also the great majorit y assessed for war-time profits tax. have already paid their tax and tlie matter is closed, it would be a hardship on thein, as well as on the Taxation Department, if every case were re-opened now. ( Mr Scullin) has contended that, because one value of the stock has been retained for i&come tax purposes, it could easily be stated for war-time profit tax purposes. He may argue that the Commissioner of Taxes could say to a taxpayer, "" This is tlie value of your stock as shown in your income tax return; so we w ill adopt it as the basis for your war-time profits tax assessment."" But many considerations have to be borne in mind. For instance, the amount of capital invested may have varied before and after the war, and so may the amount of borrowed monev. The matter is so complicated that it is almost impossible for one who is not well informed about it to understand it . reason why a uniform basis of comparison is not possible is that the basis of the war-time profit tax lies in the pre^var years, while the income tax did not come into operation u n t i l 1015. The only way for , a taxpayer to get at the position properly Avould be to go back to the time when he started with stock, say in 190S. He knew what he paid for them, and allowing for the increase, he can show the value of them at the end of the year. He will thus work up from year to year, right to the time when the tax was first levied. mation shown in the income tax returns there is nothing to prevent the taxpayers for those years ? come tax did not come into operation' certain that uot one will do so, because until 1915.

If it is illegal and is not refunded, those who dispute it can go to the H i g h Court and appeal against it . If they do that, the commissioner knows enough to combat any such endeavour.

The Treasurer has led this House to believe that ifc well nigh impossible to levy taxation on the basis of market values alone, or to review over a period of years past valuations of stock. seems strange that the Treasurer is able to ascertain over a period of years the market value of stock in respect of losses but not in respect of capital and profits..

81,Mr Makin,"I would like the Treaattention to the unfair position in which new businesses are placed by this legislation. All businesses have the right to take the pre-war standard for their capi. tal, but new businesses that have not a pre-war standing are at a distinct disadvantage; they are not even permitted to return the value they have had to pay for their stocks; they have to select a valuation between certain prescribed limits. That seems to be unjust. places a new business in a very false position, for it has had to pay an enhanced value for its stock, and yet has to accept a reduced figure under the scheme of valuation which the department allows. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) referred to the wide discrepancy between the values that the Treasurer set down as f a i r ; I do not think those values were over-generous, but we find there has been a substantial reduction of them in the limits within which taxpayers may elect. I ask the Treasurer to extend these limits to cover the prices actually paid by taxpayers for ' their stock. The honourable member for Yarra made out a very clear case when he compared the standard values with those from which the taxpayer is to be required to make his election. Returned soldiers who are partners in a business are still suffering certain ship in existence before the partner eninjustices under this legislation. war and war-time profits are to be calculated alike, but from each must be deducted the amount of income tax that would be 'paid on the particular income, according to whether it was jointly or severally earned. Section 15, sub-sections 4 and 5, govern this. period a man could be exempted from income tax, but had to pay war-time profits tax. that if a man paid no income tax, there is to be no deduction under section 15, subsections 4 and 5 from his war-time profits tax. the effect of making the aggregate wartime profits tax more than it would have been if an individual partner had never enlisted. Under section 8, sub-section 3, the particular partner obtained a refund of his portion, but the other partners paid more than they would have paid had the first partner not enlisted. This bill gives relief in those cases in which the partnership did not receive a refund under section 8. The Taxation Commissioner Yes . I desire to draw says that the act does not permit him to rectify the anomaly, and if this bill is passed in its present form, one particular partnership, whose circumstances have been brought to my notice, w ill pay £ 1 0 0 more in taxation by reason of the fact that one of the partners went on active service.

Much confusion has arisen because principles have not been applied uniformly. As the honourable member for Yarra pointed out, the war-time profits tax is really a super-income tax, and, that being so. I cannot understand why this departure should be made, unless the object is to confuse the minds of. taxpayers. 1 listened to the attempt of the honourable inember for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) to explain why the war-time profits tax should not be calculated on the same basis as the income tax.

None of the arguments advanced wil l induce me to agree to different methods in two acts that have such an intimate relation. I hope It is singular that ihat, even at this belated hour, the Government will agree to rectify the errors of the past, and will not continue to calculate fictitious profits on fictitious values that are not equitable. Great as have been the difficulties in administering the War-Time Profits Tax Assessment Act, no right of appeal against the interpretations of the Taxation Commissioner has been allowed. There is a right of appeal to a board against interpretations by the Commissioner under the Income Tax Assessment Act ; but if a taxpayer feels that an interpretation of the WarTime Profits Tax Assessment Act operates harshly towards him and in a He way not intended by the Parliament, there is no authority to which he can appeal. The Commissioner is a power unto himself; his word is final. A l though many taxpayers feel that they have serious grievances, they have no remedy. Provision should be made for a The personal knowright of appeal against interpretations of the Commissioner. I suggest that the board that hears income tax appeals should hear war-time profits tax appeals.

99,Mr Makin,"The true values, asgrievance. It is very difficult for a layman to grasp the legal technicalities of legislation of this kind. The bill should impress honourable members with the need for simpler legislation. We cannot expect people to obey the law if it is impossible for them to understand what the law means. Our method of framing legislation may be of advantage to eminent lawyers, but it causes great loss to the taxpayer, who has to test the validity of an act of Parliament by the expensive process of an appeal to the courts. It frequently happens t h a t , a taxpayer who succeeds in such an appeal has to pay more in costs than the amount of the judgment. strange to me that so many years after the expiration of this tax amending legislation of this character, applicable to pastoralists, should be necessary. I should like an assurance that the bill will not be retrospective in its application act was amended, and the then Treasurer, to the genera] body of pastoralists. If it deals only with cases that have not been completed by the department, I am content; but if it allows the Commissioner to re-open assessments submitted five or more years ago, there is room for pro^ test. The war-time profits tax fell heavily on the small pastoralists who started operations only a few years before the passing of the original act. Those who were making large profits before the war were able to take two years out of the six years preceding the war to represent a pre-war standard. were making £10,000 a year were not seriously affected, for they paid the tax only on the excess profits over pre-war profits; but the small pastoralists, who made little or no profits in the years preceding the war, were taxed very heavily. My reading of the proposed new subsection In of section 2 is that the Commissioner will be able to re-open old cases. I hope that is not the intention. I am glad to see that in an amendment to be moved by the Treasurer, further concessions will be made to returned soldiers. Still greater concessions should be made to them. I find that a number of honourable members extend very little sympathy to the pastoralist who has to pay taxation, not on his average profits, but on his profits each year. A fte r paying taxation on £1,000 one year, he may make a loss of an equal amount the next year. The Treasurer may remember that the Taxation Commission reported that one of our big pastoral organizations actually paid more income tax to the Commonwealth over a period of seven years than the whole of its profits in the same period. The pastoralists are certainly a section of the community which should be given consideration. In connection with my appeal that further consideration should be given to the returned soldier, let me refer to the exemptions that have been granted. The original War-time Profits Tax Assessment A ct provided that the business ol any person taking commissions in respect of any transactions or services rendered, It is should be taxed, The meaning of that provision was that any ordinary agent who made a big profit had to pay war-time profits taxation according as his profit was above the pre-war standard. The following year the the right honourable inember for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) was responsible for having all the words that I read struck out and a new exemption included as f o l lows :' (j) any agency (in which little or no capital expenditure is required) to the extent to which the commissioner is satisfied that the profits arise from commission in respect of purchases, sales, leases, loans, insurances, or collections of moneys made on behalf of any other person. In other words, an agent whose business did uot require the investment of a large Thus, men who amount of capital to enable it to be carried on could make £5,000, £10,000, or even £100,000 profit annually without being obliged to pay war-time profits t a x ; but the soldier was obliged to pay wartime profits tax on any big profits made in his business even while he was at the front. I suggest that he should receive exemption for the period he was absent at the war. If possible, even more consideration should be given to the ex-soldier. During the war enormous commission was made on goods sold in Melbourne and sent to Sydney, and then sent back from Sydney to Melbourne, and no war-time profits tax was claimed on it . In these circumstances, surely the pastoralists and the ex-soldiers should be given the consideration that they deserve. We should go as f a r as we possibly can in granting exemptions to ex-soldiers. We should not be doing too much if we",33,Eahle Page Woul D The Honor

Both measures were designed to relieve certain persons of hardship, and not to increase the incidence of the war-time profits tax. In consequence of the Cameron judgment, war-time profits aud income taxpayers were forced ""from the invalid departmental assessments which had been made in their cases, to the basis of market value, which was declared to be the only valid basis on which assessments could be levied. The 1924 bill was brought down to enable them to choose either selected or market values as the basis of their assessments. It has been suggested that the present bill would be more acceptable if the market 'values option were included. "" The Government has no hesitation in accepting that suggestion, and I have circulated an amendment which will give effect to it. But the fact is that the amendment will be of no value, for it will not be used to any extent. When I spoke on the second reading of the 1924 bill I said that probably no one would avail themselves of the opportunity of accepting the market value basis. I find .that since then there have been twenty cases in which persons have selected it. This bill was brought down because many people had failed to learn that they had the opportunity to choose the selected value oasis which is incorporated in the previous act. hundreds of miles away from civilization in the back-blocks of north-west Australia, others live in Queensland, and others in the Northern Territory. They represented that the four months granted by the 1924 act to enable them, to exercise the option that was allowed, was altogether too short. Others said that although they were aware that they might exercise the option, the time allowed was not sufficient for thom to consider whether it would be more profitable for them to elect selected values than to remain under the old assessment. In consequence of these representations this bill was introduced. Its object is to remove any injustice or hardship that certain taxpayers may have suffered through their inability to exercise the option which was given them in the act If this had been realized by honourable members, they would not have addressed themselves to the measure as they have done. Everybody must agree that the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act is most difficult to interpret, and that it has caused serious hardship to some taxpayers. I can assure honourable members that, as Treasurer, I had no desire to introduce another amending bill. I should have been glad to let the matter rest, but I introduced this measure purely for the purpose of allowing more even-handed justice to be dealt out to taxpayers who felt that they were suffering under an intolerable hardship. there will be no more measures of the kind. with this bill has daunted my enthusiasm in introducing remedial legislation like itbe no more war to render such measures necessary. -members would realize that the object of the bill is to avoid any unfair distinction between taxpayers already assessed under the 1924 act. and those to be assessed, they would willingly pass it. Tlie desire of both the Government and. the Commissioner of Taxation is to treat taxpayers equitably. The reason why no provision was made for allowing a market value option to the taxpayers concerned was Some of them live that it was considered impossible, because of the inherent difficulty of determining market values. I have been reading the debate on the 1924 bill, and I can see now from the exchanges between myself and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that we were at cross purjjoses. I was drawing a distinction between the ordinary Income Tax Assessment Act and the two remedial measures-the Income Tax Assessment Live Stock Bill, which was designed to remedy disabilities revealed by the Cameron judgment, and the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill. In the Income Tax Assessment Act there were three alternatives. I was not worrying about the",34,Eahle Page Woul D The Honor

The distinction is that iu the case of the former market values were allowed as an alternative, and in the other they were not. market values alternative is not allowed in the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act becaiise of the extreme difficulty there would be in determining market values as far back as 1908. It must be remembered that pastoral properties change hands a good deal, and many pastoralists do not keep proper books. doubt that the amendment which w ill be made by the insertion of the new clause 3 a, in order to give the market values alternative, will be of very little use. The only possible way that market values could be determined would be by agreement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner or by referring the matter to the law courts. Refereuce to specific transactions is the only effective way of deterjust as much entitled to it as are those mining the matter. The honourable member for Yarra said that there was an unfair distiction made between those who would be dealt with under one sub-clause of this measure and the people who were dealt with under the existing act. But that is not so. I should like to say that the difference between the standard values of the past and the regulation values of the present is very small. There may have been some difference between the maxima and miuima it is true, but it is in the middle values that the choice will probably be made, and in that case there will not be very much in it . That really disposes of that aspect of the argument of the honourable member for Yarra. As the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter), dealt at considerable length with stock ratesa subject with which he is very familiar from practical experience-ther e is no necessity for me to deal with it . position of the ex-soldier. Here again we are taking advantage of the opportunity to rectify some injustices that have become apparent. Some of the anomalies that we are dealing with could not be ascertained except through working out figures in specific cases. Those that had been revealed when the previous amending bill was before Parliament were rectified. covered cases such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). man who was in a partnership but went to the front, and so did not pay income taxation, but actually had to pay more taxation through the war-time profits tax than his partner paid who did not go to The the war, and paid income taxation in the ordinary way, but no war-time profits taxation. It has since been found that certain soldiers in Victoria and South Australia who were exempt from State income tax were put in an unfavorable position under the war-time profits tax provisions. The amendment that has been 1 have no introduced now is designed to meet those cases. The position of ex-soldiers who became partners in undertakings' after they went away is more difficult. Now that the war is over, and we are looking retrospectively on the position, the difficulty is to find a form of words to express what is' intended without including some who are not entitled to the relief proposed, and excluding others who are mentioned. Any one who studies the existing act w ill admit that it is sufficiently complicated. This very point has been discussed with taxation officials, and they cannot suggest any simple form of words that will express what is intended. Any one who reads the list of amendments proposed will admit that simplicity is not a distinguishing .characteristic of the act. The honourable member for Y a r ra on a previous occasion quoted a section of it , but, apparently did not grasp the whole of its meaning. He ' accused me subsequently of trying to deceive the House, because I assumed that his reading of the section made it clear to honourable members what the act really meant. The anomaly arising from a man being levied on for war-time profits tax for the last year of the war is one which I am afraid must continue to exist. The other points raised during the debate can be dealt with I pass now to the in committee. It is the intention of the Government to t r y to give every one an absolutely f a i r deal.. That is the reason why these measures are submitted. The House can rest assured that it is not the intention of the Government to r i p open all the old assessments for the purpose of an inquisition into old transactions, as suggested by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). What the GovernThe amendments at that time ment is trying to do is to conclude this long-drawn out business.

There was a good deal of objection to the proposals, because of that limitation. A referendum was taken, and the proposals were defeated. The present proposals came as a surprise, not only to me, but also to the community generally, because no one anticipated that the Government would ask for an amendment of the Constitution at this stage. When the House adjourned for the recent Easter recess, nothing was said regarding an amendment of the Constitution, but, just on the eve of the reassembling of Parliament, we were told that the Government intended to ask for certain amendments of the Constitution. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has stated repeatedly that the Government intends to hold a constitutional session at Canberra next year, and I contend that this referendum should be deferred until we have dealt fully with the whole question, of amending the Constitution.

Why put the taxpayers of this country to the expense of two referendums, costing from £80,000. to £100,000, when one would suffice? surer's referendum on new States? pose, be included among the subjects to be discussed at the constitutional session to be held at Canberra. ment's proposals should have remained in abeyance until the people could be asked to clothe this Parliament with proper powers. It is absolutely necessary that the Statesshould be consulted before any referendum to amend the Constitution is submitted to the people. Unless there is such a consultation, we are riding for a fall, and our efforts are doomed to failure. State parliamentary representatives are elected by the people who elect us. Are vve not one people with one destiny ? How ran we expect the States to view kindly a proposal to amend the Constitution when they have not been consulted in the matter ? Mr .WATT -The Fisher Government did not consult the States in 1911 and 1913. consulted in 1915 by the then Labour Government, and, as I have already stated, a certain promise was given which was not carried out. There is always the possibility of obtaining from the States concessions that will obviate the necessity of submitting a referendum to the people. In any case, it is an act of courtesy to approach the State Governments when an amendment of the Constitution is mooted. In January, 1912, a conference was held. after the referendum? 1913 referendum was taken. We were preparing for the taking of the referendum in 1913 at the expiration of Parliament. The right honourable member now representing North Sydney in 1912 convened a conference, at which five States were represented. Two of them favoured Commonwealth control of industrial disputes, the regulation of the prices of protected goods, and the regulation and nationalization of interstate monopolies. These proposals were modified to permit the Commonwealth to control disputes of an interstate character, with power to provide for the common rule. The State of South Australia was not represented at the conference, and she repudiated this arrangement. If , in 1912, five of the States were prepared to give certain concessions to the Commonwealth, why should they not, if they were now approached, The Governcome to some arrangement with the Commonwealth, in view of the fact that the whole question of amending the Constitution is to be considered in twelve months' time? 1919 surely does not make the honourable member optimistic. should not refer to past happenings.

126,Mr Charlton,"It is difficult to be facilitated in every possible way. Unions desiring to approach the Arbitration Court should not be prohibited from doing so unless they will magnify their grievance into an interstate dispute. Yet every previous attempt to get for the Commonwealth Parliament the additional power that is now sought has failed. Uniformity throughout Australia of working conditions and wages is an absolute necessity. This country cannot progress if different sets of conditions obtain in the various States. The continuance of such a state of affairs will be a menace to the workers. Competition plays a most important part in the determination of working conditions, and if in one State the workers' have been able to obtain shorter hours and better wages than rule in the same industry in a neighbouring State, the manufacturers in the former State will be at a disadvantage; they will represent their disabilities to the Arbitration Court, and the tendency will be towards a levelling down rather than a levelling up of conditions. It is not contended for a moment that if this Parliament is granted the power it seeks it will interfere with every phase of industry in a State. Our desire is to apply the Commonwealth power to national or inter' state problems only, leaving the others still within the jurisdiction of the States. This does not involve any step towards unification. We are not asking that the Federal Parliament shall monopolize all powers, or even take complete control of industrial matters. All that is sought is power to legislate where Federal intervention is necessary in the interests of the whole Commonwealth. Therefore, I do not expect that any persons will be found opposing the first amendment. second amendment is the insertion after paragraph xxxrx. of the following provision :Establishing authorities with such powers as the Parliament confers on them with respect to the regulation and determination of terms and conditions of industrial employment, and »f rights and duties of employers and employees with respect to industrial matters and things. It seems strange that the Government should take action at this stage to establish such authorities. I do not agree with those who say that the establishment of industrial authorities will mean the surrender of any of the powers of this Parliament. This amendment will merely enable this Parliament to submit any question, whether it relates to working hours, the basic wage, motherhood endowment, or any such subject, to the Commonwealth authority., The Government is proposing to give the judges of the Arbitration Court life tenure, and the only reason urged is that, unless they have such tenure, all appeals must be to the High Court. The Prime Minister said that the terms and conditions of industrial employment, and the rights and duties of employers and employees are economic and industrial questions. That is true, and the proposed authority will be required to decide what is an adequate working week and a sufficient basic wage. The decision of the authority will then become a general rule. If the general rule sets up a working week of 44 hours, that limit will be the maximum, not the minimum. The tribunal may still award shorter hours in any industry, if it thinks the circumstances warrant it. Sewer miners, men working in the tropical parts of Queensland, and others, might be awarded a week of 40 hours. I differ from the Prime Minister's statement that the jurisdiction in this matter is being placed beyond the reach of Parliament, and that there is nothing political in this proposal. It presents the policy of the Government in regard to the management of industrial matters; but any other party that may be returned to power in the future will be able, under this provision, to give effect to its policy, whatever that policy may be. This is a provision, not for appointing judges with a life tenure, but for establishing authorities, and any party The can establish authorities to investigate and give etffect to its policy. Would it not be proper for any party in power to do so 1 authority is only a buffer to save the Government from the criticism of its friends. but no one can mistake the language of the bill. Power is proposed to be given, as it should be, to this Parliament to appoint any tribunal it likes to investigate any big national industrial question and make a general rule.

That provision is contingent on the other That may be so, for two being carried. No one would take exception to this Parliament being able to vest State authorities w i th power to deal with industrial disputes. The day has arrived when we should have conciliation committees in the different States to intervene in industrial disputes. We the honourable ought not to wait unti l a dispute has occurred before taking action; but when there are symptoms of a dispute, an authority appointed for the purpose I contend that any should intervene and adjust matters. It may be necessary, as the Prime Minister has said, to appoint courts in other It may appoint authoStates, to expedite the hearing of industrial . cases. Nothing is more neY e s ; the Parliacessary in the industrial life of this country than expedition in handling industrial disputes. Every honourable member knows of the delays that have occurred in the hearing of applications before the Arbitration Court. The wonder is that the men have been patient enough to submit to the system. They have had to wait for two years for the hearing of some of their plaints. Honourable members should welcome the provision to permit of disputes being in vestigated in a reasonable time in the States in which they arise, instead of making the parties travel to Melbourne or Canberra. The Prime Minister said that a court might be established in Western Australia; b u t he will probably find that courts will be needed in the other States, too. I do not wish it to be understood that. I am speaking about disputes within the States. The State parliaments can handle many disputes without our interference; but we ought to have power to settle the big questions that affect the relations of employers and employees. The next provision relates toTrusts and combinations in restraint of trade, trade unions, and associations of employers or of employees for industrial purposes, including honorablo the formation, dissolution, regulation and control thereof. AlthoughI am not a It is necessary that we should have power over trusts and combinations in restraint The. next proof trade; but the proposal does not go f a r enough, nor even so far as the previous proposals.

If it can be shown that the bringing about of a close combination has reduced the cost of living, and has been in the interests of the people, it is in a different category from a combination which exists for the purpose of increasing prices and accumulating wealth at the expense of the public. I do not think this provision is wide enough to enable us to legislate for undesirable combinations. A corporation is generally a large company established within a State, and as such we have no power to control it. porations can carry on their business to the detriment of the public without let or hindrance from this Parliament. Is that in the best interests of the community? I was surprised that the Prime Minister devoted only a few sentences of his speech to this phase of the subject; but he had much to say about the control of trade unions. The time has arrived when this Parliament is as urgently in need of powers over big corporations and monopolies as it is in need of powers to make industrial legislation. Why is the Government so vigorous in pushing the industrial side of this question, although it does not go so far as it should on the other side?

If it is necessary 'for this Parliament to have full power over industrial matters, it is equally necessary that it should have power to control combines, monopolies and corporations. The Government would be wise to defer the taking of this referendum; but if a referendum is to be taken, it should go beyond the fringe of the question. Why not obtain from the people full power to control combines, monopolies and corporations ? Why go only half way, and baulk at the rest? There appears to be no genuine reason why we should not go the whole wa} .T Surely no honourable The result is that cormember will say that we should not have the power to regulate corporations, combines and monopolies that may raise their heads to the detriment of the people. If they are operating iu a way that is hindering the progress of Australia, we should have power to deal with them. Yet we are not asking the people for it. Why is that? It is all very Well to say that this is not a party question; but honourable members opposite have dealt with it in their party meeting. They may talk about the Labour party caucus, but they also have a party meeting. Everybody knows that there is a great difference of opinion among honourable members opposite on this matter. ago, when a Labour Government submitted to the people a number of constitutional questions covering the matters referred to in the bill, their most bitter opponents were honourable members who are to-day supporting the Government. One can easily visualize what happened upstairs in the party room. There was, no doubt, a difference of opinion, ancT a decision had to be made as to how far the Government could go and yet retain the unanimous support of its followers. A halt had to be made somewhere, and it was made at a point which ensured that the Government supporters would be unanimous. Corporations were excluded from the proposals.

But why was the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr employers that it desires to deal with Bruce) almost altogether directed to the question of the control of trade unions?

Power to deal with all these things should be sought. The -Government should make it quite clear to the public that it intends to deal with big combines and corporations if they do conduct their business in a way that interferes with the rights of the public. should be given to understand that they will not be permitted to act detrimentally to public interests.

The Government proposals are grouped, and that is unwise. Some people may be willing to vote ""yes"" to some of the questions, but would vote "" no"" to the others; and because the whole of them are grouped they may be inclined to vote "" no"" to the whole lot. On the last occasion that constitutional questions were put to the people they were put separately. confused that they voted "" no "" to the lot, that the people would become confused if they were asked to vote a straight-out "" yes "" or "" no.""

After all, it is proposed when we go to Canberra to consider constitutional amendments, and this matter mightwell be deferred until then. There is no immediate need to rush these questions to the people. No particular benefit would be derived from the carrying of the proposals at the present juncture. arising from the result of the referendum, if the bill were proceeded with immediately, could he undertaken for another twelve months. It is well known that the Prime Minister must go abroad in August, and if he is to spend any time in the Old Country he will not have returned to Australia until January or February of next year, and so the Parliament will not be in a position to deal with any measures arising out of the referendum until after that time. We might as well now go on with other business and leave this matter for general discussion by all parties. I do not want to make this a party question. I believe that the Constitution should be above party. Let us put our heads together and see if we cannot devise something upon which we can be united in recommending the people to accept. consultation in the meantime with the States, and see what part they are prepared to play in the matter. It would be far better to lay down a general scheme in that way than to rush, possibly to disaster, by immediately submitting tlie Government's proposals to a referendum. Every one knows that something like unanimity is required to carry a referendum on any of these questions. The last time similar proposals were discussed in this House honourable members were very much divided. Unless we can the honourable secure some kind of co-operation with the States, and some unanimity here about the presentation of the views of this Parliament to the country, we shall have little There hope of getting any amendment of the Constitution. I put this view because I desire to see the Constitution amended. It is absolutely deplorable that the Fedethe ral Parliament should be deprived of the powers necessary to govern the people it represents. How long are we to wait before we try to come to a common understanding on which we can go to the people? No one in Australia regards the Constitution as a party matter. It is It does not follow that the instrument by which we are governed, and it is the power which it confers that enables this Parliament to look after the welfare of the people. At present we are without sufficient power to protect the interests of the people against the corporations and combinations to which I have referred. I do not speak against them generally, because I wish to make No legislation it clear that in some cases they may operate for the benefit of the community; but it is necessary that we should be in a position to deal with corporations detrimental to the community. If we have the necessary power to control them, those who pool their capital in these corporations will see that their operations are conducted on proper lines. Before resuming my seat I should like very much to know whether anything can be done by the Government to give honourable members a full opportunity to consider these matters iustead of rushing questions to a referendum at the present juncture, because I am very doubtful whether we shall succeed in getting the approval of the people for proposed amendments of the Constitution if we have not come to a common understanding as to what additional powers are necesWe might have sary. We should be in a position to go to the people, not. as separate parties, but as a united Parliament, and tell them how necessary it is that the Parliament should be clothed with these powers. If we are in a position to do that, I believe that the people will respond to what is proposed. I ask the Prime Minister to take seriously into consideration the advisability of deferring these proposals.

The amendment is self-explanatory. paragraph, as originally framed, required un explanation; but I shall not ask the Treasurer to make it , because I agree wholeheartedly with the amendment that he has moved. It w ill beremembered that, on the second reading of the bill, I took exception to the*phrasing of this provision, and I pointed out that the declaration in the act that existing assessments must be taken to be valid and effectual did not necessarily make them valid and effectual. I said then that I had reason to believe that if the taxpayer failed to choose a value in the new schedule, and the department endeavoured to force upon him the existing assessments which have been declared invalid by the H i g h Court, the tax could not be collected. assess the taxpayer on market values, which would not suit h i m at all. . Treasurer has brought this paragraph into line with the next paragraph dealing with new assessments. member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) asked me to show him, at the committee stage, wherein thero was inconsistency between tlie clauses of the bill. Thei n consistency was certainly in evidence; but it has since been removed by the Treasurer. tained w it h respect to new assessments; but not to old assessments. Where the taxpayer failed to elect a value in the new schedule between the minimum and maximum limits, he would be assessed upon the basis of an invalid value. when there was no election. paragraph, 3 A , states that where any person fails to elect w i th respect to new assessments, market values shall apply. The inconsistency in the b ill , originally introduced, was a grave blot on it from a legal point of view. It was obvious that if the department could not directly impose a standard of value under a schedule that fixed differential rates between State and State, and the H i gh Court held that it could not, then it could not do it indirectly merely because a person failed to elect some other value. The mere fact of a man f a i l in g to elect a value in the new schedule, which he might hold to be wrong, did not necessarily enable, the department to declare the old invalid assessment to be valid. completely removes any suggestion of that. amendment removes the great danger that I pointed out on the second reading, and brings this provision into conformity with the other clauses of the bill. Amendment agreed to I propose to move the following amendment :That after the word "" thereof,"" paragraph (3A) , sub-clause (o), the following proviso be added:"" Provided that such persons shall have the option of selecting the market selling value of live stock that applied to all assessments issued prior to the commencement of this act.""

Whilst1 recognize the difficulty of framing an amendment to meet cases such as those to which I referred earlier this evening, the existing anomaly should not be passed over as lightly as the Treasurer suggests. A returned soldier who has entered into a partnership is deprived of certain deductions and exemptions because he is not directly engaged in the management of the business. surer asked me if I would extend the concession to all soldier shareholders. would not pledge myself to such a wide application of it„ but 1 consider that a soldier who is a substantial shareholder in a business should be allowed a reduction.

FRAHCIH -Suppos e that a returned soldier holds one-twentieth of the shares, and ia not taking any part in the management, and is not even working for the company ? not in a position to say that such a percentage was sufficient to justify a deduction, but if a returned soldier had a one-third or one-fifth share he should receive consideration.

EARLE PAGE -The existing qualification is that the soldier must have spent the greater part of his time in connection with the management of the business. The honourable members remarks are applicable to any shareholder. this committee that we recognize the existence of an anomaly, but cannot frame an amendment to remove it ? I hope that the Treasurer will further consider the possibility of making provision to do justice to the people whose circumstances I have placed before him. it is possible to place the returned soldier I in the same position in relation to wartime _ profits taxation as he occupies in relation to income taxation. Both those were imposed as war measures, and this Parliament particularly exempted soldiers from income tax, and tried to exempt them from war-time profits tax also; but to obviate the possibility of improper evasions by the transfer of businesses to returned soldiers, it excluded any returned soldier who did not go into the danger zone or who went into the danger zone, but before he went on active service had not devoted the greater part of his time to the management of the business. The risk that necessitated the original safeguard no longer exists, because there can be no evasion now by transfer to soldiers. I therefore move That tlie following paragraph bo added to the proposed new clause:"" (3) Where the naval or military duties of any individual or member referred to in the last preceding sub-section required him to be in any part of the field of operations in connection with the war, where there waa danger to life as a result of the operations of enemy forces, the commissioner may further alter or make the The cases I have in said assessment so that there sliall be deducted from the said profits ao much of those profits as were entitled to an exemption from income tax by virtue of section 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-21. and which would but for this sub-section be liable to war-time profit* tax.""

One applies to the income of an individual, which may be derived from personal exertion, and the other to the profits of a business.

The object of the proposed new clause is to rectify one of the most serious anomalies in the act. Losses are calculated by cue method, and profits and capital by another. I desire that all three shall be calculated by the same method. The method of determining war-time profits is most inconsistent, and cannot be reconciled w it h the ordinary principles of accountancy. Losses are recouped on what is termed market values, but in the calculation of capital, which determines profits, what is known as the elective system, which gives a fictitious value, is employed. By that means a greatly inflated profit is arrived at. All . I ask is that there should at least be consistency and equity.

Does the honourable member for Hindmarsh in tend to make the suggested provision retrospective, or does he wish it to be applied only to the assessments still to be made ? I would not expect the suggestion to be applied to assessments already completed, which, I presume, have been accepted by the. taxpayers concerned as satisfactory. tral office taxpayers assessed under the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act did not accept the invalid basis. The taxpayers generally evidently thought that that basis was the best for them. disturb a system that is regarded by the taxpayer as equitable, but I think the Treasurer will recognize that an injustice is possible under the present method.
