It being 8 p.m.,WednesdaY,1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1331 Wednesday, 1 March 1995 Cognate bill: Consideration resumed from 9 February. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to begin the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. The bill contains chapters 1 and 2 of a new criminal code. During the next five years the code will be systematically built around these chapters. Chapter2 is the most fundamental part of the code. It contains the foundations of the new Commonwealth criminal law-the general principles of criminal responsibility. By the end of five years, these principles will apply to every federal offence unless there is need to vary these by reason of special considerations applying to particular offences. When this is achieved, for the first time since federation, those accused of federal offences will be dealt with under the same principles-no longer will people charged in different states and territories be treated differently from one another. This step is long overdue. It is partly a recognition that the Commonwealth criminal law has grown enormously since federation. Indeed, in 1914 when the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 was first enacted, most of the criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act and the Customs Act 1901. Even in 1914 an attempt was made to adopt common principles of criminal responsibility by section 4 of the Crimes Act, which provided that common law principles of criminal liability applied in relation to Crimes Act offences. Since then Commonwealth criminal law has grown like a vigorous vine, branching out into topics such as the environment, health, heritage, insurance and banking, and offences which ensure meeting of our international obligations. Now most offences are found outside the Crimes Act. This means that in most cases the principles of criminal responsibility that apply vary from state to state because they are picked up from the local state and territory law under section 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903. This is unsatisfactory. Codification of the criminal law has its roots in the work of the 18th century jurist Jeremy Bentham who, speaking of the English common law at that time, said: Do you know how they make it? Just as a man makes law for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it, and then you beat him for it. While the common law has come a long way since then, and the principles are more certain, Bentham's comment may seem to reflect the way the general principles of the criminal law are applied to anyone who travels from one Australian jurisdiction to another. A person might live in Tweed Heads, New South Wales and make a 10-minute trip to Coolangatta, Queensland. In many cases that person would be surprised to know that in relation to the",138,Tobacco Advertising Us Department Of Health And Human Prohibition Amendment Bill Services Preventing Tobacco Use Among

No longer are the differences in the law just an inconvenience for those who live in the border towns of Tweed Heads and Coolangatta and Albury-Wodonga. Indeed it also impacts on those who are involved in international trade with Australia. . These problems were first addressed in the July 1990 report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs GCMG, AC, KBE, our former Chief Justice of the High Court. The Gibbs committee, which also included the Hon. Justice Ray Watson and Mr Andrew Menzies AM, OBE, recommended that there be general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law, and planted the seed of what became a national initiative to standardise the foundations of the criminal law across the nation. State and territory governments were quick to take up the challenge and, at the same time, began to participate in the development of the general principles of criminal responsibility and other provisions for a model criminal code. Indeed, it was the state and territory governments who initiated the idea of a model criminal code for Australia The Northern Territory Attorney General, Mr Daryl Manzie, suggested that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and, out of that, the Criminal Law Officers Committee was established-now called the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee-made up of criminal law experts from each jurisdiction. The committee was remarkably successful at developing consensus on general principles, in a process that, building on the work of the Gibbs committee and the consultation it had undertaken, drew even more widely on contributions from the academic and legal professional community. There has been the most extensive consultation towards the drafting of this bill and through its consideration before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I am pleased to see that all parties represented on the Senate committee supported the bill . and the concept of uniform criminal law . The committee made the very important observation that compromises were necessary if national uniformity was to be achieved, and concluded that it was satisfied that the Criminal Code Bill 'provides a thorough, workable, logical and balanced compromise between competing legal policy views, and perhaps more importantly, between the competing interests of the State and of the people, which lies at the heart of the criminal law.' I am pleased to see that the approach of the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories who have given their personal support to the development of the model Criminal Code is being reflected in this parliament. This bodes well for the implementation of the model Criminal Code by the year 2001, as agreed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has worked long and hard to turn the concept of a model Criminal Code from theory into reality. I am pleased to say that I have been able to initiate the first legislative step which has made it a reality. The Commonwealth has a very wide range of offence provisions to amend consequentially. The magnitude of this task should not be understated. Many serious offences with a number of elements will have to be examined. If the standing committee's target is to be met, the Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1333 Commonwealth must start now. In this, I hope to initiate a dramatic improvement in the Commonwealth statute book, and also to show commitment to those state and territory governments who have invested their time and resources in the development of the model Criminal code. This project is a very significant demonstration that federalism can work in Australia. As such, I believe it is a fitting project to contribute to our celebration of the centenary of our federation. I turn now to the provisions of the code before the Committee. It is to be noted that these blend the two main approaches to the criminal law in Australia. On one hand, the code contains subjective fault-based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of the common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions-such as those relating to intoxication-which are closer to the approach of the Griffith codes. Furthermore, it is a code and, as such, it accepts the underlying philosophy of the Griffith codes that, in such an important area of the law, parliament should determine the appropriate principles. In setting out the physical and fault elements of offences and instances where fault elements do not apply, part 2.2 adopts the usual analytical division of the elements of criminal offences into 'actus reus' and 'mens rea'. The 'physical elements' may be conduct, or the circumstances in which conduct occurs or a result of conduct. The 'fault elements' refer to the state of mind of the person. It is in relation to the fault elements that the Griffith codes and the common law have taken different approaches. The essential difference between the two systems is that criminal responsibility under the common law is based on subjective fault elements: what the accused knew, believed or intended at the time of the conduct. This is not so under the basic provisions of the Griffith codes. In many offences under the Griffith codes, one or more forms of intention are express elements of the offence. In these cases, the difference between the Griffith codes and the common law as regards intention is less marked. Nevertheless, in the case of many Griffith code provisions which do not specify a fault element, the difference is more significant. There is no onus on the prosecution to prove a fault element, and criminal responsibility can only be negated by the defendant raising accident, or honest and reasonable mistake, or that the event occurred independently of his or her will. In the common law jurisdictions, if a fault element is not specified for a serious offence, the general rule is that a fault element such as intention or recklessness is to be implied, and that the prosecution must prove it as part of its case. The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. This was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received on the model Criminal Code, and is consistent with the US model penal code, the English draft code, the Canadian draft code and the Gibbs committee recommendations. It strikes the right balance and strengthens the principle that the accused is innocent until proven gUilty. On the other hand, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General preferred the general approach of the Griffith code in relation to intoxication. The code provides that evidence of self-induced intoxication may not be taken into account in determining whether the conduct was voluntary and that it cannot be considered in determining whether a fault element of an offence of basic intent existed. An offence of 'basic intent' is an offence where the physical element is one of conduct alone, such as striking a person, rather than one requiring greater awareness, such as striking a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. This approach is similar to that in the law in the USA and England, but differs in some situations from the MC 1334 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 law in the common law jurisdictions of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, which follow a High Court decision known as O'Connor. In those jurisdictions gross intoxication can be taken into account in determining whether a person had intent. It is the view of Commonwealth and the unanimous view of state and territory Attorneys General that legislation to enable intoxication to be used as an excuse for otherwise criminal conduct in relation to simple offences of 'basic intent' is totally unacceptable at a time when alcohol and drug abuse are causing so many social problems. It is the Commonwealth's view that if a person voluntarily takes the risk of getting intoxicated to such a degree then he or she should be responsible for actions which would otherwise amount to an offence of basic intent. Part 2.3 describes circumstances where there is no criminal responsibility, such as where a person: is under 10 years of age; suffers from mental impainnent; is involuntarily intoxicated; is under a mistaken belief; or has a claim of right. Also covered are situations where there is some intervening conduct or event such as duress, emergency or self-defence. Apart from intoxication, which I have already mentioned, the most difficult issues concern mental impairment and self-defence. The approach taken in relation to mental impairment follows the basic principles of what is called the McNaghten test. The code provides for a mental impairment defence primarily concerned with the determination of criminal responsibility: a legal rather than medical test. This issue must depend in part on the expertise of psychiatrists and psychologists but is not exclusively a medical issue. The approach adopted has produced a workable definition of mental impairment that allows the jury to hear relevant psychiatric testimony, based on the best scientific evidence, and properly leaves the ultimate question of responsibility to the jury. The self-defence test is subjective as to the necessity of using force but the test as to the proportion of force used is objective and is similar to section 45 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code. Although not of great practical relevance to federal offences, revision of the law of self defence is very important in state and territory legislation to which the same principles will apply. In this connection the approach taken in proposed section 10.4 should be noted. Attention is directed to the explanatory memorandum which examines how the issue of the so-called 'battered women's syndrome' has been dealt with. Part 2.4 of the code deals with extensions of criminal responsibility such as attempts, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. Each of these extensions raise interesting issues which are dealt with in detail in the explanatory memorandum. The most notable change relates to the offence of conspiracy where measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limit that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades. Part 2.5 deals with the important issue of corporate criminal responsibility. It sets a basic standard of responsibility for bodies corporate in relation to general offences. The code introduces the concept that criminal responsibility should attach to bodies corporate where the corporate culture encourages situations which lead to the commission of offences. Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1335 The provisions make companies accountable for their general managerial responsibilities and policy. It provides that negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate. In speaking about this part I must stress that it is still open to the legislature to employ reverse onus of proof provisions or strict liability for offences where the normal rules of criminal responsibility are considered inappropriate. At the federal level this will need to occur in a number of important areas where corporations are the main players, such as environmental protection, where the potential harm of committing the offence may be enormous and the breach difficult to detect before the damage is done. For example, the government is not planning to water down the requirements of section 65 of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 in regard to the matters covered by that act. Part 2.5 concerns general principles suitable for ordinary offences. It will be the basis of liability if no other basis is provided. Finally, part 2.6 deals with proof of criminal responsibility and sets out the respective burdens of proof to be discharged by both the prosecution and defence. It also deals with averments and restricts their use. It follows established principles. Clearly there are different views on particular issues, in some cases very strongly held, and the government will take particular care to listen to the debate on those aspects of the bill. I will conclude by saying that for constitutional reasons later parts of the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be different from the new state and territory criminal codes as its subject matter will include what are currently Crimes Act 1914 offences and certain other serious offences such as drug offences. Despite this, the offences common to the Commonwealth and state codes will be expressed in substantially the same terms and offences unique to the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be constructed having regard to the same principles of criminal responsibility contained in this bill. Once the legislation is in place, no matter where a trial is held in Australia, Commonwealth offences will be proved in the same way and this will reflect a common national approach for all offences as the states modify their criminal laws. This will have enormous benefits for all Australian citizens because it will simplify joint Commonwealth-state investigations and trials and increase the mobility of the legal profession and investigators. It is the government's hope that this bill will not only be the beginning of a new era for Commonwealth criminal law but for the criminal law of Australia generally-the beginning of one of the most ambitious legal simplification programs ever attempted in this country. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House. The purpose of the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 as an interim measure pending the commencement of the Criminal Code Bill 1994, which will not be completed for five years. While the code bill is likely to commence in relation to its own offence provisions towards the end of this year, there are many Commonwealth offences which will need to be reviewed and consequentially amended to make them referable to the code before it applies to them. The period of five years was chosen to ensure that the transition is ordered and that it occurs without disruption. While interim in nature, this bill contains much needed and long overdue reforms. The application of common law principles of criminal responsibility means that all people accused MC 1336 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 of federal offences will be subject to the same principles of criminal liability wherever they are in Australia. The bill will replace section 4, which only applied these principles to offences against the Crimes Act 1914. The common law principles of criminal liability have been extended to other Commonwealth offences to avoid a situation where there would be three sets of principles in existence during the transitional period-the code principles, the Crimes Act use of the common law, and the application of state and territory law in relation to other offences. It should be noted that the common law principles have already applied to federal Crimes Act offences since it was first enacted in 1914. At that time there were far fewer offences in other Commonwealth legislation. Therefore the change is consistent with the effect of the policy as it was then, that is, in relation to criminal liability, people were dealt with under the same principles in different parts of the country. Finally, the code itself is largely based on common law principles and therefore this interim measure will generally be consistent with its principles. The minimum age of criminal responsibility has for some time varied betweenjurisdictions. The minimum age for criminal responsibility is seven years in Tasmania, eight years in the ACT and 10 years in the other jurisdictions. This meant that a child from New South Wales on· holidays in Tasmania could be accused and convicted of a federal offence committed during the holiday, when at home he or she could not be charged for doing the same thing. That is clearly anomalous and requires reform. The approach taken mirrors proposed section 7.1 of the Criminal Code. Also in pressing need of reform are the laws relating to attempt and conspiracy. In relation to 'attempt', the government was keen to see some clarification of this, in some respects complex, area of the law in the shorter term. In particular we wanted to act on the recommendation of the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in relation to impossibility. The amendment ensures that couriers who believe that they are importing a prohibited drug are unable to avoid being charged for attempt when it is discovered the substance is something else. Apart from the question of what fault element applies-which is not dealt with in this bill but is left to the common law-the provision on attempt is the same as proposed in section 11.1 of the Criminal Code. Finally, the bill introduces new laws in relation to the offence of conspiracy. Measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limitation that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades. This reform mirrors proposed section 11.5 of the Criminal Code. These measures ensure that during the period leading up to the commencement of the code the reform process is not frozen. They will facilitate the introduction of the code by following a consistent approach and helping to simplify the transition. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House. Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1337 Committee that we have present in the gallery this morning the President of the Senate of the Republic of Fiji, accompanied by the Secretary-General of the Parliament of Fiji. On behalf of the Committee, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed. welcome to our distinguished guests. I was getting worried that I might have to do so myself! I am delighted to see the President and the Secretary-General in the gallery, having met them privately during their visit here. I am sorry that they have to endure such a technical area of Australian law and law reform. I have not spent very much time looking at these matters since my days at law school-and I am perhaps grateful for the refresher-but to come in cold and have to endure speeches which deal with matters of such a technical nature shows your commitment to examining our parliamentary system and its workings in full. The Criminal Code Bill and the cognate bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill, are part of a development of law reform to codify the criminal law in the Commonwealth of Australia. As the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) made very clear in his speech, we are in a situation where, with separate states, we have seen the development of criminal law on separate bases: in some places, modelled on the common law regimes; in others, codified-adopting more of the European model. So quite different approaches have been taken which, in a large country like Australia, certainly have to be viewed-as we become closer together and as we seek to operate as a nation-as matters that deserve further examination. The aim of the bill, in our view, is worthwhile as its broader objective is the development of a model Criminal Code to be adopted in all of the Australian jurisdictions. This is one of those areas in which there is welcome support-so far as the government is concerned, I am sure-from the opposition. In other words, there is the development of a bipartisan approach to this significant area of law reform. The principles contained in this bill have been the subject of very considerable debate. It has been the subject of very extensive examination, and that is particularly important because, when you have a lengthy examination of this sort and you develop general agreement, you have a reasonable prospect of success. The Criminal Code Bill is drawn from a draft model criminal code, which has been subjected to jurisdictional agreement. It has been examined by this parliament. Specific concerns in relation to this bill and to the Crimes Amendment Bill have been examined, as the Minister for Justice has said, by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The members of that committee unanimously recommended that both bills be passed. I note-and I think this was referred to earlier-that the committee in its conclusion said that the preparation of the code and the Crimes Amendment Bill had been exhaustive and that none",139,Representatives Main Committee

239,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (10.22 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad you extended aMC 1338 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 of the evidence before the committee questioned the need for a model criminal code and, with one exception, none of the evidence questioned the approach taken in the bill. There was some criticism of the general drafting style, but that often happens in relation to Commonwealth legislation, where the states see our drafting techniques as being quite different. Some have moved to simplify theirs in particular ways, so I could understand that. However, the fact is that all of the evidence suggests that the bill is usable and workable in all the jurisdictions in Australia. That is particularly useful information to the parliament. By way of background, the Criminal Code Bill does concern the Commonwealth criminal law. The Commonwealth criminal law encompasses the offences created by federal legislation and regulations, and the principles of criminal responsibility applicable to those offences. To understand the current difficulties with the federal system, it is necessary to understand the state and territory approaches. The Minister for Justice has dealt with some of them. At the state and territory level there are two main approaches to criminal law: the common law approach and the code approach, which I mentioned earlier. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory the criminal law is based on the common law approach. In those jurisdictions, while a significant proportion of offences are contained in acts and regulations, many are based upon the non-legislative common law principles inherited primarily from other Commonwealth common law jurisdictions. On the other hand, the criminal law in Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory is based upon comprehensive codes. In those jurisdictions, there is no recourse to common law principles. In the early years following Federation, most Commonwealth criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act 1914. That has now changed and criminal offences are contained throughout every conceivable area of Commonwealth legislation. So when a person is charged with a Commonwealth offence in a state or federal court, principles of criminal responsibility need to be applied in determining a person's guilt or innocence. At present, the principles applicable to the Commonwealth offences are disparate and unsatisfactory. If the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914, common law principles apply. For the remainder, and the majority of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the relevant state or territory laws apply. That means that two people convicted of the same Commonwealth offence in different states may be subject to different rules. These rules can have a substantive impact on the outcome of the prosecution. The Gibbs review of the Commonwealth criminal law recommended that the general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law should apply. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Justice mentioned something of the Gibbs review. I want to make my own comments in relation to the eminence of the people who examined these questions for the Commonwealth. The committee was chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia-a very distinguished Australian. The committee included the Hon. Justice Ray Watson, a senior judge of the Family Court of Australia and one who played a very significant part-and I was often reminded by the judge of this matter-in the drafting of the Family Law Act. I am not sure whether Mr Justice Murphy or Mr Justice Watson could take the greater credit for family law. However, Mr Justice Watson has been a very distinguished judge who has been known to my family for many years. He suffered considerable tragedy in his life in later years, but certainly it is a great credit to him that he has been involved in this work in a very constructive way. Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1339 Of course, Mr Andrew Menzies AM, OBE, one of the very distinguished officers of our Attorney-General's Department, who retired some years ago, has contributed to government in an advisory capacity in a number of areas. He is a widely respected person whose skills have been drawn upon in this area. It is the eminence of people such as this reporting on these matters that has enabled such a positive outcome. This bill represents the first phase in the implementation of the recommendations of the Gibbs review and, as the minister said, it is expected that that implementation will take five years. It has been set as one of the major achievements of our centenary of Federation. I think that will give plenty of opportunity for a cooperative approach of bringing everybody on board in relation to the implementation. The government is determined that in order to achieve consistency while the reform process continues there should be an interim position whereby common law principles are applicable to all Commonwealth offences, and that requires an amendment to the Crimes Act 1914, which is included in the bill that we are discussing today, the contemporaneous amendments to the Crimes Act. Ultimately, the reform agenda is wider than an attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. The aim is to achieve uniformity across all jurisdictions of criminal law principles, and the goal has been endorsed for the year 2001 by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The government has indicated that the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, made up of criminal law experts from each jurisdiction, has developed agreed principles for the model Criminal Code and the draft is anticipated by 1998. In dealing with the provisions, the bill sets out the principles of criminal responsibility which will apply within five years to all Commonwealth offences. The principles are contained in chapter 2. The five-year delay is due in part to making consequential amendments to offences contained across a range of Commonwealth legislation. That is because the offences are drafted on the basis of principles that might apply. The delay is also a result of a plan to incorporate in the code, with appropriate redrafts, the offences contained in the Crimes Act 1914. It is planned that those offences will be moved into the Criminal Code in 1995, that is, this year. At that time the act will be proclaimed and will apply in relation to offences within the code. The code will apply to other Commonwealth offences not later than five years after the date on which the act receives royal assent. The bill is being introduced now so as to provide a firm legislative base on which to begin the process of drafting consequential amendments. It is also being introduced to indicate to the states and territories the Commonwealth's commitment to the development of the model Criminal Code. Chapter1 of the code deals with the codification process itself. At present all the chapter provides is that the only offences under Commonwealth law are those created by the code or under any other Commonwealth act. In other words, when the code comes into force there will be no common law, Commonwealth criminal law. The principles contained in chapter 2 are a combination of the elements of common law jurisdictions and the code jurisdictions, as noted in the second reading speech. On the one hand, the code contains subjective fault based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions such as those relating to intoxication, which are closer to the approach of the code jurisdictions. Chapter2 of the code is divided into parts 2.1 to 2.2 inclusively. Part 2.1 of the code outlines the purpose and application of the chapter, which is to codify the general principles MC 1340 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 of criminal responsibility. Part 2.2 deals with the elements of an offence. It provides that defence consists of physical elements and fault elements which provide the traditional analytical basis of offences known as the actus reus and mens rea respectively. The characteristics of the physical elements and fault principles are described in detail in the remainder of part 2.2. The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. The second reading speech states that this was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received and is consistent with the United States model penal code, the English draft code and the Canadian draft code, as well as the Gibbs committee recommendations. Part 2.3 contains circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility. This part deals with criminal responsibility of minors, mental impairment, intoxication, mistake of fact, mistake of law, claim of right, intervening conduct, duress, emergency and self-defence. The mental impairment provisions follow what is known as the McNaghten test. That test and the relevant provision provide that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person was suffering from a mental impairment so that the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct or did not know that the conduct was wrong or was unable to control the conduct. Particularly noteworthy are the provisions relating to intoxication. Under the provisions, voluntary intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether conduct was voluntary or whether fault elements of an offence element of basic intent existed. This follows the approach of the code states. It differs from common law jurisdictions where gross intoxication can be taken into account in determining whether a person had intent. The government has stated that the approach taken in this bill has been endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Part 2.4 deals with extensions of criminal responsibility. It contains provisions dealing with attempt, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. The bill makes amendments to the current conspiracy laws to take into account judicial and other criticisms of abuse of conspiracy laws. The provision imposes limits on the situations when conspiracy applies. Part 2.5 deals with corporate criminal responsibility. The bill introduces the concept that criminal responsibility should attach to bodies corporate where the corporate culture encourages situations which lead to the commission of offences. In addition, negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate. It is stated that the provisions make companies accountable for their general managerial responsibilities and policy. Part 2.6 codifies established principles dealing with proof of criminal responsibility and the respective burdens of proof that must be discharged. The government has determined that certain areas of reform cannot wait five years for implementation. They are the provisions relating to the age of criminal responsibility, the law of attempt and the law relating to conspiracy. Provisions mirroring those in this bill have been included in the Crimes Amendment Bill, which is being debated cognately and which is intended to enter into force in the short term. When this bill enters into force, the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994, which we are going to pass today, will be repealed. It is clear that not everyone agrees with all aspects of the bill, although support for the general approach taken and the concept of the model national Criminal Code has been almost unanimous. When the Senate committee considered the details of the bill, there were concerns Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1341 expressed in a number of areas, including intoxication as a defence, conspiracy, duress and corporate criminal responsibility; in other words, in relation to specific matters of detail in relation to what is to be the model code. It is clear that where concerns were raised there were legitimate competing views, making the ultimate choice a finely balanced decision. In its report, the Senate committee noted the bill provides: ... a thorough, workable, logical and balanced compromise between competing legal policy views, and perhaps more importantly, between the competing interests of the State and of the people, which lies at the heart of criminal law. The Crimes Amendment Bill implements the reforms to Commonwealth criminal law as an interim measure, pending the commencement of the Criminal Code Bill, which I have just discussed. The substantive provisions mirror certain aspects of the Criminal Code Bill but, as with that bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill is not opposed by the coalition. In the debate on that bill, the Criminal Code Bill of 1994 is noted as the first phase of the government's attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. The code is being implemented in stages and because of the need to make consequential amendments the bill will not enter into force until five years hence. As I mentioned earlier, the government has determined that it is desirable that some areas of reform contained in the Criminal Code Bill be implemented in the short term. These reforms are contained in this bill. They deal with, firstly, the age of criminal responsibility: the provisions standardise the current situation such that persons under 10 years of age are not liable for offences under Commonwealth law. In relation to the issue of the law of attempt, the provisions require that the conduct said to constitute the attempt must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The provisions allow for a conviction even where committing the offence attempted is impossible. Finally, in relation to law relating to conspiracy, the provisions aim to reduce the abuse of conspiracy charges. The provisions only apply where the offence to which they relate has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment, or a fine of more than $A20,000. Proceedings may be commenced only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. As I said, the provisions mirror those in the model Criminal Code Bill. In addition, the bill has the effect that, until the code bill enters into force, common law principles of criminal responsibility are to apply to Commonwealth offences. At present, common law principles apply to Commonwealth offences contained under the Crimes Act of 1914. For the remainder-and the majority-of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the particular state law and territory laws apply. The amendment is designed to produce a measure of consistency while the reform process is underway. As with the model code, this bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The committee unanimously recommended that the bill be passed. As I have said, both of these bills have the concurrence of the coalition and we will not be opposing their carriage. Bill 1995 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995. These bills are long overdue and, as the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech, the purpose of the Criminal Code Bill is to begin the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. The most pleasing aspect of the bill is that no longer will people charged in different states and territories be treated differently from one another. That is the nub of what this is all about. There has been a lot of consultation. There has been a model criminal code produced by the criminal law",145,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.43 A.m.),"I am pleased to rise in support of the Criminal CodeMC 1342 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 officers committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which I will deal with later. As I see it and summarise it, there are basically only two differences from the model code that was introduced by the officers committee and what we are debating here today: one relates to the question of intoxication; the other concerns the threshold level of conspiracy-and the minister well knows my views in relation to that. It is a question of policy and a question of what people are used to in their jurisdictions. I am a New South Wales practitioner versed in the common law approach, whereas the minister is a practitioner from Tasmania. Differences were mirrored throughout the basically consultative process and they were reflected in submissions which are also before the Senate committee. That is the way it should be. We should not be frightened of different views; we should not be frightened of consultation; and we should not sit here and say, 'You are right' or 'You are wrong', because that is not the case. People are coming at it genuinely from different views. In the end there has to be compromise, and that is what has happened here: the Commonwealth and the state Attorneys-General have adopted the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and endorsed it. It is good to see that such uniformity of view exists, because that augurs well for what this project is about. No longer is it tolerable in the criminal code, or, indeed, in other areas of civil law and commercial law, that, by chance, depending on what state or territory you reside in, you are treated differently from other citizens within the Commonwealth. The pleasing aspect of this particular bill is that we will have equality before the law and that will uniformly help to ensure that all people, no matter where they reside in Australia, will be tried in accordance with the same basic principles, and, through that, that all people will enjoy equality before the law. It is unconscionable not to take steps to address this, because it is quite wrong that Queenslanders are treated differently from people from New South Wales or Tasmania. That is the most pleasing aspect of this legislation, and the Minister for Justice, the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) and the relevant state ministers ought to be congratulated for their attempt to reach agreement and for their ability to compromise in their attempt to reach uniformity, because the overriding principle is uniformity. We can argue some of the principles and they will be ongoing arguments, because I am sure that we, as a parliament, will from time to time be urged to review certain aspects of the code. That situation will result from judicial decisions and experience, and that is what parliaments at the national level and state level do all the time. The one thing that I do not want to see-and I am not saying that this will be the case in relation to this bill-is that, in the effort to reach uniformity and compromise, we play to the lowest common denominator. It needs to be said at the outset that that has not happened in this bill, and I have not heard any of that criticism. In relation to intoxication, there has been vigorous debate as to whether the Majewski approach or the O'Connor approach should be preferred. The criminal law officers preferred the O'Connor approach, and that is my preferred view. In the end, that has not prevailed. In relation to conspiracy, the threshold of 12 months is applied. I understand the reasons for that, whereas the officers committee recommended two years. However, there is a provision there, in terms of the precautions, to stop an abuse in terms of overcharging with a charge of conspiracy. That needs to be acknowledged and accepted, and I congratulate the minister in Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1343 relation to that area. He has taken on board some of the concerns expressed during the consultation process but he has not moved away from what is an important principle. My reservations relate only to a caution to the parliament because this is the first stage of an ongoing process. I come to the parliament with a decade of experience in the criminal law field. From 1979 until 1990 I practised exclusively in New South Wales in the criminal law field, firstly as a public solicitor and then as a public defender defending people charged with serious criminal offences. Parliamentarians need to be very careful about the attitude in the community at the moment, where there are genuine concerns in the community about the level of penalties, the level of incarceration and the applicability of certain offences. There is a generally held view in the community that we are being too lenient in relation to penalties for offences. Traditionally criminal law has been, in effect, the states' domain. The Commonwealth, as the minister quite rightly pointed out in his second reading speech, had very limited involvement in the Criminal Code. So a lot of the practitioners and a lot of the experience reside in the states. I think it is fair to concede that at the outset. That is why it is pleasing to see this cooperative approach that the Commonwealth has adopted. We have not turned around and said, 'We are the experts in the field and so we are going to bring in a model criminal code. We are just going to adopt Commonwealth principles, or whatever.' Without criticising the Attorney-General's Department-I hold the department and officers of that department in very high esteem-I believe that, just as a matter of reality, at Commonwealth level the officers in that department do not have the depth or level of experience as those in the state jurisdictions. I think most of the crime that we normally know of has traditionally been at a state level, but it is expanding at a Commonwealth level. That is why we need to address it now in a cooperative fashion, in view of drug importations and other matters that are crossing state borders, crossing territory borders, crossing international borders. Basically, that sort of recent trend has meant that more and more as a Commonwealth we have to legislate in this area. In the past the states could effectively legislate but that is not the case any more. I want to give that word of caution because I have grave reservations about a number of pieces of legislation that in recent years have been introduced in New South Wales and Victoria. I am talking about the Kable bill in New South Wales and the Gary David bill in Victoria. I have grave reservations because, whilst I think those parliaments enacted those pieces of legislation in all good faith-and obviously they are the law of the land in those states-personally as a practitioner I feel that the parliament was responding too heavily in response to community concerns. I am not saying that there were not problems in relation to Kable and Gary David. Of course there were, and serious problems that the parliamentarians and legislators needed to address. I just felt that what happened there was that it was driven too far. At times we in the parliament need to stand up and say, 'We understand that that is the popular view, but we cannot adopt that.' We need to justify our role. I am concerned that bad cases make bad law. The thing with this model code and the way we are going is that that is less likely because we are looking at uniformity. The governments and parliaments of various states or territories will be able to say, 'This is in the national interest. Yes, we hear what you are saying.' ThenI would anticipate that it would come to the committee at a national level, where I think a more rational debate can take place rather than a localised debate. MC 1344 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 The great tragedy in New South Wales, with the Kable bill, was that as a result of a pending election both political parties felt the need to support what I say quite honestly and openly is a bad precedent. They legislated to incarcerate someone on what he might do. To me, that is anathema in dealing with the criminal law. I am not attempting to justify what Kable did, in terms of the facts of that particular case, but I am an old practitioner. I am fairly conservative in relation to incarcerating someone and denying him his liberty. I am not talking about attempt cases or whatever. In terms of letters being written and threats being made, I believe that there are adequate sanctions in the existing law if someone transgresses. That is what is pleasing about this because I think that by going to a uniform code we will be able to resist what are legitimate pressure groups and legitimate concerns. I had a recent study trip to America, the United Kingdom and the United States, having a look at their criminal justice systems. I fear for some of the developments that are taking place in those countries because I think that we have one of the best criminal justice systems in the world, and that that is because we have drawn together the best of the lot of the strands of those particular jurisdictions that I have just talked about. Obviously, with the increasing attention of the media and the need for sensationalism and the need for headlines and ratings, the criminal area is an area that the media have started to pick up more and more. That has resulted in a lot of pressure on politicians. I am not saying that in relation to this legislation because we need the consultation process that has occurred here. It is pleasing to see that there was again a senate committee looking at this. Just because the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) or the Minister for Justice, who is at the table, or the various ministers get together-no disrespect to them-and put their tick on a particular piece of legislation or because the bureaucrats do so, I do not happen to believe that it is sufficient consultation. Part of the consultation process involves the parliament and its committees because it is one way that as members of the parliament we can bring before us some experts to understand what is currently happening in the field. As I said earlier, I practised for 10 years exclusively in the criminal law area as an advocate. It has been almost five years since I was elected to the parliament-five years next month. I am amazed at the extent to which it is like when athletes stop training and are obviously not as fit or as capable. That is why the parliamentary process is very important for us in studying these items of legislation because we then have an opportunity to bring before us current practitioners in the field. It is an education process in terms of the parliament and parliamentarians as well, and I think that augurs well for the future. The recent changes in the House of Representatives have seen the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee playa critical role in evaluating some legislation that has come before the parliament. In the end, that process has enhanced and enriched the particular legislation. I note that the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams), a member of that committee, is present to debate the legislation. I know that the minister, who is at the table, acknowledges the role of that committee and its bipartisan approach. We are not talking here about cheap political points. What we are doing here through this bill is setting the standard, the code, by which all our fellow citizens are going to be judged. My view is that the criminal area and legislation such as this should not be the subject of cheap political shots. I am not talking about vigorous debate in relation to policy. It is well known that the minister and I have different views, but we respect one another's views. Where Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1345 compromises can be made, they have been made. Where concessions have been made, they have been made. But sometimes a decision has to be made about a particular policy path to be taken. It is pleasing that the bill before the parliament today enjoys cross-party support-not unanimous support as far as individuals are concerned, but I would have thought it had near unanimous support across the parliament and unanimous support from the ministers involved. It is not useful to indicate where one group recommended something and another group varied from that position. Where that happens it is not a weakening of the bill; that shows that the consultation process is working, that we are having filters at different levels and that people are not just accepting the first look at the bill as the only way to go. The fact that the ministers have differed from the code shows that serious consideration has been given to what is a draft. That is a development that I would like to see more and more occurring so that as members of parliament we are not already locked into a situation if practitioners bring forward further material involving problems of implementation that were not apparent to an earlier committee. If these problems come out in evidence, we should be able to adopt the changes. I applaud this development. It is going to be a tortuous path, not an easy path. Certainly, it is very satisfying when a stage of the process is completed. This bill has been a long time coming. Five years is a fair time in terms of a staged process because it allows for consultation. Too often things are rushed because of deadlines, allowing insufficient scrutiny. That is where there is a balance. Too often we are told a bill has to be passed by such and such a date and that there are imperatives. I have always felt that it was a conspiracy by the executive, but that is not the case with this bill. This bill has been subjected to tortuous consultation and that is why we are getting a reasonably good bill. I am quite happy to support both these bills. The Crimes Amendment Bill contains interim measures in relation to a number of matters to do with age and makes 10 years of age the uniform age for criminal responsibility throughout Australia. That is a desirable progression. Other than that, there is not much to say. The minister's second reading speeches in relation to each of the bills have put the issues before the parliament fairly and squarely, quite rightly pointing out that there were differences of opinion in relation to some aspects of the bills. I applaud him for that. The criminal area is something that not a lot of members of parliament have had experience in as legal practitioners and a lot of colleagues would not understand. The same principles apply in other areas of the parliament. We should seek to get uniformity on such matters. I commend the bills to the House. on what has proven to be a quite uncontentious pair of bills and a pair of bills which seem to be welcomed universally. As the member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock) has said, the Criminal Code Bill is the first step in the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. It sets out what could be described as the foundations of the proposed new code, the general principles of criminal responsibility. In anticipation of the proposed code the Crimes Amendment Bill applies Commonwealth principles of criminal liability to all Commonwealth offences as a transitional position. It also introduces immediate reforms to the age of criminal responsibility in the law of attempt and conspiracy until the code comes into force.",149,Representativesmain Committee
241,Mr Williams (Tangney) (11.03 A.m.),"I would like to offer a few general commentsMC 1346 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 The Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) has mentioned the Gibbs committee which was established in 1987. I note that Sir Harry Gibbs, after whom the committee is named, only retired as Chief Justice of the High Court in February 1987. He went straight from the high court into reforming the law. The committee's task was to review aspects of criminal law. It was to do that when most of the states and territories were similarly reviewing their criminal laws. In my own state, Western Australia, the Criminal Code had been undergoing an extensive review over a number of years by Mr Justice Murray, who was at that time Mr Michael Murray QC. At one stage, he had been the Chief Crown Prosecutor in Western Australia. He produced a voluminous report which has been implemented in stages and which I think is still being implemented. In June 1990, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed to put the development of the uniform criminal code on its agenda and established a criminal law officers committee, which is now known as the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. This committee was made up of senior officers from each jurisdiction with responsibility for advising his or her Attorney-General on criminal law matters. I note from an article by Mr Graham Scott QC-also a former Chief Crown Prosecutor in Western Australia, now Mr Justice Scott of the Supreme Court-that the impetus for the standing committee to put the item on its agenda came from a meeting in Brisbane in April 1990 of a body called the Society for the Reform of the Criminal Law. That body apparently held a seminar to discuss the desirability of producing a uniform criminal code for Australia and, according to Mr Justice Scott, the project was adopted enthusiastically by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, who formed and funded the criminal law officers committee. I mention that only because that body is not known to me and I do not know that it continues; its purpose may have been superseded by the actions of the standing committee. The model code committee took the view that issues of criminal responsibility were fundamental to any criminal code and issued a discussion draft chapter of a model code. Where some elements of an offence occur in one state and other elements in the neighbouring state, it should, of course, make no difference to criminal responsibility which elements occur where and the Criminal Code Bill generally follows the proposals of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. The committee delivered a discussion draft of a chapter of a model criminal code dealing with general principles of criminal responsibility to SCAG in July 1992, and it was circulated for comment. Some 52 written submissions were received in response to that discussion draft. In addition to the written submissions, the fmal report reflected the substance of many meetings held with criminal law experts and detailed comments from delegates to the Fourth International Criminal Law Congress held in Auckland in September 1992. The committee designed the provisions relating to general principles of criminal responsibility so as not to affect existing legislation until three years after the enactment of the general principles chapter. This has now been extended to five years. Given the length of time Mr Justice Murray took to review the Western Australian criminal code and the length of time it has taken to implement those recommendations, I think the extension of time to five years is entirely appropriate, even if that time may have had something to do with the timing of the centenary of federation. Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1347 The purpose of the delay is to allow time to review existing legislation in those jurisdictions which may wish to enact the general principles as set out in the Criminal Code Bill without awaiting completion of the whole code. Some jurisdictions, on the other hand, may prefer to wait and see the entire code produced before contemplating adopting it. A Commonwealth criminal code cannot, of course, cover all areas of criminal law. The Commonwealth only has legislative competence in the areas provided to it by the constitution. The states and, under present arrangements, the territories have the power to legislate for the residue, which is the bulk of the criminal law. It includes such matters as assault, sexual assault, murder and theft and other property offences. The Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth creates certain specific Commonwealth offences, chiefly relating to Commonwealth officers and property. Most Commonwealth offences, which include matters relating to the environment, health, heritage, insurance and banking, are created under other specialised Commonwealth legislation. Clearly then, there cannot be a uniform or model Criminal Code applying Australia-wide, but Commonwealth criminal law can be codified and state criminal law can be codified. So, too, the overarching principles, such as those relating to criminal responsibility and sentencing, can be unified for the sake of consistency and they can be made easier to understand, easier to find and, one hopes, more easily obeyed. The aim of the Criminal Code Bill is not just to reform Commonwealth criminal law, but to serve as the basis of a model Criminal Code for all jurisdictions and generally to improve or tidy up the criminal law in Australia. It is intended that the Commonwealth code will be developed in stages. The code bill applies the general principles of criminal responsibility immediately to all offences against the code and to all other Commonwealth offences five years after the day on which the code receives royal assent. The idea is that a draft code is developed in stages by cooperation between the states, territories and the Commonwealth. It is then to be implemented by the Commonwealth, in the first instance. Those of the states and territories that choose to do so will adopt and implement appropriate parts of the model code. Thus, for example, the Western Australian version of the code could be legislated for by the Western Australian parliament, but if, and when, and to the extent that the Western Australian government is satisfied that to do so is in the best interests of the people of that state. It is anticipated that other states will go through a similar process. Since the code is being developed with the cooperation of, and in consultation with, most of the states, it is more likely than not that the resulting code will be acceptable to the states and therefore will be adopted by the states and territories involved in the process. I say 'most of the states' because it is my understanding that Victoria is not represented on the model code committee. The legislation that is enacted by each state and territory in the Commonwealth would therefore share a central core, but by no means be identical. Because the law will be able to be amended by the parliaments of the states and the Commonwealth, it will inevitably develop differently in accordance with the different requirements of the states. It is to be hoped, however, that the developments will not go off in different directions without being prompted by some particular state interest. The scheme, when implemented, will be a huge advantage to the administration of justice. It will be a particular boon to lawyers who practise in the criminal law field. At the moment, MC 1348 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 lawyers are obliged, when reading any case, to identify clearly at the outset whether the case relates to a common law offence or to a statutory offence in a common law jurisdiction, or is a code offence. The code states-Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania-have all basically adopted the code developed at the turn of the century by Sir Samuel Griffith, the first Chief Justice of the High Court, and it has served extremely well. Something has been made, in the speeches on these bills up to this point, of the distinctions between code offences and common law offences. For my part, I think there is some exaggeration of that. Certainly, there are elements of code offences which are less subjective than common law offences, but there is, notwithstanding the different approaches, a huge area of similarity. The High Court has inevitably been faced with the difficulty in dealing both with common law offences and code offences. In recent times, certainly in the last 20 years, the court has always had among its members lawyers from both code and common law jurisdictions. The High Court has in its criminal law decisions made some attempt to unify the law by interpreting code provisions in accordance with common law principles and, equally, determining common law principles by reference to the code, but there are significant differences that prevent uniformity from being achieved through judicial revision. It is appropriate that a model criminal law system should be achieved through a code rather than by use of the common law. It is appropriate because, if a citizen is to lose liberty or property or privileges under the sentence of the court for a .criminal offence, the rules should be written and capable of being read by everyone so that they can be capable of being obeyed. Whether the drafting of the bill is a success is to be seen. I noted that in the evidence given before the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs there was some criticism of the bill. For my part, I welcome the use of expressions such as 'physical element' and 'fault element', in lieu of 'actus reus' and 'mens rea', which, while readily known to anybody who has studied criminal law, are not known to citizens and can only serve, I think, to confuse juries when the terms are used in addresses to them. The content of the bill has proven to be remarkably uncontentious. I suspect that if the recommendation to follow the Majewski line in relation to intoxication-rather than the common law, O'Connor line-had not occurrred, the debate would have gone on from another direction. It is obviously a difficult area, and there are quite a number of difficult areas where there is a bald choice between two alternatives. The evidence before the Senate committee suggests that there really have been no major criticisms of the work of the committee, which is most commendable. The honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham) commented upon the value of committee review of bills and I strongly share his sentiments. In this case, while nothing came out of the Senate committee in the form of recommendation for amendment, it is, I think, comforting to those who do not have time, as most members of parliament do not, to study legislation in detail that the committee has reviewed the bills, has recommended that both be passed and has made only one other recommendation. That is, the committee recommends that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General ensure that the officials and drafters working on the model Criminal Code are directed to maintain a commitment to drafting in simple and concise language in future chapters of the code. Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1349 One particular feature of the work of that Senate committee upon which I am pleased to comment is that the committee actually held a hearing in Perth. That is a remarkable event, because few parliamentary committees actually make the trip that members of parliament from Western Australia make two weeks in three across the N ullarbor in a fouror five-hour flight. committee was Mr Justice Murray, who has vast experience in the criminal law, particularly in the review of the code provisions. I think the Criminal Code Bill is a landmark in cooperative federalism. It should be seen as the way to go in the future in the reform of law where the Commonwealth does not have exclusive jurisdiction, either under the constitution or indirectly via the external affairs power in the constitution. I commend the bills. I commend the minister and the committee that prepared them in the form in which they have appeared. criminal law, having spent 10 years in the Victorian police force and some 25 years in the practice of the law. I suppose I have been on both sides. I have been a young police officer, forced to delve into the mysteries of various aspects of the criminal law, and a lawyer, placed in the position of defending people who have been charged with criminal offences. It is interesting to look back to a young constable still training as a police officer who undertook a study of what was then the common law of theft-a very strange definition, if indeed the common law does have definitions. Certainly the law of theft was expressed in very strange language to those not used to the study of law. One goes back further and looks at the history of how the common law came to develop laws of theft and laws against property generally. It was clear that in the 17th and 18th century-ofcourse, the English common law developed in England-most criminal offences were an attempt by a ruling class to enclose laws against those it saw as the subservient class. In fact, most of the English common law is historically laws passed by a minority which had the power in England to control the majority which had no economic or political power in that period. Hence the genesis of the English common law is in the Dark Ages. Over the years there have been fundamental changes to that English common law as lawyers became more common and individuals took greater control over the creation and passing of laws, and perhaps judges themselves became more aware of the social factors involved in the commission and structure of crime. The law of theft, of course, has undergone many changes. From a lawyer's viewpoint in Australia, the tragedy is that it was not Australia which was leading the world, as we often do in change, in amending and restructuring the criminal law. Actually, it started in America. I do not think there is a law student in Australia who has not gone into a law library and delved into the American restatement. Surely it is the greatest codification of law the world has ever seen. It still stands in all law libraries as the way I think a lot of lawyers see the need for laws to change. For those who have never thought about the American restatement, it is a large volume of books which go back many years. America being a common law jurisdiction, an American group actually decided to write the then English common law practice in the United States into fairly simple language in a series of codes which people could understand. I know as a law student I very regularly delved into the American restatement to try to understand and to come to better grips with the quite often nebulous nature of English common law.",153,Representatives Main Committee

In fact, even England has led us to an extent, because the law of larceny or the law of theft was amended many years ago and codified by the English Theft Act. It took some years for that even to permeate Australian jurisdiction. I am pleased to say that some years ago now Victoria codified the law of theft and it is now in the Victorian Theft Act. It has basically simplified and made the law understandable to ordinary people. IfI have any criticism of law, it is that only lawyers seem to understand it. understanding of where they are disagreeing. They often will not agree, but they have a conceptual understanding of where their differences do, in fact, lie. I have always believed, as a lawyer, as an ex-policeman and as a parliamentarian advising people who are constituents on the difficulties that they face with their lives, that the difficulty is that you cannot pick up and hand to a person a fairly simple explanatory statement of what Australian law really is. I think lawyers are condemned for their long neglect of change, and I think parliamentarians are condemned for their long neglect of these changes. I suppose, from a Commonwealth parliamentarian's perspective, that the difficulty lies in the separation of powers in this country: the fact that states have constitutional powers to pass laws for the good government of the states. The Commonwealth has, over the years, been hamstrung by the defined powers in our federal constitution which mean that the states are still primarily responsible for the passing of the bulk of criminal laws in this country. We know that the states, irrespective of which particular political party may run a state from time to time, are not exactly reformist. I say that with some degree of tongue in cheek: they are certainly not exactly reformist. Yet codification of law-not just criminal law-has been around as a proposal in this country forever. I have been in the practice of law now for some 25 years. For some 10 years prior to that, I was a police officer, operating on the other side, so to speak. Even back in my days at university we had lecturers telling our open, young minds how we should go out to practice and try to force change into the codification areas. An example is in how lawyers draft and prepare wills. I recall that we had a lecturer named Stan Robinson. In the drafting course that I did there, he taught us to use English as English in drafting wills and legal documents, to get away from the wherewiths and the hereinbefores and hereinafters. which lawyers are so willing to use because they are bred on precedent and because each is anxious not to change the law in case he or she becomes the first bunny to appear in court for doing a will which is challengeable. As a lawyer, I have found this has always been a major problem in effecting change by the use of language. The English common law, rightly or wrongly, has always operated on the basis that a case decided by judges becomes law. If a judge has made a particular decision on a particular set of circumstances, in the criminal or civil jurisdictions, and it goes to appeal in the final jurisdiction of appeal-in the old days, the Privy Council, or, these days, the High Court of Australia-that becomes a law. Lawyers, if they are careful and do not want to have high surety and indemnity costs, are very loath to change language. They are very frightened to change language, because of the",157,Representatives Main Committee

The common law has never been common. This is one of the great problems. The common law has been inclusive and exclusive. It is only an area of practice which an exclusive few people are privileged to understand or allowed to get involved in. I might say that today it is not so exclusive, because I understand that there are as many legal undergraduates in universities in Australia as there are practising lawyers. Maybe it is time the law was broken up and some of the 'mysteries' of the law were made more available to the general public. I say that as a background to the common law, because it is a mysterious area. Lawyers who practise in it are forced to look at history to determine today's law. They are forced to look at precedent. Most legal training is a study of how one goes into a law library and searches through myriad law reports, back into ancient history. Law books that we all look at are almost falling apart because they are so old. But, as law students, we still go back and pick up these crumbling books, look at the words of judges centuries dead and, with wisdom, ponder upon the words they spoke back then and say, 'This is the law.' Yet law should be current. Law should be appropriate to the day and the circumstances in which we live, as lawyers; in which the parliament operates, as parliamentarians; and in which the people we say we represent live their lives and conduct their business. So this change is long, long overdue. I am so proud that, as a lawyer, I can stand here, as part of a Labor government, and say, yet again, 'We have done it.' As we did with the National Crime Authority, as we did with the changes to the law of evidence, as we did with the Proceeds of Crime Bill, as we did with all of the enormous changes to the law in the last decade, it has been a Labor government that has done it in what is a relatively short space of time in the history of this country. I can say, and I can agree, it has often been with the support of the opposition. particular piece of legislation is being introduced with cooperation and support, and with the support of the lawyers of the parliament. It is interesting to look around and see that it is mostly lawyers who are standing in this debate and who are all supporting it so strongly. There are some who do not understand the law-we know that. Nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an important bill. Whilst it is at the moment Commonwealth law, what I find so pleasing about it is that the states are now cooperating with the Commonwealth through committees, and we hope-indeed, I will almost pray-that within a very short space of time criminal codification will occur across all the states so that there is a unified criminal law operating equally within each state. I notice that the member for Tangney( Mr Williams) has left, but I can say that Victoria has not exactly run away from the process. You do not often find me praising Jeff Kennett-in fact, it is very rare, and I do not think I will even praise him now-but it is fair to point out that the Premier of Victoria has fully supported the process on codificatiori now taking place. I understand Victoria has now joined the process of negotiation and consultation, so, hopefully, those changes will also occur in Victoria. The difficulty that we have always faced in this country, as I said originally, is that the states have sovereign constitutional power and the Commonwealth has limited constitutional power.

250,Mr Cleeland,"--On occasions, it has been cooperative; not always, but on occasions. ThisMC 1352 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 set of laws is through the states. My plea today to the states will be: do not hesitate, do not wait, forget state pride, forget the antagonism which still exists between states, get behind the Commonwealth in this process and ensure that sooner, rather than later, we will have that codified law. There are several aspects of the code, as it is now before the parliament, which are very noteworthy. The first, of course, is section 1.1, which should be noted because it states that the only offences-the only offences-against the laws of the Commonwealth are those offences created by or under the authority of this code or any other act. That is a very important statement. It is a statement which says that the parliament of Australia is the only body which has authority to create criminal offences. That sounds almost as though it need not be stated. But the reality is that, under the English common law system, judges have had the power to create new offences in the criminal area. with some fine judges on it, and I support it fully. we are not discussing Mabo, we are discussing another bill. stressing the supremacy of parliament, which is something I wholly and fully support. It is an indication that the parliament is saying that judge-made law, rather than interpretation, is a thing of the past, and that the parliament is sovereign in terms of what is and is not a criminal offence or the elements of which will create a criminal offence. I join the honourable member for Tangney in enjoying the fact that, finally, actus reus and mens rea will be cast from legal language. They are finally to be cast to the winds and lawyers will not have to sit back and pretend that they are Latin experts when they are not, and they will not have to spend hours practising how to say actus reus or mens rea. If you have a room full of lawyers, you will find 100 different pronunciations of the Latin words or the FrenchNorman words which so many lawyers love to use. is the rest of the language which we love to use to pretend that we are knowledgeable in Latin. However, Latin is no longer a requirement for lawyers as it once it was. Another marvellous element of this criminal code is that, finally, we are talking about physical elements and mental elements, which are the two aspects where we once said actus reus and mens rea. Any reasonably intelligent person can pick up this code, read division 4 and understand what the parliament is saying about the law, and that was never possible in the past As far as division 2.3 is concerned, we are finally saying that there should be a uniform age from which criminal responsibility will flow. The code provides that it is 10 years of age, but currently each state has a different age. It is interesting in a number of ways. Honourable members will know that the current inquiry of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority concerns organised criminal paedophile activity. One of the things we are discussing at the moment, and which it is necessary to work out before we undergo the inquiries, is the question of what a child is. What is, at law, a child?

There are areas which I had never thought of until we started this particular area of inquiry, and yet there may be, within this code provision, an area where we say that, in terms of paedophilic responsibility, a child under 10 is in the area we will look at. That is for the committee to decide, but at least we finally may have a guide so that we can start to define, as a committee, what we are looking at when we talk about a paedophilic act. Currently the law defines sexual offences in terms of age. Even today, in one of the states, it is still a criminal offence for a male above the age of 21 years to have a sexual relationship with a woman above the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, even though it is not a criminal offence for a male above the age of 18 and below the age of 21 to have a sexual relationship with a female between the ages of 16 years and 18 years. statute books in Victoria despite the fact that it has not been used for so long that people probably would have difficulty in finding out where it is. Again, in terms of some of these areas, we need to look at and to codify what we are talking about in terms of criminal and noncriminal sexual activity. It is all over the place between the states at the moment. The laws are old and they are often anachronistic. I recall that even when I was in the police force over 25 years ago the Victorian police did not charge under the 16 to 18 years of age carnal knowledge areas, even though they were often reported. This was primarily because it was so difficult to convict a person of a criminal offence in front of a jury when there was consent. Again, it is an area of codification which is required. This is an area of law about which one can stand and talk for hours and it interests lawyers in particular. I know that Mr Deputy Speaker does not want me to talk for hours, but I confirm the fact, for those who are interested, that this is a very important piece of legislation. This legislation sets the scene for change throughout Australia: change which has been necessary for many years, but which has not been undertaken by the states. It requires a federal approach. It requires the parliament of the Commonwealth to instigate change and to work with the states in establishingNevertheless, Queensland is not Australia. Queensland is just one little part of Australia. As a national parliament we are looking, I hope, at Australia rather than the anachronisms which we call states; because the sooner they go, the better. I support the legislation in its entirety.

I found what he said thought-provoking, although from the government's point of view perhaps a little self-serving in so far as he sought to give to the government full credit for the important steps which are being taken in these two pieces of legislation before the committee this morning, the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995. I think it is important to realise that there is in the community generally a desire that in a nation like Australia, as part of the many reforms that we should make to unify our laws as much as possible, the criminal law ought not to be exempted.

261,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.40 A.m.),"I always enjoy following my colleague the honourableMC 1354 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 the model criminal code was first a suggestion of one of the state or territory attorneys-general. We ought to be collectively congratulating ourselves as Australians on being prepared to bring forward and support two bills which I believe are major steps forward in unifying the criminal law in this nation and making it the same, as much as possible, throughout the country. As has been mentioned, we are debating the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995, and these two bills go hand in hand. It is very appropriate that in this place we should have a cognate debate, because the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995 in effect will include some provisions which will take effect until such time as the Criminal Code Bill comes into effect in about five years time. When receiving advice on what was proposed in these two bills, as is usual the coalition consulted widely throughout the Australian community. We spoke to attorneys-general and shadow attorneys-general throughout the nation, to the Law Council, the New South Wales Criminal Lawyers Association, the Australian Federal Police and so on. I must say that there were no widespread major concerns in relation to the bills, although there were some aspects which, following a debate in the Senate, were referred to a Senate committee. That committee has recommended that the bills proceed, and thus we are not opposing what the government is seeking to do in this particular area. The Criminal Code Bill 1995 concerns, as one would expect, the Commonwealth criminal law. The Commonwealth criminal law encompasses offences created by federal legislation and by regulations, and the principles of criminal responsibility applicable to those offences. To understand any of the current difficulties with our federal system it is important to look at the various state and territory approaches that we have. Various states and territories have different approaches to whether the law ought to be codified or whether there ought to be a common law approach. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT the criminal law has been based on the common law approach. In those jurisdictions, while a significant proportion of offences are contained in acts and regulations many are based on non-legislative common law principles. On the other hand, the criminal law in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory is based on comprehensive codes, and in those jurisdictions there is no recourse to common law principles. It has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams) that Sir Samuel Griffith drafted the criminal code in Queensland, and I believe that code has been followed in many other jurisdictions. It is interesting to see that the Commonwealth is following the Queensland lead in this area of codification of criminal law, although it has taken many years for this to occur. In the early years following Federation, most criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act 1914. That has now changed and criminal offences are contained throughout every conceivable area of Commonwealth legislation. No doubt there is a great maze of confusion because, to ascertain what are Commonwealth criminal offences, one has to go to the government printer and look through almost every statute. As the concept of Australia as a nation has grown, the Commonwealth has brought in many additions to the criminal law in areas such as heritage, the environment and so many other areas which were not envisaged as being suitable for criminal law in those early years. We have a situation where a person could be charged with a Commonwealth offence in a particular state or federal court and, when this occurs, principles of criminal responsibility need to be applied in determining a person's guilt or innocence. Believe it or not, at the present time Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC l355 principles relating to Commonwealth offences are disparate and unsatisfactory. If the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914, common law principles apply. For the remainder and majority of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the relevant state or territory laws apply. This has created a substantial degree of confusion because it could mean that, if a person is charged in one part of the country with a certain offence, then the prosecution would proceed on the basis of the laws and principles of that particular state or territory and, if the offence occurs and the matter proceeds in another part of the country, then a different law could apply. There are major problems of equity when this happens because the different principles which apply in different parts of the country could well impact substantially on the outcome. Most reasonable people would say, if a person is charged with an offence in Australia, that it is appropriate that the rules governing the prosecution should be the same regardless of whether the trial occurs in Queensland, New South Wales or any other part of the nation. Criminal law is a very important area of the law. It is interesting thatJeremy Bentham, when speaking of how the English common law was made at the time, said: Just as a man makes law for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it, and then you beat him for it. While the common law has come a long way since then and the principles are much more certain, one thing that is important, as was indicated by prior speakers, is that when you do have a codified criminal law you have a very great degree of certainty. That is very important in the Australia of 1995. It is important to know what the law is and it is important that, wherever possible, the law should be the same throughout the country as far as Commonwealth offences are concerned. This matter was reviewed by Sir Harry Gibbs and his committee. The review of commonwealth criminal law recommended that there should be general principles for criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law; That report was brought down in 1990. It is interesting that this was not totally a Commonwealth initiative. State and territory governments were very keen to take up the challenge and; as I said previously, it was a state or a territory attorneygeneral who first suggested a model criminal code. In fact, that gentleman was the Hon. Daryl Manzie, who was then the Northern Territory Attorney-General. He suggested that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Out of that the Criminal Law Officers Committee was established and that has been renamed the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. This committee has worked long and hard and the concept of a model criminal code, I believe, will become reality. It is very interesting to see that all states and territories are interested, wherever possible, in working together to ensure that this model Criminal Code becomes a reality. The Criminal Code Bill represents the first part of the implementation of the recommendations of the Gibbs review and, because there are so many things that have to be changed and so many areas right across the law, the implementation will take five years. The government has decided that, in order to achieve consistency while the reform process goes on, there should be an interim position whereby common law principles are applicable to all Commonwealth offences. That requires an amendment to the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that amendment MC 1356 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 is dealt with in the contemporaneous Commonwealth Crimes Act Amendment Bill 1994 which is being debated in a cognate way with the principal piece of legislation we are talking about. Ultimately, the reform agenda is wider than the attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. Of course, the aim is to achieve uniformity across all jurisdictions of criminal law principles by the year 2001. Most importantly, that goal has been endorsed by SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I think that is a major step forward and I understand that a draft model criminal code, first suggested by the Northern Territory Attorney-General, will be available by 1998. The bill actually sets out principles of criminal responsibility which will apply within five years to all Commonwealth offences. The principles are contained in chapter 2 of the code. The five-year delay is necessary because there are a large number of amendments that have to be made across the range of Commonwealth legislation. That is because the offences are drafted on the basis of the principles that may apply. The delay is also a result of the plan to incorporate, with appropriate redrafts, the offences contained in the Crimes Act 1914 into the code. It is planned that those offences will be moved into the criminal code in 1995. The act will be proclaimed and will apply in relation to offences within the code. The code will apply to other Commonwealth offences not later than five years after the date on which the act receives royal assent. The bill is being introduced to put a firm legislative base on the statute book. This will indicate faith with the states and territories and will indicate in a very compelling and certain way that the Commonwealth is committed to the development of a model criminal code. I am. pleased that all parties in the parliament support this very welcome development. At last we are getting the cooperation in this area that has eluded us for quite some time. Chapter1 of the code deals with codification itself. At present, all the chapter provides is that the only offences against the Commonwealth are those created by the code or by any other Commonwealth act. In other words, when the code comes into force there will be no common law Commonwealth criminal law . The principles contained in chapter 2 are a combination of the elements of the common law jurisdictions and the code jurisdictions. As noted in the second reading speech, on the one hand the code contains subjective fault based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of the common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions such as those relating to intoxication, which are closer to the approach of the code jurisdictions. Chapter2 of the code is divided into parts 2.1 to 2.6 inclusive. Part 2.1 of the code outlines the purpose and application of the chapter, which is to codify the general principles of criminal responsibility. Part 2.2 deals with the elements of an offence. It provides that an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements which provide the traditional analytical bases of offences, known as actus reus and mens rea, respectively. Characteristics of the physical elements and fault elements are described in detail in the remainder of part 2.2. The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. The second reading speech also indicates that this was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received and there is a consistency with the US model penal code, the English draft code, the Canadian draft code and, of course, the Gibbs committee recommendations. Part 2.3 contains circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility. It deals with criminal responsibility of minors, mental impairment, intoxication, mistake of fact, mistake Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1357 of law, claim of right, intervening conduct, duress, emergency, and self-defence. The mental impairment provisions follow what is known as the McNaghten test. That test and the relevant provisions provide that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if a person was suffering from a mental impairment such that the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct or did not know that the conduct was wrong or was unable to control the conduct. Particularly noteworthy are the comments in relation to intoxication. Under the provisions, voluntary intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether conduct was voluntary or whether fault elements of an offence element of basic intent existed. It is actually quite interesting because there has been a lot of controversy in relation to this particular area. On balance, the government has come up with one position. Not everyone will agree with the government but I do accept that the government has come to this decision honestly. I have some concerns about it and I know that a number of other people do also. Be that as it may, the coalition is not opposing this particular proposal. The government has actually stated that the approach taken in the bill was consistent with that endorsed by SCAG. Part 2.4 deals with extensions of criminal responsibility. It contains provisions dealing with attempt, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. The bill also makes amendments to the current conspiracy laws to take into account judicial and other criticisms of abuses of conspiracy laws. The provision imposes limits on the situations where conspiracy applies. A lot of the time it seems that people are charged with conspiracy when the Crown cannot dredge up any other offence. I think that what the government is suggesting here is a positive step. Part 2.5 deals with corporate criminal responsibility. There were some concerns with what the government was suggesting here but there has been a recommendation that this matter proceed as part of the bill. Part 2.6 codifies established principles dealing with proof of criminal responsibility and the respective burdens of proof that must be discharged. The government has decided that certain areas cannot wait for the five years and that is understandable. It has decided that the age of criminal responsibility must be determined and put into effect now. The law of attempt must be clarified and also the law relating to conspiracy. Provisions mirroring those in the bill have been included in the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994, which is intended, as I said earlier, to take effect relatively sooo. When the Criminal Code Bill enters into force, the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 will be repealed. The government is bringing in the cognate bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill, to cover the loopholes until the principal piece of legislation becomes law. The interim measure could be criticised by some saying that really it is a stopgap measure. I think it is important that, given the matters to be covered by the Crimes Amendment Bill, these matters are brought into law now. The coalition is certainly not opposing what the government is suggesting. The matters included in the Crimes Amendment Bill.1994 include the age of criminal responsibility which, as the honourable member for McEwen( Mr Cleeland) said, will standardise the current situation so that persons under 10 years cannot be liable for offences against Commonwealth law. Concerning the law of attempt, the provisions require that the conduct said to constitute the attempt must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The provisions allow a conviction even where committing the MC 1358 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,1 March 1995 offence attempted is impossible. With respect to the law relating to conspiracy, the provision aims to reduce abuse of conspiracy charges. The provisions only apply where the offence to which they relate has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of more than $20,000. Proceedings may only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. So we have a situation where we have two bills before the Committee today. These bills are the product of a long period of consultation, a long period of cooperation between people at this level of government and those representing the states and the territories. I commend the minister on this particular approach. I commend the government and all those who have participated in the discussions until now. The law has been complicated. There have been problems. We have, quite often, continued to operate as though we are six or seven different countries and not a nation. I do w1l.nt to reject absolutely the suggestion made by the honourable member for McEwen that the states should be abolished. I believe in the federal system. I believe the states perform a very worthwhile function. It ought to be remembered that a federal system is a guarantee of decentralisation of power. When we have a decentralisation of power, it is fairly clear that we will not have a concentration of authority in too few hands. If we abolished the states and we gave all power to the Commonwealth parliament and, indeed, to the Prime Minister, that would be a very retrograde step from the point of view of Australian democracy. I therefore support the federal system of government, as does the coalition, but that does not mean that we will not work and cooperate with all other levels of government and encourage cooperation to ensure that, wherever possible, we are able to standardise laws and procedures throughout Australia. Quite often the different laws and the different procedures we have had in different parts of the country have ensured that inequities and unfairnesses have occurred, and no-one would support that. The legislation before the committee today is important legislation. It is a positive step forward. It indicates the Commonwealth's commitment to this cooperative approach. I commend the minister, I commend the government, but I commend also all of the state and territory governments which have been part of this very important process, which I believe will be of immense benefit to our nation. of short remarks to conclude this debate. BeforeI turn to some more general comments in closing, I take this moment to put on record particular thanks for the work of David Neal, who chaired the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee for some time and then proceeded to work as a consultant in the area. David Neal has just recently had a motor vehicle accident which has caused him quite severe injuries. I am sure that all members of this committee would wish him well in his recovery and hope that the sterling work he has done, which has been so widely commended in the debate, continues. We might also recognise the work being done by those in the department that have been supporting the process. They have been entirely committed to it. We have set a fairly tight timetable in going to the year 200 I-the pressure is really quite on them-and they have risen to the occasion very well. I will make a couple of remarks about what has been said in this debate. Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams) and the honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper), from the opposition parties, who have spoken.

His is always a vital voice to be listened to in these areas and I note particularly his warning that, as we move down this process, we should avoid following models which have commended themselves in the United States and in Europe but which appear not to be appropriate for us to follow. I note also his concern that we should not allow ourselves as parliamentarians to be drawn into knee-jerk responses to immediate pressures that come from time to time, but should rather look at this as a constructive and consultative process that needs to bear in mind the whole range of issues, including those coming from those concerned with law enforcement, those concerned with civil liberties and those concerned with the community as a whole. As to my colleague the honourable member for McEwen( Mr Cleeland), I thank him for his generous remarks. I too am pleased that Victoria now is settled into the process of reform. The comments by the Victorian PremierI welcome very much, in his commitment in joining with other premiers towards uniform criminal legislation. I close by saying that the thing that really impresses me about the development of the Criminal Code Bill is the way in which all those involved, whether they be state or territory officials or the parties in this parliament, have worked well towards achieving agreement on principled and workable sets of laws suitable for adoption across Australia. I think it is a fitting credit to this parliament that it be the first to enact general principles of criminal responsibility, as an expression of confidence in the aim of uniformity, and I look forward to other governments doing likewise. This bill was scrutinised in detail by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which includes the opposition and Democrats spokespersons on the Attorney General's portfolios. I wish to personally thank: Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler for the spirit in which they approached the bill. I know that they have made an important contribution towards the development of worthwhile, progressive and uniform criminal laws for Australia. I might note that in debate each raised some specific matters on which they have sought further advice, and I will undertake that in due course my department will respond to the specifics that they have raised. I believe, however, that the contributions from those who have spoken in this debate have all shown vision. The same can be said for the support that has come for the criminal code from the highest levels of government. The Prime Minister( Mr Keating) and each Premier and Chief Minister have committed themselves to the ongoing development of the model criminal code. That is very important since the project is long-term and is aiming for completion in every jurisdiction by the year 2001. I thank all the members of the House who have participated.

The Archives Amendment Bill will make amendments of a minor policy nature to the Archives Act 1983. The Australian Archives plays an important role in ensuring that the history of government in Australia is preserved and is available for access by future generations of Australians. These amendments are intended to clarify the application of the Archives Act to two types of records, namely the records of government business enterprises and other commercialised bodies and the records of the national witness protection program. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments relating to government business enterprises will result in indirect savings through improved efficiency in the process associated with the commercialisation, incorporation and sale of government bodies. The first category of amendments concerns the application of the Archives Act to government business enterprises. In the last few years, the Commonwealth has been reviewing the structure and operations of government business enterprises. As a result, a number of these bodies have been commercialised, incorporated or privati sed in order to improve the efficiency of their operations. Unfortunately, the method used to incorporate or privatise these bodies in the last few years has resulted in problems for the Australian Archives. The first is that legislation used to privatise or corporatise the government enterprise has, on several occasions, had the effect that the body was no longer subject to the Archives Act. The second problem is that a particular legislative process used to incorporate bodies also had the effect of removing all the preincorporation records of the body from the operation of the Archives Act. As a result of this process, the Australian Archives has lost control of the pre-incorporation records of bodies such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The amendments concerning government business enterprises are intended to prevent the inadvertent removal of records from the operation of the Archives Act as a consequence of a change in structure of certain bodies. To this end, the bill provides for:",167,Representatives Main Committee

These amendments will preserve established statutory rights of access to records of national significance or public interest. It should be recognised that the bill will not prevent the transfer of Commonwealth records where the government decides this is necessary. The amendments provide for the government to preclude the application of the Archives Act to commercial government bodies, either by means of the legislation relating to the incorporation or sale of the body or by an amendment to the regulations to the Archives Act. The bill will not apply to bodies that were excluded from the application of the Archives Act prior to the commencement of these amendments. The second category of amendments concerns the application of the Archives Act to the records of the national witness protection program. Earlier this year the government enacted the National Witness Protection Act 1994. This act provides a legislative basis for a program run by the Australian Federal Police which is designed to facilitate the provision of high-level witness protection, including the issuing of alternative identity documents for protected witnesses. This bill makes special provision for access to and custody of records of the national witness protection program. The bill: permits the Australian Federal Police to retain custody of certain sensitive documents relating to the national witness protection program, rather than requiring those records to be transferred to the Australian Archives; ensures that certain highly sensitive documents relating to the national witness protection program are exempted from public disclosure under the Archives Act; and makes specific provision for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, or a staff member associated with the national witness protection program, to provide documents and/or evidence to a private hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I commend the bill to the House. Dr KEMP (Goldstein) (12.13 p.m.)-The Archives Amendment Bill seeks to ensure that bodies established for a public purpose or under Commonwealth control, such as government business enterprises, remain subject to the Archives Act 1983 after a change in their structure, and that legislation in relation to the national witness protection program is clarified. These proposed amendments are not anticipated to have any significant financial impact. In fact, the government has claimed that the amendments relating to government business enterprises will result in minor savings through improved efficiency in the process associated with the commercialisation, incorporation and sale of government bodies. The Australian Archives is responsible for the management of Commonwealth records, including the transfer of ownership or custody of such records. There is currently no legislation in place which prevents bodies established for public purposes, such as government business enterprises which have been commercialised, incorporated or privatised, from inadvertently MC 1362 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,l March 1995 or otherwise removing their pre-incorporation records from the Archives. As a result, the Archives has already relinquished control of the pre-incorporation records of such bodies as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The amendments which the government is proposing will ensure that all records in relation to bodies such as these and government business enterprises will be subject to the Archives Act 1983. This means that the Archives will have control over the pre-incorporation records of bodies which are subsequently removed from the application of the Archives Act as a result of structural changes, unless the legislation associated with the change, or an amendment to the Archives Regulations, specifically exclude the body. The government must, in other words, consciously decide whether or not records should stay in the Archives or be transferred to the new body. The coalition does not oppose these amendments. The bill also deals with the records of the national witness protection program. The proposed amendments will clarify the current legislation concerning the protection of witnesses or participants in the national witness protection program. This will be achieved by identifying the circumstances in which records associated with the program can be exempted from being transferred to Archives and by protecting certain material from being publicly disclosed. The Australian Federal Police will be able to retain sensitive documents relating to the program, and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or a staff member associated with the program will be permitted to provide documents and/or evidence to a private hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These amendments will strengthen the protection afforded by current legislation and, again, the coalition does not oppose them. relating to the records of government business enterprises. The Australian Archives has a statutory responsibility to ensure that Commonwealth records of value for historical research or which document rights and entitlements of individual citizens are preserved for future generations. The present amendments to the Archives Act 1983 address a problem which has become evident in recent years with the corporatisation and privatisation of Commonwealth functions. There have been a number of instances in which valuable Commonwealth records have been transferred or sold with government business enterprises. Although this was not necessarily the intention, it occurred because of the form of the legislation authorising the sales. In consequence, there was no longer a public right of access to the records once they reached the age of 30 years and, hence, the new owners had the right to destroy them if they saw fit. The Archives has naturally been concerned for a number of years to rectify this situation to ensure that valuable records are preserved. In some cases, records of privatised enterprises are of no further interest to the Commonwealth or the public, and it is appropriate for them to be transferred to the new owner. However, as has been mentioned in earlier speeches, there are other cases-for example, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, Australian Airlines and the Australian National Line-where the records include important historical material.",168,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (12.15 P.m.),"I would like to speak firstly on the amendmentsWednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1363 The only existing remedies for this problem are: to seek to have provisions for retention of the records included in the legislation authorising the incorporation or sale of the enterprise; to bring the records back into the coverage of the act by regulation; and to induce the new owner to deposit the older records with the Australian Archives' corporate archives service. All three remedies are uncertain and time consuming. The amendments provide that, if a Commonwealth enterprise is sold, the records which are created up to the time of sale will continue to be subject to the Archives Act 1983, unless there is specific provision for their removal either in the legislation authorising the sale or in a regulation under the act. The amendments are not intended to keep all such records within the act, but merely to ensure that the issue of their appropriate disposition is consciously addressed as part of the sale process. The second item I wish to discuss is the amendments relating to the national witness protection program. The amendments are intended to strengthen the protection of information which might lead to the identification of protected witnesses. They are consequential to the passage of the Witness Protection Act 1994. The amendment to section 29 permits the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to determine, without the need to seek concurrence of the Director-General of the Australian Archives, that records may be withheld from transfer to the Archives if their release might endanger the safety of an actual or potential protected witness. All records of the security and intelligence agencies already have a similar protection. The amendment to section 33 confirms that the exemption category covering confidential sources of information in relation to the enforcement or administration of the law extends to a person who has provided confidential information to the National Crime Authority or the Australian Federal Police or who has been included in the national witness protection program. The amendments do not remove the statutory right of members of the public to seek access under the Archives Act 1983 to records relating to protected witnesses once the records reach the age of 30 years, regardless of whether the records are by then in the custody of the Archives or the Australian Federal Police. Nor do they prevent members of the public from applying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision to exempt such records from public access. I now turn from the specific amendments to say something about the Australian Archives. Although 1994 marked the 50th anniversary of the appointment of the first Commonwealth archivist, throughout most of that period the Archives has been very much an organisation in the background. An archives act was developed during the 1970s but was not passed by this parliament until 1983. In recent years, the Australian Archives has sought to put greater emphasis on its public role-its role in relation to all Australians-and to make more Australians aware of what it has to offer. It is thus assuming its rightful place as not only an integral part of government administration, but one of the significant cultural institutions of our country. The Advisory Council on Australian Archives, of which I am a member, has actively encouraged the Archives to be more outgoing and to make its achievements and collections better known. The role of a national government archives is not always apparent, yet it is one of the essential supporting pillars of any democracy. The Australian Archives contributes to the maintenance and understanding of political, social and cultural values in Australia. It does this MC 1364 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,1 March 1995 in three very clear ways: it promotes the role of records as evidence in supporting the role of law; it supports the effectiveness and accountability of government administration; and it preserves documentation about the interaction between the people of Australia and their governments. The history of the Australian Archives has been one of significant achievement. The Archives has devised a unique system for the intellectual quality of records. This system has become the de facto standard in Australia and it is copied and emulated widely. It has set new standards in the management of access to government records. These standards balance the public's right to know and the competing demand for protection from unreasonable disclosure of personal affairs. In size and scale, the Australian Archives is the dominant archival institution in Australia. It is established in each state and the Northern Territory, as well as in Canberra, and its collections are truly distributed. It holds over 200,000 shelf metres of records of enduring value, documenting the archives of government and people. Almost every subject imaginable is represented in its collections, which are a little known treasure trove of information on our nation's development. Something of the flavour of what I want to convey about the Archives was captured in an editorial in the Canberra Times earlier this year. It described the Archives as 'one of the great treasure houses of Australian history and culture'. It also noted that for most of its SO-year history the treasure has been sadly underdeveloped, under-resourced and underexploited, even by government and the bureaucracy, let alone by the public. The editorial continued: The Archives holds most of the constitutional documents which are the national birth certificates;just as significantly its records of public administration and policy development tell not only of the development of the nation and how Australia's politicians and public servants handled their public trusts, but also the stories of millions of Australians: our Aborigines, our immigrants, our soldiers, our industries and our agriculture, the development of communities, particularly Canberra, and the way Australia and Australians saw the world and changing times. In recent years, the Archives has had some notable achievements which I believe should be mentioned. One such achievement concerns the type of paper which is used when records are being created. Building good quality paper into records of likely long-term value saves preservation dollars. The adage about prevention being better than cure certainly applies when the size of the Australian Archives' existing preservation challenge is understood-those 200,000 metres of records of enduring value amount to over 1,100 million individual documents. Building recycled paper into files of short-term importance also makes good sense. The Australian Archives has taken on the issue of paper quality and has taken notice of the increasing concern in the community about the environment and the growth of interest in recycled papers. It has used this concern to promote the development of archival quality paper manufactured through processes which use industrial cotton waste rather than virgin pulp. Through a joint venture with Australian Paper, Visyboard andUnistat, the Australian Archives has ensured the manufacture and marketing of a range of paper products and storage containers at low cost. The availability of these Australian made products will allow all cultural institutions to have access to high quality materials to improve the preservation of Australia's cultural heritage. On the other side of the coin, in order to promote the use of recycled papers in appropriate Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1365 cases, the Archives has developed and published guidelines for the use of papers. Those guidelines set out for the user situations where it is appropriate to use recycled papers and those where archival quality papers should be used. The Australian Archives has also recognised the challenges presented by the development of electronic records, and it certainly does not underestimate these challenges. They were encapsulated in an article in the January issue of Scientific American written by Jeff Rothenberg, a computer scientist with Rand Corporation. Rothenberg began the article with the following scenario: The year is 2045, any my grandchildren (as yet unborn) are exploring the attic of my house (as yet unbought). They find a letter dated 1995 and a CD-ROM. The letter says the disk contains a document that provides the key to obtaining my fortune (as yet unearthed). My grandchildren are understandably excited, but they have never before seen a CD-except in old movies. Even if they can find a suitable disk drive, how will they run the sofiwarenecessaryto interpret what is on the disk? How can they read my obsolete digital document? Of course, electronic records pose problems not only for individuals but also for governments, and they are with us now, regardless of what 2045 will bring. In this rapidly developing area of communication and technology, there are no hard and fast rules. The Archives has recognised, however, that guidance and advice is necessary even in this situation where the technology is constantly changing and hence the advice may have to be. adjusted. In a culmination of some two years work in this area, the Archives in November last year hosted a major conference bringing together archivists, record managers, librarians, other information professionals and computer industry personnel to review the state of knowledge about preservation of electronic records and to develop some consensus of approach. The conference was widely attended from Australia and overseas. In recognition of the expertise of the specialists from the Archives acknowledged at the conference, it is now represented on the electronic records committee of the International Council on Archives. I mentioned at the outset that the Australian Archives has put increasing emphasis on public programs in recent years. Over the last three years, it has mounted a range of exhibitions drawn from items in its collections which both inform and challenge our knowledge and memory of past evidence. A highlight of this exhibition program has been the exhibition 'Between Two Worlds', which explores the experiences of people of part-Aboriginal descent who were taken away from their families earlier this century. The exhibition opened at Sydney in October 1993 and has been at anumber of venues across the country. since then. The exhibition is currently in Western Australia and is scheduled to open in Dubbo in May. Other significant exhibitions that have been staged in Old Parliament House include' Making Ends Meet', which is about the development of child endowment for Australian families, and an exhibition on 'Trademarks' as part of Australia's cultural identify. To mark the 50th anniversary of the death of John Curtin, the Archives is staging an exhibition on Curtin's life, which will open in this building later this year. The exhibition is being developed in conjunction with the Curtin Foundation and will eventually reside permanently at the Curtin Centre in Perth. The importance of exhibitions is the opportunity they provide to reach a much wider number Of Australians. The greater majority of us will never become researchers in the search rooms MC 1366 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 of the Australian Archives but, through exhibitions, the Archives is able to reach a much wider audience to enable people to be informed about aspects of Australia's history and development. Another project the Archives has commenced is the production of the first comprehensive guide to the records relating to the. development of the constitution and federation in Australia. The Archives sees this as its major contribution to the centenary of federation. Its intention is that the guide be completed and published well ahead of 2001 so it will be available as a source for others writing about and preparing education kits and exhibitions on federation. This guide will build upon a series of published guides the Archives has already published in recent years, such as those describing records relating to genealogical research, to lighthouses and to Aboriginal Australians. It is appropriate at this stage to look at the future environment for the Archives. The Australian Archives has identified a number of challenges it needs to address over the coming decade. These are: challenges in the changing nature of records and their use in governmentand I have already referred to the issue of electronic records in this context; challenges in increasing users' appreciation of the records in the Archives' custody and access to them; challenges in arresting the deterioration of records in custody. conversations. value of records to government and the community but establish standards for documentation; to direct resources increasingly towards the identification, control, preservation and acceptability of records of enduring value; and to promote wider acceptability and use of the archival resources of Australia. The Archives is pursuing these strategies vigorously. I have already referred to some of the achievements. It is also conscious of the need to work cooperatively with other cultural institutions and seeks to do so wherever possible. In meeting the challenges it has identified, the Archives is changing from a low profile backroom agency, which was principally a warehouse for government records that had ceased to be of administrative use, to a modem archival institution which seeks to employ best practices in its facilities, in its handling of records and in making them available to the public. I referred earlier to the access arrangements the Archives has developed. Under the Archives Act, there is a general presumption that government records will be available for public scrutiny after 30 years as a right. The task of ensuring that records are available to the public at 30 years has always been a challenge to the Archives. Honourable members will be aware that the 30-year-old cabinet records are made available each new year and there is a growing media interest in them. Indeed, a straightforward comparison of the 1994 and 1995 openings of 1963 and 1964 cabinet papers reveals the realisation that there is a records superhighway worth exploring. The press coverage this year, whether measured in terms of editorials, letters to the editor, number of articles or column inches, more than doubled over the last year. Given the need to examine records for material that might need to remain exempt after 30 years, it has not always been possible for other 30-year-old material to be so readily available. Increased efforts by the Archives in this area and the development of new approaches in the light of experience are now enabling the Archives to ensure to a much greater extent that records will be readily available when sought. Obviously, the resource costs of preserving and making records available are significant. In Australia and in other Western democracies this has always been seen as a legitimate expenditure in the public interest.",170,Representatives Main Committee

By way of example, in 1989-90 visits to the search room by members of the public totalled 7,500. By 1993-94 this had almost doubled to 13,500. Over the same five-year period, the number of new researchers registering with the Archives each year increased from 2,145 in 1989-90 to 3,284 in 1993-94. Other statistics reveal a similar growth. One thing the Archives lacks is a significant national building in order to focus its presence. The Advisory Council on Australian Archives has, since its inception, identified the lack of a national building as the outstanding requirement to enable the Archives to take its rightful place amongst the significant cultural institutions of this nation. There have been plans and proposals for a national archives building since this national capital was first developed. To date, none of them have come to fruition. Because of its unique position as a central support to government administration, as well as being a significant cultural institution holding much of the information about Australia's development, I believe that now is the time to decide that the Archives deserves a permanent location within the national capital's central areas. I know that the Archives has indicated that part of the building presently occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-the administrative building-would provide a suitable national headquarters. It would seem to be too good an opportunity to miss and would avoid the need for a substantial capital outlay on a new building. Only when it is appropriately located does the council believe that the Archives will have the opportunity to perform its role to the greatest effect. I have spoken at some length about the Australian Archives-but I did follow some people speaking about a legal bill-because it is an important institution and it receives too little attention in this place. Let me conclude by saying that the evidence is on the record that the Australian Archives has substantial achievements to its credit. It is focused in its approach and has a clear view and strategy for the next decade. It is aware of the challenges that confront a modern archives and is meeting these challenges. If it achieves its goals, we can confidently expect that the Australian Archives, at the turn of the century, will be a vital national organisation assisting good administration and accountability in government and making a valuable contribution to understanding our past and how our society has evolved. As I said at the outset, along with Senator Margaret ReidI serve on the Advisory Council on Australian Archives. I think we are the longest serving members, having served on the council for approximately 10 years, and we hope that we make a significant contribution. I appeal to my parliamentary colleagues, especially ministers, parliamentary secretaries and chairpersons of caucus, in saying that the Labor Party caucus records should be in the Australian Archives, not in the National Library.· I appeal to honourable members to investigate with Australian Archives the possibility of storing your office correspondence so that future generations and future researchers can study that documentation and see what a wise and able group of people occupied this building in this year.

In starting my contribution to the debate on the Archives Amendment Bill, I refer to my favourite author, George Orwell, whose magnum opus is Nineteen Eighty-four. Some honourable members-particularly those honourable members who saw the very good film which was made of the book Nineteen Eighty-four starring Richard Burton and John Hurtmay recall the role played by Winston Smith. Winston Smith, of course, played the role of the antihero of the novel and he had a function to perform in the ministry of truth. In the book, the ministry of truth deals with lies, similar to the ministry of plenty, which deals with shortages, and the ministry of peace, with deals with wars. The ministry of truth and the ministry of plenty are similar to the ministry of employment in the Labor government which predominantly deals with unemployment. In Winston Smith's role in the ministry of truth, his job was to update back copies of the Times newspaper and to alter them in such a way as to reflect more positively on the regime, the Ingsoc, the ruling English socialist party of Oceana, or Landstrip 1, as the United Kingdom was termed in the novel. There is a particular maxim that is used in the ministry of truth by Ingsoc, and that is 'He who controls the present controls the past, and he who controls the past controls the future.' Those who saw that particularly well-made film and who can recall the images of John Hurt as Winston Smith sitting there, sending down the old versions of the Times newspaper into the vast furnace that was, presumably, on the bottom floor or in the basement of this large pyramid shaped building, can understand how an. ability to control the past and to be able to alter history places the present incumbents in a very powerful position indeed. In order for us to be able to interpret history, in order for us to be able to interpret the present and to iook towards the future, we require records, documents and those valuable oral histories which are being compiled this year as part of the Australia Remembers commemoration. These sorts of items and government records are invaluable for citizens to be able to determine exactly how the present situation came to pass and what has occurred in the past. When one looks at recent history-in particular, in my state, the state of Western Australiaunder the previous Labor governments of Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and, of course, Carmen Lawrence, one of the most serious criticisms by the royal commission that was conducted into the affairs of Western Australia Inc. was that many documents and other records of ministers and cabinet were discovered to be missing. This situation meant that it was very difficult for the royal commissioners to be able to determine precisely what had occurred. In fact, on a number of occasionsIf the parliamentary secretary had listened to my opening remarks, he would see how it is relevant. Particularly in the case of the records of cabinet-which are very important records in any government system-there were occurrences where evidence of the missing records was the fact that there were yellow tabs still stuck in the files where those records ought to have been. It was as though somebody had left the yellow tabs in place in case they needed to put the missing records back in the right place . .

273,Mr Filing,"The parliamentary secretary asked, 'What has this got to do with the bill?'Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1369 The Archives Amendment Bill is a bill which makes amendments in minor policy. Nonetheless, the amendments are important because they impact on our principal source of national records, Australian Archives, which was established by the Archives Act in 1983. I listened with great interest yesterday to the statement by the Speaker of the House of Representatives in relation to access to other important databases, such as those which are held by the Parliamentary Library, and, most particularly, the Hansard records of parliamentary debates. The Speaker made quite positive and progressive comments about the accessibility of those records to the community. In fact, via the Internet, that incredible expanding communication network that Australians can have access to at a relatively cheap cost, people will soon be able to go into the Hansard records and be able to conduct searches in the records, such as we are able to do in our own personal computers which are on-line with the Parliamentary Library. This is a very significant and important democratic influence because, quite clearly, in any vibrant and healthy democracy, access to information, particularly the records of decisionmakers, of particular public officials, is critical. That is why any movement to make those records more accessible to the community is to be commended. The Australian Archives is responsible for the management of records, including the storage, transfer and custody of those records. The bill arises from issues in relation to ownership of some of these records, particularly from previous government departments that have been privatised, corporatised or in some other changed in a way that may mean that those records become unavailable or less available to the Australian Archives and to the community. The bill arises from the inadvertent loss of ownership over pre-incorporation records of organisations such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. But I would like to point out that, while the ramifications of this bill do not impact greatly on the man or woman in the street, there is at the heart of this matter the general principle of access to information of all kinds in this country, particularly that information that is contained within the numerous government archives. I raised the question of Western Australia Inc. because that was, within recent memory, a good example of how records that are critical to the public interest can be lost or spirited away in such a way that the commissioners of the WA Inc. royal commission were deprived of the opportunity to verify the truth of the matter in relation to the issues that they had undertaken to examine or investigate. It made for less efficient royal commission findings: because of the lack of particular documents, the commissioners were unable to reach conclusions on a number of matters. That is one of the reasons why I, and members of the opposition, have a great deal of interest in the workings of the Australian Archives, as do the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) and Senator Reid of the Australian Capital Territory, both of whom are on the board. I commend their work in ensuring that the Archives do reflect the intent to provide accessible information for Australian citizens. I can tell you, speaking from the perspective of Western Australians who live on the other side of the continent, that access to the Archives in a number of cases has become a matter of some concern. In particular, I refer to a gentleman by the name of Mr Funch of Roleystone, in the hills of the metropolitan area. He is an historian who finds his research all but impossible now that the government has indicated he must fully pay for his research projects. MC 1370 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 March 1995 Formerly, he was able to have the assistance of staff at the Australian Archives to assist him with various projects. We find that, as a consequence of those charges, historians like Mr Funch and others who reside in Western Australia or, for that matter, in other more remote states find themselves at a considerable disadvantage, compared with those who may reside within travelling distance of the archive. I might also at the same time refer to another important Australian institution, the War Memorial, which is another source of records invaluable to historians who are endeavouring to write about Australia's past. In many cases these are people who are writing about histories that are perhaps less significant in terms of the national stage, but significant in terms of regional local interests: histories of some importance to local people or to people who reside in a particular area. Jim Davies is another historian Who resides in my electorate who has written a number of popular books about Australia's involvement in World War II. One book, The Lady was not a Spy, detailed in anecdotal form the adventures of Army and other service personnel along the Western Australian coast during the Second WorId War. Although it is not strictly relevant to the Australian Archives, it is following down the same issue. Both Mr Funch and Mr Davies, in their respective interests in obtaining information, have had difficulty in being able to get the information, because both the Archives and the War Memorial have stopped doing research for local authors. That has severely affected Mr Funch's ability to be able to write his local history and, in the case of Mr Davies, to write a follow-up book to The Lady was not a Spy which deals with wartime experiences of people in Western Australia. I have made a number of representations on behalf of both of these particular people. In the Australian Archives-he must now pay a professional researcher up to $40 an hour to attend the War Memorial or the Australian Archives to be able to avail himself of that information. Obviously in the case of a state like Western Australia-and, I am sure, in the case of the home state of the honourable meniberJor Moncrieff( Mrs Sullivan)-that is a severe financial impediment. The travelling costs and the accommodation are so prohibitive that unless historians are writing things that are going to be huge best-sellers, they could not possibly afford to travel to the national capital to undertake their own research. In my view, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is flying in the face of the stated policy of the government to make these types of records more readily available for the Australian community. of Australia the interests of all Australians, not just those that live within reasonable motoring distance of here, ought to be regarded. They ought to be given the opportunity to avail themselves of this information without prohibitive costs. On behalf of these two historians I have written to the various ministers to elicit a more favourable response for them. Unfortunately, the best they could say was that in the case of the War Memorial there is a research fund, and that the Australian Archives can provide access to the actual indexes of information. But these people would have to avail themselves of a researcher to pull out those particular documents and look at them and do whatever necessary research is involved. As I said earlier, that is a severe impediment to the writing of local histories in my home state.",176,Representatives Main Committee

Nonetheless, in a federation the sizeWednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1371 The minister tells me that most of the information is available at state archive departments at 30c a page. He also informs me that, in the case of the War Memorial, all books held in the research centre are listed on the Australian Bibliographic Network, available at larger state libraries. The War Memorial in particular has limited research grants available, but these are all but useless to writers of small histories such as Mr Funch and Mr Davies. They are forced to rely on the goodwill and assistance of government departments, and it seems that in the case of the federal government this goodwill is drying up. In the name of user pays, we see that in the case of outlying states-the more remote states-people are unable to get that access. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to refer to the matter concerning to the arrangements in relation to the Australian Archives and the national witness protection plan. The Parliamentary Secretary ( Mr Lindsay) was pointing at me a minute ago. He and I used to be on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority together, and he would know that in the case of the national witness protection plan there are very, very significant confidentiality and secrecy requirements. Under normal circumstances I would have to agree entirely with the provisions that are in the bill to provide for exemption for Australian Federal Police documents relating to the NWPP. However, the difficulty is that that does tend to make for a less accountable situation in the case of the AFP. I would prefer to see a situation where there were provisions for a more secret arrangement within the Archives for those types of documents. Clearly, nobody would like to endanger protected witnesses by having their records available to all and sundry, but I would like to see that there is proper accountability and scrutiny of the AFP and, in particular, the NWPP. As a consequence, I would prefer to see a situation where the exemption is not just at the behest of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner but is by mutual arrangement between the Director-General of Archives and the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, where the substantial concerns of public interest are taken into account and where, when necessary, extra secure arrangements can be made for those types of records within the Archives itself. As I said at the beginning, this is a non-controversial or, let us say, a minor policy change in relation to the Archives. I would like to reiterate the theme of my speech: in the interests of greater accountability, in the interests of a fairer democratic system in our nation, in the interests of those people who live in the outlying states, I urge the honourable member responsible for guiding this legislation through the committee on behalf of the government to reconsider the arrangements in the Archives for people from my state and other outlying states to be able to access historical documents, to make access more fair and equitable to all concerned. respect of the Archives Amendment Bill. The first relates to the national witness protection program, which the honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) has just mentioned; the second is the contemplation by the bill of legislation by regulation. The Archives Act 1983 established the Australian Archives, which is responsible for the management of Commonwealth records, including the transfer of custody or ownership of those records. This bill has been prompted by the need to ensure that the Archives Act applies to the preincorporation records of such bodies as government business enterprises which have since establishment been commercialised, incorporated or privatised. Under the current law, there",178,Representatives Main Committee
277,Mr Williams (Tangney) (12.52 P.m.),"There are two matters I wish to mention inMC 1372 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,1 March 1995 is nothing to prevent such bodies from inadvertently or deliberately removing their preincorporation records from the Australian Archives. This defect in the law has resulted in the pre-incorporation records of bodies such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation being lost to the Australian Archives. The Australian Federal Police is a Commonwealth statutory authority established by the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and, as such, would come within the purview of the Archives Act. But it is important, in the interests of protecting witnesses who are part of the national witness protection program and of preserving the integrity of that program generally, that certain sources and classes of information in the hands of the AFP not be publicly disclosed. The bill, therefore, exempts from the application of the Archives Act 1983 sensitive records concerning witnesses and participants who are connected with the witness protection program. The exemption is not to apply to such non-sensitive documents as those relating to administrative or budgetary matters, where those documents would not reveal information concerning a witness or a person assessed for inclusion in the program. As I have said, this is clearly important to the integrity of the program. There is no point in establishing an elaborate arid secure scheme for creating, bestowing and protecting a new identity for a witness if the records relating to that scheme are as accessible as those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. On the other hand, I support the call by the honourable member for Moore for some form of accountability. It is difficult to see how this might be done conveniently but perhaps something in the nature of a prison governor sworn to secrecy who can make regular inspections or audits would be appropriate. The second matter to which I refer is a matter of concern. Proposed section 3A provides that a body that was established for a public purpose is deemed for the purposes of the Archives Act never to have been so established if either a legislative provision or regulations made for the purposes of the proposed section 3A expressly provide that the body is to be taken never to have been so established. I share the concern of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee in relation to this provision. The effect of section 3A is that regulations as well as primary legislation can deem a body not to have been established for a public purpose. The ultimate effect of that is that such a body will fall outside the scope of the Archives Act. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has commented that this may be regarded as 'an inappropriate delegation of legislative power'. The committee has sought the minister's advice on whether it might not be more appropriate to achieve this purpose by amending the primary legislation, the Archives Act, instead of the use in this way of the power to make regulations. To date I am not aware that the minister has made a satisfactory or, indeed, any response to the committee's concern. On other occasions I have referred to my concerns about this government's use of regulations to bypass parliament. We must be vigilant to ensure that the parliament's role is not subverted by delegating the proper work of the parliament to the government to do behind closed doors. This is what happens when legislation is taken out of the hands of the parliament and appropriated by a department in the form of statutory regulations. Parliament's role is important, not so that we as parliamentarians may have something to do with our time, but because we, the members of parliament, are the representatives of the Wednesday, 1 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1373 people and, as such, are a crucial part of the democratic process. Our particip Ition should be observable by the public to whom we are accountable. Technology) (12.56 p.m.)-in reply-I thank all honourable members wh(, have made a contribution to the debate on the Archives Amendment Bill, in particular he member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis), the member for Mcore( Mr Filing) and the member for Tangney( Mr Williams). In response to some of the com nents made by the member for Moore, I wish to place on the record that Australian Archives charges for the provision of photocopies of records. It does not charge for access to records b:' those who are able to visit the search rooms of Archives. However, Archives does have standards of service for customers beyond which it does not have the resources to proceed. Hence if a researcher requires extensive research to be done and cannot visit the Archives, that per5 on will have to engage the services of a professional researcher. Accordingly, that presents a problem to Australian Archives to provide a senice of the kind that is sought by the member for Moore. One remedy Archives is examining is to microfilm the most important records so that copies can be made available in all offices (.f Archives and in some cases in public libraries. Nevertheless, the holdings of Archives are s( vast that it can only ever hope to microfilm a small proportion of them. In relation to the matter raised by the member for Tangney with respect to l1e implications of proposed new section 3A, I respond by saying that this matter has been dis -ussed with the Secretary of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The point that the comr tittee has made is clearly appreciated. Nevertheless, the power of regulation was inserted at th suggestion of the Attorney-General's Department. It is thought that this is the appropriate Hay to proceed. In so far as this method of procedure is concerned, the committee has been, or ,vill be, advised that the power of regulation will be used judiciously and will not be used cal lriciously. I am sure that the member for Tangney is assured by that solemn undertaking by Australian Archives, given his extensive and eminent legal background. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is nearly 1 o'clock. I had intended to make some cemarks on the necessity for Australian Archives to develop new policies that deal with ile retention of electronic information, particularly electronic information held by cor Iputers within government service and also within government business enterprises.
