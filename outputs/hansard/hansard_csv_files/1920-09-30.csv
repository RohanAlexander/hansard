I see it is stated that the speech to which the '.honourable member refers was made at a meeting held under the auspices of the Church Social Campaign. Most remarkable statements are made from time to time by different people, and if I took notice of one of them. I should have to take notice of all. I fear that I am not the man to carry on such a business. I am not my brother's keeper. This is a free country, where every one apparently is inclined to say just what he thinks. I haye noticed statements made by different people-includin g Mr Garden, for example-wit h which I do not agree. I agree with Major-General Rosenthal that we must have a larger population. As to the statement made by him concerning Mr Fisher, I can only say that I have had the honour of Mr Fisher's intimate acquaintance and friendship for many years, and am sure that he takes the very keenest interest in Australia. I certainly do not propose to stop people, merely because I do not agree with their views, from saying anything that occurs to them. If any statement calculated to create disorder is made, ho wever, I must take notice of it. I read in the newspapers that, the other evening, during my absence from the House, the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) made a statement in regard to subsidizing dances, or something of the sort. I have also read what Mrs. Stein, the Acting Lady Mayoress of Melbourne, has said about dances, andputting two and two together I am bound to Bay that the remark made ber for Grampians did not reflect upon a public official.

10,Mr Watkins,"In reply to a quesgranted to coal miners. According to today's newspapers a Commission, consisting of Messrs. C. Hibble, H . Ling, and A. Jobson, has been appointed, and held a preliminary meeting in Sydney yesterday. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he misunderstood the question put to him, and whether the Commission to which I have referred has been appointed for the purpose? son, and Ling are the members of the Commission. . Their functions are to determine what increase, if any, in the price of coal is justified by the increased wages paid to the miners. I do not know whether they have held a meeting, but their appointment has been approved, and they constitute bhe Commission which will settle the matter if official sanction be given -If this increase be premature, the honourable member may accept the assurance that it is premature only in so far that it anticipates the fact by, say, a few hours. The functions of the Commission are quite limited; they have to determine how much the increased wages justify an increase in the price of '-coal. .1 have no doubt that by the next miners' pay-day we shall be able to declare, at any rate, an interim price of coal. While on my feet, I might say that, in anticipation of the Commission's . decision, I have taken it on myself to accept Mr Hibble's recommendation that the prices for oversea coal shall be those he considered fair until the Commission has otherwise determined. course, the coal has to be sold on the ship, and when the ship takes it away the transaction is completed, and cannot he undone. whole ground. Commission be final as to the price the people of Australia will pay for coal, or will this House have an opportunity to review it? an opportunity to review any decision, but the gentlemen engaged in this work are expert accountants, and their function is very simple. It is to determine how much the existing price of coal shall be added to as the result of the increased wages paid to miners. The House cannot, by any review, no matter how prolonged or meticulous, escape the fact that if more wages are paid for hewing coal the product must cost more. But the House can h'ave an opportunity to review the decision, and if the House says coal shall be free, I shall be perfectly satisfied, because I am a consumer. of the Treasurer been called to the fact that a log has 'been declared on behalf of the Bank Clerks' Association of New South Wales?

When I was granted leave to continue experiences two bad seasons, and then one my remarks on Tuesday evening there good one. seemed to bs a tendency on the part of the Government to rush through the the bad year he has to pay the tax on his House this taxation proposal. No more income for the good year. The farmers important matter than taxation can come are being deluged by the averaging probefore the Legislature.

Yet there are members body else. The citizens to-day are rei n this Chamber who give no thought to quired to pay a much larger amount in the question of taxation, and are ignorant Customs and Excise duties than they did of the principles upon which the raising in 1911, when the amount of thc present of revenue from the people is based. The general exemption was fixed. Tn some late honourable member for Hume( Mr. Falkiner) first brought before this House the suggestion that farmers should pay taxation on their average income over a period of three years. If honourable members w ill analyze that proposal they w ill find that there is really nothing in it . I do not think the farmers are anxious to evade their just share of the burden of taxation. I shall show the fallacy of the averaging proposal by an illustration. -Suppose that a farmer had prosperous 1 Commissioner advises that his income in those years was £500 and £400 respectively. In the third year he might he affected by drought, and he would have no taxable income. Under the present system the farmer would pay taxation on au income of £500 in 1917, on an income of £400 in 191S, and nothing at all in 1919. The proposal that has been made on behalf of the farmer is that the income of the three years shall be averaged, and that he should pay on an income of £300 per annum. The total taxable income for the three years is the same under both systems. It must be borne in mind that nobody pays income tax until he has earned an income. In Customs and Excise duty on his raw material before he can get the goods with which to earn an income.

32,Mr West,"H is trouble is that ininstances Customs and Excise duties havs increased from 40 to 50 .per cent. 11 is an old axiom that everybody should be taxed according to his means and ability to pay. If the averaging proposal is adopted, and the farmers do derive any benefit from it, the rest of the community will be required to make good the loss of revenue. In other countries the exemptions are higher than that allowed under the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment' Act. I see no reason why that should be so. The people of Australia claim a higher standard of living than do the people of other parts of the world, and we should exempt from taxation the amount of income necessary to maintain that standard. All taxation is passed on to the working or industrial classes, but none so easily as Customs and Excise duties, which are an indirect impost that everybody must pay. The standard of living is fixed at the absolute minimum upon which a human being can exist. nexion with income taxation was fixed at the low amount of £156 by a Labour Government which I had the honour to support in this House. But the Government did not realize at that time what was about to 'befall the world, although the war clouds were gathering on the horizon. The then Treasurer, in his wisdom, decided upon the lowest basis of exemption considered practicable under the conditions then existing. are very familiar with the cost of living to-day, and with the tremendous increase since prior to the war. which I ask the Treasurer to accept is based upon the series of exemptions recommended by the British Commission dealing with this subject, and my figures are exactly the same as those adopted in Great Britain. same also as the exemptions existing in Canada and South Africa. almost every civilized country to-day the taxation exemptions have been raised in keeping with the enormous increase in the cost of living. the large majority of thinking people will endorse my request. nate folk who are receiving more than an average income will agree that the industrial section of the community is having a particularly hard time, and that there Mr fVest. should be a considerable increase in income tax exemption in order that they may be permitted to retain sufficient of their inadequate wages to maintain life in these difficult days. If the Government continue to extract a large sum from eaoh working man in the community the injury will not fall upon the individual and his family alone, but will he felt throughout Australia. The matter of exchange has been referred to. There is only one practical way in which this factor in keeping up costs can be dealt with, and that is 'to drastically cut down the importation of unnecessary commodities. Despite the fact that the people generally are poorer than ever to-day, there is a vast amount of extravagance, particularly, of course, among those who are making huge business profits, and have plenty of money to spend. Why should a man want a velvet collar on his overcoat nowadays? If people were satisfied with good, plain The exemption in conmaterials, and were to "" cut out"" the purchase of luxuries, the time would be much nearer when Australians would find themselves hack again in that happier state which existed before the war. I ask the Treasurer to accept the following scale of exemptions-which , I again remind him, are not my own figures, but are those which were accepted in Great 'Britain, upon the recommendation of the Commission:Honourable members For bachelors, £150 exemption. For married persons without children, £200 exemption. The proposal For married persons with three or more children, £350 exemption. These proposed exemptions are based upon equity, and represent an honest endeavour to make the burden of taxation bearable. [3.10] -There will be widespread disIn fact, in satisfaction at the Government's failure to increase the income tax exemption beyond £156, and also the deduction of £26 for. each child. Personally, I think the I am quite sure that exemption should he as high as £300, but, at any rate, I hope that before the Bill Even those fortupasses the Government will see their way clear to meet the very widely expressed feeling among the community that the existing exemption is altogether too low. In my opinion, the amount should be nearly",23,Smith For Mr Seasons I N The Years 1917 And 1918 And
33,They Are Virtually The Mr Parker Moloney (Hume),"double what it was five years ago, because, since the income tax was first imposed, with an exemption of £156, the cost of living has gone up by leaps and bounds; and since the Government have not done anything in the direction of fulfilling their vague election promises to reduce the cost of living, which so seriously affects the great mass of the people who are living to-day on the bread-and-butter line, the least they can do is to increase the income tax exemption. ""When I was speaking recently on the Public Service Arbitration Bill, I mentioned that about 14,000 public servants in this country were compelled to accept a wage below what is really the basic wage in relation to the present cost of living; and I venture to say that, outside the Public Service, the numberd are still more startling. In fact, it is quite safe to say that at prethe difficulty created by the unanimous sent a bare living allowance is not less than £220 per annum. Yet the income tax exemption is still maintained at what it was five years ago. Some time ago, this House unanimously agreed to a motion submitted by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) that, for income taxation purposes, the incomes of primary producers should be based upon an average of five years' earnings. I could imagine no one cavilling at sueh a proposal, and I am sure nothing has transpired since that motion was agreed to unanimously which would cause any honourable member to change his views upon the matter. But it is surprising to find that in this Bill the Government have made no provision whatever to meet the expressed will of the House in this regard. When the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) was announcing the appointment of the Taxation Commission, and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Byan) interjected, "" That is a sop to prevent further action by the primary producers,"" implying that it was a means the Goveniment had adopted to get out of their difficulty in regard to giving effect to the unanimous wish of the House as expressed on the motion moved by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay), the right honourable gentleman replied, "" The honourable member always suggests something sinister in connection with any proposal by the Government."" He threw cold water on the suggestion of the honourable mem. ber for West Sydney that there was a motive behind the appointment of this Commission, or that it was really a move on the part of the Government to shirk their responsibility in regard to the matter of assessing primary producers' incomes on five years' earnings. The impression he conveyed, to my mind, was that-this question of assessing primary producers' incomes-was not to be intrusted to this Commission, but was to be treated as a separate matter altogether. However, seeing that there is no provision in the Bill to give effect to the wish of the House in this direction, one is led to conclude that the honourable member for West Sydney had ample reason for suggesting that the real object of the Government in appointing the Commission was to avoid decision of the House. member believe that this Bill affords .x suitable opportunity for dealing with that matter? We ought to take the first opportunity afforded us to carry out the unanimous wish of the House. I do not think that the honourable member for Lilley is of the opinion that it is a matter that ought to be thrown uoon the shoulders of the Royal Commission. I could quite understand that matters upon which honourable members were not in agreement, or upon which the House required some light or leading, should be intrusted to the Royal Commission for investigation; but this was something upon which our minds had been already made up, and upon which no difference of opinion existed among us; and this Bill affords us the very best opportunity for carrying it into effect. Since the debate took place here upon the honourable member's motion, I have received numerous letters from primary producers in my electorate and elsewhere, expressing the desire that Parliament should take the earliest opportunity of giving effect to the decision of the House. A farmer in New South Wales-which , owing to two years of most disastrous drought, is in a different position from that of the other States-ha s written to me stating that for the twelve months ending June, 1918, he made a profit of",24,Smith For Mr Seasons I N The Years 1917 And 1918 And

Thus, during, the two drought years, instead of making a profit out of his operations, he suffered an actual loss of £2,500. He points out rightly, but quite unnecessarily, since we are all aware of the position, that if the coming season isa good one, as he expects it to bej no allowance will be made in assessing his income tax in respect of the twelve months ending June, 1921, for the losses suffered by him during the disastrous yearsof drought. no doubt as to that. carrying on operations in a small way tically that of the primary producers all over Australia. plaint applies more particularly to New South Wales, where the farmers have had to contend for two years with a most disastrous drought. Another primary producer in New South Wales writes to meMy position is this: I am assessed on income for 1919-20, £1,113. Tax payable, £54 14s. lid. This year I have to borrow £500, and I even have to borrow what is necessary to pay this tax-the amount of £54 14s. l i d . The system is so inequitable and unjust that we should avail ourselves of the opportunity which now presents itself to remedy it . Sir, JOSEPH COOK -There is an opportunity existing under the law as it stands for that man to obtain relief if he likes to apply for it He can have his case Act. who make such applications are put to a very great deal of inconvenience and trouble, and in the end do not obtain much satisfaction. Our object should be to make the law so clear and straightforward that the people will know exactly where they stand. A debate which took place in this House a few weeks ago revealed the fact that honourable members were .practically unanimously in favour of so amending the Income' Tax Act as to provide that in the case of primary producers assessments should be based, on a, five years' average. We have an opportunity to amend the law in that direction to-day. We should insert such, a provision in this Bill. objection can there be to such a clause? orable member quite a number of reasons. able gentleman bring, down a Bil l to give effect to what is evidently the view of. the House?

It is not the straggling taxpayer of whom the honourable member is thinking. not make a suggestion to the Treasurer without beingtold, that we have some sinister motive.

70,Mr Bruce (Flinders) [3.32],"Thisneed to hesitate, but that we can go ahead now and so recast our income-tax legislation that it will operate justly and equitably. I entirely differ from that view. I would remind honourable members that this is probably the most difficult question that we have to consider, and involves more detailed and technical knowledge than the majority of subjects with which we have to deal. I have a good deal to do with income assessments in both Australia and Great Britain, and in respect of certain types of assessments I rather imagine I can pose as an expert. ""When I go outside my own line, however, I am as helpless as a child in considering how the assessments should be dealt with, and the basis upon which the returns should be made. That being so, .1 most certainly consider that we can only hope to have the whole of our income-tax' legislation placed on a just and equitable basis as the result of careful inquiry by the Taxation Commission. The Commission, having regard to its personnel, has an intimate knowledge of these matters, and can .gain any further knowledge it requires by the examination of witnesses. In this way we shall be able to secure a decision that will result in the burden of taxation that has to be carried being placed equitably on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. We have had several references to the uselessness of Royal Commissions, but I am inclined to think we may have the same experience as in Great Britain. The British Income Tax Commission has issued its report, and any one who has read it must agree that it is truly a mine of information. Its recommendations are based on sane and sound principles, and, a'bove all, they are directed to placing the burden upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. report. cellor of the Exchequer, in introducing the Budget in Great Britain, gave a special meed of praise to the work done by the Chairman and the Commission is a good augury for the results we may hope to obtain from a similar inquiry in Australia. In Great Britain the problem is a very difficult one; but here, strange as it may appear, it is almost more difficult. Here questions have to be considered in view of Great Britain's decision regarding double taxation and similar matters. I defy any one who has not considerable knowledge of these questions to express an opinion as to what is a fair and equitable arrangement to come to. As to double income tax, .we have a certain obligation; and I would like to ask the Treasurer whether the question has been considered, and whether we propose to take our share of the burden, the major portion of which has already been shouldered by Great Britain. Great Britain has undertaken to halve the burden of taxation, provided that elsewhere within the Empire a higher rate is being paid, or a rate which brings the amount paid by the taxpayer up to the maximum amount. But Great Britain will not go further than give relief to bhe extent of half the tax. The Chancellor has stated that Great Britain will do this; and fhe report of the Royal Comniission recommends that the double income taxpayer shall be placed on equitable terms with the maximum payer in any part of the Empire, and that any further burden shall be borne by the Dominion concerned. But he made it clear that whether the Dominions are prepared to take any share of the burden or not, Great Britain is prepared to take her share. going to say the Chancellor had made the whole thing very clear. ject. can be. but T ask the Treasurer whether he has considered this point, and whether anything is going to be done. A simple example may, perhaps, make the matter clear. The rate of income tax in Great Britain is Ga. in the £3 for a company trading in Australia as a British registered company, though the profits are all earned in Australia; and it also pays income tax in Australia. The British authorities gay that if such a company is paying an amount equal to 6s., they will relieve it to the extent of 3s., or one-half of the tax; and in Great Britain it will pay 3s. instead of 6s., provided it pays at least",27,Joseph Cook Tha T Quibble Move In Committee The Insertion Of A

TUDOR -Hear, hear! You do me no injustice in saying that. siderations which make it very doubtful whether this taxation should be obtained from the individual. I have'referred to a hardship suffered by British registered companies; but with that hardship they have some slight privileges,' one of which arises from the fact that we in Australia .do not collect income tax at the source. All companies in Australia pay only on the undivided profit. This means that a British registered company trading in Australia, with, perhaps, the whole of the -shareholders in Great Britain, pays 2s. 6d. income tax on its undivided profit, and on the balance, which possibly goes to people with large incomes, who should pay 3s. 6d. or 4s. 6d., or even higher, instead of 2s. 6d., we receive only Sd. by way of absentee tax. This ease seems to. show that there may be something in the -proposal to collect the taxation at the source; the only trouble is that such collection may be beyond our constitutional powers, the persons concerned being outside our jurisdiction. To-day in Great Britain, where the tax is collected at the source, super tax is collected from the individual. A man with an income of over £2,500 a year pays 6s. in the £1 collected at the source for any shares he holds in a company, and then he has to put in his own return, and, in addition, pay the balance due for super tax. The same thing should operate perfectly well here. Tf the whole basic amount were collected at the source, it would facilitate So far as I have been able to ascertain, the collection to a certain extent, the balance being collected from the individual taxpayer. understood as advocating the collection df the income tax at the source; I am merely putting it that the question is arguknowledge of honourable members tliat .the able. For that reason, it is imperative that the matter should be very 'fully considered, ancl we should have the greatest possible volume of evidence before we plunge into what might prove to be hast;/ and, possibly, ill-conceived legislation. We should realize how complicated the subject is. There is, for instance, the question of the assessment of husbands and wives. Thai was attacked by many people in Great Britain, where a husband and a wife are assessed upon their joint income. If the joint income is £6,000-£4,00 0 for the husband and £2,000 for the wifethey each pay tax at the higher rates applying to £6,000 as if the two incomes were one. It has been argued that the joining of the two incomes is an infringement of the rights of the individual woman citizen by merely making her an appendage to her husband. On the other hand, it has been contended that the process is fair and just, because the basis of income taxation is the ability to pay, and if there is an income of £6,000 in the home enjoyed by two people living together they are well able to pay taxation at the higher rates. I have indicated some of the questions that must be considered very carefully by the Commission. I ask the Treasurer whether he will give attention to the matter of the relief which has -been suggested by the Commission in the case of double income -payments. If that is his intention, I appeal to him to do it within the next few years. My request may sound humorous, but it is not so; it is based on hard facts. The war profits taxation legislation in Great Britain and Austr.alia contemplated an arrangement between the two Governments whereby whichever tax, British or Australian, was the higher should be collected and then apportioned between the two Governments. That was to have been brought into force by an Imperial Order in Council, and by whatever is the corresponding procedure in Australia. nothing of the sort has been done, although the arrangement is three years I do not want to be old. The inevitable result of tlie delay will be a heavy and serious loss iu revenue to Australia. It -is well within the Commonwealth was very late in imposing taxation on war-time profits, nnd that when the -.first collection took place in respect of the excess profits made during the first year of the war Britain 'had",29,Joseph Cook Tha T Quibble Move In Committee The Insertion Of A

86,Mr Bru'ce,"There are several conalready made three collections of the wartime profits tax. I know, for a fact, that the agreement between the two Governments has been drawn up, but, so f a r as I know, it has not yet been proclaimed. Mr Collins, the secretary to the Treasury, is now in London, and I suggest that the Government should instruct h i m to finalize this arrangement. I am"" of opinion that Australia w ill be the loser in the long run by the delay that has taken place, because GreatB r it a in has collected the tax for a number of years, and it will be difficult to readjust the accounts and ascertain how much was collected from companies that trade-in GreatB r it a in and Australia, in order that Australia may get her fairproportion. unfortunate taxpayer might be asked to pay to both Governments in f u l l . I do not think anybody w ill suggest that such an iniquity should take place; and that does not appear to be the intention of the taxation authorities here, because in all cases they have asked companies, when making up their figures for Australia, to state the amount paid in war-time profits taxation in Great Britain. I point out, however, what would happen if such an iniquitous thing were done. B r it a in has collected a tax of SO per cent, raising revenue to defray portion of the on all profits in excess of the pre-war standard. There is only 20 per cent, left for taxation. If Australia, so late in the day, is to come in and collect 75 per cent, of the 20 per cent., it will mean that the taxpayer w ill pay in taxation 95 per cent, of his excess profits to one Government or the other. But whilst the Treasurer might, with utter disregard to the unfortunate taxpayers, be prepared to commit that iniquity, I think he w ill not do it when he realizes that he must lose his f a i r share of the taxation collected by Great Britain, which has been taking SO per cent, of excess profits for years, aud there remains only 20 per cent, on which Australia can possibly levy its tax of 75 per cent. The only reason why I speak on this measure at all is to emphasize the extreme complexity of the taxation problem. much experience as have had most honourable members on questions relating to income tax, but I am not prepared to make a serious attempt to put income taxation on a proper and equitable basis until I have had the opportunity of considering the evidence to be obtained, and the report to be made by the Royal Commission. Meanwhile, revenue must be obtained, and as we are not in a position to deal with the whole question of taxation as it should be dealt with , I am prepared to support the. B ill as merely a stopgap arrangement. Thousands of people throughout Australia will be disappointed by the failure of the Government to increase the amount of the general exemption. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has argued that in view of the fact that a Royal Commission has been appointed to The inquire into taxation matters, this B ill should be supported as a stopgap measure. He pointed out that there are many complex questions involved which make it necessary that a thorough in quiry should be made into the whole subject. Whilst that is true, there are certain facts whioh stand out so clearly that no Commission is required to report upon them. I refer particularly to the amount of income on which the Government can commence to impose taxation. I remember that when Parliament passed Great the measure in 1914 for the purpose of cost of the war, the basis of exemption was the income necessary for a person to live and maintain a family in reasonable comfort. ' Parliament fixed the amount at £ 1 5 6 , although even then T thought it was too small But whatever justification may have existed for fixing the amount of exemption at £15 6 in 1914, has disappeared. The cost of living has increased considerably; including clothing, food, and other necessaries, it has probably doubled. That being so, and if Parliament accepts the principle of not taxing the minimum living income, we should at least double the exemption. An incomeof £300 is little enough on which to maintain a home under present conditions. Unfortunately, during the. war, when the cost of living was increasing, the Act was amended in order to further tax the poorer people. Parliament provided that the exemption of a single man should be only £ 1 0 0 , and that I think I have probably had as for every £ 4 earned by him in excess of the £ 1 0 0 , £ 1 should be deducted from his exemption. Thus a man with an income of £140 would be entitled to an",30,Joseph Cook Tha T Quibble Move In Committee The Insertion Of A
87,Mr Charlton (Hunter ) [8.56],"exemption of only £90. In the case of the married man Parliament provided that for every £3 in excess of £156, £ 1 should be deducted from the exemption. Thus, a married man who earned £200 would have his exemption reduced by £14. hand of the increase in the living wage, due to the fact that the purchasing power of a sovereign to-day is no greater than that of half a sovereign when the income tax was first imposed. In view of these facts can we shelter ourselves behind a Commission, and take no action pending the receipt of a report from that body? It is absolutely necessary that the Act should be amended immediately in order to increase the exemption. every industrial organization throughout Australia has, by resolution, instructed its representatives in Parliament to take steps to have the exemption increased, but, in spite of that fact, the Government are doing nothing. Reference has been made to the Royal Commission whioh inquired iuto taxation matters in Great Britain, and the Treasurer remarked by interjection that the voluminous report of the Commission contained a vast amount of valuable information. Exemptions in the Old Country are generally below those in Australia, but the Imperial Commission recommended that the exemption for a bachelor should be £150, or £50 more"" than we allow in Australia; for a married couple with no children £250; and for a married couple with three children £350. ago the Treasurer was commending the Imperial Commission's report; hut when I quote one of its recommendations, he ridicules it. orable member that the British workman pays 30s. per head more in Customs taxation than does the Australian workman. trying to raise a side issue.

Nothing the Treasurer has said controverts them. ting against them another set of facts. Commission reportedThe reasons which have been given to ns Ior raising the exemption limit are(a) That the cost of living has greatly increased since thc present limit was fixed; The same argument applies to Australia, where the cost of living has doubled since the exemption limit was fixed(6) that there should be no taxation on an income so small that it is only sufficient to satisfy ordinary human needs; That is the argument I have just adduced 1 (c) that existing indirect taxation lays upon the person with a small income the full share of the State burden which he ought to be called upon to bear. is the point I have just been citing. to the House that the very thing which that Commission condemns is being practised in Australia, and for that the Treasurer is responsible through his Budget proposals.

We borrowed a huge sum of money to pay our soldiers for their services. Our men have returned, and the majority of them to-day are earning salaries ranging around £200 per annum; many of them, too, are supporting families. We say to those men, "" You went away to fight for us, and we were compelled to borrow money to pay you for your services I have a complaint to make which Now that you are back home we are going to ask you to pay us something out of your wages so that we may repay what we borrowed on your behalf."" That is not fair . thing. Most of the Labour organizations throughout the country have carried resolutions urging that the exemption in connection with income taxation should be raised to an amount varying between £25 0 and £300. It h in k , ' personallyI have realized all along, of and am only consistent in expressing the view-that the exemption should not be less than £300. I have never, even prior to the war, favoured the exemption being fixed below £200. And , remembering the high cost of living to-day, I would still be no more than consistent if I were to advocate that the exemption should be nearer £400. We cannot lose sight of the fact that, generally speaking, there But I are very many people in the community who made huge fortunes during the war, and who now 'have larger incomes than The Treasurer they dreamed of prior to 1914. There is no reason why they should not be made to pay taxes on suoh a basis as will very materially assist the Government to discharge their liabilities arising from the war. As for the formula, its alteration may be a matter for consideration by the ComThe necesmission; but I strongly .urge that it should be simplified. There are very few people who understand the formula. W h y should not the Government simplif y it? Y o u agreed to take Why should they not say that, in connection with incomes between £300 and £500, taxpayers should be required to furnish a fixed sum in the £ 1 ; and similarly upon incomes above £500, and so on? Thus, everybody would know just how much he was required to pay. I have no complaint to make of the actual assessments issued by the Department. The officers do good work, and I have Stick not known them to be at f a u l t ; but because people do not understand the system, they believe that mistakes are made. Even explanations are very difficult to furnish which are convincing in the eyes of aggrieved parties. In New South Wales we have no such formula as in the case of the Commonwealth Department. The State authorities require a fixed amount in every £ 1 , and taxpayers know, or are in a position to know, just how much they should pay. chiefly concerns tenant farmers.

Is that not plain enough ? the instructions despatched from the Taxation land, telling him that it is not necessary that he should include in his return the item of 5 per cent, as the equivalent of the capital value of his residence; that is, if he is holding his land on leasehold. But, if it is necessary for him to do so, then it is tantamount to double taxation. If I own a certain property, and lease it to some one else at a rental of £100 per annum, that amount, being part of my income, must be shown as such in my return; but if my tenant is also to 'De charged a capital value percentage, the practice amounts to double taxation. for the leasehold; he the house. instructions sent out ment, and there is no them. the Commissioner tells a tenant' that he is not required to show 5 per cent, of the capital value of His residence, if the tenant does show the amount, he is a. fool. that the Taxation Department makes these leaseholders show the amount. concerned have not done so in their reI am not too certurns for previous years they are called upon to furnish reasons why, and are compelled to pay up.

Would any one say that a man who was paying rent for premises, in the case of his leasing a farm, was not occupying those premises for the purpose of proHere are ducing income? Such a person would be living in the house because.he was comOffice to the man on the pelled to do so, it being part of the bargain into which he had entered when taking over the leasehold. Yet the authorities say that they will make this man pay income tax in respect of a house upon .which some one else is already paying taxation. SinceI held the view that the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney was wrong, I personally submitted the matter to the Federal Commissioner in Melbourne, and received the following r e p l y With reference to your letter and attached correspondence, the assessment as made is correct. The action taken is really not to include tbe £20 as income, but to disallow as a deduction But a tenant pays that portion of the annual rent which was paid does not pay for for the residence.

112,Mr Charlton,"My complaint isThe Act forbids deduction of rent paid for a private residence, but it permits a deduction of so much of the rent as is attributable to any part of a residence which is set apart and used for income 'producing business purposes. There is no double taxation in -this case any more tlian there is double taxation in the case of .money which the taxpayer pays to his tailor for clothes. The'tailor pays'tax on the money so paid, but the 'person paying it is not allowed to deduct the expenditure in his income tax assessment. In thc present case the taxpayer is merely debarred from deducting the rent from his income, however derived, whether from wages, dividends, .business, or 'farming proiits, or other sources. There is uo relation .between my paying a bill 'to a tailor and this matter which I have taken up on behalf of a tenant farmer. If I pay my tailor hie bill .he must show the amount received as part of his general income when furnishing his annual r e t u r n ; and upon 'that ret u r n 'he is taxed.

As a matter of fact, Australians are now becoming accustomed to finance themselves, not only in a public, but also in a private sense. It is better for all concerned. A t any rate, it means that we are not paying so much interest to investors in other parts of the world, I hope that the Treasurer's brightest anticipations with regard to the labours of the Taxation Commission will be realized, and that it will submit to this House some .scientific scheme for the application of taxation which will overcome the possibility of the rich man passing it on to the poor man. privately that he will take steps to have a leaflet issued from the Taxation Department that will explain by a number of examples -how the income tax is imposed, thus enabling any taxpayer to compute ihe tax that may be levied upon a certain income. The system now employed would puzzle the wise6t and cleverest mathematicians in our community. I trust that in this B ill or in another measure the exemption will be increased. I hope that the Commission will bring down a report speedily, and that this Parliament may soon get to work to devise a more equitable system of taxation. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [4.31]. I have no intention of dealing with general financial questions on this B ill . The Treasurer will need every penny he proposes to raise by this tax to meet the expenditure which he has proposed, and I regret that I was not here to t r y to pre'vent a certain tax being taken off which provided a fair amount of revenue. I wish I could look with the f a it h that some honourable members have on the appointment of the Taxation Commission. There are not many phases of income taxation which have not already been tried in Australia. The method of collecting the tax at the source has been tried under the Companies Act ; the sysI t is handy to tem of collecting from the individual is to be found in our own Act , and there is hardly any Statei n which one or other If the honorahle of the methods referred to by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has not been tried. I . candidly confess, therefore, that I am not looking forward with very much hope to the result of the labours of this Commission because the t ground they will cover has already been covered in one State or another. However, there are some matters which this Parliament ought to face immediately. There are some features of our income tax which are manifestly unfair, and should not be allowed to continue a day longer. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has given notice of his intention to test the feeling of the Housei n regard to one of them. not t r y to test it on this B ill . It would be unusual to do so. This is not an Assessment B ill . The Treasurer has promised me MrM c WILLIAMS T h is B ill incorporates the Income Tax Assessment Act , and it is proposed to ask for a ruling fro m the Chair as to whether the matter cannot be tested upon it . I venture to express the opinion that it may be. As to the fairness of the honourable member's proposal there can be no question. During the last two years many primary producers throughout Australia who have been absolutely ruined by the drought, have yet been called upon to pay income tax on stock which has died in several States. There are two features of the In come Tax Act which, so far. as the landowner is concerned, are so pronouncedly unjust that I hope we shall be able to deal with them, if not in connection with this B ill , at least during the present session. We ought to provide that primary producers shall be assessed in respect of their average income over a period of years, and we should eliminate entirely the provision whicli calls upon pastoralists to pay income tax upon the value of the natural increases in their stock. These natural increases do not represent income u n t i l they have been realized. When they have been sold and the owner has received payment for them, then that payment represents income on which he should be taxed. Under the law as it stands, stock-owners are compelled to include in their return and pay income upon the value of the",36,Joseph Cook M Y Officers Are With No Means Of Passing On The Tax

162,Sir Joseph Cook,"I have someWe always think a system is wrong if it happens to hurt us. We have to keep those facts in mind when discussing taxation. I do not propose to deal at any length with the points raised during the debate. I should, however, like to refer to the question of averaging this tax. May I suggest to my corner friends that, although they have made up their minds definitely, they have entered on a path which is thorny and f u l l of trouble; the question is not half so simple as they appear to imagine. If they go on, they will plunge themselves into a sea of difficulties, from which people everywhere else are seeking to escape. we shall not blame the Treasurer. . Sir JOSEPH COOK told the honourable member -that I must try to save him fro m himself. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) calls out "" No, no""; but I point out to him that the inquiry in the Old Country was a very complete one. I see that the honourable member has a copy of the Royal Commission's report, and I invite him to read paragraph 479, as follows :It is clear to us that public opinion has moved since that report was written, and possibly in consequence of that report. There has been a surprising weight of evidence in favour of the profits of the preceding year (i.e., either the year to the 5th April immediately preceding the year of assessment, or the last business year completed prior to that date) being taken as the basis for ScheduleD ceding years' profits as the basis of liability assessment.

Sir JOSEPH COOK say that if there had been drought in mending that the change be made. England for five or ten years, the report would not have been very different. So far as I can see, there is a better and fairer method for the man on the land than that of averaging. The honourable member for Grampians appears to have made up his mind on the point. tralia have. Sir JOSEPH COOK I suggest that that does not quite settle the matter. Men sometimes make up their minds in the wrong direction; it may well be that the people who helped to shape the farmer's mind on the question have shaped it on a course which I suggest is not the best. Let there be no mistake as to my positionI agree with my friends in the corner in the objects which they seek. I agree that the present system is unfair, I have already and that some amelioration must be found; it is only a question of which is the better method-whethe r the averaging system proposed by the honourable member for Grampians Mr Mo WILLIAMS The honourable member has given a lot of consideration to it . Sir JOSEPH COOK I know; but still there is room for difference of opinion. We all desire to reach the same goal, and by the fairest method we can contrive.

'Notwithstanding that, however, this B ill must be kept entirely separate from the principal Act, according to the terms of the Constitution. . The honourable member's amendment, therefore, is not in order. I merely desire to intimate that the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) has just been called away on business, and that he asked me to move an amendment in terms similar to that which has just been moved. The honourable member for Hume, however, had intended to propose its insertion in clause 4. Seeing that the amendment of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has been ruled out of order, I take it for granted that the same decision will apply to that which I was about to move. I make this explanation in justice to the honourable member for Hume. Clause agreed to.

The clauses may as well be agreed to in to to. members have intimated their desire to move amendments. The raising of the exemption has been advocated on all sides. I take it that there can be no objection to the insertion of a provision to the eifect that the exemption shall be raised. Figures supplied by the Treasurer, in the course of his Budget speech, showed that the amount collected from people with small incomes is comparatively small. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) remarked, some months ago, that a tremendous amount of money was spent by the public in the preparation of returns. It is not long since the Deputy Federal (Hon. J. M . Commissioner of Taxationi n this State resigned in order to open an office in this city as an expert taxation adviser. He obviously considered it would pay him better to launch out in private pracThat is not so.. It is true tice rather than remain in the Department to draw the comparatively high salary of Deputy Commissioner. In the Budget papers presented by the Treasurer, it was pointed out that of the sum of £10,800,000 collected last year about £9,000,000 was received from persons in possession of incomes of more than £1,000 per annum. It was shown that 44 per cent, of the grand total was paid, by people having incomes ranging from £1,000 to £10,000 per annum; 34.4 per cent, was received from those whose incomes ranged between £10,000 and £100,000; and 4.3 per cent, was received from persons or companies having incomes of more than £100,000 per annum. From these people and companies the Treasurer could secure his requirements by increasing the rate of taxation; and he could, at the same time, raise the exemption.

Can any honourable member contend that 10s. a week, representing the deduction of £ 2 6 per annum for each child, is sufficient to maintain a child at the present time ? The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has told me that he is in favour of increasing the deduction for each child wholly dependent on the taxpayer. there is no opportunity of doing it on this B ill , but the Treasurer has promised, if possible, to bring down an Income Tax Assessment B ill in which the amendment can be made. to attempt to amend this B ill for that purpose, but an effort will certainly be made to do so. We ought also to take into consideration the case of widowers, whose exemption is only £100. Many widowers have been penalized for not having furnished returns for several years past. noticed the fact that in their case the exemption is so limited. However, when we find from the figures furnished by the wealth census card that IS per cent, of the people who filled in returns enjoy more than half the income of Aiistralia, that 82 per cent, get less 'than 50 per cent, of the income of Australia, that only 13£ per cent, of the population own freehold estates, that 8 per cent, own 7 per cent, -of the value of the land of the Commonwealth, and that 2 per cent, own 75 per -cent, of it , we cannot remain silent simply because this .Bill may net present the the opportunity for us to move an amendment to increase the exemption. The Treasurer says that he has invited, representatives of the workers to take part in the Taxation Commission, I advise the The figures applying to workers to be represented on that Commission by one or more persons-, who may be able to put forward their views as to the amount of the exemption and as to the unequal distribution of wealth which justifies the demand that the persons with large incomes should be hi t harder. I do not agree w it h the principle that income should be taxed at its source. I do not These are the perknow any of the shareholders of the Metropolitan Gas Company of MelHow can any man keep a bourne, and I merely cite the case of this company because I know that it is a big concern, whioh, presumably, has among its shareholders men who are at present paying income tax at the rate of Ss. 1-^d. in the £1. they w ill be paving Ss. 6d. in t h e . £ l .

I contend that each taxpayer should pay income tax according to his own personal schedule. The honocable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton) has intimated that he intends to move an amendment to increase the exemption, and I shall vote for it, because I believe that we can attach to this B ill a Unfortunately, they have not proviso that the exemption shall not be less than any amount whicli the Committee decides upon.

We are all anxious to afford relief to a large body of the community, not only from the payment of the tax, but also from the necessity to furnish returns, when they are earning under, say, £250 a year. Even with such an exemption, the position of these people would not be as good as it was in 1915, when we decided that an exemption of £156 should be allowed.

I submit this amendment believing that it must be apparent to every honourable member that the time has arrived wnen the exemption should be raised. present exemptions of £156 in the case of married men and of £100 in the case of single men are altogether too small, having regard to the fact that since 1914, when they were determined upon by the Parliament, the cost of living has practically doubled. ""We fixed these exemptions in 1914, believing that they would afford a fair living margin, and since the cost of living is double what it was at that time, we ought really to double the exemption. This matter has been dealt with in Great Britain, where Commissioners have reported that a 'bachelor should be allowed an exemption of £200; a married man, without children, £250; and a man with a wife and three children, £300. If those exemptions are considered reasonable in Great Britain, should we have a lower exemption here? Apart.from the finding of the British Commissioners, it must he obvious that the time has arrived when the exemptions should be raised. A single man cannot keep himself decently on £100 a year. I know young fellows who, in connection with the railway service, have had to leave their parents' homes, and some of whom have to pay 27s. 6d. for their board, in addition to paying for their washing. In other cases they pay 35s. per week for board alone. Then, again, a man has to pay about £11 for a tailored suit for which he paid only £ 5 prior to the war. Taking all these facts into consideration, it must be recognised that we shall do a serious injustice to the great working population of Australia if we do not raise the exemption. On the motion for the second reading of the BillI gave reasons why the exemption should be inmittee by enlarging upon the subject. I hope the Treasurer will agree to this amendment. The Government cannot shelter themselves behind the plea that the Taxation Commission is going into the whole question, since that Commission cannot possibly report in time to enable effect to be given to its recommendations in respect of income taxation for the current financial year. of having a Taxation Commission if we are to ignore it? The anything of the kind. The returns in respect of income from personal exertion had to be furnished at the end of July last. The departmental officers will base their assessments on 'those returns, and will have to observe the provisions of this measure. We cannot hope to obtain from the Commission a report in time to enable the passing of the legislative machinery necessary to give effect to its recommendations, in respect of the current financial year. That being so, the Committee should amend the Bill in the direction proposed by me.

289,Mr Mahony,"I am always pleasedto pay income tax is as unjust as would have been a demand in 1914 that a sing e man earning £ 5 0 per annum and a married man earning £ 1 0 0 should pay taxation. Had such a proposal been made when the original Bill was before the House it would have been justly resented. Sitting suspended, from 6.30 to 8 p.m. prolong the discussion, but it must be apparent to every honourable member that there is a great deal of hardship throughout Australia on account of the low margin of the exemptions. Single men, and women too, who are in receipt of salaries of £100 per annum must find it almost impossible to live. It should be remembered, alsa, that even of that slender wage, a cons derable sum is disbursed in : ind rect taxation. And it is iniquitous that married men in receipt of £15 6 per annum have to part with portion of that inadequate ainouut by way of income taxation. A man who is trying to suppert himself and his wife and children on £156 must find himself degrees below the bread line. A judicial in quiry in New South ""Wales recently determined that £ 3 12s. 6d. shou.d be regarded as the basic wage. It was agreed that that was the lowest sum on which a man could maintain himself and family. Yet the Government are taxing family men whose incomes are actually less than the basic wage. any intention of relieving the position ? I ask the Treasurer to introduce an amending B ill in that direction. pa d in income tax one pays £ 1 through : the Customs. say. When the present exemptions were fixed, in the early stages of the war, the value of money was far different from to-day. these, the amounts of the exemptions should now be doubled. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the Royal Commission will inquire into this and all other l'ke matters, and that, upon its recommendations, the Government will probably act. We are dealing with taxation proposals for the current financial year, and the Commission may not present its report for six months or twelve months. Meanwhile, hard pressed people are be ng compelled to pay income tax : when they are in receipt, in some cases, of less than a living wage. I suggest that the Treasurer give instructions to his officials that the tax be not collected this year from those who are placed as i have just described, pending the receipt of the report of the Royal Commission. Such action would grant a welcome measure of relief. The Treasurer has already stated that it I have no desire to is h..s intention to refer the whole system of taxation to the Royal Commissioq. I suggest that he call particular attention to the taxation of those who are in receipt of ouly £100 per annum. Incidentally, 1 doubt if it is worthwhile, collecting individual amounts of £ 1 from these persons. True, £ 1 may appear to some to be ouly a smail item, but it looms very large in the eyes of single men and women who are trying to live, in these times, on £ 1 0 0 a year. It is, relatively, a heavier tax upon them than is a tax of £ 5 or £6 upon a person in receipt of., double the amount of income. I do not want to vote against the clause, but I 1 would have supported an amendment to exempt people whose income is £ 1 0 0 . It is unfortunate that the proper opportu-. nity for proposing such an amendment, was not seized.

The fact is that philanthropic gifts, spread, over small sums,' rather than provided in totals of £ 2 0 or more, often do the greater good.

The plain fact is that I must raise money, and that any money which I may knock off in one direction must be provided for in another. That would involve revision of the whole of the rates of taxation. As I have said more than once to-day, the entire system of taxation is to be revised.

308,Mr Jowett,"T h a t matter has beenber speaking for his party? and those whom I represent. The vast majority of my constituents are engaged in primary pursuits.' I do uot propose, however, that the relief which will flow from this averaging system shall be confined to the primary producers. My intention is that all income tax payers shall reap the benefit of it. Another point whicli I wish to make clear is that all we ask is that a man whose income, from the very nature of the occupation followed by him, is precarious, should not be callerl upon to pay a heavier tax than a man or woman whose income, is fixed. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a man follows a certain occupation from which in respect of a period of five years his net income is £5,000. That represents an average of £1,000 per annum. In justice to all, we ask that a man whose income, while precarious, is on the average £1,0.00 pay no more by way tax than a man whose income £250 per quarter and i.= paid regularly, as in many cases it is, into his banking account. In five years each receives the same amount, fl""'! --hpshould he regarded as equal before the law. It has been well said by Saint Augustine, and ought never to be forgotten by us, that "" The State that is without justice is only a robber band."" That reproach might be directed -to some of those who resist thc meting out of even-handed justice to every income tax payer or citizen. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) has told us very emphatically that the Taxation Commission is going to inquire into the whole question of taxation, and w ill bring in a report which w ill enable him to adjust the income tax on more satisfactory lines. I take it that the Commission cannot bring in a report in time to enable its recommendations to be applied to assessments in respect of income earned during the present year. Under this cliiu°e. however, we are making provision f o the levying of in com P. f x i v l r respct of income earned, not only during the financi""! year beginning on the 1st Julv, 1920, but during the financial year beginning on 1st July, 1921. mission's report can be brought in in I speak for myself time. we be tied up in this way in view of the fact that the Commission may be able, according to the Treasurer, to bring in recommendations in time to allow of their application to assessments in respect of the present year? We want to know exactly where we are. In order to assist the Treasurer to pass this measure we have given way to him to a considerable crrtcnt, because of his promise that he w ill do his very best to give effect to the wishes expressed by the Committee; but I point out that, under this clause, we are legislating in respect of incomes earned during the financial year 1920, and also the year 1921. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) hopes to secure the support of some of our party for his amendment. I am sorry to say that he has not made out a per annum, should case that I can follow. His amendment of income is altogether different from that moved is earlier in the proceedings, and which I would have, supported. it in . ginal amendment it was proposed that the income tax of primary producers should be based upon an average return covering a period of five year?. ThatI should have supported, because, in common w i th others, I know what the primary producers have suifered from drought, especially in my own State. I wish to ffive them a fair deal, and to that end it would be a proper thing to permit them to average their income; but, with a general provision to permit anybody and everybody to average their incomes over two vears, the Treasurer would be confronted with a considerable difficulty, because he would never know where he stood in regard to the revenue. If we provide that all taxpayers may average their incomes the tax wo^ld have to be made 10 per cent, instead of 5 per cent. not meet the case Mir.
