They will be warmly welcome in this country. My Government will continue to support the principles of tbe United Nations and seek in that way the establishment of enduring peace amongst all nations. But in a world still torn by tension and by conflict we must also look to our own defences. A comprehensive statement on Australia's defence policy will be made to the Parliament in the early days of this Session by the Minister for Defence. This statement will outline the attention being given to the long range strategic policies which will best serve Australia's security. And it will indicate the priorities to be given to the development of selfsufficient and versatile forces to support those policies. New proposals will be made for the supports the continuing efforts which are Defence infrastructure, and for new equipbeing made to achieve a just and lasting ment in the years ahead. Meanwhile the acquisition of the fighting equipment, which was announced in the ment, at the invitation of the Governments last Budget, is proceeding.

The strength of our industrial base is of Sabre aircraft to Malaysia, is a real convital importance to our defence.

Territory and it will not do so. Australia will therefore continue, in cooperation with the United States of America and other countries, to assist the Republic of Vietnam in its struggle to repel aggression and allow its citizens to live under a Government of their own choice. My Government will continue io give military and economic assistance to tbe Republic of Vietnam and will continue its Civic Action Programme. My Goveniment is glad to note that the ' increasing capacity of the South Vietnamese to defend themselves has already permitted the withdrawal of some Allied Forces. Should the future situation permit a further substantial withdrawal of troops-beyon d those announced by President Nixon on 16 December 1969-the n in consultation with tbe Government of the Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the United States, some Australian troops will be included, at some stage, in tbe number's scheduled for such withdrawal. My Government deplores the continuing threat posed by North Vietnam and strongly peace through negotiation. Turning to our near North my GovernMy Government believes that our defence aid, which includes approved programmes amounting to $45m, and the gift of ten My Government will take steps to adMy Government does not believe that an arbitrary date for independence of Papua But my Government does believe in constant government. Consideration of major changes in constitutional arrangements for self-government should await presentation to the Territory House of Assembly of the Report of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development, which is at present inquiring into this matter. My Government will, however, take early steps to introduce new arrangements within the scope of the present Papua and New Guinea Act. This will result in Ministerial Members accepting full day-today responsibility for their Departments instead of sharing that responsibility as at present with a Departmental Head. The Ministerial Member will be responsible to the Administrator's Execuvernment believes that economic growth in tive Council. The scope of the responsibilities of the Administrator's Executive Council will be enlarged and additional. powers will be transferred to that Council, and to Ministerial Members who form a majority of that Council. The procedures by which the Territory Budget is framed will be changed so that elected Members will have a greater voice in the actual drafting of the Budget. The Territory of Papua and New Guinea is developing economically and will in the future develop faster. But the level of local savings in Papua and New Guinea is low and finance for major development projects comes predominantly from outside the Territory. Because of this the Administration has in the past acquired-for future disposal to the people of the Territory-substantia l equity holdings in certain enterprises, notably the Bougainville Copper Project and the New Britain Oil Palm Project. My Government now proposes to ask the Territory House of Assembly for legislation to establish a statutory corporation to acquire equity in major investment projects in tbe Territory. This new institution would have a close link with the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank and its principal functions would be to take up shares in appropriate enterprises and hold them for future disposal to the people of the Territory, to underwrite local share issues, and to advancement towards selfestablish unit trusts or investment companies. My Government will, this month, introduce a new scheme for practical, down to earth training of Papuans and New Guineans in Australia, in areas of training not available in the Territory. In doing this my Government will seek the co-operation of private organisations, private enterprise, and State Governments so that the scheme may be a human and economic success and, through the training provided, help Papuans and New Guineans' to accept greater responsibilities in both private and government activity in their own country. Turning now to internal matters my GoAustralia has continued strongly. Thus in the year to the September quarter 1969 gross national product increased by 11.7% and the indications are that this strong growth rate is continuing. Full employment has been maintained and considerable expansion has taken place. Commerce and industry-apar t from some rural industries-is prosperous. Pressures on costs and prices, though strong and persistent and requiring close attention, have for the most part been kept reasonably under control. The Australian economy, moreover, has demonstrated a new resilience which has enabled it to weather problems created by droughts, and by international financial stresses. My Government will follow policies aimed at broadening the economy and further developing the Australian nation. These policies will require, among other things, an increase in labour and in skills. To this end overseas training techniques are being studied and, in co-operation with the organisations of employees and employers my Government will formulate procedures to retrain employees displaced by technological change. A training scheme for married and single women who, for domestic reasons have not previously been employed, will be set up. Special studies will be made into the problems and tbe rehabilitation of persons who, for a variety of reasons, have tended to be classed as unemployable. Discussions are taking place between the National Employers' Organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government in an endeavour to develop more effective means of avoiding and settling industrial disputes within the framework of the Conciliation and Arbitration system. My Government has instituted an enquiry into Australia's future needs in postgraduate education in management and will legislate to provide the funds necessary to ensure that there are adequate facilities in Australia for post-graduate education in business management of the highest quality. Financially, last year was marked by Spirits Act 1906-1969 in that statute or in internationalfinancialcrises but it was also the Customs legislation. a year of achievement in international financial co-operation which my Government believes will provide a greatly improved other aspects of the taxation system which financial foundation for world trade in the affect particularly the lower and middle period ahead. In keeping with Australia's contribution enable fulfilment of my Government's aim in this field my Government will introduce to put before Parliament specific provisions legislation to increase Australia's quota in for relief in the next Budget. the International Monetary Fund, and my Government will also proceed with the conveniently into the international mould, negotiation of new double taxation agreemy Government will present legislation to ments and tbe revision of existing establish a Metric Conversion Board, so that agreements.

It will also legislate to amalgamate the Excise Act 1901-1968, the Distillation Act 1901-1968, and tbe Coal Excise Act 1949-1968 into a single statute and to incorporate certain provisions of the The progressive income tax scale and income earners are being closely studied to To enable Australian trade to fit more a programme for conversion to a metric My Government reaffirms its belief that industries has been the basis for the sound and vigorous development of secondary However there is a need to re-examine After the close of thisfinancialyear new financial arrangements will need to be made The bases for such an agreement were These bases of discussion will be the proimmediately following sitting days to enable posals of the Commonwealth to assume the Commonwealth to meet its guarantee progressively responsibility for a share of by making a loan of up to $300m to the existing State Debt, to reduce the future Wheat Board. growth of State Debt by providing each year to the States, as a non-repayable grant, some money which would now be provided lation, in support of legislation by State as a loan, to review the present base for Governments, in order to make fully effecrevenue grants, and to review the present tive the wheat delivery quota plan of the betterment factor by which revenue grants Australian Wheat Growers' Federation; and grow annually.

My Government will over the next 5 years provide SlOOm for new proposals under the National Water Resources Development Programme. The new programme will cover proposals for flood prevention and flood mitigation works, and for small dams supplying particular districts and groups of farmers. My Government has already allocated $ 12.8m of this $100m towards the cost of an irrigation project in the Bundaberg Region of Queensland. Legislation will also be introduced to prorailway from Port Augusta to Whyalla and vide funds to help finance the construction of a new power house in Central Queensland at Gladstone.

It will be a concrete example of decentralisation and it will add to the export earnings of the nation. To assist in reducing our dependence on imports of forest products my Government will continue to give substantial support to the development of Australia's forests and forestry. Long term loans estimated at $4.8m will be provided to the States for this purpose under the Softwood Forestry Agreements Act 1967. In order to provide amenities to those engaged in work in remote areas my Government will continue its policy to extend television coverage and low powered national relay stations will be established in tralian partnership in development is a further thirty-eight remote areas of the Commonwealth. During the life of the Parliament the Australian Atomic Energy Commission will begin construction of a nuclear power station in Commonwealth Territory at Jervis Bay. My Government recognises that much of the Northern Territory is heavily dependent on sea transport and that the establishment the region's further economic growth. My Government therefore proposes to undertake major new works at the Port of Darwin, including the construction of a new container and general cargo berth in the existing port area, a bulk port facility at East Arm and a new small craft facility at Frances Bay. My Government proposes to set up a Bureau of Transport Economics to analyse the economics of transport in Australia. Further, because it is clear that the costs of sea transport will greatly depend on the ability to use new and larger ships my Government proposes that a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers meet shortly to examine and co-ordinate plans for port development. My Government will continue with the standardisation of railway lines in Australia. Early legislation will be introduced to enable the construction bf a standard gauge as soon as an agreement is reached between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments, Parliament will be asked to approve the construction of the line linking Port Pirie to Adelaide. My Government will continue to provide the climate and conditions which will encourage the maximum development of all sectors of Australian industry by private enterprise. It believes that the development of industry on the scale and with the efficiency to compete in world markets is the cornerstone of national growth. For this aim to be achieved a strong and continuing inflow of development capital from overseas is imperative. My Government has made it clear that it prefers those who supply overseas capital for these purposes to provide the opportunity for partnership to Australian capital. This is now increasingly occurring. Ausgrowing. My Government proposes to take a step designed to help that growth. At present foreign firms are able to raise vast sums overseas at fixed interest for major development and expansion in Australia. Australian companies, lacking the investtrial Research Organisation in Northern ment appeal abroad of large international Australia and a wild life research laboratory companies, have been, in general, unable will be established at Darwin. to tap those sources of funds for themselves, and often accept a smaller stake in development in Australia than they otherwise would. My Government will therefore ask the Parliament to legislate during this Session to establish an Industry Development Corporation. The purpose of this Corporation will be to borrow, predominantly overseas and at fixed interest, from the sources at present tional research and $250,000 will be protapped by foreign enterprises. My Government believes that this Corporation will help bring about greater Australian participation in the ownership of Training Colleges totals $24m and will our developing nation. My Government has examined the presently unresolved legal question as to which Government is entitled to exercise sovereign control over the resources of the sea bed off the Australian coast to the outer limits of the continental shelf. At present, the various State Governof ments claim sovereign rights in respect of such resources from low water mark to the outer limits of the shelf. The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal legislation to pay pensions at standard rates waters as they existed at Federation, it has to married couples who have lost the sovereignrightsin this area. It is the view of my Government that subsidies to organisations providing meals it would serve Australia's national and on international interests to have the legal position resolved. In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish improve and extend the scheme of comwhat the Commonwealth conceives to be its pensation under the Commonwealth Emlegal rights. This legislation will not affect the existing agreements between the Commonwealth Session to give effect to the scheme for the and the States concerning off-shore preservation of superannuation rights-the petroleum. -My Government will introduce legislatember last. The arrangements will apply, tion forthwith to establish an Institute of after the passage of the legislation, on and Marine Science at Townsville, and to estabfrom 1st January 1970. lish an Anglo-Australian Telescope Board to erect a 150 inch telescope at Siding Spring. My Government has agreed to a programme of extended wild life research by tion to provide substantially increased medithe Commonwealth Scientific and Induscal benefits, based on the concept that Legislation will be introduced to finance the Commonwealth's share of establishing a fourth school of Veterinary Science at an Australian University. A Royal Commission will be established to enquire into the question of damage which might be caused to the Barrier Reef through drilling for oil. Special grants will be made for educavided by my Government in 1970-71. The present programme of unmatched capital grants for construction of Teacher expire on 30th June this year. My Government will introduce legislation early in this Session to authorise a further similar three year programme to the value of $30m. My Government is at present co-operating with the States in a nation-wide survey educational needs at the primary and secondary levels, and for teacher education including in-service training. My Government will introduce early economies of living together; to authorise on wheels; and to provide capital assistance a 2 for 1 basis to approved institutions training handicapped children. Early legislation will be introduced to ployees* Compensation Act 1930-1969. Legislation will also be brought down this so-called portability of pensions-whic h was announced in the Parliament on 25th SepDuring this Session legislation will be introduced to improve the health scheme. My Government will introduce legislamedical benefit payments are to be determined by reference to the fees most commonly charged for medical services. This, and other improvements to the scheme, will require increased insurance premiums from individuals and increased subventions by the Commonwealth. My Government has also decided that the major recommendations of the Nimmo Report should be accepted and will introduce legislation to this end. Those recommendations dealing with matters for which the Commonwealth and States have joint responsibility remain to be. the subject of negotiation with State governments. The Minister for Health will make a full and detailed statement to the Parliament on these matters early in the present Session. My Government has decided that families on low incomes should be helped to meet the cost of health insurance by a graduated subsidy designed to pay the full cost of health insurance for families with incomes not in excess of the average minimum wage, and part of the cost of meeting health insurance for families whose incomes are litde in excess of the average minimum wage. Measures will be introduced directed towards simplification of the procedures of health insurance funds, the more effective employment of their financial reserves, the maintenance of their management expenses at reasonable levels, and the improvement of their operational efficiency and economy generally. The increases in the traffic in drugs is a gramme of tourism development and the matter of concern to my Government.

My Government will now imCriminology, financed by the Commonmediately introduce legislation to establish wealth, to carry out research and provide a statutory corporation to promote the protraining for officers engaged in the prevenduction and distribution of Australian-made tion of crime. My Government also proposes to introcorporation. duce legislation to reduce delays in the hearing of proceedings for divorce and to reduce the cost to litigants. This will be sitate a substantial programme of legislation. done by enabling State Courts of intermediate jurisdiction to hear certain undefended divorce cases and to simplify procedures for the enforcement of maintenance orders granted in another State or Territory. My Government will introduce legislation immediately to amend the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964-1967 to raise the permissible limit on the value of a house from SI5,000 to $17,500, to liberalise other aspects of the scheme and to provide that, if a credit union meets the conditions which will be required, savings deposited with that credit union will qualify for the purposes of homes savings grants. My Government will continue its policy of fostering Aboriginal initiative, will use the special capital fund which has been set up to assist in this task, and hopes that during the lifetime of the Parliament any remnants of discriminatory legislation against Aboriginals will be eliminated. International tourism nowadays is big business. A decade ago it brought Australia approximately SI6m. In 1969 it brought Australia approximately $120m. The Australian Tourist Commission, established by the Government in 1967 to encourage the How of visitors to Australia, believes this can be raised to $300m per annum by 1975, if certain development programmes are adopted. The Government recognises the vital role of the States and the industry in any proMy Government has already demonCouncil has been appointed to investigate films of high quality.

The prompt preparation of legislation is the basis of effective parliamentary Government and so that such preparation may be expedited my Government proposes to establish by statute an Office of Parliamentary Counsel and to take administrative steps which it is hoped will lead to the availability of such experienced draftsmen. And now, as we enter this new decade of opportunity for Australia, I leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties in the faith that Divine Providence will guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of Australia.

It has been announced in this place and it has not changed. I would add to that, in case the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten, that we have indicated we support sanctions but would not support the use of force. I would like that to be understood.

10,Mr Gortoni Think The Policy Of,"question and I refer to the passage in the Governor General's Speech in relation to tbe Government's intentions to introduce legislation to allow portability of pensions retrospective to 1st January 1970. Can the Prime Minister advise me whether Captain J. P. Stevenson, who has submitted his resignation to the Royal Australian Navy, will therefore be entitled to receive his pensecurity of the region that Australian troops sion entitlements? to, as I think the honourable member will see, will give a right to all public servants employed by the Commonwealth and all officers employed in tbe Armed Forces to retire after having served tbe required number of years and to take with them the pro rata pension to which they are entitled according to the number of years which they have served. This would not be as great a pension as it would be had the full term of service been carried out in either the Public Service or the Services but would be in the terms of the legislation as presented the proportion of pension which the number of years served would suggest. That being so, then Captain Stevenson, amongst others, would certainly be entitled to that. The legislation must first be passed. But when it is passed, all those who have retired in the categories I have mentioned after 1st January 1970 will get the benefits of the Bill. addressed to the Minister for the Army. 1 refer the honourable gentleman to mine explosions in Vietnam in which nine Australian soldiers were killed and fifteen wounded. I ask the Minister: What mine detection devices were used by the units in these operations and what training had these units been given in the detection of mines? I further ask the Minister: Is be satisfied that equipment and training are adequate to prevent the decimations of Australian units? detailed questions relating in particular to the barrier mine field in South Vietnam which were answered in detail in August last year. The honourable gentleman is now referring to the regrettable losses which have been sustained over the last 10 to 14 days. The details of training were given to the honourable member. I am satisfied with tbe training which is given and the equipment that is used by the Australian Army for mine detection. These losses were sustained in the Long Hai hills area which, as the honourable member will know, is above the plains of the lower part of South Vietnam. It is essential for the enter this region to ensure the security of the local inhabitants. The incidents were regrettable. I am satisfied that the techniques used were correct. I am satisfied that the troops approached their task with the proper degree of security and attention that was required of them. 1 am not belittling the losses that were sustained over this period but I am endeavouring to put my mind to the question that the honourable member has posed and therefore my short answer is: Yes, I am satisfied with the training. If the honourable member wants any further information in relation to actual techniques 1 will be happy to supply it to him. Minister for External Affairs. Further to the reply that the Prime Minister has just given to the Leader of tbe Opposition, can the right honourable gentleman give a firm assurance that the Australian Government has no intention of changing its policy of not recognising the Smith regime as the legitimate government of Rhodesia? sibility for Southern Rhodesia resides in the United Kingdom Govermnent. We have always accepted that position. For this and other reasons we have not recognised the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia and we have no intention of changing our policy. the right honourable Treasurer.

Is he aware that some local government authorities are paying interest of up to 8% and more for their money, this rate deterring them from carrying out urgent community development projects? If the Government is bereft of plans in this area of great need will the Treasurer please tell the House why the Australian Labor Party solution outlined before the last federal election cannot be adopted in this sphere as it has been in so many others? Treasurer I would like to draw the attention of all members to the fact that question time is a period in which to seek infortion of its policy in regard not only to mation based on fact. Matters which are hypothetical are out of order. Questions which have long prefaces or which give information are just two examples of questions which are out of order. However, the honourable member has asked this question and I have allowed it to go through as it is his first question. But I would remind all honourable members that to frame questions correctly they should refer to the book economy, and any government which prepared by the Clerk some time ago entitled 'Business and Procedures of the House of Representatives', which gives fuller information than I have given. the honourable member for that slight bit of promotion which he gave me in the early part of his question. tralia we do have what is, relative to the rest of the world, a very low structure of interest rates. Fortunately also, so far in this respect we have been able to sever our economy very largely from overseas influences. The honourable member might be interested to know, incidentally, that on our current reserves of foreign exchange Australia earns somewhat over 8% . The general structure of interest rates is, of course, a by-product of the forces at work in the economy. By issuing sufficient quantiforepcak of this 58,000 ton Liberian registies of money it is always possible to keep interest rates low. Looking back to the early post-war years, one can see that disastrous damage was done to the Australian economy-thi s persisted for many Labor Party at that time of forcing long term interest rates down to 34% . policy. ber for Melbourne has made the curious remark that he won the war. I recollect that at the time certain Prime Ministers of his own persuasion had in him a mighty weight to carry on their backs in order to pursue the war. An interest rate like that could of course be attained again by using the printing, press. I do not think that the Australian Labor Party has enunciated that in so many words, but that is the implicainterest rates but also in other directions. At the present time we live in an inflationary era. Inflation is worse overseas than it is here. While the tremendous demand for investment funds persists and while the pressures on wages and incomes are still there it will be extremely difficult to control interest rates. In other words, they are a by-product of the operations of the devotes its whole economic policy towards fixing interest rates at a certain level will get the economy into a great deal of trouble. Shipping and Transport advise the House whether he is aware of the maritime accident off Thursday Island early today? of a maritime accident today, but it is insufficient for me to be able to make a statement to the House at this stage. However, I will be doing so at the first opportunity. I am able to say that a vessel called the 'Oceanic Grandeur' was involved in a collision with a submerged object about 2 miles east of a place called Ince Point on Wednesday Island in Torres Strait early this morning. As a result of this collision the tered vessel was damaged.

The oil is being pumped from the 'Oceanic Grandeur* into the 'Leslie J. Thompson' and it is hoped that the process of transferring the oil from one ship to the other will be completed in the quickest possible time. In the meantime the Queensland Department of Harbours and Marine and my own Department are co-operating to ensure that adequate detergents are flown to the area by the Royal Australian Air Force. As soon as it is possible for me to make a full and detailed report to the House on the progress of this oil slick and the measures being taken to contain it I shall do so. Minister for Immigration a question. Taking the hint, Mr Speaker, I will make my preface brief. I refer to British migration, which has long been of great strength to our total migration programme. Is the Government concerned at the recent downturn of assisted migration from Britain? What are the factors responsible for this downturn? What is being done to generate a greater flow of British settlers to this country? tion, the number of British settlers who will arrive in Australia this year under the United Kingdom-Australia assisted migration programme is at least 68,000, which is slightly fewer than the 73,000 for the previous year. However, this figure should certainly be assessed against results over a wider period of time as there have been considerable fluctuations in the intake of assisted British settlers over the past decade. The right honourable gentleman queried the reason why there has been a fluctuation during the present period. This, of course, is a most complex situation which does not lend itself to simple elaboration, but if one assumes that the pull factors, that is, the conditions in Australia, have remained constant, some of the factors which have influenced British thinking in relation to the downturn would be marginal improvement in economic conditions in Great Britain, the prospects of Britain's entry .into the European Economic Community, a very good summer in Britain in 1969 and the difficulties which many British people who wish to come to this country are experiencing in selling homes quickly. Certainly the Government is concerned at any diminution in the assisted migration programme from Great Britain because British migration has been, and we would wish it to continue to be, the cornerstone of our immigration programme. I can assure the right honourable gentleman and the House that we are most vigorously prosecuting our migration programme in the United Kingdom to ensure a greater flow of British settlers to this country. We need more British settlers, and as an indication of the positive steps which have been taken I would instance these facts: In the first place, the number of regional offices has been expanded over the years. There are now seven regional offices and my understanding is that a further office will shortly be opened; in the second place, our administrative machinery in London has been kept under constant review. I point also to the fact that there has been a major uplift in our expenditure on funds on television advertising and general printing in Britain, and that we are providing additional resources, by way of counselling, to professional workers and single men and women. So in summary I say to the right honourable gentleman and to the House that we are determined that migration from the United Kingdom should continue to be the cornerstone of our total immigration programme and that steps are being taken to realise this objective. Navy: Firstly, how many Service patrol boats does Australia possess at the present time and, secondly, having regard to the vast area to be patrolled, will the Minister use his undoubted powers of persuasion in an effort to have more patrol boats provided as early as practicable? operation twenty vessels which undertake patrol operations.

Did the Government reject the Premiers' proposals for a share of income tax revenue, and did the Government also disapprove of any proposals for them to levy State income tax? Is the Constitution silent on the question of income tax for the very good reason that that tax did not exist at the time of Federation? In order that the views of the Australian people can be obtained, will the Government authorise a referendum asking tbe following questions: 1, Are you in favour of State parliaments being retained in their present form? 2, If the answer to 1 is yes, are you in favour of the States receiving afixedproportion of income tax? member, if be had bothered to read the newspaper reports of the Premiers Conference or the transcript of the Conference, which was held in public, would scarcely have needed to ask tbe question he has because be would have got the answer from such reading. We pointed out to the Premiers the difficulties involved and inherent in transference of income tax to State governments and proposed a number of other means by which State government finances could be assisted. I will again not repeat what was said in the Governor General's Speech but refer the honourable member to that Speech, because there these alternate methods of assisting State governments are clearly set out. I believe that he is right in his assumption that the Constitution is silent on the question of income tax, but I would point out to him that there bave been High Court cases on the subject of the right to levy income tax and that the High Court, as the legally and properly constituted interpreter of the Constituconclusion late this afternoon was that it is tion, has brought down judgments which have led to the present situation. The answer to tbe third question is no. MAIL SERVICES him: What action is being taken to bring to an end the disastrous strike by postal workers which is designed to bring chaos member for Reid has been interjecting continually since he sat on the front bench this afternoon. I ask him to restrain himself. Would the honourable member for Bennelong commence the question again? Postmaster-General: What action is being taken to bring to an end the disastrous strike by postal workers which is designed to bring chaos to commercial activity and great distress to the people of Australia? make a brief explanation in relation to this issue. It has been suggested in the news media that the problem arose out of the Arbitrator's decision to give to certain classifications of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union a rise of between $1.0 and $91 and also out of the fact that a 6.6% increase which had been given to motor drivers and to certain work areas had not been passed on to this particular group. Tbe APWU lodged a claim in relation to tbese classifications in December 1.968. Tbe first decision, which was an interim decision, was given in January 1969. A further decision, which was a consent decision, was given in July 1969. The Arbitrator's decision was the third in relation to this claim. Tbe three together represent in tbe broad area an increase of from 8.6% to 10.5% in the wages of these classifications. I say that because I believe that this matter has been put out of perspective so far as the public is concerned. As to the question which the honourable member asked, today there has been consultation between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union, the Public Service Board and representatives of the Post Office.

I ask the right honourable gentleman: Does the Convention provide, inter alia, ownership rights for indigenous peoples over land that they traditionally occupy? Is the failure of the Government to ratify the Convention related to its refusal to grant land ownership rights, within the meaning of the Convention, to Aboriginals? Will the Government immediately set up a joint committee of inquiry of this House to investigate the most effective and equitable means of providing land rights for Aboriginals in Australia? Convention referred to has not previously come under my attention. It would probably be a matter for the Minister for External Affairs to study and no doubt he can answer the first part of the honourable member's question after that, should the honourable member seek that information from him. The answer to the second part of the honourable member's question is that I would not undertake to set up a commission of the kind he suggests. the Minister for Primary Industry. It refers Minister for Defence. I cannot give an to the Government's proposal of 2 years answer to the first part of the honourable ago to provide S25m through the States to assist in the reconstruction of Australian dairy farms. Have any of the States except Western Australia, which has agreed to this proposal, indicated if and when they will agree to this important means of assisting the dairy industry? negotiation has not been without its difficulties, but there are now encouraging signs. I am fairly confident that an agreement will be reached. However, I would like to qualify that comment by saying that I have said this before. At the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in Sydney in February it was agreed that the officers of State departments involved in this matter would get together in Canberra on 12th February to discuss the difficulties that the States saw in the scheme and to unravel arisen. The Prime Minister contacted the Premiers and the meeting was arranged and held. Much good came out of the meeting and at the moment the matter is in the hands of the State governments for them to iron out some of the minor areas of disagreement that still exist. I would like to point out, however, that we drew up a draft document of agreement witb Western Australia so that it could implement the scheme. This document was then circulated to the other States and it is being examined by the various State officers at the moment. I hope that in the very near future the difficulties will be ironed out to the satisfaction of all parties. directed to the Minister for the Army. Can he advise the House how much the Australian Government invested in the military base at Terendak in Malaysia in construction and associated costs? What is to happen to that investment of Australian taxpayers' money now that the base has been abandoned?

42,Mr Peacock,"This question shouldmember's question. From the top of my head 1 could not give thefiguresto him. In the last part of his question he raises a matter that is currently under negotiation and the Minister for Defence, I am sure, would be able to give tbe information to him. If he wishes to draw inferences in relation to the stationing of our troops in Malaysia, as newspaper reports that I have seen suggest he does, or from the fact that Terendak is a very fine establishment that could be and is at present being used by the Malaysians, I would remind him that in the short term tbe problem of positioning our own troops has been solved and that our long term involvement in the area and accommodation for our troops will be dealt with by the Minister for Defence. Mr Malcolm Fraser-May 1 also answer the question? member wish him to do so? I would agree to that course being followed. one allegation that has been made by the honourable member not only in this House but outside it which, I think, should be corrected. He has said that the Malaysians are demanding a high rental for facilities at Butterworth. This is not true. It has also been denied by Malaysian officials. I think that, from the honourable member's experience in Malaysia, Mr Speaker, he should understand better than he apparently does the attitude that the Malaysians have to our presence there and understand better the attitude that the Singaporeans have to our presence there. 1 would like to quote from one editorial appearing in a Malaysian newspaper which had something to say about earlier remarks of the honourable member. One Malaysian newspapera Kuala Lumpur newspaperdoubted that Mr Morrison 'because of his experience in the region could genuinely feel that there was any unfriendliness towards Australia on the part of tbe Malaysian Government or people'. The editorial described the Morrison allegations as 'cheap tactics' in a 'domestic affair' and regretted the reference to Malaysia in that context. I think that it has become quite clear that the honourable member is seeking to use his background of alleged responsibility in this area to try to cast doubts on the defence arrangements which have been made between the countries concerned and to try to lead people to believe that there are substantial difficulties between ourselves and the Malaysians or the Singaporeans. This is not the case. BABY BONUS Minister for Social Services recall my constant campaigning during the last Parliament on behalf of mothers who give birth to twins? Will he assure this Parliament that he will view this matter with great concern in order that justice may be given in baby bonus payments? I hope it is not with any personal prospects-the interest which the honourable member has shown in this question. It is a matter of policy. I can assure him of my sympathetic understanding of his difficulties.

50,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honourablemay recall that, when he first took office, by question in this HouseI drew his attention to the widening of the gap in our economy between secondary and primary industry and asked whether he would cause investigations to be made with a view to giving primary industry by price support on exports the samefinancialadvantage as that enjoyed by secondary industry through tariff protection. I now ask: Did the Prime Minister take any action in this regard and, if so, by the previous Labor Government in New with what result? that this and other matters concerned with the welfare of primary producers of this country were very carefully considered by the Minister for Primary Industry and indeed by the Government generally since there are, as the honourable member would agree, many advantages enjoyed by primary producers which the other sections of the community do not enjoy. I am talking of taxation concessions and matters of that kind. Having said that, that is not in any way to be taken as indicating that there is not a difficult situation in some sections of primary industry. Indeed, the Governor General's Speech indicated that the Government would, in conjunction with the primary industry organisations, seek to help primary producers in the future as they have helped them in the past I would not undertake to do what the honourable member suggested, and that is, I gather, to pay a bounty on the export bounty. If it is not referring to a bounty then I am not answering the question he asked. I would not undertake to do that by whatever name it were called-that is, a bounty on some exports. Prime Minister been drawn to the increasing quotas in fact eventually bring about a pollution of Sydney beaches by untreated situation in which approximately one third and undertreated sewage? Is he aware that of those now in the industry will be obliged the authority responsible for sewerage has to seek other means of livelihood? Does the indicated that the submarine outflow system Minister favour such a situation on the required to free Sydney beaches of sewage ground that even before quotas one third pollution will not be in operation before qf the industry was uneconomic? Finally, 1990 due to the impasse in Commonwealth if the Minister does not favour the situation and Statefinancialrelations? Will the Prime Minister act urgently in this matter and make a grant available to New South Wales so that Sydney's beaches may be free of pollution. drawn to the fact that Sydney beaches have been damaged and polluted in the way referred to by the honourable member. I believe that this has come about primarily as a result of a deliberate policy adopted South Wales, which quite deliberately indicated, and is on record as quite deliberately indicating, that they wished to dispose of their sewerage by this means and not by treatment. I would be glad to draw the honourable member's attention to that. I have not at this stage myself read any special request for assistance in that direction but 1 did some time ago have a communication from the Premier of New South Wales who indicated that he hoped that the New South Wales Government would be able to receive better treatment at Loan Council meetings, for example in order to enable this work to correct mistakes made by the previous Labor administration to be brought into being. I hope and think that the measures taken to relieve that State and other States, or the measures being discussed to relieve it of some of the burden of debt-measure s being taken to prevent that burden of debt growing-wil l enable the State Government to tackle this problem more rapidly than they have been able to do in the past. It may be that 1 will get a specific request; it may be that in the last day or so one has come in, but if so I have not seen it. Primary Industry a question.

This situation became very obvious to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, which is the supreme body of wheat growers in Australia. Facing up to the enormous problems, which were almost impossible to resolve, the Federation decided on a quota proposal, which needed the backing of the Commonwealth for financing the first advance and which needed the support of all State governments for implementation. The fundamental purpose of the quota proposal was to try to protect the traditional wheat growers and the small wheat growers who did not cause this problem and who had not expanded their production to a great extent during the past 5 years. The way in which the quota system is administered is a matter entirely for the States. The actual determination of quotas, and the method used, varies from State to State. I will not allow anybody to interpret a quota scheme as being against the small grower and the traditional grower. The objective is to protect those people. ' COLLISION IN SYDNEY HARBOUR the Navy inform the House of the approximate cost of repairs to HMAS 'Parramatta resulting from the collision it had recently with a Manly ferry in Sydney Harbour? How long will the ship be out of commission undergoing repairs? Was there any damage at all to the Manly ferry? honourable member's last question. I understand that no damage was done to the ferry. I am not aware of any timefixedto carry out tbe repairs to HMAS 'Parramatta'. I have seen afigureof some thousands of dollars relating to the repair of HMAS 'Parramatta* but that figure would be a highly speculative one at this stage. I would like to observe to the honourable gentleman and to the House that I think it is a pity that some people are endeavouring to apportion or to lay liability upon one or other of the vessels. Both vessels are now the subject of boards of inquiry and for my part I would hesitate very much indeed to say where liability should rest. I will make inquiries to see whether I can get a definite figure for the honourable gentleman as to the cost of the repairs and the time involved. I will supply the information to him at the earliest opportunity. General whether he can indicate to the House when the microwave system between Western Australia and the eastern States will be operational? member asked me a question about this matter during the last session. I informed him then that there had been considerable delay in receipt of essential equipment from, the United Kingdom. My understanding and expectation is that the system will be completed by the end of June. I remind the honourable gentleman that during the Christmas period the Post Office leased some twenty-four channels on the satellite system between Sydney and Perth so that Western Australian people would not be disadvantaged because the microwave system had not been completed. Those channels would cost the Post Office at the rate of $55,000 per annum per channel.
