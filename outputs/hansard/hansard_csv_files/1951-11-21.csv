HEALTH AND MEDICAL the Minister for Health arises from the fact that persons who axe old enough to qualify for the age 'pension but who continue to work, as they are being encouraged to do by this Government, are not entitled to medical benefits if they fall sick. Such elderly people are liable to be unable to work again if they J become sick. Will the Minister amend tbe appropriate regulations so that persons over the pensionable age who are endeavouring to keep at work will be eligible for the medical benefits that are provided for age pensioners! such persons is being carefully examined by the Government with the object of making medical 'benefits available to them and also to men and women in receipt of superannuation pensions approximately equivalent to the age pension. COAL. Labour and National Service whether the conciliation and arbitration machinery that was set urp under the National Security (Coal Mining Industry Employment) Regulations will shortly cease to be available for the settlement of disputes in the coal industry. If so, is the Minister in a position to advise the House of the Government's intentions in this matter ? ber has indicated, part of the machinery for the settlement of disputes in the coal mining industry was established under certain National Security Regulations. The validity of those regulations as they apply to the coal-mining industry is now under attack. The matter is rather complex and the Government has given a great deal of consideration to it. I propose, with the permission of the House, to make a statement on the subject at a later stage so as not to take up time that is available for questions. Labour and National Service read of the decision of tbe miners' federation to continue, its opposition to the mechanical extraction of pillar coal? In view of the importance of this decision, which will affect coal production in future years, particularly in New South Wales, has the Minister .decided to take any action in regard to this matter? the decision of the miners' federation. I very much regret that at this important meeting of .the federation a decision hostile to the extraction of coal by mechanical means was made. This decision could have serious effects on the industrial economy of this country. It",8,Setup

This matter should not become the subject of a party dispute in the polithe miners' federation. The National tical sense. I am glad to say that the Minister for MineB in the New South Wales Government has repeatedly insisted on the necessity for extracting pillar coal by mechanical means. There cannot be any reasonable doubt regarding the safety of this method' of extraction which is extensively used in other countries and which was recommended by the Coal Industry Tribunal. That recommendation has received the support of departmental experts of the Mines Department in New South Wales. It is apparent that the forces inside the miners' federation whose objective is to retard our eoonomy are still dominant in the federation. able gentleman has gone outside the scope of the question. the resolution on . this subject was reached by only nineteen votes to seventeen, I hope that it may be possible to arrive at a reasonable basis of discussion on this matter between the representatives of tbe Joint Coal Board and the more responsible elements in the miners' federation. Later:Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) -h y leave I ""wish to refer to a question raised by the honourable member for Robertson on the arrangements the Government has in mind in regard to industrial machinery for tbe coal-mining industry. accordance with the agreement recorded in the preambles to the Coal Industry Acts 1946, of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, the Government has sent, for the concurrence of the New South Wales Government, a bill, the broad purpose of which is to extend the jurisdiction of the Ooal Industry Tribunal so us to cover all disputes in tbe industry, -whether they be interstate in character or affect New South Wales only. The present industrial machinery springs from two different legislative sources. The Coal Industry Acts gave to the Ooal Industry Tribunal jurisdiction over all interstate disputes and intra-state disputes in New South Wales that affect Security (Goal Mining Industry Employment) Regulations gave to a system of reference boards jurisdiction over all disputes in Australia affecting the craft unions, whether interstate or intra-state. Outside New South Wales these regulations also apply to intra-state disputes affecting the miners' federation. It was always recognized that the National Security Regulations could have but a limited life. The question of the machinery that should be provided to deal with industrial disputes covered by the regulations has engaged the attention of successive Australian governments for some time. Many discussions have been held with the New South Wales Government and with representatives of the employers and the unions. These discussions were commenced by the Chifley Gdvernment. The validity of the regulations has now been challenged in theHigh Court, and a decision respecting the industrial machinery to take the placeof that provided by the regulations has. become a matter of pressing urgency. Weheld a series of discussions with representatives of the owners and the unionsin the industry, and the New South Wales Government. Following these the present Government decided that the plan which appeared most practicable would? be for the Commonwealth to vest in theOoal Industry Tribunal, established? under the 1946 legislation, jurisdiction in respect of industrial disputes of an interstate character affecting the craft unions,, and for the State of New South Wales In to vest in the tribunal jurisdiction im respect to industrial disputes within New South Wales affecting the craft unions.. That is the jurisdiction possessed by thereference boards under the regulations. The result of this would be to give theCoal Industry Tribunal jurisdiction in. relation to all interstate coal industrial' disputes and those affecting New South Wales alone. I should mention-here that since 1947 Mr Gallagher, who is theCoal Industry Tribunal, has also been chairman of the Central Reference Board! under the regulations.",13,Services

10,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forA draft bill has been prepared after discussions with all concerned in the -^idustry. This bill has been submitted fo the New South Wales Government for its approval under the inter-governmental agreement to which I have referred. Representatives of the owners and the unions were informed what would be substantially, in similar terms to agreed in 1949 at the request of the Chifley Government. To judge from the discussions which have been held recently with the mining industry unions, I think it can be said that they may he expected not to disagree with this bill except in one particular, and that is, the degree to which the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should extend to the eiiforcemeut of awards and orders of the Coal Industry Tribunal. The Government desires to introduce this bill into this Parliament during this sessional period. If the bill is not passed during the current sittings it will not be possible to put into effect the plans that have been discussed with representatives of the industry. Security (Coal Mining Industry Employment) Regulations cease to have effect, the eraft unions in the coal-mining industry will revert to the jurisdiction of the normal Commonwealth and State industrial tribunals. We are dependent upon a speedy and favorable reply from the -Government of New South Walesi f we are to carry through the plans discussed with all concerned. As the New South Wales Government has been fully aware all along of the issues involved, it should not have any difficulty in letting us know its views. I lay on the table the following paper:Coal-mining Industry-Industria l Machinery -Ministeria l Statement. ui nd move That the paper be printed. adjoiirned. Treasurer a question which relates ito the serious situation that has arisen iu the building industry because of the Government's action in restricting credit for building purposes. Is it a fact that builders and intending home purchasers are being asked to obtain their financial accommodation outside the banking system, from insurance companies, &c, as a result of done. This draft bill is, which the loans are dearer and the negotiation of them is more complicated ? Is it further a fact that every person who wishes to borrow more than £5,000 must obtain the permission of the Commonwealth Bank Board before being able, to do so? In view of the fact that houses are so urgently required to accommodate workers who are being asked to increase the production of coal and steel, will the Minister explain to the House why those restrictions artbeing imposed? fully direct the honourable gentleman's attention to the speech that I made in rci>lv tn the budget debate, in which I gave a good deal of consideration to and explanation of the general problem of housing nnrl housing finance in Australia. And, as soon as the National ROADS. MrI ' AIRBAIRN I ask the Minister for Supply or the Minister for Defence Production whether, in view of the fact that it has been found necessary to use thousands of tons of Oaklands coal to maintain production in the Mulwala munitions and fertilizer factory, the Government will consider making a grant to the local council so that it will be able to improve and seal the road over which this coal has to be taken between Oaklands and Mulwala. Mr .BEALE I am not sure whether this matter comes within the province of the Minister for Defence Production or the Minister for National Development, but I shall draw the attention of the appropriate Minister to the honourable gentleman's question who will let him have a reply. ported performance of a Single Pass soil stabilizing machine imported by the Government for use by the Royal Australian Air Force in aerodrome construction, can the Minister for Air make the machine",14,Services

15,Mr Fairhall,"In view of the reavailable for inspection and demonstration to main roads boards and local government authorities who might then be able to decide whether the machine would be of use in the reconstruction of our damaged country roads? tralian Air Force has recently imported a soil stabilizer from the United States of America. The machine can be used for the construction of roads or air strips and will make possible the construction of a strip of road a mile long and 20 feet feet wide in a little less than eight hours. It was produced by an American corporation known as the P. and H . Corporation and full details about it can be obtained from that corporation, or from Waugh and Josephson Limited, who are its local agents in New South Wales and Queensland. I think that the suggestion of the honourable member has great merit, and I shall recommend to the Air Board that the machine be made available for inspection at Williamtown within the course of the next few weeks. I shall also endeavour to have it made available for inspection at the local government conference when it meets in New South Wales next year. for Immigration say how many immigrants have entered Australia from the tTnited Kingdom, Europe and other places since this Government came into office? What was the growth of population by natural increase in the same period? honourable member precise figures in relation to that matter, but I can tell him that, since the end of the war 560.000 or 570,000 new settlers have come to Australia. During that period there has been a movement from Australia of people who have left the country permanently. At the present time that movement averages about 20,000 persons a year. This year the Government will have attracted more British settlers to Australia than has been the case in any other year in Australia's history. I shall obtain the figures regarding immigration from Europe and supply the honourable member with the table for which he has asked. Immigration say whether it is a fact that a Chinese millionaire from Singa#'} pore, who collaborated with the Japanese -during World War II . , is now operating a chain of restaurants in all the capital cities of Australia? Has he applied for and obtained permits from the Minister for the admission into Australia of Asiatics to work as cooks and waiters in those restaurants? knowledge of the person to whom the honourable gentleman has referred. If the honourable member will supply me with the name of the person, I shall cause inquiries to be made into the matter that he has raised. The rules relating to the residence in Australia of Chinese citizens are well known to all honourable members. I am not aware that there are any Chinese in this country at the present time who have not complied' with thosr rules. Minister, in view of the disturbed state of affairs in Egypt, the vital importance to Australia of the Suez Canal, and tbe murder of British subjects in Egypt, what he has done or is doing in regard to Australia's intervention in this matter? I indicated to the House in a special statement our view on the position in Egypt and the nature of the opinions that we had expressed about it. in particular, to the Government of Ununited Kingdom. Since then we have been kept very closely in touch with developments. I cannot at the present stage add to my previous statement anything that would be useful. mous losses of stock and property that have been suffered by primary producers as a result of the disastrous bush fires in the north-west of New South Wales will the Treasurer say whether action can be taken to authorize the Commissioner of Taxation to refrain from collecting provisional tax in the current financial year from those who have suffered such heavy losses.",15,Housing

CALL TO THENATION . ter whether it is a fact that the persons who were responsible for the preparation of a message that was broadcast and published under the title of "" The Gall"" on Remembrance Day have held a series -of secret meetings in the dining hall of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, Melbourne. Is it not also a fact that the Prime Minister is fully conversant with the activities of this organization and its real purpose, which is to employ all means available to it to keep Labour from obtaining political power in this country ? men who prepared the "" Call to the Nation"" which was published in the press are known to me and, indeed, to most honourable members. sponsor of "" The Call"" was Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, who occupies a deservedly high position in the public life of this country. I do not know whether the people concerned have met in the dining hall of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank in Melbourne. I do not even know if there is a dining hall in that building. If the honourable member for East Sydney believes that there is some sinister and secret diving labour which has always been political manoeuvre behind this matter, T direct his attention to the fact that when "" The Call"" was broadcast it instantly received warm and encouraging support, not only from me as Prime Minister, but also from my distinguished and learned friend, the Leader of the Opposition. inform me whether it is a fact that 150 highly trained customs officers have been dismissed in accordance with the Government's policy of retrenchment, and that such dismissals have caused a serious congestion of cargoes on the Australian waterfront ? Conversation being audible. too much conversation taking place in the House to-day. It affords an excellent example of the state of affairs about which the honourable member for Wilmot complained so eloquently last night. fact, will the Government give consideration to the immediate re-engagement of these former customs officers in order that the irritating delays now occurring in clearing goods from our wharfs may be lessened? aware that the statement made by the honourable member is fact, but I shall refer his question to the Minister for Trade and Customs and ask that he be given a suitable reply. Immigration inform the House whether there is any truth in the report that perThe chief mits to enter into Australia are being sought on behalf of Japanese pearl divers so that they might work pearl beds in north Australian waters? In view of the disastrous experience that Australia has had in regard to Japanese agents operating under the guise of divers in those parts prior to the last war, will the Minister give an assurance to this House that no such permits will be issued? Will he also give a direction that other available is to be used in this industry? member's question because I recently noticed a statement in the press to the effect that I have authorized the entry of certain Japanese immigrants into this country. That is completely false. The only approval given to the entry of Japanese has been that given to certain business representatives to come here on short-term tourist permits.

I felt that the claims were sufficiently serious to warrant investigation, but I do not propose to discuss the matter with Cabinet until the facts have been ascertained. ""When the facts are before me I shall determine whether there is any basis for the claims of the association, and I shall then ask Cabinet to express a view on what should be done about the matter. is addressed to the Minister for Health, relates to the scheme under which milk is distributed to school children free of charge. In many parts of Australia, especially those where the average rainfall is less than 10 inches, it is virtually impossible to maintain dairy herds and, therefore, milk is not available for distriof adequate supplies of copper, can he bution to children. There is also a great shortage of powdered milk in those areas. Will the Minister consider tbe desirability of arranging for fruit juices to be issued to school children in those districts as a substitute for milk? Such juices are exceedingly nutritious, and their consumption by school children would assist the fruit industry. lation that authorizes the distribution of free milk to school children, it would not be possible to distribute fruit juices. An effort is being made to ensure that ample supplies of powdered milk shall be available in places such as those to which the honourable gentleman has referred. Investigations are being conducted with a view to ascertaining the best methods of using powdered milk. I shall be pleased to give consideration tn the honourable gentleman's suggestion on fruit juice, where it is not possible to obtain milk. Australian holdings of foreign currency have fallen by nearly £134,000,000. Will widespread hostility that has been the Treasurer say whether it is the view aroused among the people of north of the Government that there is a danger point below which this country's holdings of foreign currency should not be permitted to fall ? If so, what is the figure that has been determined ? Is the Government formulating any policy for arresting the fall in our foreign currency holdings ? matter that the honourable member has raised is being kept constantly under review. The Government has formulated its policy with respect to it and it will be discussed with other subjects at the forthcoming conference of British Commonwealth finance Ministers. for Supply inform the House of the present position of copper supplies in Australia ? Is he aware that the activities of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited in Tasmania are being seriously curtailed by the shortage of coke supplies ? In view of the importance do anything to remedy that shortage? able member asked me a question some weeks ago on the matter that he has just raised; and, while I was absent from the sittings recently the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Yarra also asked questions about the same subject.

However, any proposal the Government of Queensland or any other State government may put to the Commonwealth for assistance will receive every consideraordinance. tion provided that the proposal is based on sound economic grounds. Territories read reports of the discovery of a silver-lead deposit in the aboriginal reserve in Arnhem Land? Did the prospector concerned have a permit to enter upon the reserve? Will he be permitted to carry out raining operations in that area? a prospector named Brennan reported that he had discovered a silver-lead deposit at a spot about 25 miles north of Mainoru station in the Northern Territory. Upon investigation, it was found that the deposit was about fifteen miles inside the boundary of the aboriginal reserve. never been surveyed, and unless the prospector had a map and made the requisite observations he, probably, would not have been aware of the fact that he was within it. As the result of his report, the Director of Native Affairs in the Northern Territory, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Aboriginals Ordinance of the Northern Territory, granted a permit to him to return to the scene of his find with a geologist. Subsequently, they brought back specimens and, following an examination of those specimens, the Director of Native Affairs, acting again in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance, granted a provisional permit to the prospector and one assistant to return to the site of the discovery.

Has his attention been drawn to the fact that East-West Airlines Limited, a company that operated from thin aerodrome, has discarded its Avro Anson aircraft on the ground that they are too small for its purposes. Is he aware that, as the company now operates only Lockheed Hudson aircraft and expects soon to be using D.C.3 aircraft, Armidale is without an air service? In view of the serious inconvenience that is being caused by the lack of safe landing facilities at Armidale for aircraft of the larger types, can the Minister give an assurance that the construction of at least one landing strip suitable for large aircraft will be commenced at an early date? to say that the Department of Civil Aviation, at the request of the local governing authority, took over the aerodrome at Armidale. It may be that the aerodrome cannot accommodate aircraft of the larger types such as those that are now being used by East-West Airlines Limited. It is a matter for regret if Armidale is without an air service for that reason. The Government has had tp impose a l i m it upon work on aerodromes throughout the country in order to curtail expenditure and to ensure that the best possible use shall be made of our resources. At the moment, I can hold out no hope that tlie aerodrome at Armidale will be improved. Minister) -by leave-Cabinet yesterday '-onsidered its policy on civil aviation after a close study of the existing financial circumstances of the two main commercial airlines in Australia-Australia n National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission, otherwise known as Trans-Australia Airlines. A t the outset, I wish to remind the House of the policy declaration on civil aviation which appears in the 1949 joint Opposition policy speech, on which the present Government was returned to office. The relevant portions of that declaration are as follows:In civil aviation, we shall maintain arid expand full and developing air services. So far from having less need of trained aii crews and ground and engineering staffs, we will have more and more need of them, in the public interest. We are still only at tbe early stages of air transport. As for the Government airlines, which were designed by the Chifley Government to be monopolies (and failed to be so only because of a High Court decision), we shall put them on to a true competitive basis, with no pre ferences either in cheap capital or dollar expenditure. Though the future of their operative staff* is assured, because Australia needs them, the form of their future management and control will be considered in the light of results am) circumstances. Against this background, the Government has decided to attempt to secure the retention of the major airlines in competitive service to the Australian community. It is no part of the policy of thp I think it is correct, Government to foster either a government monopoly or a private monopoly on the major air routes. Trans-Australia Airlines has been successfully and efficiently established, and having secured a substantial share of the public goodwill, we consider it desirable that its competition should continue, so long as that competition is f a i r . Quite frankly, the Government would .regard it as unfortunateif either Trans-Australia Airlines or Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, its major competitor, disappeared from tbe airlines business, since such an event would create either a straight-out government monopoly or a private monopoly, to each of which this Government and, we believe, the (Kooyong-Prime public are in principle opposed. Whenever a government goes into competition with private enterprise, its competition can easily become unfair and oppressive. It can make losses and survive. It can find capital-a n important item in an industry in which new types of aircraft are being steadily evolved and in which, therefore, the problem of re-equipment and modernization assumes large financial proportions. If the government competition succeeds, private enterprise given away to a government monopoly. Such a result should, we believe, be avoided. The Government, having laid down the principle of the desirability of competition, has therefore authorized a Cabinet committee to work out promptly ways and",20,Civil Aviation
55,Mr Anthony,,21,Civil Aviation
56,Mr Menzies,"means of securing fair competition, having regard to such matters as mail and other government traffic, air route charges, rationalization of services, and charges made to the public; and to discuss these matters with the airlines affected. Whatever is done will attach predominant importance to the safety of and service to the public. It is intended that the practical measures to he adopted will be operative before the new year. by leave-The statement that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has made will re-assure the public mind in some degree but not completely. I think it can be said with justice that the statement has been elicited from the right honourable gentleman as a result of the strong representations that have been made by the Opposition, and perhaps also as a result of the fact that a small minority of liberal minded .members has been prodding the Government from the rear. Although the statement may be re-assuring in its first part, some portions of it give rise to anxiety. For instance, the Prime Minister referred to the rationalization of services. "" rationalization "" ? The dictionary that is made available in this chamber for the use of honourable members states that "" rationalization "" meansRe organization of an industry or group of related industries on a rational basis by means of amalgamations, common selling agencies, price-fixing agreements, and control of output, &c. dictionary. that the Government provides for the use of honourable members. We succeeded to it. interpretation that the average man lished Trans-Australia Airlines stipulated would place upon the word. Prime Minister referred to a statement private enterprise on a fair basis. Gothat he made in his policy speech of 1949, vernment supporters laugh, but they canbut I recall statements that he made in not laugh off the profits that have been previous policy speeches in which he exmade by Trans-Au3tralia Airlines, pressed his belief that transport, water although once they sneered at the idea of conservation, electricity and other such the organization ever making profits. projects should be controlled by governments. I do not know whether he has changed his view since then. The Labour Government endeavoured to set up what the right honourable gentleman now describes as a monopoly only because a growing monopoly was alreadv in existence. When that Government found that it had to compete with private enterprise it competed fairly. Does the Prime Minister know that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited requested that advice or directions be issued to employees of private enterprise not to travel on Trans-Australia Airlines services long before the Labour Government issued an instruction to everybody employed on government business to travel by those services? The action taken by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited gave rise to th* Labour Government's action. appears to be disturbed, but he knows that Trans-Australia Airlines brought funds to the Treasury coffers, not by extra taxation, but by proper competitive means. I fear that the rationalization What does he mean by to which the Prime Minister referred will lead to conditions the effect of which will be the reverse of that indicated b'y the right honourable gentleman. It may lead to the reduction of air crews and aircraft maintenance staffs as a result of reductions of air services. The Labour party believes in giving service to the people whether or not the service is profitable. The Trans-Australian Airlines organization has developed much of the outback country of Queensland, for instance. Such operations may not have produced profits, but Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has avoided operating on any but inter-capital city air routes unless it has received a subsidy foT such a service.

Some heat may develop over this issue, but let 'us remain calm and collected in this House. little time in which to say all that 1 should like to say. I merely emphasize that the Prime Minister's statement was reassuring in the first part but of very doubtful quality in the second part, and that no indication was given of what the right honourable gentleman meant when he referred to "" rationalization "". We can only accept the dictionary definition and, having that in mind, I Warn the Government and tell the people that, when the Labour party is returned to power in the not-far-distant future, it will restore Trans-Australia Airlines to the status it held previously. I point out that public opinion, as illustrated by the results of gallup polls, if such can be considered accurate, is quite clearly that the public wishes Trans-Australia Airlines to 'be retained as a government airline. Tf there is to be a monopoly, then, as fa'ias t!h'e Labour party can achieve ? rhat result, it m i l he a government and not a private im'onopoly, towards which we consider the present Government is rather favorable. Already Trans-Australia Airlines has paid a vast sum of money for route charges, though Aiistralian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited .a-re not paying 'one -cent under that heading. We consider 'that, uivtiil the matter c*E route charges has been finally determined by the High Court, the Government should relieve T'rans-Aiistrjali-a Airlines of rOu'tc means that it intends to do so, I venture charges, 'because it is unfair that Trans-Australia Airlines should have to pay such charges while the other major airliires do not pay them. The Government, by doing so, would allow Tra.ns-A-ustralia Airlines to work on 'the same 'basis as that -on which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is working. It would -provide fair competition. I'f it had been working on that basis Trans-Aus'tr'alia Air-lines would h'a've -shown a profit of more than £1,'000,000 [78] in the period in which it has been in operation. No other airline has done as well as that. I can make that statement with some feeling of satisfaction. It is well known that Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Empire Airways Limited are paying heavy air route charges although private enterprise airlines, towards which the Government is kindly disposed, are being allowed to escape from the payment of such charges. I know that this is a matter which has finally to be' dealt with by the High 'Gourt, but, in the meantime, the Government should suspend the charge on Trans-Australia Airlines. I hope that the Government will give favorable consideration to that suggestion. If it is prepared to do so, at least it will show that it believes in what we interpret to be rationalization of the industry. The Government, by acting as it is doing at the present time, however, is placing Trans-Australia Airlines in an entirely false position in spite of the wonderful opinion that the people have of it and of the service that it renders. It cannot be denied that as far as safety of operations and excellence of service is concerned, Trans-Australia Airlines merits the complete confidence of the people. Any attempt by a committee of the Cabinet to interfere in any way with it will, I am certain, rouse a great deal of resentment among the people. WhilstI am satisfied with the 'early part of :the Prime Minister's statement, I >am not satisfied with the -latter part of it. I have not time to traverse all the matters covered in the statement, but I assert that the Labour -party's definite policy in relation to civil .aviation has been completely justified. The Government has not interfered -with Trans-Australia Airlines adversely so far., but if -rationalization -of the air industry to suggest that some honourable members opposite disagree with the Government's policy 'and if it came to a vote they may cross the floor 'of this House when a vote is taken -on it.

He. referred to "" big "" extensions to the Lismore exchange. The expenditure on the erection of this exchange was unanimously recommended by the Public Works Committee and for £132,000 it is at present hardly possible to build a four-roomed cottage. At any rate, it is not possible to construct any building of an extensive character for £132,000. As Postmaster-General, I have not favoured the city or the country.

I think that such works are even being undertaken in the electorate of the honourable member for Dalley, but according to the honourable should be completed before construction is commenced anywhere else. The construction of exchanges at Lismore, and at Bathurst, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), will not be commenced for some little time for the Government has to call for tenders and observe other formalities in regard to contracts.

The Public Accounts Committee was established by legislation in 1913 and it. continued to function u n t i l 1932, when it was suspended by act of parliament as a depression economy measure. committee could be reconstituted by resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament. The matter of reconstituting the committee has been examined on several occasions., but for various reasons the government of the day has decided against the proposals submitted. The Auditor General, in his 1947-48 report, in advocating the removal of the suspension I imposed by Act No. 58 of 1932, referred to the rapid increase of Commonwealth revenue and expenditure since pre-waryears and expressed the view that the! need' fora more detailed survey of expenditure was now much greater than it was during the period when the Public Accounts Committee functioned, from. 1913 to 1932. The Government has f u l l y examined the matter and has reached the conclusion that the reconstitution of the committee would be a wise proceeding. In reaching this decision,, it took into consideration the substantial growth in Commonwealth expenditure in recent years and the necessity of imposing as much check as possible on the tendency to further increases. Although the committee couldi be reconstituted by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament,, it has been decided to repeal the old act,, to bring in a number of new provisions and to redraft some of the existing provisions. Asin the case of. theact. which it w ill repeal, the bill provides for a committee of ten members, three of whom are to be members of and appointed by the Senate, and seven of whom are to be members of and. apr pointed by the House of Representatives.

Provision is made in the bill for the committee to take in private, if so requested by a witness, evidence whether oral or documentary which in its opinion relates to a secret or confidential matter, and such evidence may not be disclosed without the authority of the witness. The bill makes provision for the appointment by the committee of sectional committees to report to the committee upon such matters with which the committee is concerned as the committee directs. The number of sectional committees is limited to two, and each sectional committee is to consist of three or more members. A departure made in this bill is for the payment of allowances as prescribed by regulation. This is desirable to avoid the necessity for amending the act in the event of an adjustment becoinng necessary in the rate of allowance payable to members. The provisions remaining in the bill are substantially the same as those included in the existing act.

The disadvantage of this upon recommendations of the Tariff is that when changing circumstances warrant an adjustment in the rate of allowance it is necessary to amend the act. In view of the difficulty in obtaining the passage of an amending bill on every occasion when an adjustment in the rates becomes necessary, the Government considers that the act should, be amended to provide for payment of allowances at rates to be prescribed. As it is anticipated that increases will be effected in the rates currently payable it will be necessary to increase the annual appropriation. The limit of expenditure in any one year has, therefore, been increased from £3,500 to £5,000.

However, I point out that if the Opposition agrees to it and the three measures are considered together honourable members will rely upon you, Mr Speaker, to allow a fairly wide scope of debate. The Minister for Commerce McEwen), in his second-reading speech on the principal bill, made a fairly wide survey of tlie wool industry which, however, was notable for several important omissions. I should like to be given the opportunity to remedy those omissions and to complete the survey in order that honourable members may be fully seized of the import of these amendments. I am not now referring to party political matters. The Opposition will agree on that basis to the suggestion that the Vice(Contributory Charge) Assessment Act President of the Executive Council has made. objection to the procedure that the Vice President of the Executive Council has suggested that the House should follow. I simply point out that on a number of occasions recently we have got into difficulties because of the fact that Ministers, in the course of second-reading speeches, have gone far beyond, the scope of the measures that they were introducing. Ministers can facilitate the passage of measures by confining their second-reading speeches strictly to the scope of the measures with which they deal. If they traverse a wider sphere, it is very difficult for the Chair to deny to other honourable members the same degree of liberty; and I do not propose to do so. I should like to be supplied with a copy of the Minisperly, that the Lyons Government imter's second-reading speeches in respect posed a wool tax in 1936. That action to the measures now before the Chair. was probably taken at the request, and strictly to the subject-matters of the the rate of 2s. a. bale, Is. a fadge and respective bills. will have to be dealt with separately in reason for the imposition of that tax was committee.

The Minister for Comin his second-reading speech on the main bill pointed out quite properly, ( Mr Eric J. that the Wool (Contributory Charge Bill (No. 1) and the Wool (Contributory Charge) Bill (No. 2) are complementary to the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill. <Such a variety of definitions has arisen in respect of contributory charges, assessments and and Agriculture ( Mr wool tax under these measures that they involve thorough consideration on the part of honourable members who wish to state with clarity the issues to which they give rise. The Minister has stated that the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill 1951 is one of three bills, the purpose of which is to grant exemption to certain classes of wools from the contributory charge that is now being used to collect moneys for wool use promotion. This bill proposes to amend the Wool 1945-1950 in order to exempt from the contributory charge manufactured wool, including wool tops, wool noils, wool waste, skin wool, wool on the skin, or dead wool. I gather, from the Minister's second-reading speech, that the reason why he desires to exempt those particular kinds of wool, or wools in the process of manufacture, from the operation of the contributory charge is that the Wool Tax Act 1945 is applicable only to shorn wool, and the Government wishes to ensure that pending the re-introduction of the wool tax, no wools which have been exempt from that impost will pay the contributory charge. That policy is in contrast to the situation which has operated under the Joint Organization, or its Australian subsidiary, the Australian Wool Realization Commission. The Minister pointed out, very prowith the consent of, the graziers' orga4d. a bag on all wools which were dethat, in those days, the Australian wool",29,Mcewen

That charge was levied under the Wool Tax .Act 1936, and the wool-growers of Australia, not withstanding their serious economic plight at that time, contributed is being undertaken by the Commonannually to an amount of approximately £300,000. of tax? Is. a fadge and 4d. a bag. The wool industry and the national economy benefited greatly from the expenditure of the money that was collected from that wool tax from 1.936 until 1945. The Wool Publicity Board, which was a most capable authority, expended that money wisely and well. Indeed, its work proved so beneficial that when the Joint Organization was established, the Curtin Labour Government decided to continue the levy of 2s. a bale on wool-growers, but resolved, in the interests of convenience, to adopt a different method of raising it. The money, instead of being collected through the medium of the Wool Tax Act 1936, was to be obtained as part of the contributory charge which was levied under the Wool Realization Act 1945 that established the Australian Wool vernment to assist the wool industry. My Realization Commission. was imposed for the purpose of financing the administration of that body, and its associated senior partner, the Jpint Organization. That charge was varied from time to time. The original rate was 5 per cent, on the value monwealth in the sale of skin wools, of the clip of each grower, and from the proceeds there was set aside an amount equivalent to that which would have been raised under the Wool Tax Act 1936 at the rate of 2s. a bale. But almost simulceeds of its operations as the handling taneously, a decision was made by the Curtin Labour Government to provide, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, an amount equivalent to the money which was collected from the contributory charge. In other words, the Commonwealth began to provide 2s. a bale for every 2s. that was collected from the wool-growers. A proportion of that money was allocated to the Wool Use Promotion Fund and the Wool Publicity and Research Fund. I am happy to say that such moneys are expended wisely and well, and the results are proving of immense benefit to the wool growers of Australia. When I make that statement, I refer to the operations of the Australian Wool Board, and the research work in the wool industry that wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, with money provided from the Wool Publicity and Research Fund. I sincerely hope that such good work will be continued, because Australia cannot afford to slip back into a minor place in the production of wool for the people of the world. Although wool-growers are enjoying conditions of great prosperity to-day, the Commonwealth proposes to continue to provide from the Consolidated Revenue Fund an amount of 2s. a bale for every 2s. that is subscribed by the wool-growers. Such moneys will be used to aid wool-growers, to assist, indirectly, the economy of this great Commonwealth. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, made an historical survey of taxes that have been levied on wool for the purpose of promoting its use, and for research, and, therefore, I hope that I shall be permitted to mention further action that was taken by the Ourtin Labour GoThis tax remarks refer to the position in 1946, before the operation of the Joint Organization and the Australian Wool Realization Commission. The Central Wool Committee, as a result of its trading and acting as an agent for the Comand as the collector of drawback of subsidy on wools that were exported, accumulated £7,000,000.

When some of the cloth was exported, surely the Australian Government was entitled to recover the subsidy that it had paid only on the understanding that the manufactured wool would be sold and used in Australia. The sum of £7,000,000 was placed in a fund under the terms of the Wool Industry Fund Act 1946. The act specifically provided that the money should be used for any or all of the following express purposes :Wool research. Application of the results of research. Wool use promotion. Regulation of marketing. Stabilization of the price of wool in order ing schools and other institutions for to give temporary relief to the industry. which plans were prepared long ago. Discharge of any losses ultimately sustained under the wool disposals plan. Fortunately, no financial loss was sustained under the wool disposals plan and the growers to-day are happy in the knowledge that they have the f u l l amount of £7,000,000 intact for use in any or all of the other purposes that I have mentioned. The money remains the property of the industry at all times. Had the scheme that was sponsored by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for the continuance of a form of joint organization control been approved by the growers, a portion of the nest-egg could have been used as backing for a reserve price scheme. That was even suggested by some of the growers' organizations. In the circumstances, I am glad that the Minister has set aside the money to be used solely for the welfare of the industry. When the 1.946 legislation was debated in this House, the Minister and other honourable members who were then in Opposition were extremely critical of its provisions. member has been sitting on the Government side of the chamber for two years now, but neither he nor the Minister has member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) is made any move during that period to "" anti-everythingexcept in drought have any part of the sum of £7,000,000 years or at other times when the primary distributed directly to the growers. His present inactivity is an acknowledgment that his former criticism was misguided, and I am prepared to prophesy that the Minister will not make any direct distribution to the growers from the fund. Wisely, in the light of his present responsibilities, he will ensure that the money will be retained in the fund to be used on a rainy day or, alternatively, to supplement the 4s. charge for each bale of wool that will be levied equally upon the growers and the Consolidated Revenue for the purposes of promoting the use of wool and offinancingscientific research.

The Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill is the kernel of the scheme. The other two measures are complementary. In addition to providing for the lifting of the tax on wool noils, tops and so forth, the three measures provide for the elimination, of the 7 i per cent, contributory charge that was levied in anticipation of ratification by the growers of the Government's wool stabilization plan. I supported that plan, although it was prepared*by an anti-Labour Government. Notwithstandinsr our efforts to convince the growers of its virtues, they would have nothing to do with the scheme and rejected it by a very substantial majority. In New South Wales, for instance, 27,000 votes were cast against the scheme and only 3,400 were cast in support of it. Apparently even my recommendations did not cut any ice with the growers.",31,Mcewen

In normal periods, he prefers to risk the hazards of the markets and opposes even the schemes that are sponsored by the primary producers. I have heard him campaigning against measures that have been recommended by substantial majority votes of primary producers' organizations. The honourable member is always out on a limb. He is a typical "" agin' the Government"" man, and no doubt he helped to defeat the excellent stabilization scheme that was sponsored by the Government that he professes to support. His presence on the Government side of the chamber is extraordinary. I do not know why he sits there. He should have a seat in the central gangway so that, he could fall into either political camp as the occasion suited. Because the Government's plan was rejected by the growers, it became necessary to introduce these three bills in order to cancel the contributory charge that was intended to finance the stabilization plan and in order to authorize the continuation of a levy, which will be known as a contributory charge, in place of the former wool tax. The authorities that will be charged with the expenditure of the money are highly efficient, as I know from my own observation. It is essential that their good work shall be continued and, because an amount equal to the growers' contribution will be drawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, I support the bills whole-heartedly. My only regret is that the wool-growers had so little confidence in the plan that was submitted to them by the Minister that they kicked it ignominiously out the door, and for that act received the blessings of the honourable member for Riverina. For the sake of the wool industry, I hope that the honourable gentleman will never have cause to regret his campaign against the stabilization plan. I have only a few observations to make in connection with the three bills that the House is now considering. Because of tbe timely absence from the chamber of tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), and in the hope that honourable members who are present will not betray me to him, I make the comment, for my own satisfaction, that these measures will return us to the status quo ante as it was in 1936. Honourable members no doubt recall that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has expressed his intense dislike of Latin tags and phrases. I hope I may be pardoned for having used that phrase, because it applies aptly to the three bills. In 1936, it was found necessary in the interests of the wool industry, if for no other reason, to establish a fund in order to promote the use of wool. At that time, the industry was said to be threatened by synthetics and all sorts of other dubious materials that were on the market. In fact, some of our best-informed economists imagined, or so I conclude from the vagaries of their deductions, that the end of the wool industry was in sight and that never again would it be a profitable industry. They prophesied that synthetics would obliterate it and said that the time had arrived to dispose of the whole of the Australian wool flock. Largely for the purpose of retrieving that situation, a wool tax was imposed in order to provide a fund with which to promote the use of wool in the best possible way and on the widest possible scale. [Quorum formed.'] These three bills provide for a return to the state of affairs that existed, for all practical purposes, in 1936 when the wool tax was introduced. In 1939, when war broke out and it was found necessary to acquire wool in the interests of Australia and its allies, an organization was appointed to dispose of wool in a way that would provide a remunerative price for the producers. That acquisition scheme operated satisfactorily throughout the period of the war. At the termination of hostilities, of course, some other plan had to be introduced because, under the acquisition scheme, arrangements had been made to buy in quantities of wool if and when the market price fell below the reserve price. Because of that arrangement, when the scheme was terminated an accumulation of wool remained in possession of the organization at that time. A complementary organization had to be established not only to deal with current wool clips from year to year, but also to dispose of that huge accumulation",32,Mcewen
104,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [4.25],"of wool which, if I remember aright, totalled about 10,000,000 bales. then Prime Minister and Government believed that it would take from fourteen to twenty years to dispose of that accumulated wool by a means that would not prejudice the market. It was found necessary in 1949, therefore, to alter the wool tax provisions to provide for a contributory charge that would, to a degree, meet any losses that might be incurred incidental to the subsequent disposal of that accumulated wool through the wool disposals plan. Fortunately, no losses occurred, and it did not take the expected length of time to dispose of the accumulated wool. The contributory charge was therefore unnecessary for the purposes for which it had been levied, and that fact was entirely due to the favorable circumstances of the wool industry. In 1950, after two years of negotiations Government, faithful to its undertaking with the previous Government, wool growers expressed through their State organizations, and later their federal organizations, the desire that the general arrangements that had covered the industry right from the acquisition period in 1939 up to 1949 be continued. They could not be continued under the acquisition system, because the acquisition powers of the Government are restricted by the Constitution and could not operate for any sound reason, after the accumulated stockpile of wool had been disposed of. So the growers asked the Chifley Government for a wool reserve price scheme. Tentative proposals were submitted by the State growers' organizations and by the two growers' federations, and the proposals were amalgamated. The federations then produced a proposal for a wool reserve price scheme that they believed to be the best that had ever been submitted to any gorernment. They then asked the Chifley Government for legislation that would, : .n the first place, allow the growers to *ote on a proposal of this kind, and, in 'he second place, put a wool reserve price -schamie into operation in the event of a favorable vote being recorded. t was privileged to take part in the stration of socialization by stealth that negotiations at that time, and I vividly had been given by the Chifley Governrecall »od.y of public opinion in favour of to the wool industry. ;he'wool reserve price scheme, there was Mr Rcberl.011. an even greater body of public opinion The that believed that there should be no such scheme unless the growers were first consulted and allowed to express their opinions in a ballot. When the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was speaking he forgot to mention that both he and the Chifley Government, of which he was a member, were opposed to the holding of a ballot. They believed that, the growers* State organizations having expressed a majority decision of their members to the federations, and the federations having expressed a majority opinion to the Government, all that was necessary was to bring down legislation to inaugurate a. wool reserve price scheme. That was the .position in 1949, but the Government was changed at the end of that year. The new to the democratic people of this country, immediately assured the wool-growers that no wool reserve price scheme would be introduced without the growers having been consulted and without a ballot of the growers having been held. The primary producers, including the woolrgrowers, had had bitter experience of schemes of this kind before, when the honourable member for Lalor was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the Chifley Government. As a direct result of that experience, public opinion became hostile to the proposition for a wool reserve price scheme, and the wool growers finally rejected the proposal. I venture to say that had any government other than a socialist government been in office, and had any Minister other than the honourable member for Lalor been in charge of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture at the time, the experience of the years under acquisition and of the years during which the accumulated stockpile was being disposed of, would have been entirely different and the consensus of opinion that favoured a wool reserve price scheme of some description would have remained constant. That it did not remain constant was due to the wretched demonthat whereas there was a ment in relation to other industries allied I refer 'particularly to the wheat indusorganizations affiliated with them. It is try. The people engaged in any industry who would wilfully subject themselves to the indignities that were thrust on the wheat industry could be considered wholly irresponsible. So no matter how perfect, in general terms, a reserve price scheme might be., and no matter how faithfully the present Minister for Commerce and his undertaking to the wool-growers' federations in the first place, to the State organizations in the second place, and subsequently to the community as a whole, it was inevitable that the scheme would be rejected. Because the present Minister wished to discharge the Government's undertaking to the people in full, he carried out the promise that had been given that a wool reserve price scheme would be considered by the Government and that its terms would be submitted to the growers themselves for either approval or rejection. Subsequently the wool reserve price scheme was rejected by the growers, and in consequence of that rejection the contributory charge of I i per cent, that had been levied to provide capital for the scheme, became redundant, and the amount so collected must now be refunded toits rightful owners. SoI come back to my original point that these three bills, for all practical purposes, restore us to the position as it existed in 1936. They will abolish the contributory charge that was levied in order to provide capital for the operation of tbe scheme. I take this opportunity to express my satisfaction that this point has been reached and that the accumulated stock-pile of wool has been disposed of in a way that has been profitable not only to the wool-growers and to our economy, but also to the economy of the countries that have bought the wool. I am also glad that the industry has been restored to its normal production level. With all respect to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I must, also express my personal satisfaction that the wool reserve price scheme was defeated. I did not have any faith in it, because I have an intimate knowledge of the growers' federations, having been a member of them ever since their inception, and having had 30 years day to day personal experience of the producers' competent for such organizations to make certain decisions and it is just as competent for them to change their minds. They changed their minds in this instance because of the bitter experiences that the producers had had when the previous administration attempted to socialize all our major industries by stealth. As a result of that experience the growers took the first available opportunity to register a protest against such a policy, and so rejected the wool reserve price scheme. I hope that the wool industry will he allowed to remain free and unfettered by circumstances, and untrammelled by politics. I agree entirely with the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) in relation to the inadequacy, of the 2s. a bale levy for wool research, because I consider that the amount that we expend in Australia on wool research is pitifully insufficient. In 1945, the 2s. a bale levy produced about £300,000 at a time when the price we were receiving for wool was loid . per lb. To-day we are receiving ten times that price for wool, but are still levying the same amount a bale for research. Last year we expended £336,000 through the Australian Wool Board and an equivalent amount through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization on wool research, making a total of about £672,000 for research out of a wool cheque of about £636.000,000. I believe that such an amount for research is pitifully inadequate, especially when we consider the enormous and growing competition from artificial fibres overseas. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) that the wool industry has nothing to worry about in the future. Nylon, rayon, orlon and various other artificial fibres are increasingly apnearing in the American market. The Du Pont interests have spent more than 30,000,000 dollars in putting nylon alone on the market, and another 70,000,000 dollars in research on, and publicity for, that product. They aim at doubling in about three years the quantity of nylon that they are putting on the market. I consider that we need",33,Mcewen

A glance at the relevant figures will show that the production of those substitutes is increasing at an enormous rate. There is an enormous volume of research, publicity and promotion work to be done in the industry. I believe that the makes it necessary that a certain amount Australian Wool Board is doing an excelof legislation be drafted in order lent, job,, but how can it carry on with these very limited funds?

How can that research be continued on this ludicrously small amount? In 1950 the board operated at a loss and its adminisobserved that when there is plenty of tration cost £25,000 more in 1950 than it cost in 1949.

I ask the Minister to approach wool-growers' organizations with a view to obtaining the Riverina( Mr Roberton) I have some assistance of the industry to increase the amount made available to the Australian Wool Board. [4.47] -This bill has been introduced for the specific purpose of carrying out a promise that was made to the electorates that are interested in growing wool.

There is a young; physicist in my electorate who is very anxious to. foin the staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, I believe that he would make some contribution in his particular field of knowledge if he coul'd join that organization.

If this amendment, will have the effect of allowing the Public; Service Board to cl'ecid'e whether a man can do his job. satisfactorily, even though he cannot pass a rigid medical test, then it will' serve a useful purpose.

British, will, be impressed by the amazing difference between the steadiness;, the impartialityaauh the incorruptibility of the British civil, service and the civil services of other countries. The Public Service of the Commonwealth is founded upon the British pattern, which is one of the most efficient, ethically correct and' incorruptible civil services that the people of this globe have ; been fortunate enough to. en-joy. A l though in many respects the-work of the Public Service can be criticized"", I ' pay tribute toits impartiality and' incorruptibility. The qualities of our Public Service have not been established' by accident, nor is it of different clay, or inherently more honest than, other services. Oar impartial and' incorruptible Public Service has been developed by the system of selection that we have established. It must be remembered that that system is based primarily on competitive examinations. That means not necessarily that the best candidate offering is selected for service, but. certainly that there is absolute impartiality in the selection of officers. Under such a system-, the government of the day cannot rewar.d' its followers by giving; to them positions in the Public Service. If a government wants to ensure continuity of its policy after it has been forced out of office it cannot do so under our present system because itcannot see that officers of itsown selectionshall be appoiovted. to key positions.

The exemption provisions should not be such as will enable a' government to evade the provisions of legislation that the Parliament has passed and, by so doing, control appointments to, and promotions and salaries in, the Public Service. I ask the Prime Minister( Mr more fully when the bill is in committee. Menzies)-who , I notice, is in charge of the bill-to say what has become of the terrors to which, he assured us, we should be subjected as a result of the activities of Communists. It is true that, as a result of the vote of the people at the last ' referendum, the Government has been deprived of an opportunity to secure the passage of legislation that it desires to place upon the statute-book of this country. But the Commonwealth has complete authority over the Public: Service. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Parliament is entitled to insert in legislation that it passes any provision in relation to the employment in the Public Service of subversive persons, whether they be Communists or members of other organizations. ""When1 have queried some appointments that have been made, even by this Government, I have been told that the Public Service Board is bound by the provisions of a statute in determining whether or not persons are fit to be appointed to positions in the Public Service. the board shall judge an applicant's suitability on the basis of certain standards. Very rightly, the board has said that it can act only in conformity with the provisions of that legislation and, therefore, cannot take into account the political leauings of an individual. It cannot take into account the fact that he is a member of the Communist party, even though he might be appointed to a position in which he would be able to endanger the security of this country. I ask the Prime Minister why in this and other institutions, and will know what, bill the Government has not gone as far is required of them. There is nothing as its constitutional power over its sinister in this proposal. servants would permit it to go. If nothing in that regard has been done in this hill, and it would appear that it has Yarra, in dealing with the competitive not been done, I suggest to the Prime Minister that consideration be given to the matter before the bill is sent to the Senate, or at any rate when the legislation that has been foreshadowed is under consideration. I hope that, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) promised in his second-reading speech, the right honourable gentleman will explain the clauses The fact that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is in charge of this bill, quite apart from the fact that the Public Service is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Department, is an indication of the significance that we should attach to it. This is one of the most important measures that has come before the House during this sessional period because, as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) has said, it goes to the very roots of the integrity of the Public Service. The machinery that we devise to control the Public Service is a measure of the efficiency of the Public Service and also of the system of government as a whole. I suggest to the honourable member for Yarra that there is nothing sinister in the proposal that alterations of the conditions and subjects in relation to examinations shall no longer be made by regulation. I have had considerable experience of such matters. There is something to be said in favour of specifying conditions and subjects in The statute provides that regulations, but the manner in which examination subjects and conditions change make it desirable that there shall be a flexible method of dealing with such matters. I believe that the method of notifying alterations in the Gazette will provide ample safeguards and also will enable people concerned with examinations to know what is required of them. I do not think that anything will be done in a hole-andcorner manner. People who wish to take examinations, whether for entry to the Public Service or for promotion in it, will be in touch with schools, colleges I think that the honourable member for",40,Harrison

The competitive system can take many forms, one of which is the written examination. There may he competitive interviews. The honourable gentleman knows that very frequently a written examination is supplemented by another form of examination that is as competitive as the written examination. I have had experience of both methods. It has been my privilege to assist the Commonwealth in the selection of university graduates for positions in the Public Service. I assure the honourable gentleman that in the selection of those graduates there has been competition. graduates who wish to enter the Public Service is not always so large as to make the competition as real as one would like it to be, but competitive interyears reveals that the board itself views and the scrutiny of applicants' qualifications, especially qualifications of the kind that university graduates are expected to possess, does introduce a measure of competition. Appointments are not made in a hole-and-corner manner. From my own experience, I am quite convinced that the methods that have been adopted have ensured the integrity of the Public Service and the selection of graduates of a good type.

As far as I can see, this measure abuses of that provision. Exemptions will enhance the authority of the Public of this kind are necessary if we want Service Board. That tendency is inevitan efficient, or at any rate an elastic, able. If we establish an institution to method of recruiting for the Public Sercontrol a section of government, we must vice. I do not think that any difficulties mist that institution, but the result is will occur as a result of conditions relatthat, more and more, the control of the ing to examinations being published in matters handled by the institution is the Gazette and not in the form of taken from the Parliament. instance, I have always regarded that as being desirable, but there is a stage at which we must review the purposes for Mr liland. which we established the institutions and tering to or detracting from parliamentary government. Although this bill will enhance the authority of the Public Service Board, honourable members will notice that there has been a move in the direction of delegating power to a number of special officers. That process of delegation has gone quite a long way. The kind of delegation of power that has seemed to me to be necessary is in respect of appeals in connection with promotions. Both in the making of promotions and in the hearing of appeals, there is a streamlining of The number of university the provisions of the Public Service Act which seems to me to be highly desirable. An .examination of the reports of the Public Service Board for the last two has dealt with a large number of appeals. It appeared to me that the board, after it had heard appeals, had very little time left in which to do anything else. This bill will make provision for the delegation of power over a wide field. I entirely agree with that provision. There are one or two matters of drafting to which I should like the Prime Minister to direct his attention. There is au illustration, of what I mean on page The competitive In this regulations. If the Public Service Board believes it to be necessary to review the whole of the Public Service Act in the light of developments since 1945, the Prime providing that the third member of the Minister would be fortified in any committee shall be a representative of changes to he made if, in addition to the union of which the appellant is a seeking advice and assistance from the member. board, he sought the advice and assistance of an external authority that could offer lodged, the board is obliged to forward a detached opinion.

In such circumstances, the whole, it is important that we shall board could furnish to the committee a be convinced of the complete integrity of report that was unfavorable to an appelthe Public Service and be assured that lant, who would have no knowledge of the system of organization and administhat having been done.

120,Mr Costa (Banks) [5.30],"The proindefinite periods.Service rights, including seniority, in the event of his being defeated at a subsequent election. [5.35] I support the bill. I should not have participated in this debate but for certain remarks by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) which, I believe, should command not only the attention but also the approval of the House. He suggested that provision should be made with the object of preventing Communists from infiltrating the Public Service. That is an important matter, because, undoubtedly, there is a degree of Communist infiltration of the Service at present. That is apparent in various forms. I do not intend to mention any names, because it is not my intention to make any statement in this House that I am not prepared to make outside it. In this instance, although I have a reasonable character. suspicion it does not warrant my citing any names. The honourable member for Yarra correctly pointed out that at present the Public Service Board and, indeed, any government department or authority, is not in a position to inquire into such matters. In view of the statutory duties with the discharge of which they are entrusted, one could scarcely blame them for not undertaking such inquiries. However, I emphasize the danger of this infiltration. We know that members of the Communist party are Russian agents. They are our enemies and they are working for our downfall. We also know that one of the most effective ways in which the Communist party can operate is for its agents to infiltrate government departments. munists have followed that procedure in other countries. Indeed, it has been the secret of their success in many countries. Is any honourable member so simple minded that he imagines that the Communists are not engaging in a similar process in Australia? Of course, they are; and the Government should take steps to remedy the position. I do not propose at this juncture to examine in detail the steps that might be taken for that purpose. Other countries have taken very drastic steps in that respect. instance, governments of some countries require all their employees to make a declaration that they have not been members of the Communist party or of (Mackellar) any Communist front. The Government might do well to take a similar step in order to meet the problem in this country. Let us not run away with the idea that no danger exists in this respect. Honourable members opposite should be jusl as concerned as are supporters of the Government to solve this problem. Another fact that should concern members of the Opposition just as much as it concerns supporters of the Government is that owing to the degree of Communist infiltration of the Public Service much suspicion has been aroused that is not justified. Activities which, perhaps, are described as militant may in many repects be innocent and non-Communist in Consequently, there is a danger of confusion arising in the publicmind in this matter. However, as things stand, and in view of the degree to which Communists have infiltrated the Public .Service, we have no means now of clearing the innocent except by convicting the guilty. It should be the concern of honourable members opposite, perhaps even more than of supporters of the Government, that action shall be taken along those lines. The principle that the honourable member for Yarra enunciated, and that I support, is of such importance that it should not be implemented under this measure, which is merely of a machinery character. I should be prepared to support by my vote in this House the introduction, after due and proper consideraThe Comtion, of a measure designed not only to prevent the recruitment of Communists for the Public Service but also to expel Communists already in the Service. I believe that when such action is taken-the honourable member for Yarra correctly said that the Commonwealth has such power under the Constitution in spite of the unfortunate result of the recent referendum-it will be effective. It must be the responsibility of the Government to take such action: and it should be effective in that, first, it will convict the guilty; and, For secondly, it will not harm the innocent.",43,Harrison
121,Mr Wentworth,"Such action, will require the utmost cooperation of all sections of the community.' Many people who voted against the Government's referendum proposal to ban the Communist party salved their reputations, if not their consciences, by claiming that they were opposed to the Communists but that the Government should deal with the Communists in some other way. Those members of the Opposition-perhap s all of them-wh o are willing to stand by their word can reveal themselves as anti-Communists by cooperating with Government supporters in dealing effectively with at least Comtnunists who are members of the Public Service. Honourable members opposite will be judged by their deeds in this respect. This is not a matter that can be dealt with lightly. It is one in respect of which effective action can be best assured by co-operation between members of the Government parties and of the Opposition. Mr BB.YSON (Wills) [5.43] -The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr have had an opportunity to study the Wentworth) appears to be suffering from a Communist phobia. He has spoken about the infiltration of the Public Service by Communists. As other individuals naturally do, Communists accept jobs wherever they happen to be available. Indeed, in some instances training in tbe Public Service is partly responsible for the making of Communists. I remind the honourable member that apart altogether from the rejection of the Government's recent referendum proposals, the Public Service Board possesses power to deal effectively with any Communist who is a member of the Public Service and who acts in a manner that is detrimental to the good government of Australia. The honourable gentleman, if he will examine the provisions of the act, will find that the Government, or the Public Service Board, may take action against a Communist, who is employed in the. Public Service and is considered a danger to tbe peace, order and good government of Australia. When such artion is not taken against a suspected Communist, speeches of a general kind about communism do not get us very far. The honourable member for Mackellar, if he knows that a public servant is acting in the manner he has suggested, should bring the matter to the notice of the proper authorities, and action should be taken against such a person under the Public Service Act. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) in his second-reading speech, indicated that a . complete review of the Public Service Act will be made at some future time, and that a consolidation bill will be introduced which will embody the original act and the numerous amendments that have been made to it in the . interim. I consider that such action is essential. The act has not been thoroughly reviewed since 1922, and, in the intervening years, many amendments of various kinds have been passed by the Parliament. As a result of such _ piecemeal methods, the act is becoming exceptionally difficult to understand, and to administer. The Vice President of the Executive Council has stated that the amendments proposed in this bill are necessary and urgent. I majority of them, and I do not object to them, although the reason why some of them are required is not clear to me. The time is overdue for a definite step to be taken in respect of exempt officers and employees in the Public Service. Such persons include temporary and casual employees -As the numerical strength of the Public Service has increased over the years, and doubtless will continue to increase as the Commonwealth progresses, the number of exempt temporary and casual employees is growing at a much greater rate than should be the case. The Public Service is a permanent organization,-and the first objective of the Public Service Board, acting under the direction of the government of the day, should be to ensure that as many permanent positions as is possible shall be filled by permanent officers who are prepared to make the Public Service their career. Such men will produce a much more efficient public service than has been known in the past, and is known at the present time. The Estimates of expenditure, which were considered a few weeks ago by tbe Committee of Supply, disclosed that at least 50 per cent, of the officers in the various departments are employed in only a temporary capacity. In only a few departments are the majority of the officers permanent public servants. I realize that a new department, such as the Department of National Development, must engage, at its inception., a large number of temporary employees, but such a condition does not apply in long established departments such as the Department of Trade and Customs, Department, the Department of the Interior and the Attorney-General's Department. The employment of so many temporary and casual officers in the Public Service is, iai my opinion,, evidence that the Service is not being efficiently administered. General's Department,, the turnover of employees,, as temporary officers, is greater at present than has been the case at and other period since federation. Consequently, the efficiency of the Postal Department is gradually but surely becoming impaired. I consider that th>3 efficiency of that department to-day is as l.o.vs as, or even, lower than, it has been foj: many years. The explanation for such a condition of affairs is that steps have not beentaken torecruit permanent officers for the Postmaster-General's Department. Action should be taken immediately to posals. I"" find it necessary to remind recruit permanent staffs for departments the Prime Minister of that promisethat have been in existence for many because, after several Ministers had years.

I am eager to see a much greater number of classified positions filled by permanent officers tban is the case ; to-day. That matter should receive the urgent consideration' of the Government. I welcome quite a number of the proposed amendments. The provision in respect of furlough is satisfactory, and the the' Postmaster-General's amendment to section 84 of the principal act in relation to the permanent appointment of returned soldiers is a step in the right direction, but the Public Service Act itself should be brought up to date. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the original' act has been amended! at least once a year in the last 2S years; In the Postmastersometimes, it has been amended twoor three times a year. The act, and the numerous amendments to it, should be consolidated without delay. Earlier, I stated that the reasons, for some of the proposed amendments are not clear. I remind the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies)' that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in his second reading speech, stated' that a. full explanation of all' the amendments would' be given in committee.

122,Mr Speaker,"Order. ! The honor[5.56] I wish to refer briefly to a section of the Public Service that may have been overlooked in this debate. The honourable member for Wills( Mr moderate positions in private enterprise. Bryson) has directed attention to the large number of public servants who are temporary officers. For a considerable time, I have been receiving representations on behalf of persons who have been working in the Public Service in a temporary capacity for a number of years. They have given great satisfaction to their departmental heads, but, because they lack the necessary qualifications, they have not been given the status of permanent officers. Doubtless, many honourable members consider that the Public Service should consist of persons who have passed a specific examination, or who possess special qualifications that justify their appointment. I understand that a person who seeks appointment to a permanent position in the Public Service must have passed the leaving certificate -examination, although that condition is waived in respect of ex-servicemen, who are required to possess the intermediate certificate. I make a plea on behalf of persons who hare filled positions in the Public Service such is desirable. The purpose of another satisfactorily for a number of years, but are not eligible for permanent appointment because they have not passed the leaving certificate examination or do not possess special qualifications. The Government should ensure that such persons shall be given a. fair deal without delay. I have been obliged to advise quite a number of men to leave their positions in the Public Service while they have -opportunities to obtain satisfactory positions with private enterprise because, as temporary public servants, they do not know from week to week whether the.ir services will be retained. A man who has filled a temporary position in the Public Service satisfactorily for a few years should be given the status of a permanent officer. I know perfectly well that a man who does not possess suitable qualifications -cannot be appointed to .a high position, -and I am not referring to such a class of person. However, I know that many of the most brilliant men in the professions barely "" scraped "" through their examinations, while other men, who gained high marks in examinations, occupy only I make that plea on behalf of the considerable number of men who have informed me that they have been penalized in the Public Service because they have not gained the leaving certificate or do not possess special qualifications. They are quite capable of filling many positions in the Public Service as permanent officers, but, unfortunately, they have been pushed aside. Minister) [5.58] in reply Several matters, particularly those raised by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), deserve consideration. Some honourable members have suggested that -the Public Service Act is in need of review. I inform them that the Government has that matter in hand. Two other points that have been mentioned indicate that some honourable gentlemen are under a misapprehension. The proposal in relation to the promotions appeal committees is merely to increase their number in order to facilitate procedure. I am sure that every one will agree that amendment is to relieve the Executive Council of an intolerable volume of paper work, purely formal business, and technical matters of detail. In truth, much of that work has not been done, and I think that the purpose of this amendment is to put regular what has frequently been irregular. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The effect of this amendment is simply to alter the date of the commencement of the provisions from the 1st January, 1952, to the 1st January, 1951. The Government indicated earlier in this year that it proposed to make an alteration in respect of furlough. Because of circumstances beyond the control of the Government, the necessary legislation, which includes clause 15 of this bill, and the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Bill 1951, was not introduced earlier, and in the light of that promise it would be unfair to employees who retire or have retired during this year, if they were deprived of that benefit. Under this amendment, the provision is to be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st January, 195.1, and, therefore, the whole of this calendar year will be covered. Amendment agreed to.

Sitting suspended from 6.3 to 8 p.m. Debate resumed from, the 16th November (vide page 2241), on motion by That the bill he now read a second time. Opposition approves of this measure because, as the second-reading speech made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) on behalf of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) stated, it provides' for the correction of an anomaly in relation to furlough for employees of the Public Service. Briefly, the problem has been that those employees they had rendered service for twenty years, found that they were inhibited by an arrangement that credited additional furlough only in respect of every completed period of five years. Thus, a man who had served for, say, 24 years, was granted no more leave than accrued to a man who had served for only twenty years. The Opposition approves heartily of the removal of this anomaly. Several of its members wish to discuss other anomalies individually but, as a party, it supports the bill. of the amendments to tbe Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act for which the bill provides. However, the act contains other weaknesses that may cause injustices, and, with a view to avoiding them, I ask the Government to give consideration to my representations. At present, the act merely provides that an employee may be granted furlough if he has complied with the conditions that are specified in it, not that he must be granted furlough. I believe that furlough should be granted as an unqualified right. As the act stands, a man who has given loyal and efficient service for twenty years may, if he happens to make a slight slip, be deprived of furlough. He should have an absolute right to it, and I ask that the act be so amended that it will achieve that purpose. I point out that furlough accrues only after an employee has rendered twenty legislation of at least one of the States provides that benefits shall become due after ten years of service. Incentives are very important in these days and that is a non-financial incentive that might well be extended to employees of our Public Service with good results. The period of leave to which an employee is entitled after twenty years of service is six months. Some employees take advantage of that leave to rest and re-invigorate themselves, but many others use it for another purpose. They allow furlough to accrue until they retire and then draw an equivalent lump sum in cash in lieu of leave. By this means they are enabled to complete such projects as the building of a house, for",47,Harrison

128,Mr Costa (Banks) [8.1],"I approveinstance. I remind the House of the fact that many employees of the Public Service give more than 40 years of service. In fact I have known of cases in which the total period of continuous service has exceeded 50 years. However, furlough rights do not accumulate beyond a period, of 40 years. The act should be liberalized in order to allow a mau who has given 50 years of service or more to be credited with additional furlough for the extra period of loyal and efficient Overseas Telecommunications Commisservice beyond 40 years. I hope that the Government will heed my comments and later take action to give effect to my suggestions. heartedly support the bill; but, like the honourable member for Banks( Mr provide for their interests, but I cannot Costa)., I consider that the Government should make the grant of furlough to an employee after twenty years of service mandatory rather than permissive. The fact that an employee has been engaged continuously for a period of twenty years indicates that he has been efficient and loyal. obliged to pass any sort of test to deterThe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) may mine his eligibility for furlough. I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to consider an amendment of the act that will ensure that every employee of the Public Service who completes a period of twenty years in that capacity shall be entitled to six months leave as a right instead of as a privilege. This bill relates to temporary employees of the Public Service, and the House has already dealt with another measure that relates to furlough for Public Service officers. Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, no provision has been made for officers and employees of government instrumentalities, such as the Commonwealth Bank, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. I ask the Prime Minister to inform the House whether all such officers and employees will be covered by nrovisions similar to those that we are considering now. They are entitled to furlough. I have in mind particularly the officers of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission who, I understand, have made representations to the Government on this subject. I sincerely trust that they will not suffer from any discriminatory treatment. They should be placed on the same footing as Public Service officers and employees. [8.10] -Most of the points in relation to furlough that I have in mind have been discussed by the honourable members who have already spoken in this debate. Therefore, I shall be brief. I should like to obtain information about the situation of officers and employees of the sion, who were mentioned by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson). Such officers are not dealt with either in this bill or in the bill that we have already debated. The Government may intend to introduce a third measure to let this opportunity pass without speaking on their behalf lest their interests should be overlooked. Representations have been made to me from time to time on behalf of persons employed by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, who were originally employed by Therefore, he should not he the Postmaster-General's Department. be aware of their circumstances. They were induced by superior officers and others in the Postal Department to leave that organization and continue their work as employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. After having served that body for a considerable time, they again became public servants as employees of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission while continuing to do the same class of work. As a result of those changes, they may he deemed not to have given continuous service for the purpose of calculating their eligibility for furlough. They fear that such an injustice will be done to them. The Government may have this matter in mind, but the officers concerned have not yet had any response to the representations that they have made on the subject. I hope that they will not be treated unfairly and I ask the Prime Minister to tell the House whether another bill to deal with these persons will he introduced at a later stage. A great deal of anxiety will be allayed if he will give an assurance on this point. I appreciate the provisions of the hill as it stands, and I am sure that those employees of",48,Employees Years Of Continuous Service The Furlough
129,Mr Bryson (Wills) [8.5],I whole,49,Employees Years Of Continuous Service The Furlough
130,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"the Public Service who will be affected by it will be pleased with its terms. has the approval of the Opposition because it will enable various employees of the Public Service who complete more than twenty years of service before their retirement to obtain extra periods ot furlough to which otherwise they would not be entitled. This Government, of course, is pledged to the denationalization, desocialization, or whatever else it may be termed, of government undertakings. It has had no more success with this aspect of its policy than it has had with any other project since it has been in office, but we must not ignore its intentions. Notwithstanding its decision in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines, which was announced to-day, pressure will be brought to bear upon it to dissolve that organization in due course and to allow private enterprise to monopolize the field of civil aviation. Therefore, we may assume that, when a suitable opportunity occurs and the pressure is severe enough, the Government will yield. The employees of this important undertaking, and of similar instrumentalities that the Government is pledged to denationalize if and when the occasion arises and sufficient members of the Cabinet summon up enough courage to defy public opinion, should be protected. Provision should be made to make payments to such persons in lieu of furlough should they be forced willy-nilly to accept employment under private enterprise. It. would be most unjust to deprive them of anv furlough rights if the organization that employed them were sold to private enterprise. An employee who had served for all but three months, one month, or even one day of the qualifying period for furlough might be forced, to forgo his right through no fault of his own. I consider that since the Government's policy is to sell national enterprises to private enterprise and to re-establish the private entrepreneur in those fields from which Government undertakings have ejected him at the moment, in justice to such employees the Government should insert a provision in the legislation, when it reaches the Senate, whereby employees of government undertakings who must transfer to private enterprise in order to retain their jobs, shall be paid in full up to the day of the transfer, in lieu of the furlough to which they are entitled. That is only fair and reasonable and I ask the Prime Minister to have such a provision inserted in the bill. Minister) [8.17] -in replyI am completely unmoved by the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) and, I must say, singularly little moved by the remarks of the two honourable members who preceded him. It is marvellous with what energy honourable members opposite spring to the charge iu relation to matters to which they might have attended during their own period of office. The fact is that this is a bill to amend the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act. The principal act was passed in 1943, when honourable members opposite, or at any rate some of them, were in office. At that time, of course, they did not have the benefit of the support of the present honourable member for Yarra but they had the benefit of the support of another very distinguished right honourable member for Yarra. They brought in a bill for an act in relation to Commonwealth employees' furlough, and the interesting thing about the matter is that if they will give themselves the trouble of studying that act they will find that it provides that where the period of service of a Commonwealth employee is at least twenty years, the approving authority may grant him leave of absence. We have repeated in this bill tbe very words that were used in the'act. But apparently, although they were admirable and appropriate words in 1943 when honourable members opposite were in office, they are most objectionable words in 1951 when they are out of office. Mr Bryson interjecting, able member for Wills( Mr Bryson) has already spoken in the debate. uses the words. ber for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) was a member of this House at that time, but",49,Employees Years Of Continuous Service The Furlough

Of course he did not, because the Grovemment that he supported knew that if the word "" shall"" had been used it would have found itself at the very instant relation to postal employees who were at which the qualifying period terminated, called upon to provide furlough to the employees concerned. It is not always administratively convenient to do so. So the Prime Minister and government of the clay very sensibly worded the act to say that furlough "" may "" be provided. Everybody knows that that does not mean that an employee can be arbitrarily denied furlough. That has never been the case. It merely means that there is a certain degree of sensible discretion about when furlough will be granted. Mr J.

Of course, the whole argument about the words "" may"" and "" shall "" is as bid as the hills and is about as pointless as ""an old hill, because it has been going on, if I may say so, since before the first edition of May was published. for lawyers, too. I remember correctly, the honourable member also has produced some beanfeasts for lawyers. I am glad that my memory has not entirely collapsed in relation to this matter. Another point that was raised concerns employees of Amalgamated ""Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Overseas Telecommunications agree that some points in relation to that matter have yet to be worked out. I hope that it will not be said that a government that has produced this amendment-whic h is, by concession, a just amendment, and in respect of which I propose to move a further amendment to make the provisions of the bill operate as from the beginning of this calendar year, so that nobody will be under any disability-is unaware of the problem in transferred to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and then to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. It is a very difficult problem, and I remind the House that it did not emerge for the first time when we came into office, because the Overseas Telecommunications Commission was established by our predecessors. Up to the time that they went out of office they had. not found it possible to solve that problem by amending the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act. On the other hand, we propose to deal with the problem. to know. was no mystery about it. It is not a very easy problem. It is easier to state than it is to resolve.

141,Amendment (By Mr Menzies) Agreed,"TEA IMPORTATION BILL 1951. Debate resumed from tbe 16th November (vide page 2242), on motion by Mr the Board; ERIC J. HARRISONThat the bill be now read a second time. bill seeks to replace the existing control of the importation and distribution of tea in Australia. It is well known, or should be, to both this Parliament and the people, that during the war, and right up to the present time, all tea imported into Australia has been imported under the authority of the Australian Government by virtue of the powers given to it by the Defence (Transitional Provisions) .Vet and the regulations made under that act. Probably the ordinary householder does not realize that every 1 lb. of tea that comes to Australia by virtue of the powers exercised under that act is imported by the Commonwealth and under its authority. Probably householders also do not appreciate the fact that some of that tea has this year been imported at a price of 2s. Sd. per lb., some of it at a price boards that were established. of 4s. per lb., and some at 6s per lb., and that in order to keep down the cost of living the Commonwealth has subsidized the price of all tea to the consuming public to the average amount of 2s. 6d. per lb. That is a very substantia] contribution towards keeping down the cost of living. The subsidy policy was inaugurated by the Chifley Government during the war. The measure seeks to give statutory authority to the Government to import tea, purchase it and release it to distributors under legislative authority which none of us can conceive would be challenged in the High Court in any circumstances. known that the Government is entitled, under the Constitution, to control imports and exports. It is recognized that because of the nature of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act and the regulations that have been made under it, some person interested in the tea trade could challenge the constitutionality of the act and the regulations and possibly succeed in having them declared invalid. In place of the tea controller, who is the existing authority that controls the importation and distribution ol tea, the bill seeks to establish an authority composed of the following:(a) a person who shall be the Chairman ot (b) an officer of the Department of the Treasury; (c) a representative of the tea trade; and (d) the Tea Controller. The person who is to be chairman of the board will be nominated by the Government, and rightly so, and the officer of the Department of the Treasury will, of course, be concerned with reporting to the Treasurer in respect of the cost of the subsidy. I have no doubt that the representative of the tea trade will be a wholesale distributor. I suggest that if the board is intended to be well-balanced, it is lacking in one very important respect. It will have on it no representative of the employees who are engaged in the tea trade. During the period of office of the Curtin and Chifley Governments they were very particular to ensure that representatives of the workers in the particular industries concerned should have a place on practically all the statutory the plaudits of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Robcrton). casm.

The proposed tea authority will collect tea from wherever it can be obtained, and nobody else, except a few specified persons, Therefore, the larger families get the will be able to import tea except with the consent in writing of the Minister.

However, there seems to be much competition on the part of tea distributors to convince the public that their own particular brand is better than all others. the Government buys in bulk in order This intensive advertising adds to the ultimate cost of the tea. The cost of the 54,733,000 lb. of tea that we imported in the year ended the 30th June, 1950, was £11,828,000. The landed cost of the tea was, therefore, about 4s. per lb. The subsidy paid by the Australian Government, according to the budget, was £7,750,000. so that by the time the tea was consumed by the people there had been added to the import cost a further sum of £7,750,000. That sum is nttriburpble to the costs of distrithere should be a trade union representabution from the bulk buying centre to the individual consumers. That indicates that in a modern community such as ours, a most important economic problem is involved in the distribution of goods to individual consumers. Distribution costs are sometimes ignored when Government supporters try to establish that only wages add to costs in this country. The cost of distributing tea amounts to about two-thirds of the initial landed cost. If the cost of tea were not subsidized, the people would have to pay about 7s. per lb. instead of 3s. lOd. per lb. for it. Mr Crean. I agree with the honourable member for Lalor that a subsidy distributes the burden of cost over the people more fairly. The subsidy is raised from the general revenue which is collected from all tax-payers according to their ability to pay. It then benefits people according to the quantity of tea they consume. greater benefit. Many economic lessons can be learnt from the tea industry. Private enterprise has departed, to a large extent, from the tea distributing industry. All There is now a ganging-up by producers to get the maximum prices for their products. It is regarded as good business for the wool producer in Australia to get producer in Ceylon to get the maximum price for his product. That state of Whether or not there is any affairs has to be overcome by constituting That is rational buying, and it should lead to rational selling. 'There does not seem to be much difference between the various brands of tea, and perhaps the Government could investigate the profits made by distributors. If to supply cheaper tea to the people, distributors should not be allowed to make profits out of proportion to the services that they render. All the risks of buying have been removed from the distributors who once did their own buying. They know in advance the price that they will have to pay, and perhaps they should not now be entitled to the same margin of profit that they had in the past when they had to make provision for unforeseen contingencies. To-day they run no risks. Perhaps that is another good reason why tive on the proposed tea. authority. Such a representative would represent not only the employees but also the average consumers. The first function of the tea distributor, that of importing his goods, has now gone. He no longer needs to have a retinue of representatives travelling round the world to arrange for the purchase of his requirements. He is merely a distributing agent and all that he is now doing is putting the tea in various packets and calling it by various names. [9.0] I stall address myself briefly to a matter that I consider to be relevant to the bill, especially as the Minister for Australian tea drinkers, but at no stage Territories ( Mr Hasluck) is in charge of the measure. I suggest that it would be to the advantage of Australia if the Government were fully to explore the possibility of encouraging tea-growing in the territories of the Commonwealth. In a small nursery in the central highlands of New Guinea, I saw 1,000 tea j>lauts that appeared to me to be extremely healthy. I believe that tea-growing in the territories would be of great advantage to this country. Tea produced in the territories would not compete with other Australian primary products, but the expansion of a tea-growing industry there would bring wealth to the natives and others employed in the industry and, by increasing the wealth of the territories, would obviate the constant and ever-increasing drain upon our national revenue that is involved in the discharge of our obligations in respect of the terrihave among its members a representative tories. ""We must decide whether we shail continue to pay a subsidy in respect of tea imported from other countries, or direct our attention to the production ot that commodity in territories that require development. ""While we do not produce any tea in the areas under our control, we shall continue to be held to ransom, as it were, by being compelled to pay a subsidy in respect of imported tea. I suggest to the Minister that my suggestion be considered by himself and his officers. Territories) [9.2] I congratulate the honourable member for Lalor( Mr argument is followed to its logical conPollard) upon a speech that was well suited to this subject. It was a speech that cheered but did not inebriate the House. It is probable that never before in the history of tea-making has so much warm water been poured upon so small a quantity of leaves. The honourable member for Lalor suggested that the membership of the board should be extended to include representation of employees of the tea trade in Australia. I shall make two comments upon that suggestion. First, the functions of the board will be limited to the procurement of tea overseas, its importation into Australia and its sale to wholesalers in Australia. The board will be empowered to do many things that will have a broad appeal to will any body of employees in particular be affected by its operations. I am aware that members of the Storemen's and Packers' Union enjoy their cup of tea as much as does any one else in this country, but they are not the only people in Australia who enjoy drinking tea. The claim that could be made for members of that organization, as tea drinkers, to be represented on the board, could be made with equal force on behalf of bridge players, housewives, and other sections of the community. The second comment that I wish to make upon the suggestion that the membership of the board should be extended is that the previous board, which was established by a Labour government and which exercised precisely the same functions as those which it is proposed shall be exercised by the new board, did not of the employees as such. Broadly speaking, the membership of that board was much the same as that which is proposed for the new board. The argument of the honourable member for Lalor has been refuted by the practice of his own party. The honourable gentleman said that the powers and functions of the Tea Control Board would give to it great power over the tea trade, including power to decide which wholesaler should receive tea. Any such power was possessed by the board which the proposed new board will replace. If the honourable gentleman's clusion, it will be seen that it amounts to a proposition that, although a board appointed by a Labour government can be trusted to act honestly and fairly, aboard appointed by any other government cannot be trusted to do so. I am sure that the honourable gentleman does not seriously believe that to be so.

""We must admit that there is a capacity for honesty on both sides of politics. The final horror of socialism was presented to us by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), who suggested that rationalization of the purchase of tea should be extended to the distribution of tea. The honourable gentleman wants to reduce us to a dread state of uniformity in which every one will have to drink the same kind of tea and will not have a chance of indulging his own taste or fancy. If the full horrors of socialism were ever exposed to the people of Australia, they were exposed in the honourable gentleman's proposition that there should be rationalization of tea disretailers shall do with that tea, and totribution and that every oue should drink exactly the same kind of tea and should have no choice even in regard to the colour of the packet on the grocers' shelves. The suggestion made by the honourable member for New England Drunimond), although not strictly relevant to the bill, is extremely interestanother State decides that another price ing. For some time experiments in the cultivation of tea have been in progress in New Guinea. Seed was imported and this year, for the first time, tea seedlings will be distributed by the Department of Territories in New Guinea for commercial planting, and commercial plantings will take place. Already some honourable members, including myself, have had the -pleasure of drinking tea grown in New Guinea. It is a pleasant and palatable draught. If commercial plantings of tea in New Guinea meet with success, we hope that an expanding tea-growing industry in New Guinea will make a significant contribution to ensuring for Australia constant supplies of tea. I am wondering what will be the price of tea does not deal with the price of tea. The Commonwealth has no power in respect of prices. Speaker, for having told me succinctly what I wanted to know. The board will purchase tea overseas, bring it to Australia and sell it to wholesalers. ""What will happen to the tea when it has been, sold to the wholesalers? It is clear thai the wholesalers will not be allowed to re-export the tea unless they pay a duty upon it, but will the persons who purchase tea from the board be able to dowhat they like with that tea in Australia ? Will they be able to withhold it from the public if they cannot obtain the price that they want for it? I know that the intention is that the Commonwealth 3hall pay a subsidy upon imported tea in order that people throughout Australia may be able to purchase tea at a reasonable price.

171,Mr Thompson,"The honorablethat the States are responsible for prices control, yet he concurs in the criticism of the New South Wales Government by members of his party for allegedly not having discharged its prices control. I do not agree with that criticism. I believe that the New South Wales Government is trying to discharge its responsibilities to the people of New South Wales in the best way in which it can do so and that it would be prepared to ensure that retailers and wholesalers shall make only a certain profit upon tea sold to them by the board. The proposal is that we shall authorize the board to import tea and to sell that tea for less than it has paid for it, but there is nothing in this legislation which provides that the retailers shall sell that tea to the people of this country at the correct price. I realize that this measure is disliked by honourable gentlemen opposite because it makes provision for a form of socialistic control in connection with the importation of tea into this country. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) stated that the bill will remain in force for only one year unless otherwise ordered. I am aware that anti-Labour governments do not like legislation of this type, but, as this Government has gone some way along the path of controlling a commodity on behalf of the people, it should insert in the bill a provision that would enable the board to exercise some control of tea that it has sold to wholesalers and retailers in order to ensure that the tea shall be sold at a proper price. I know that this Government has no power to fix the price of tea, but that objective could be achieved indirectly. Let me use the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement to illustrate my point. The Commonwealth has no power to build houses in the States, but it has said to the States that it will make available money for the construction of houses if the States will agree to comply with certain conditions. There should be a provision in this bill that would give to the board power to control tea after that tea had left its possession. I agree with the honourable member for Lyne that there is an obligation upon the States to ensure that the price of tea shall be fixed. We can only assume that the States will do that, but we have no assurance that they will do it. responsibilities in relation to The Minister for Territories has informed us that a start has been made with the production of tea in the territories. We should do our utmost to produce our own requirements, and I am pleased with what the department has done in that respect. However, until' such plans are brought to fruition, Australian tea consumers will be at the mercy of overseas suppliers. The board will be obliged to pay the world market price. Consequently, the Government should enable the board to ensure that the community shall really reap the benefit of this measure. That could be done under the regulation making power. The Government adopted that principle in respect of the Hospital Benefits Bill which the House passed last evening. It should take similar action in this instance in order to enable the Tea Importation Board to ensure that all tea that is imported shall be sold at a reasonable retail price. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) effectively exposed the inconsistency of supporters of the Government who accept every opportunity to advocate the abolition of all controls and the supremacy of the law of supply and demand. It is interesting to note that the Government, in its efforts to keep down the cost of living and to check inflation, has embodied in this measure the very principles that it has criticized the Labour party for upholding. This measure is socialistic in principle. Consequently, I can understand why so few supporters of the Government have spoken on it. The bill is designed to keep a check on the price of tea. in an indirect way by implementing Labour's policy of providing effective controls over the importation and distribution of essential commodities. Members of the Opposition are proud of the fact that the Government is now emulating the example that Labour Governments have set in that respect. should like to explain for the benefit of the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr",58,Second Reading
172,Mr Treloae (Gwydir) [9.20],"1Thompson) why so few supporters of the Government have spoken on this measure. It is a simple bill and, already, honourable members opposite have delayed its passage unnecessarily. Those honourable members have claimed that the Government has been obliged to introduce the measure because private enterprise has failed in this sphere. It must be obvious that private enterprise would not import tea and retail it at 2s. 6d. per lb. less than the landed cost. As the Government provides a subsidy in order to stabilize the retail price of tea, the responsibility devolves upon it to control its importation and distribution. ment subsidize the retail price of tea? support the principle of price stabilization subsidies because, ultimately, the consumer pays the subsidies indirectly in taxes. The sooner the Government can see its way clear to cease purchasing tea from overseas and to leave that activity entirely to private enterprise, the better will it be for the community. However, for as long as the Government subsidizes the retail price it is bound to arrange for tlie purchase and importation of tea. understand that the primary objects of this measure are to stabilize the importation of tea and, by the provision of a subsidy, to stabilize the retail price of tea. For that purpose it is proposed to set up a board to acquire tea overseas and to control its distribution within Australia. The composition of the board is interesting. It will consist of a chairman-who , I take it, will be an independent person-a n officer of the Department of the Treasury, a representative of the tea trade and the tea controller. However, clause 14 provides that members of the board shall not, except in tbe performance of their duties or with the consent of the Minister, directly or indirectly communicate, or divulge, information that they may acquire in consequence of holding their official positions. That means that the person who is appointed to the board as the representative of the tea trade will not be able to give to the trade any information, or guidance, with respect to matters that relate to the supply and distribution of tea. In addition, he will be the sole person among those directly interested in the tea trade who will be in the "" know "". Thus, he will be placed in a particularly advantageous position. the board he will have access to all inside trade information that he desires to ascertain, and under clause 14 he will have the advantage of not being permitted to divulge such information to any one else who is engaged in the trade. benefit to him? tion could not be of benefit to him or any one else, why must he be bound to absolute secrecy? I have not the slightest doubt that the appointee will be a person who knows something about the tea trade and is actively engaged in it. is assuming that the representative of the tea trade on the board must, be some one who is actively engaged in the tea trade; but that does not necessarily follow. representative of the tea trade "". Therefore, he will be actively engaged in the tea trade or, at least, will know the ins and outs of the trade. Otherwise, his services would be of no value to'the board. would not appoin a representative of the f horse-shoe trade to a tea board. is that the appointee will be a representative of the tea trade. If , as a member of the board, he will not gain any information that will be of value to him from a trade standpoint what is the need to bind him to absolute secrecy concerning any information that he may acquire in consequence of holding his official position? However, whilst he will be bound to secrecy in that respect he will not be prevented in any way from using, to his own advantage, inside information that he may obtain as a result of his membership of the board.",59,Second Reading

I ask honourable members to restrain themselves. order in discussing the experiences of other boards, some members of which have been known to use to their own advantage inside information that they obtained in their official positions. The Minister' should explain the point that [ have raised. It would be useless to appoint to the board a representative of the tea trade on such conditions that that individual would be given a tremendous advantage over others who are engaged in that trade. First, he would consumers. When the tea is in the hands be given the opportunity to ascertain movements within' the trade. If such knowledge and information is not valuable to somebody, why should he be bound to secrecy? The only conclusion that I can reach is that some of the operations of that board can be used to the material advantage of individuals. The Government proposes to appoint to the board a member of the tea trade. As he will have an opportunity to learn all the secrets of the business, he is to be bound to secrecy. The Government is giving to him a close preserve of the knowledge that he may gain, as a member of the board, to use to his own advantage. honourable member for Dalley( Mr somewhat reluctant to remind GovernRosevear) floundered badly and wasted the time of the House iu his attempt to convince the people that this bill is not soundly based in the interests of the country. when it establishes a board to control an industry, acts wisely when it appoints to that authority at least one person who has a practical knowledge of the business. In this instance, the Government proposes to appoint a representative of the tea trade to the Tea Importation Board. Another member of that board will be a representative of the Treasury. His function will be to safeguard the financial interests of the country, and to supervise purchasing conditions. The other two members will be the Tea COEtroller, and a representative of the tea trade. As there are so many grades of tea, and as supplies of that commodity are obtained from various parts of the world, a person who has a practical knowledge of the trade must be appointed to the board. The proposals in this bill are completely satisfactory, and the honourable member for Dalley merely tried to cause confusion in the minds of the people. The Government proposes to appoint a board to acquire tea from various overseas sources at the most advantageous prices to this country. When supplies of tea have been landed in Australia, an average price will be struck, and the Government will pay a subsidy for the purpose of reducing the cost of tea to of the wholesale trade, the Ministers in charge of prices control in the several States will be able to follow the price through the trade channels and ensure that the public shall be protected against exploitation. This bill is sound in rjrinciple under existing conditions. Government supporters advocate the policy of private trading, and I hope that we shall revert to that system as soon as tea becomes more readily obtainable. Meanwhile, the procedure that is envisaged in this bill must be adopted while the Commonwealth is paying a subsidy to reduce the price of tea. to the consumers. I support the bill. ment supporters that they are supporting a measure of socialization, or nationalization. Psychiatrists refer to a conflict between the inner desires of people and Obviously the Government, their actions. If we are to believe the protestations of honourable (members opposite during a general election campaign, this Government wishes to remove controls, and restore the system of private trading. Psychiatrists state that when a conflict occurs between an inner desire and the actions that a person is forced by circumstances to take, a mental conflict results, which leads to all sorts of peculiar aberrations. That seems to be the explanation of many of the aberrations that, unfortunately, affect the present Government. This bill, obviously, is a measure",60,Second Reading

I venture to say that even the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) would not be prepared to deny that statement. Quito obviously, this bill is a measure of socialization and of control. The honourable member for Flinders, and other honourable members opposite, were elected on the basis of a. promise to remove controls. They gave to the people during the general election campaign in 1949 a pledge that if they were elected to office, they would not re-impose or continue controls.

Obviously, if tbe members of a Government have almost continuously to introduce legislation that, is in direct conflict with their political philosophy, those mental conflicts about, which the psychiatrists speak will be set up. and will cause honourable gentlemen opposite to take all sorts of peculiar actions. At least those conflicts provide some kind of explanation for the peculiar actions of Government supporters in the past. But, remarkable as the bill is as evidence of this Government's failure to remove the controls, it is not so remarkable as is the absence of a provision to require the Tea Importation Board to report to the Parliament upon its activities. I should have thought that such stern anti-socialists and decontrolled as are supporters of the Government, woul.1 say, ""Well, circumstances that we are not prepared to face compel us to reintroduce a measure that was taken by a Labour government to control the tea trade; but, at least, we shall compel the Tea Importation Board to submit to the Parliament a complete report upon its activities, and disclose the sources from which it has purchased tea, the prices that have been paid for it, and the retail price."" I say quite frankly that many people consider that there is not much difference between the various brands of tea that they buy, other than in the quantity of condy's crystals that they are expected to consume with them. Evidently large sums are expended upon advertisements for various brands of tea. Why that is so, I do not know. Whether or not the advertising signs that are so conspicuous are a relic from the days of pre-control, I do not know; but if they are a relic of those days, 1 see no earthly reason why this Governmentshould permit the wholesalers of tea to expend money upon advertising their particular brands. be prevented from advertising brands of tea? prevent them from doing so by passing the requisite legislation. tising expenses as an allowable deduction for the purposes of taxation. not effective in such a matter, the Government would have sufficient implicit pres^ sure under this bill to force the wholesalers to bow to its wishes. If they were not prepared to "" play ball "", the Government could take the obvious course of retailing one government brand of tea. Tea appears to be in the same category as tennis balls and electric light globes, which are displayed before the public in all sorts of guises, and under various names. Yet all tennis balls are made by the one factory, and are of the same standard. The same remark applies to electric light globes. However, large sums are expended in advertising the qualities of one brand of tennis ball compared with those of another",61,Second Reading

Yet there is no difference between the various tennis balls, between the various electric light globes, or, for that matter, between the various brands of tea. The Government should pay attention to the fact that the advertising expenses that are incurred by some wholesalers of tea are completely unjustified in view of the standard of the tea that is sold to the public of Australia. The Government should take firm measures to prevent the addition of another penny to the cost of 1 lib. of tea. as a result of adding advertising charges to the cost of distributing it. Clause5 (2.) provides that the Tea Importation .Board shall consist of(«) a person who shall be the Chairman of the Board: (b) an officer of the Department of the Treasury; (o) a. representative of the tea trade: and (d) the tea controller. Four persons are specified, if I read that sub-clause correctly. Yet clause 8 (4.) providesI n the absence of the Chairman and his deputy from a meeting of the Board, a member -elected by the members present shall preside. I assume that if two of the four members of the board are absent, only two members remain at the meeting. Yet clause S (2.) providesAt a meeting of the .Board, three members form a quorum.

I ask the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who is in charge of the bill, to give careful consideration to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) that a representative of the trade unions be appointed to the board. I should also like to know why a representative of the biggest trade union of all-eve n though, unfortunately, it is not organized to the degree that it should be-shoul d not be appointed to the board. I refer, of course, to the housewives union. Dear old ladies, in season and out of season, produce their teapots, put in a spoonful of tea, and make their "" cuppa "". Above all others, they are entitled to be represented on the Tea Importation Board. After all, they are the persons who mostly make and drink the tea. In view of the quality of the tea that has been sold to them lately, they are definitely entitled to representation on the board. bored with the honourable member's speech. of the Australian Country party are not in favour of the proposal that a representative of the housewives should be appointed to the Tea Importation Board. If I remember correctly, the women's section of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party was repeatedly assured by Government supporters that, under a non-Labour government, it could rest assured that the views of the housewives would always receive the most sympathetic consideration. During the general election campaign in 1949, dozens of circulars were addressed to mothers and wives in my electorate, stating that the Liberal party would always sympathetically consider the views and problems of women. I think that the honordefinition of able member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) made a particular point that the housewives, above all other people, could rest assured that they would have representatives on the various government committees that were appointed to deal with their problems. able member for Isaacs wooed all the housewives in a political sense in his constituency. number of them to ensure his election to this House.

AH that I am trying to do is to convince the Government, in my own imperfect way, that it should live up to its pre-election promise to give representation to women upon various boards and committees. Why should not those persons, who, more than any body else, are concerned with tea, be represented on the board? The housewives make and drink the tea. has said that before. Mr .SPEAKER -Order! I warn the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) that he must not repeat his statements; otherwise he will be guilty of tedious repetition. Mr Speaker, to decide whether or not an honourable member is guilty of tedious repetition, I suppose that I may not repeat that statement. But it is news to me that it is a function of Mr Speaker to determine whether or not an honourable member is guilty of tedious repetition. function of the Speaker, and I shall not allow it to be discussed. neither that nor what I said previously. At least I assume that I can again suggest that the Government should provide, before the bill finally leaves this House, for representation of the women of the community on this board above all others. It made a promise to that effect, and we are entitled to ask it to honour that promise. The board will be of particular importance, because tea affects the housesented on the board in any way. Clause hold budget of every family to a large degree. Its cost, notwithstanding the subsidy, is very high. For that reason alone the Government should provide for the appointment to the board of a representative of the consumers so that they may have an opportunity, through that representative, to make sure that the board shall buy tea in the most favorable market. If I know my bureaucracy, the board may operate efficiently at first, but it is likely to settle down into a groove and continue to buy tea from the same sellers by force of habit without exploring the possibilities of obtaining it more cheaply elsewhere. The present poor quality of tea also makes the appointment of a representative of the consumers -advisable. The gravest dissatisfaction must be experienced by every tea drinker in Australia to-day. I do not know how many tea drinkers there are on the Government side of the chamber, but I believe that none of them can be satisfied with the quality of the tea that is sold to us at present. I hope that thy Government will take notice of what I have said and take steps to ensure that a housewife shall be appointed to the board. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The language that he used is not unparliamentary, and he may proceed. a offended the susceptibilities of honourable members opposite. The fact that I have done so shows that my statement was very near the mark. We have one member of the Opposition suggesting that we should have a representative honourable member may not discuss the merits or demerits of members of the Opposition. He must keep to the clause. opposite have expressed various opinions in relation to this clause. One wants a representative of the employees, or of the trade unions, on the board. I ask them to say where tliey would find their representative of the employees. Would he be a member of the Storemen and Packers Union, or a member of of tlie grocers'* organization who sells tea Parliament, and enables the chairman over the counter? Honourable members opposite have expressed no opinion in that direction. The proposed appointment to the board of a representative of the tea trade is wise because people engaged in the tea trade are used to buying tea on the overseas markets. I take it that the appointment will not be made in a haphazard manner. The person so appointed will undoubtedly be somebody who has the confidence of the tea trade. The Government is hardly likely to select, for appointment somebody who has not the confidence of the tea trade. It is unworthy of the honourable member who made the suggestion to imply that that person would have an undue advantage over his competitors, because I am quite sure that the person appointed would have the confidence of the trade, otherwise by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and I point out to the Minister( Mr Hasluck) that the Opposition is supporting this measure because it really wishes to make it effective, and to put i i above criticism. We have moved the amendment to provide that the board shall not have a representative of the tea trade on it, because a later clause provides that absolute secrecy in regard to the board's proceedings shall be maintained. Therefore, it is not desirable to embarrass the representative of the tea trade on the board. I suggest that it is of no particular advantage for us to move for the deletion of a particular part of this clause, unless we also put some helpful and constructive proposal to the Government. I appreciate fully that it is Order! The desirable that the Tea Controller, notwithstanding his extensive experience' during the war and since, should have at his call some technical and practical advice from the trade. I suggest that that need would be met by a provision for the insertion of which the Minister himself can move if he accepts our amendment, to the effect that the board may call in for consultation, from time to time as desired, a representative of the tea trade. Such a provision exists in other acts of this of an authority to send for experts in a particular trade to tender advice on particular problems. If the Minister accepted my suggestion the proposed board would then be in a position to conduct its business in secret, calling for advice from time to time from a representative of the tea trade who, after tendering the advice, would withdraw from the meeting. The board would then have the advantage of the advice whilst tbe secrecy of its proceedings would still be maintained. I make that as a constructive suggestion.

Under the terms of this clause the Government will have the right to appoint "" a person"" to be chairman of the board, and obviously, if it so desires, it may appoint as chairman a person who is engaged in the tea trade. However, after the criticism that has been voiced to-night I think it would be very unwise to do so, and I hope that it will not do so. The Opposition has, in fact, moved that there be no representative of the tea trade on the board, in view of the provision that is contained in clause 14.

262,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [10.34],The,70,Customs Tariff Expor T Duties Bill 1951 Second Reading
263,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [10.37].,"the series of measures by means of which the Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden) seeks to implement his budget proposals. This is probably one of the measures that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had in mind when, in a pre-view of the Government's financial proposals he described the Government's projected legislation very appropriately as a "" horror budget"". As we pass from one measure to another in this long series of bills to impose indirect taxation, we realize that the huge sums that are being raised by the Government more than justify the Prime Minister's description of the whole of the budget proposals. In fact his statement appears now to have been something in the nature of a gross understatement. The levying of excise on beer or anything else seems to be an easy way of extracting money from the pockets of the people. However, it is not a satisfactory or a f a ir way because the burden is thrown disproportionately on different sections of the people. In the case of the excise on beer, strict teetotallers pay no tax at all for the amendment to this measure to increase the upkeep of the nation or the maintenance of services for which the budget proposals in general arc designed. It is. interesting to note that there was a tax of 3d. a gallon on beer in the year 1913-14. Then came ""World WarI . and the Government decided that an increase of the excise on beer would be one way in which the war effort could b» financed. Accordingly the excise on beer was increased to 6d. a gallon. In subsequent years, the levy was in creased, until at the outbreak of World War II . it was 2s. a gallon. The excise was 2s. a gallon during the although half way through the depression it was reduced to Is. 9d. a gallon. In the second Menzies budget introduced after the outbreak of World War II . , the levy was increased to 2s. 9d. a gallon. Tn 1941, the Curtin Government raised it to 3s. a gallon. During the worse period of the last war, when it was necessary for us to marshal the f u l l financial, physical and material resources of the nation, the excise was raised to 4s. 7d. a gallon. From 1942 to the present, it has remained at that figure. This Government will raise it by this measure to 7s. 2d. a gallon, which is a most extraordinary increase and one that is completely indefensible by any criterion. It is objectionable fro m the working man's viewpoint because the average working man does not drink whisky; he drinks beer. In my own elecfinancial torate, as in other capital cities, there are many hotels, and a large proportion of the people patronize them. No hotel would open its doors for more than half an hour a year if it had to depend on my patronage, or on that of many other members of the Parliamentary Labour party. But we represent many people who want to be able to buy beer, and who object to being required to pay a tax of 50 per cent, of the cost of every glass of beer that they drink merely to help the Treasurer balance his budgetMr Ofi'KBMAK -There could not be a better way of doing it . member believes that he should move an excise on beer to 100 per cent, or 150 per cent, of the cost. I appreciate the opinions .of the people in our community who say that beer should not be drunk by anybody, but beer is being drunk. As beer-drinking is not regarded as a crime, it should not be taxed as if it were a social offence. The Treasurer proposes to raise no less than £50,000,000 by this measure. The amount raised last year by the same right honourable gentleman from this source was £37,000,000. Even that was a considerable increase of the amount raised through the last budget of the Chifley Governfirst part of the depression, ment. The amount that will be raised this year is nearly £20,000,000 more than the Chifley Government obtained from the same source during its last year of office. When we were raising £33,000,000 from the excise on beer, members of the Government parties who were then in Opposition demanded that we should reduce the excise. Since they have assumed office they have changed their tune and have increased it . This year everybody has been staggered by the amount of the increase. The amount of money that will be raised this year by way of beer excise will be more than two",70,Customs Tariff Expor T Duties Bill 1951 Second Reading
264,Mr Calwell,"If the honorablearid a half times the amount that was raised in 1911 by the entire budget of the late Mr Andrew Fisher. For the first time in our history provision was then made for the capital expenditure of our defence programme to come from revenue rather than from loan funds. I do not know whether the Treasurer will obtain tbe amount that he estimates he will get, I do not even venture to guess what he will raise; but I know that a large sum of money will be raised that the right honourable gentleman has no justification for raising by this means. This is a 56 per cent, burden on those who drink beer. If we were to tax every frivolity or social activity in the. same way we should be very humourless people and would lead a very gloomy existence. As I said a moment ago, my tastes, certainly in this regard, are very modest, but I know that many people prefer to have their drink as part of their ordinary routine and that they do not want to read books, buy gramophone records or do any of the things from which I derive my amusement. It is natural that the modest luxury of the great mass of the people who consume liquor should be exploited as a source of revenue by a government that would rather raise revenue in that way than by increasing taxes upon incomes. crack at the brewers. attacking the working man by this means. The consumer will pay not only the increases of duty but as much again to the breweries which, in order to cover their additional costs, have had to increase On the Treasurer's own estimates, there tbe price of beer. The purchase of an 11-oz. glass of beer, for which a man or woman must now pay Is., represents a gain to the Treasury of 5jd. Of the 9d. that is paid for a 7-oz. glass of beer, 3-ifd. goes to the Treasury, and of the 5d. that is paid for a 4-oz. glass of beer, 2£d. goes to the Treasury. That is the position in Victoria, where the Treasurer ta,kes Is. 2^d. of the 2s. 4d. that is paid for a bottle of beer. If the honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman) contends that it is immoral for people to drink, he must agree that it is immoral for the Government to raise revenue from drink and use it for the purpose of balancing the budget. I do not know whether the Treasurer realizes how unpopular this measure is with the people. If he still believes that, after the introduction of his horror budget, he has any popularity left, he would be disconcerted if he heard the protests that are being made by groups of average Australians in liquor bars throughout the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman may feel that he has no responsibility to the lowly people who use the ordinary public bars and that he should look after the interests only of those in the higher income group. He proposes to raise this huge sum of money, not from the directors of associated banks, the members of graziers' federations or the wealthy people generally, but from the workers. Soon, the workers will not have the wherewithal to buy even necessaries of life. It may be that, by the imposition of this form of tax, the Treasurer will in actual fact deprive the Treasury of revenue that he believes will be raised by it. Perhaps the Government hopes that later, probably before the next general election, it will be able to reduce the excise duty upon liquor, but I do not think that that is likely to happen, because its action in increasing taxes of all kinds as an antidote for inflation has, in the opinion of the Labour party, only accentuated the inflationary trend. The Government, having taken this step, will be forced to increase the duty again next year. That will not only be unfair but also will cause a great deal of discontent. could be a substantial falling-off in the consumption of liquor this year without the revenue derived from excise duties upon liquor falling below that of last year. That reduction of consumption, if it occurs, will not be caused by lack of spending power on the part of the wealthy interests in the community. It will be a reflection of the impoverished state of the average working man, who is at this time and always the most unfortunate victim of the evils of inflation. The Treasurer has calculated that his surplus, which will be derived in part",71,Customs Tariff Expor T Duties Bill 1951 Second Reading

266,Mr Calwell,"The Government isfrom the excise duty on liquor, may enable the Government to keep in power for a little longer without the country becoming insolvent, but there are many reasons for believing that the Government will have to expend the money chat it is raising by this and other forms of tax. I advise the Treasurer to reduce these duties because if he does not do so he will be unable to raise the other money that he hopes to raise. In Victoria, the reduction of the State loan allocation is already having a serious affect upon the employment market. In 1939, the last pre-war year, the excise duty upon beer was Is. 9d. a gallon. In that year, collections were approximately £7,000,000. Now they have reached the colossal figure of £53,000,000, based upon a duty of is. 2d. a gallon. beer alone? Labour party was in power, many them a bigger kick for less expenditure. demands were made upon it to reduce the As a result of the increase, the polios duty upon liquor, but we were unable in the metropolitan area of Melbourne to do so then. We reduced other forms were kept particularly busy. of taxes, and .1 am certain that had we remained in office we should have reexcise duties upon liquor or upon any duced the duty upon liquor either last other commodity has a vested interest in year or this year. Certainly we should increased sales of that commodity. The not have increased it, as this Governgreater the excise duty upon a gallon ment has done. The paradox is that of beer, the more gallons does the Gothese increases are being imposed by a vernment wish to be consumed. That is government that was elected on a promise only natural. Despite the fact that these to reduce excise duties and all other forms increases give the Government a vested of tax. I think it is fair to say that interest in the increased consumption of during the course of debates upon other liquor, those who were responsible for financial measures honourable gentlemen them have, as it were, ostentatiously opposite have admitted that the Governadjusted their haloes, and posed as benement has caused to go haywire the stable factors of the community. They cereconomy that the Chifley Government tainly are not benefactors of the comleft to Australia. I am certain that if munity.

I should not be doing my duty to the this imposes excessive duties and taxes great massof the people if I allowed this upon liquor and other commodities that legislation to pass without protest. I do are in general use in order to obtain vast not believe that the Labour party would sums of money from the ordinary people be doing its duty if , having opposed in the community and, by so doing, make every other financial measure that the it possible to reduce the taxes that are Government has introduced, it did not paid by those who are best able to bear object also to the passage of this legistbe burden of taxation. The principle lation, not only by its voice but also iby its vote. The Treasurer has it in his power to mitigate the hardship that is being caused by these increased excise duties, and he should do so at the earliest possible moment. If he does not, he will bring nearer the day when the Labour party will be in power. Then the Labour party will do what it has suggested to the Treasurer to-night that he should do. object of these increased excise duties is not to promote temperance or abstinence but to raise money. The increases will not promote temperance or abstinence, even incidentally. The week-end after the new rates of duty were imposed upon the beer drinking and liquor consuming section of the community was a record week-end for cases of drunkeness in every the people who are prone to drink too much liquor drank concoctions that gave Any government that imposes increased I believe that a government such as",72,Customs Tariff Expor T Duties Bill 1951 Second Reading

269,Mr Petebs (Burke) [10.55],"Th eupon which, all honest governments seek to base their taxation proposals is that taxation shall he imposed in accordance with ability to pay. That principle is not followed if, irrespective of income, people are required to pay taxes upon tobacco or drinks, or are taxed on each occasion when they go to the pictures, an opera or a church. None of those taxes can be justified. Under this measure, the rate of excise on oeer which was 3d. a gallon in 1914, is to be increaseil to 7s. 2d. a gallon, whilst the rate in respect of a bottle of beer, which is retailed at 2s, 4d., is to be increased to Is. 2£d., which is more than half the retail price of the article taxed. Thus, a labourer, or a worker in heavy industry, who customarily takes home a bottle of beer to enjoy with his evening meal will be penalized, whereas his next-door neighbour who is, perhaps, a teetotaller, will not be obliged to contribute an equivalent tax in respect of beverages that he may consume with his meals. No one will object to a labourer or a worker in a heavy industry refreshing himself with a drink of beer with his evening meal. It is customary for many such workers .when on their way home to purchase a bottle of beer at the local inn. I remind honourable members that in ancient days the greatness of England was founded upon its inns. Wellington said that the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields at Eton. It could be said with equal justification that it was won in the inns of England. The Government cannot possibly justify this exorbitant impost upon beer. It is levying it solely as an expedient means of raising additional revenue. ' The imposition of excise duty, possibly, presents the easiest way of extracting money from the community. That system has the additional advantage that the burden of the impost falls most heavily upon the average citizen to the advantage of the wealthy sections of the community which Government supporters represent. again emphatically protest against the imposition of these exhorbitant rates of excise. Such action is manifestly unjust. I make that protest as one who will not contribute one penny to the Government's coffers by way of excise duty on alcoholic beverages. Mr Peters. support the protests against this measure that have been voiced by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Oalwell) and the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters). One of the objects of the bill is to amend section 26 of the Beer Excise Act in order to provide for new methods for the return of beer excise stamps. Apparently, breweries and those who earn their living in the brewing trade must forever remain at the tender mercies of the Government. Whilst1 hold no brief for the breweries, 1 say emphatically that of all organizations that are obliged to furnish returns in respect of excise duty they have established the best reputation for accuracy. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) will admit that such returns invariably are accurate to a penny. In addition, the breweries have won a reputation for conforming absolutely to the provisions of the pure foods legislation in the production of beer and ale. I oppose this measure not in the interests of the breweries but because it will unfairly penalize an industry that is of great economic value. Beer is regarded as a necessity by the great majority of Australian workers. Figures have been cited in this debate to illustrate the degree to which excise duty on beer has been increased. f t would appear from those figures that whenever the Government seeks to raise additional revenue it immediately select? for such additional impositions beer and tobacco which are consumed by the majority of workers in this country. It is now proposed to increase the excise duty on beer from 4s. 7d. to 7s. 2d. a gallon. That is an increase of 56 pe> cent, of the rate of excise. Whether or not the Government approves of the fact, it must admit that 98 persons out of every 100 who partake of beer and ale do so in moderation. I A 7-oz. glass of ale is retailed at 9d. and of that price the breweries receive l.ld. and the publican 3.4d., whilst the Government extracts in excise duty 4.5d. ; or 50 per cent. An 11-oz. pot of ale is retailed at Is. Of that price, the brewery receives 1.4d. and the publican 4.6d., while excise accounts for 6d. or 50 per cent. A bottle of ale retails at",73,Customs Tariff Expor T Duties Bill 1951 Second Reading
270,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [11.4],"12s. 4d. Of that price, the brewery receives 9d. and the publican 4.6., whilst the benevolent Government receives in excise Is. 2.3d. A dozen bottles of ale are retailed at 28s. Of that price, the brewery receives 9s. and the publican 4s. Sd.. whilst the Government receives in excise 14s. 4d., or over 50 per cent. A* '9-gallon keg of ale is sold to the publican for £4 4s.; and of that price the brewery receives only 19s. 6d., whilst the Government receives in excise £3 4s. 6d. The honourable member for Melbourne indicated the increases of excise duty on beer and ale that have occurred since World WarI . At the beginning of 1914, the rate was 3d. a gallon but later in the year is was increased to 6d. a gallon. During subsequent years, the rate was increased as follows:-1917 , 7d.; 191S. Is.; 1920. Is. 3d. and Is. 9d.: 1929, 2s.; 1940, 2s. 9d.; 1941, 3s.; and 1942, 4s. 7d. reduced on only two occasions. In 1929, it was reduced from 2s. to Is. 10d., and in 1930 it was reduced from 2s. to Is. 9d. It is now proposed to increase the rate to 7s. 2d. a gallon. I remind supporters of the Government, and particularly members of the Australian Country party, that the brewing trade is a valuable customer for many primary products and that but for that fact many primary producers would -be much worse off than they are to-day. ferred to "" H ill y billy corner""? member will withdraw that remark. in respect of aggregate collections of -excise tax in order to indicate the value of the brewing industry as a contributor to the coffers of the Government. In 1938-39, the excise that was paid by the brewing interests of the Commonwealth .amounted to £7,288,579. In the period 1939-46, which included World War' II . , the total was £119,543,611. In the post-war period from 1946 to 1949, excise -on beer yielded £86,096,738. But those figures, vast as they are, pale into insignificance compared with the sum that has been paid by the brewing interests of the Commonwealth since this Government has been in office. In that period of two years, the amount has totalled £123,744,673. porters are not the stooges of the browing interests ? Mi'. CREMEAN -That interjection by the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Brown) is not fair. It does not necessarily follow, because I defend the right of the average worker to his drink that I am a stooge of the brewing interests. Honourable gentlemen know perfectly well that the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) and even my humble self are not proponents of the art of excessive drinking. But we are proponents of the art of The rate of excise was logical thought. Therefore, it seems to me inequitable that 98 per cent, of the working people of Australia, who regard ale as a necessity, and do not abuse it but. use it frugally and properly, should be. subjected to such an impost. They analways the target for an onslaught by this Government whenever additional revenue is required. The excise on beer certainly swells the Government's revenues. I shall show that the Government has no need to nationalize, or even to consider the nationalization of, the breweries. This year, the Carlton and United Breweries will make, according to estimates, 42,000,000 gallons of beer, and will act as a tax gatherer for the Commonwealth and, in that role, will collect £15,050,000. Tbe Ballarat Brewing Company, which will produce approximately 3,500,000 gallons of beer this year, will collect for .the Commonwealth in excise an amount of £1,250,000. Nearly all that money will be extracted from the workers. Yet this Government cheerfully disregards any suggestion that inferior wines should be taxed, and states that the Australian wine industry must be assisted. Half the liquor trouble that, is caused in the community is due to the consumption of inferior wines, or, as it is called in most inter-suburban electorates, "" cheap plonk "".

277,Mr Brown,"Then Government supsevere charge on inferior wines and would not subject ale, which is the drink of the working man, to heavy excise. But the Government takes refuge in anonymity, and because the increased costs which are represented by excise are passed on to the consumers, the workers, brewers and publicans share the contumely. If justice were done, that contumely would be directed against this so called benevolent Government that graces, or rather disgraces, the treasury bench. I endorse the statements by the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Burke to the effect that this burden of excise on the ale that is consumed by the workers is iniquitous, unfair and inequitable. Reference has been made to such matters as new methods of accountancy, and the necessity to prevent the occurrence of a leakage in respect of excise stamps, but the protestations of the Government in that connection arp only a pretext. Its desire, obviously, is to wheedle as much as possible out of an uncomplaining and unvociferous working class. 3hirt, ""Jos"". honourable member for Watson( Mr duction of wheat, for which a tremendous Curtin) makes a similar remark again, he will be asked to leave the chamber. bers of the Opposition have discussed tea and beer in a most learned manner this evening. I am not sure whether they are more confident when they discuss tea than when they discuss beer. But they have carefully avoided any reference to the fact that the Government requires additional revenue for defence, social services and repatriation benefits, and, therefore, is obliged to collect from the community a considerably larger sum by way of taxation than was received in the last financial year. During the budget debate, no Opposition member proved that the implementation of the financial proposals of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) did not spread the burden fairlv over all sections of the community. The Government does not derive any pleasure from measures to increase taxes, but it has a definite responsibility to place the defences of this country in order and to stabilize the economy. The consumption of beer has increased by approximately 70 per cent, since 1939. and the production of that beverage has increased by a similar figure, yet, during the same period, the production of essential goods has remained stationary, or has increased only slightly. The output of basic materials is insufficient to meet the demand for them. Therefore, we must admit that Australian production is, for the time being, out of balance. People who consume ale should lie prepared to make a contribution towards national defence preparations. They should realize that if this country is not adequately defended, they may not have the pleasure of drinking, beer in a few years' time. Some Opposition members claim that tbe brewing of beer creates demands for the products of various other industries. I recognize that fact, but I point out that those industries can make a valuable contribution to the production of commodities that are more essential than is beer. Large quantities of barley are required for the brewing of ale. Some of the attention that is given to barleygrowing might well be diverted to the prodemand exists. The increased excise on beer has been imposed for two reasons, first, to raise additional revenue, and, secondly, to reduce the demand for beer. The result of the Government's policy in that respect may be to direct production and labour into more useful channels. The Government is acting courageously in the implementation of its budget proposals, and is endeavouring to spread the burden equitably over all sections of the community. I am confident that those of us who enjoy a glass of ale are prepared to pay the additional excise as a contribution towards national defence in order that we may long have the pleasure of drinking beer.

283,Motion (By Mr Eric J. Harrison ),"Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory ) [11.42] I wish to speak very briefly about the acoustics of this chamber. hear the honourable member for conversation. MrJ . R. FRASER about the acoustics of this chamber. It has been very noticeable to-night that honourable members sitting on the back benches on occasions could not hear honourable members and Ministers who were speaking at the table in the centre of the chamber. It was also noticeable that you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees also had difficulty in hearing what was said in the centre of the chamber. I admit that at times there was noise from both sides of the House, but I believe also that the acoustic properties of the chamber were at fault. I noticed to-night, as I have noticed on previous occasions when the proceedings of this House were not being broadcast, that there seemed to be a reverberation, perhaps from the microphones although presumably they are "" dead "". This acoustic disturbance makes it extremely difficult for many honourable members to hear what is being said at the table. I suggest that the experts make an examination of the trouble to determine whether the trouble can be eliminated. the A r m y ) [11.43] -Speaking on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the 30th October, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) brought under my notice the case of an ex-serviceman who had been retrenched from the employment of the Repatriation Commission in Sydney. The honourable member, during the course of his remarks, stated that he had taken the matter up with the Ministerf or Repatriation (Senator Cooper), and had received the following reply:Iu carrying out the decision of the Government in regard to reduction in the Public Service, my department acted in accordance with instructions issued by the Public Service Board mid in selecting those employees to he retrenched the practice followed was to retain, within any group or class of employment, the efficient employee in preference to the one who was less efficient or unsuitable for any particular type of work. The honourable member said that the reply was in direct conflict with what the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had said would be the order of priority in retrenchment, which was that the last persons to be displaced would be disabled ex-servicemen. I wish to speak The Ministerf or Repatriation has advised me that the statement of the Prime Minister on the 2nd October, as reported on page 1S3 of Hansard of that date, indicated that the order of retrenchment was as follows:Married women. Women over the compulsorv retiring age (65). Males over the compulsory retiring age (65). Single women and widows. Persons qualified for permanent appointment, but not so appointed. Relatives of deceased soldiers. Female ex-7iiembers of the Forces. Single men. Married men without family. Married men with family. Male ex-members of the force's. The Minister for Repatriation has pointed out that almost 100 per cent, of the male employees of his department are ex-servicemen. It followed, therefore, that any retrenchments from the department would affect the employment of ex-servicemen. In giving effect to the Government's decision, f u l l cognizance was taken of the principle of preference in the Re-establishment and Employment Act, but it was obvious that any reduction of a staff so f u l l y employed as that of the Repatriation Department made it essential that those retained should be the best available. In selecting those employees to be retrenched the practice followed, therefore, was to retain, w it h in any group or class of employment, the efficient employee in preference to the one who was less efficient or unsuitable for any particular type of work. The reply from the Ministerf o r Repatriation (Senator Cooper) does not satisfactorily conclude this matter. He hassaid that practically 100 per cent, of the employees of the Repatriation Department are ex-servicemen, so his statement establishes that there are some persons, employed by that department who are not ex-servicemen. How the heads of thedepartrnent determined that the man toi",77,Adjournment Parliamenthouse Public Service Expropriated Property

286,Mr War D (East Sydney) [11.46],"whom 1 referred was the least efficient employee in his section is beyond me, because in actual fact, he was employed in his position for about five years. He would not have received his annual increments each year unless he had been efficient, because the payment of annual increments depended on the reports of the officers over him. This man was given no opportunity to prove whether or not he was the least efficient employee in his section. I inform the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr because I have been told that this Bland), who has attempted to justify the action of the Government in dismissing a disabled ex-serviceman, that this man was actually in the Yaralla Hospital at Concord under treatment for war disabilities at the time of his dismissal. The first notice that he received of his dismissal reached him after his discharge from the hospital, when he received a message that a letter awaited him at the William-street post office in Sydney. Tbat letter contained his dismissal notice. Th« Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has said that the Government's policy of retrenchment merely amounted to transferring labour from one position to another and that if men were retrenched from, the Repatriation Department or any other government department they would be able to find a vacancy among the 160,000 jobs that are available and for which labour cannot be found. The Government's retrenchment policy is not merely for the purpose of -saving expenditure, because the Government is budgeting for a huge surplus this .year. The Government has been telling the public that all it is doing is transferring surplus labour into other avenues -of employment. My complaint is that not only has it sacked and unjustly victimized a disabled ex-serviceman, but also that it has not found him alternative -employment. That man is still looking -for a position. How can the Government argue that by dismissing this man it is helping to increase production and assisting tbe war effort? This is not an isolated case, but is case of this kind that I know of. The merely one of a number that has been Government is always boasting about the 'brought to my notice. I know of other number of ex-servicemen who are sitting -cases of men who have been dismissed who in the Parliament as its supporters and it have not been found alternative employseems remarkable that those ex-servicemen mien t. The Government talks much of preshould be prepared to permit another ference to returned soldiers. Surely it has some obligation to provide for disabled ex-servicemen. Speeches in this Parliament will not help ex-servicemen and their dependants. What they want is practical support and fair treatment, which they are not receiving from the Government. WhatI want the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) to do is to ask the Minister for Repatriation to obtain from the section officers under whom this man worked a report on his efficiency, man, who was a records clerk, has never had his work queried. No report or file has ever been sent back to him because of his inefficient handling of it. So it is quite evident that the ground on which he was declared to be inefficient was not in respect of the quality of his work but because he has war disabilities and has lost time at work through having had to go to a repatriation hospital for treatment. It is on that ground only that the Government can claim lhat he is less efficient than the other men who work in his section. It took the Government a long time to find out that the man was inefficient because, as I have said, he was working in that particular section for about five years and was, I believe, the employee with the longest service in that section. I wish ft*. Minister for Repatriation to obtain ra&h a report in order to determine whether the man's section officers are prepared to say straight out that he is inefficient. If there is no position now available in the Repatriation Department for this disabled ex-serviceman, I wish the Government to indicate what it now proposes to do about giving him alternative employment, which the Government declared it would provide every person displaced under its retrenchment policy. H the Minister ana the Government do not act in this matter I propose to interest ex-servicemer. > organizations in it because, as I have said, it is not the only ex-serviceman to be subjected to victimizayear,' mainly because his mother was ill tion by the very Government of which they are supporters. I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Minister for Repatriation and I am quite certain that many honourable members, even among Government supporters, will consider that this man is being unjustly treated. I ask the Minister to take the wbole matter back to the Minister for Repatriation for a further review and to confer, if necessary, with the Minister for Labour and National Service about it. I believe that if the Government is not prepared to return the man to his former position, to which I believe he should be returned because he has been trained for the work, then it ought to find him another position which will be suitable for a man with his war disabilities. I hope to Australia. He asked me to have his that this matter will be acted on immediately, because I know that the Government proposes to close the Parliament for some months at the end of next week, and once the Parliament has been closed the Government will consider that that is the end of the criticism in relation to the matter, and it will do no more about it. I assure the Minister that I shall be back here next week expecting to hear that some action has been taken to place this man and others who are similarly affected in suitable employment. I wish to bring before the notice of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) the case of a person in my electorate who is suffering considerable hardship because of the operation of the National Security (Enemy Property) Regulations, in the hope that he will try to take some remedial action. The case may be unique, or it may be one of half a dozen such cases. The facts are briefly that Hermann Schmitt arrived in Australia from Germany in 1928 and, with another German who came out to Australia with him, he established a furniture manufacturing business in Albury. In 1935 be married an Australian and had two children who, as they were born here, are both Australian subjects. Unfortunately he did not take out naturalization papers. In 1938 he completed training an apprentice and decided to take his wife and family for a trip to Germany in the following there, but also for the sake of paying a visit to the country of his birth. The war broke out while he was in Germany and, being a German national, he was conscripted by the Germans. He worked first, with the German civil construction corps, and then was engaged in interpreting work. During his work as an interpreter he was successful in assisting some of our prisoners of war, including airmen who had been shot down. When the war was over he undertook work, first with the Canadian Army and then with the American Army and as he showed them that his case was bona fide he received a clearance from the American Army authorities and from the Australian Department of Immigration, and returned property cleared from the operation of the National Security (Enemy Property) Regulations. I believed that the matter would be quite straightforward, until I received a letter recently from the Attorney-General which said in partAdvice has now been received from the Delegate of the Controller of Enemy Property that, according to information before the Controller, Mr Schmitt is a German national. As he was resident in Germany during the war, he was an enemy subject for the purposes of the National Security (Enemy Property) Regulations and his property became subject to the provisions of those regulations. The position under the regulations was not altered by Mr Schmitt's subsequent return to Australia. Moreover, under the Paris Agreement on reparations from Germany, which came into force on 24th January, 1946, Australia is required to retain and liquidate German enemy assets within its jurisdiction at that date and to charge the value thereof against its reparation share. It appears that Mr Schmitt's assets must be dealt with accordingly, and the Controller of Enemy Property regrets he is not in a position to release them from control. That is the position at the moment. This man is in that position because of a slip. I understand that he had the required naturalization papers in his office and for some reason did not go any further about becoming naturalized. He was eleven years in Australia before the war, has an Australian wife and children and yet, because of the operation of the regulations, he has been told that everything that he has worked for in the last.",78,Adjournment Parliamenthouse Public Service Expropriated Property
287,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) [11.53],"23 years has been confiscated. The position is further complicated by the fact that in 1935 his wife bought out the other person who shared the manufacturing business with him, with the result that she owns one-quarter of the business. Of course tbe Controller of Enemy Property has no jurisdiction over her share of the property. But has he the power to liquidate a business of which only three-quarters is owned by Mr Schmitt? I have talked the matter over fully with Mr Padman, who was formerly Mayor of Albury, and with many other residents of Albury who are prepared to say that Mr Schmitt was not a nazi sympathizer and was never heard to voice any antiBritish sentiment. I hope that the Treasurer will take the matter up and try to rectify it. Treasurer) [11.57] I naturally know nothing about the case that the honourable gentleman has mentioned, but I shall take the matter up with the Controller of Enemy Property. The honourable gentleman will realize, of course, that we are not free agents. obligations under the Paris agreement, as the Attorney-General (Senator Spicer) pointed out in the letter that the honourable gentleman has read. Cameron) -The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr from the United Kingdom and I am J. R. Fraser) has raised the subject of the acoustics of this chamber. During the life of the Nineteenth Parliament this matter was thoroughly investigated in my presence by the responsible people, ft is possible when no honourable members are in the chamber to sit in any part of it delivery of any reasonable quantity can and hear a quiet conversation that is being carried on in any other part of it. I can assure the honourable gentleman that, from the two or three hours that I spent with other responsible people in testing the acoustics of the chamber, the quality of the acoustics is a matter that rests in the hands of honourable members themselves. If honourable gentlemen will persist in holding private conversations such as were held to-night while debates were in progressa practice to which I have often had cause to call the attention of the House-ther e is nothing that can be done to improve the acoustics. If the acoustics are to be controlled I can assure the House that it will be only by the self-control of honourable members themselves. Question resolved in the affirmative. The following paper was presented :Science and Industry Research Act-Third Annual Report of the Commonwealth Scientilic and Industrial Research Organization, for year 1950-51. House adjourned at 11.59 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) asked a question regarding an ""We have certain increase in the production of shotgunpowder. I understand from inquiries which, were made in this matter that this type of powder is not produced in Australia because manufacture of the limited quantities and extensive range required (Hon. Archie would be uneconomical. Supplies to meet Australian requirements are obtained informed that adequate stocks are available. I suggest that any person wishing to secure supplies should communicate with the State agents of Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand, as I believe that immediate be given. The Minister for Defence Production has advised that it is not possible to undertake the manufacture of gunpowder in government factories for civilian use. I understand, however, from recent inquiries that Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia, and New Zealand, with the aid of imported primer shells from the United Kingdom and through re-organizing and extending its plant, is rapidly increasing production and there are grounds for hoping that there will be some improvement in the supply position of shotgun cartridges in the near future.",80,Adjournment Parliamenthouse Public Service Expropriated Property
