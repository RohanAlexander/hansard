My colleague, the have an entitlement equivalent to that already honourable member for Corio( Mr Scholes), available for World War II veterans. The point when this issue was last debated, provided a here is that at present in regard to World War II number of instances of Australian involvement in veterans there are two clauses relating to peacekeeping-type operations. They did not entitlement and, in a sense, two bases for always attract these fine words that we have beentitlement. I refer to clauses 101 (1) (a) and come used to today but they were operations 10 1 (1) (b) of the main Act. These two provisions which were very similar to the kinds of operations on which entitlement is based can be summarised now contemplated. There was, for instance, the as, first of all, what we call the occurrence proAustralian involvement in Indonesia between vision; that is, the entitlement is based on a 1948 and 1951; there was the peacekeeping in specific occurrence during the war. The second Korea after the Korean armistice, that is for the provision, in clause 101 (1) (b), which we call the period from 1953 to 1957; there were the observer arisen-out-of provision, is a broader provision for groups sent to India and Pakistan, to the border entitlement on the basis of illness or incapacity conflict over Kashmir; and there were observer having arisen out of the war service.

I believe it was the Yet the point to note, and the purpose of this Minister for Science and Technology who pointed proposed amendment, is that for World War II out in the last debate on this matter the problem veterans both cases of entitlement are there-the occurrence basis and the arisen-out-of basis. But it is widely accepted that the repatriation benefits the provision relating to World WarI veterans, available in Australia are equal to the best in any Malayan veterans and Vietnam veterans is simply country and, indeed, better than most. We have the occurrence provision; the arisen-out-of proavailable to veterans a wide range of Service penvision is not there. Therefore, the entitlement of sions, disability pensions and medical services inthese groups of veterans, the really old veterans cluding various aids, right through a complete from the First World War and the younger vetrange of services that I believeas I said earlier, erans from Vietnam and Malaya is more limited are second to none.
