Those are not the actual words of the report, but that is the interpretation which I put upon the passage which I have read. The Prime Minister, however, has stated that it should not carry that interpretation, and I accept his denial; but 1 wish to have the actual report recorded in Hansard, so that the public may judge between us. Assent reported. Debate resumed from 29th September (vide page 5113), on motion by Mr from time to time to save the Government That tbe present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House. fence) I am not quite sure, after having listened to the debate pretty closely fora fortnight, and much more closely than I have previously been in-the habit of listening to debates, whether I shall be in order in addressing myself to the question if I refrain from making personal explanations, and from diving into ancient history. If I may judge by the experience of previous speakers, my turn for making personal explanations will come after I have spoken. But I shall endeavour to avoid as far as possible going into the ancient history of either Victoria or New South Wales. Interesting and exciting as the episodes recounted-to us may have been, they do not seem to me to bear very directly on the question now at issue. I have waited for nearly a fortnight to speak, because I thought, and but for present experience would still think, that the members of a Ministry whose existence was challenged were entitled to wait until they bad ascertained the causes for challenging it. The motion of want of 'confidence, which was moved by the honourable member for Bland last Tuesday week, in a speech in which he extolled the beauties of Socialism, and described the ideal state that is to come into existence long after we axe dead and buried, so that it has no direct personal interest for us, was seconded by the honourable :and learned member for Indi, who said, "" I second the motion, but reserve my right to speak later on."" Apparently it is to be much later on that that right will be exercised-muc h that what he said about the Labour Party later than the country will thitik he should in November last is true. postpone his speech, and much later than the Ministry which is attacked ha's a right to Labour Party, and the Minister knows it, expect, if -it is to be treated in. the manner which is customary upon occasions of this kind, and in a way which can be regarded as ordinary, not to say fair, political fighting. ber call that whining? I am not whining. We have had some new definitions added to the English language during the last week or twoa new definition of the word "" truce"" by the honourable and learned member for Indi and others, for example; and now we are getting a new definition of the word "" whining."" I assure the honourable member for Wide -Bay, who joined in running away from the bridges which he and his friends erected of which he was a member, that there will be no whining in my speech. However he may be able to characterize it when I have finished, he will find a notable absence of the whining which he desires to impute to me before I have begun to address myself to the main subject of my remarks. The honourable and learned member for Indi has delayed speaking until now, and we have not been able to ascertain when . he will speak. It is one of those happy events which are to occur in the dim future, which is to come upon us along with many other blessings when the Opposition have achieved their object of ousting the present Government from office, and have secured the first steps in the advance to that systern of perfection which their entrance into office is to insure this time, though when they were there a few months ago none of those steps were even proposed. ence from the Minister's leader, at any rate. cuss the past more than is absolutely necessary.

They will remember the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bland, standing up and announcing that he w'ould accept the honourable and spirit of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, but that it might require some verbal alterations. the day before the amendment was moved. swer to a question by the honourable and learned member for Corio, within an hour of the time of the division being takenI also recollect that the honourable member for Barker-and as all these acts took place under the public eye, I am perfectly justified in referring to them-walke d over to the table and spoke to the Prime. Minister. Then the vote was taken upon the exact verbiage of the amendment, and there was no further reference to accepting merely the spirit of it. I cannot forget either the brutal frankness with which the honourable The and learned member for Corio had put his question to the Prime Minister, "" Is this amendment vital to the Government, because if it is I shall vote with you, but if it is not I shall vote against you '' ? The honourable member for Bland said very candidlyI do not see what else he could have said under the circumstances"" Oh, the amendment is vital to the Government."" For that reason, presumably, the honourable and learned member for Corio, and the honourable member for Barker, after walking over to the table and speaking to the Prime Minis-. ter, voted with the Government, with the result that tihe amendment was carried by a majority of one. Subsequentlythe then Prime Minister informed a press interviewerin Sydney that the Government also proposed to make clause 48 vital. The honourable and learned member for Corio had announced, "" Make it vital, and I will support you,"" and apparently the honourable member for Bland thoughtI do not say there was anything improper about it-that to make",18,Watson

On the 5th September, 1904, the Age newspaper saidOn Saturday an important stage in the negotiations between' the Liberal-Protectionist and the Labour wings of the Federal Opposition was passed. The Liberal-Protectionists met at Parliament House in the morning, and discussed the recommendations of the committees-outline d in the Age of Saturday-and unanimously adopted them as a basis for alliance. The recommendations are headed ""The Official Proposals."" at that meeting?

At the end of the meeting, Mr Isaacs made the following brief statement to the representatives of the press :"" I submitted the draft proposals, and the meeting approved of them as a fair basis Honourable members may laugh; for an alliance between the Liberal-Protectionists and the Labour Parties for the consolidation of That article all the liberal progressive forces of Australia.

Talk of Britons taking their pleasures sadly, I never saw a more notable instance of it than that one. Some marched out at one end of the chamber, and others marched out at the other end. Sixteen of the cheerful acceptors voted against the provision which they were cheerfully ac-. cepting, and the other twenty cheerful 12 acceptors ran away from that which they had cheerfully accepted. They were afraid of getting too cheerful; they were afraid of the cheerfulness that pervaded their ranks, taking such an ebullient form as to carry them beyond themselves, and make them say, in the height of their exulI f that is tation, something more perhaps than they should.

I wish to draw attention to So much for the this fact, that there was one honourable member, at any rate with whom that was a gross breach of Then, with a few exceptions, faith. The honourable and learned member for Corio denounced in loud voice and unmeasured terms-in more unmeasured terms than any other speaker-the preferOn the 13th September there ence to unionists clause; but he made a second speech later on, and this was his justification for voting with the Government at a pinch-that is, in the division in which they were defeated Later on, the Watson Government accepted an amendment-that is the one which they cheerfully accepted-forbiddin g unions which were political to ask for a preference, and because of that the honourable and learned 1 member said his chief objection was removed.

For example, he is hand in hand with the Labour Party.

I do not pretend to be quoting their exact words, but that is what their statements amount to. So much for the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I now come to a question which is agitating the public mind more than any other. On the night before last the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that people must not think that clause 48 in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bil l was the great issue before the country. the whole House is practically agreed that there must be a majority asking for a preference before it is got, and the only question is as to the method by which the majority must be ascertained. He says that the majority must be asking for it. What wicked people we are to put in an amendment which says what the honourable member states ! had agreed to such. reported to have said that the whole House is practically agreed upon this. Now we come to the fiscal question. tion of the revival of the Tariff, and the question of preferential trade. In the first place, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the time when the Tariff question was revived. Tariff one of the terms of the alliance? When the Deakin Governmenta purely protectionist one-wen t out of office, and a Government which was half protectionist and half free-trade came in, we heard nothing from honourable members who now sit in that corner about re-opening the Tariff, or the danger to protection in having anv free-traders on the Treasury bench. I am coming to. The most remarkable thing is the date on which it evolved. The Watson Government was formed half of protectionists and half of free-traders. The honourable member for Bland says that that was a pure accident. think about the fiscal issue when he formed his Government, that he never stopped to consider 'whether its members were protectionists or free-traders.

The honourable member had the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in his district to support him. Was he not, therefore, subscribing to the programme of the honourable and learned member, ,who had declared, in no unmistakable terms, that the Tariff was not to be re-opened during the Parliament of 1903-6? The bookkeeping period expires in October, 1906, five years after the imposition of a uniform Tariff, which is the time when the re-opening of the Tariff might fairly be suggested. It was the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs who, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, noted the coincidence, and it was he who stated that the people had said definitely^, and that the State of Queensland, for one, had declared absolutely, that there should be no re-opening of the Tariff during the bookkeeping period. honourable member on that side but said or agreed without reservation that the Tariff should remain untouched during the life-time of the approaching Parliament. because we believed it to be best in the interests of the industries concerned? to be best in the interests of protection. The honourable member was reported in the Argus the other day to have said that, although he did not like the Tariff, it was to be at rest for five or six years, and he was glad of it. did not say it, we have another to add to the numerous instances of mis-reporting of which we have heard so much. We protectionists pledged ourselves, bad as we thought the Tariff to be in many respects, to leave it alone, and to fight those who wished to re-bpen it for the purpose of reducing duties. This has been spoken of as though it were a battle between the two parties in which the victors named their terms; but it was nothing of the kind. The two contending parties went to the Arbitration Court-the people of Australiaand obtained an award, and now those in whose favour the award was given-no t those against whom the matter was decided -wis h to re-open, it without going back to the Court. They have no right to do so. If we protectionists believed that the Tariff should be re-opened in order to do justice, the first thing we should demand is a dissolution and a general election, in order to obtain a fresh mandate from the people on the subject. The re-opening of the Tariff was suggested in this House for the first time on the 20th July by the giving of the following notice of motion by the honourable member for Bourke:That, in the opinion of this House, the existing Customs Tariff is unscientific in its operation and mischievous in its effects; and that, with a special view to the promotion of the agricultural and manufacturing industries and the more settled employment of all classes of workers, a re-adjustment of its incidence on some of its leading lines is highly desirable. That motion first appeared on the notice paper on the 26th July, when the Watson Administration had been beaten on clause 48, and had just succeeded in carrying, by a single vote, the amendment in clause 62 which was taken in preference to mine. They had also been beaten on their proThere was not an posal to include the navigation clauses in the Arbitration Bill. It was then recognised that the Bill would probably go through this House in the form in which it stood at the time, and the line of cleavage between honourable members in reference to it had become apparent. The Watson Government had also declared that they would make the re-amendment of clause 48 vital to their existence. That was when we first heard of the re-opening of the Tariff dent that the notice of motion first appeared then. take of the question, as free-traders or protectionists, I , as a protectionist, say that a great cause has been prostituted for party purposes by honourable members who wish to go behind the decision of their own Arbitration Court-the people of Australia. The day upon which the honourable member for Bland gave notice of his motion of want of confidence, the honourable and learned member for Indi immediatelv beforehand gave notice of a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the operation of the Tariff on specific lines. He gave notice of that motion on a Thursday, and had it set down on the business-paper for the following day. namely, Friday. Now, private members' business is taken on Thursday*.

Minister has declared, protectionists and free-traders alike are prepared to make the fullest inquiry into the operation of the Tariff. We do not desire a Commission which will sit indefinitely, and postpone the consideration of the question for ever. That is not the object of the Government. We recognise that, some time or other, the Tariff question will re-arise in an active form, and that honourable members must sooner or later range themselves as protectionists or free-traders. Government do then? whatever honest conduct requires under the circumstances. We have, up to the present, shown our desire to act honestly. We are prepared to appoint a Royal Commission for the consideration of every complaint that may be submitted on behalf of any industry. We shall not confine the investigation of the Commission to the position of a few favoured industries which a majority of honourable members may select; we are prepared to consider the complaints of every industry affected by the Tariff. It must be remembered that the inquiry will have to extend over the whole of Australia. position of Victorian industries alone, though some honourable members would like the investigation to be so confined. remedy as quickly as possible. ist as I am, I shall not show myself as provincial as that. for Melbourne Ports impliedly suggested it.

The honourable member yearns for a dissolution. I venture to say that most honourable members being merely human, however willingly they may face a dissolution, do not yearn for it. The yearning is confined to a few altruistic breasts. The honourable member, I am afraid, has acquired a vitiated taste 1 for a series of elections. Can anything be fairer than the position I have stated ? I quarrel with the proposal of fhe honourable and learned member for Indi in its details. He proposes:That a Royal Commission, consisting of Members of Parliament, selected by the respective Houses, should be at once appointed to inquire and report as to the injurious effect produced by the present Tariff upon certain Australian industries, which are to be specifically referred to such Commission after determination by this House. Personally, I should prefer to see the Commission composed of gentlemen who are not Members of Parliament. Take myself as an illustration to me to be proceeding to discuss a matter regarding which a notice of motion appears upon the paper. I would ask him not to do that. I have permitted him to refer incidentally to the subject for a certain time, and he may continue to follow that course, but if he proceeds to discuss the proposal contained in the motion, he will be out of order. transgressed. It is difficult to know where to draw the line in these matters.

The honourable and learned member for Indi, in the course of an interview, has gone one better than that. He says"" We must pass an Act at once, describing exactly what preferences are to be given."" He says that what is proposed by the honourable member for Hume is not enough, and the old rivalry between those two hon; orable members goes on apace. It is quite interesting to watch their eagerness to outdo each other in promoting the welfare of the community. My view of this matter has been, and is still-and I venture to hope that it has some authority-that a fair opportunity should be afforded to ascertain the view of this House on the question of preferential trade. that if any honourable member prominently identified with the question were to ask for an opportunity for a discussion in the House upon the subject, in order that our views may be communicated to the people of Great Britain, the Cabinet would do their best to grant the requestopportunity. honourable members want. I am suggesting that an opportunity should be afforded for discussing the matter in this House; but honourable members opposite do not want that. They wish the matter to be discussel by the joint party at an early date. What are they going to decide? I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa cheering the views of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the subject of raising the Customs duties against the foreigner, in order to enable us to give a preference to Great Britain. Surelv the proper place to discuss this subject is not at a secret meeting of the ioint partu on the Opposition side, but in this House, where all members will have an opportunity to consider the matter. If honourable members opposite came into office to-morrow, would preferential trade be a plank of their platform, or an open question? a plank of our platform. taken, the honourable member in his speech upon the Address-in-Reply made some remarks that were not at all friendly to preferential trade. Did he not say, "" What is the good of talking about preferential trade until our own people have been provided for,"" or something of that sort. I suppose now as then. preferential trade an open question. party, call them the dishcloth party. party-the great Victorian alliance. I think that in view of the statements being made at home, it is only fair that this House should have an opportunity to express its views upon preferenial trade, and I have no objection to that opportunity being afforded in a reasonable way. will the Government take? I feel quite satisfied know that members of the Government take different views as to what should be done in this matter, just as honourable members opposite do. Honourable members are divided upon certain clauses in the Arbitration Bill, and any Cabinet composed of free-traders and protectionists must hold differing views upon such a subject as preferential trade. Any Cabinet that might be formed of honourable members from the Opposition benches would also hold differing views, and upon that question would be, to all intents and purposes, a coalition Cabinet. There is one other matter connected with.the fiscal issue to which I desire to refer, and that is the Manufactures Encouragement B ill .

That is the joint action suggested I say that the proposal of the Government to allow the matter to be discussed, and to ascertain whether honourable members are willing to stand by their views -to support 1 the Bill or oppose it-is infinitely better than the half-and-half proposals in the alliance programme. I wish now to say a few words regarding one or two articles in that programme. Article3 states that each' member of the alliance is to use his influence individually and collectively with its organizations and supporters, to secure support for and immunity from opposition to members of either party during the currency of the_alliance, which is for this Parliament and the next. Upon Sunday evening last the honourable member for Bland, in addressing a meeting at the Queen's Hall, saidWe are, it is true, bound to use our influence t-j prevent opposition by our party to those who are allied with us. But is not that right? WouldI not be false to my principles if I believed a man to be helping us and did not use my influence with my party to secure him from opposition? But that does"" not prevent us using our influence i 1 favour of any man whom the organizations may decide to bring forward. In last week's Tocsin, too, I read a signed article by Mr Anstey, M.L.A., in which he expressed a very decided view as to what the labour organizations would do. I also read a speech delivered by Mr Scott Bennett some ten days ago at Ballarat, in which he expressed very pronounced opinions as to what the Victorian Labour Party would do. Bland was unable to promise that his organizations would give the support that ought to be extended to every member of any decent alliance. He had not the authority to make that promise. Of course it mayhappen that a leader who has authority to make a promise may make it and afterwards find that those for whom he has spoken, will not back him up. Labour Party had no authority to make a promise, and he owns it. Mr Scott Bennett, M.L.A., saysHe would leave the party and sink once more into private life, and sacrifice the position he held at the present time rather than lose his principles by mixing with such a gang. He does not call it an alliance. have heard the honourable and learned member called a "" robber,"" but I do not think that he is one. him that. able member for Coolgardie saying something to that effect. produce the statement. upon which thirty-nine honourable, members voted for the imposition of a duty, and twenty-five against it, and the honourable member said, "" It only requires one more to make up forty thieves."" made after a division upon a no-confidence motion. by the Minister's own leader, in which he designated the protectionists ""plunderers."" But there are honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber who have said exactly the same. WhatI have said was in reply to the honourable member for Yarra. I have not uttered a single word in regard to that sort of thing during the whole morning, unless I have first been challenegd by honourable members opposite. I am aware that free-traders have spoken of protectionists in unmeasured terms. They believe that a protective policy is so wrong that certain results will follow its operation. But in making those statements they do not reflect upon the personal integrity of protectionists. port bearing upon the remark of the honorThe honourable member for able member for Coolgardie, to which reference has been made. member's statement in regard to it was quite correct. The remark in question was made upon a no-confidence motion. again. "" But in this case, the leader of the the honourable and learned member I am content. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the question of old-age pensions. In .the Labour Party's platform this plank is summed up in three words, namely, ""old-age pensions.""

In the programme of the alliance, however, as finally agreed to, I find the following:Old-age pensions upon a basis fair and equitable to the several States and to individuals. As1 have previously stated, the platform of the Labour Party merely contains the words "" old-age pensions."" able member for Bland says that, irrespective of whether or not the States agree to it, the alliance will adopt a scheme of old-age pensions. whether the words "" fair and equitable to the several States and to individuals "" were inserted before or after the honourable member for Barker came to Melbourne? thing whatever to do with it. with the other matter. again. do the words "" upon a basis fair and equitable to the several States andto individuals "" mean. They can only mean that the States must agree to some arrangement by which pensions shall be granted. Otherwise the scheme will not come into operation.

For my own part I say frankly that I cannot agree to Federal direct taxation. finds the Federal authority putting its hand into his right breeches pocket, and the State authority putting its hand into his left breeches pocket. fore, means that the Federal authority shall assist the State authorities in further raiding the taxpayer's left breeches pocket. It means that there must be a Federal, as well as a State, land tax. way of putting it. cannot suggest 'any way of raising the money required for the payment of old-age pensions, except by arrangement with the States. We certainly cannot take it out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. was a printer's Mr KI NG O'MALLEY -We shall take a portion of it out of tlie profits derived from the establishment of a State tobacco monopoly. orable member that the establishment of such a monopoly means that we shall lose the whole of the revenue at present collected by the excise upon tobacco.

The question would immediately be asked, "" Where is our cheap tobacco? Why do you not give us the I should like to ask benefit accruing from your assumption of ownership by reducing the price?"" If honourable members think that there will be bigger profit from this source than the excise, I venture to say they take a view different from that of the ordinary elector. I want to refer to one other condition of the alliance as follows: Any member of the Parliament who agrees to this alliance may, subject to the approval of both parties, be admitted to it. "" Subject to the approval of both parties"" ! Before an honourable member can join the Opposition (branch of. fhe Protectionist Party, he has to get the consent of the Labour Party. of the alliance.

But what about honourable members who did not vote in that direction? What about the honourable and learned -member for Indi, who voted for the Bill? What about the stand which that honourable and learned miember took in regard to the inclusion of railway servants under the Arbitration Bill? We on this side have been taunted because we accepted that Bill containing a public service clause; but I opposed that clause because I believed it to be unconstitutional. The honourable and learned member for Indi, however, would not,say whether the clause was or was not constitutional, but he characterized the provision as in the highest degree inexpedient. learned member for Indi did not say that the clause was unconstitutional. learned member for Indi would not say whether it was or was not constitutional; but he did say that it was in the highest degree Inexpedient and most improper to have such a clause in the Bill. That honor 'able and learned member has more 'difficulty in swallowing a clause of that kind than have some honourable members who believe the clause to be unconstitutional, and who are satisfied that the High Court will so decide. with great rapidity .sometimes. Expediency varied in the alliance programme between the 5th and the 8th September, and it will probably vary between the 29th September and the ist Octoberi f circumstances justify the variation. I I gave myself, but in conclusion, that, with other honourable members on. this side, I have been subject during the last six weeks to a great deal of abuse. For example, I have been I do not propose to make taunted with having personal motivestaunted not by one member but by a score. I have drawn attention to the fact that before a division was taken on tEe 23rd June, I announced that, w in or lose, I r should support the Arbitration Bill. I am In reference afraid that some honourable members must have forgotten that announcement; but I may say that when I made it, I meant to abide by it. I should have supported the Bill whatever the result, but, naturally, I preferred a Bill in the form which I believed to be the best. Honourable members on this side have also had to submit to the taunt of "" sand-bagging,"" and of having been guilty of unfair play. I have endeavoured to fairly state the facts which led up to the division when the Watson Government went out of office; and I venture to say that the electors, when they consider those facts impartially, will f u l l y absolve every honourable member on this side, and, I admit, every honourable member on the other side, from ba-ving done anything unfair or politically improper. We differed extremely on a point of considerable importance-that is, at first; but subsequently, owing to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bland being in his view nearly the same as my own, we differed very little. I did not know, The honourable and and I do not know now, why the Watson Government made the matter vital. I can think of only one reason, namely, that they feared t h e ' amendment they had agreed to had gone too far, and they felt, from their point of view, that they must take a stand, because the preference to unionists amendment, relating to political objects, was one the unions did not approve. But whatever their reason-and I do not ascribe wrong motives of any kind-it is only fair that those charges of "" sand-bagging and unfair or improper conduct should cease. If I have said a single word in the course of my speech which ascribes any improper motives or conduct to any honourable member, I have to express 'my regret. I spoke more warmly when referring to the honourable and learned member for Corio than perhaps I should have done on another occasion. I can only say that the honourable and learned I find member promised to produce a letter in this have far exceeded the time limit House, and for that letter I wait.

Progressive legislation of a cautious but thoroughly democratic character of protection is, it is stated, to be the main objective of the new body. The decision arrived at has no relation to the immediate crisis. Whether Mr Reid form a Government, or the Watson Ministry obtain a dissolution, the new organization is to be set going. I should like to ask if the honourable and learned member for Ballarat communicated that information? member for Ballarat knew all about it. It will fight for its principles in the House of Representatives and on the platform and in the country, no matter what stop-gap Government occupies the Treasury benches. The words "" stop-gap Government "" indicate the nature of the communication. It was known what the division list would be -it was known that the Watson Government would be beaten by two votes. The next day there is a further reference in the Melbourne Age, headed "" Meeting of Liberal Protectionists,"" as follows: The solidarity of the Liberal-Protectionist Paity in the House of Representatives, and its determination to maintain its identity and usefulness, despite the extraordinary attitude of Mr thon, Mr Higgins, Mr Mauger, MrL .

Having done that duty to the country, we need fear no result. that it has become the fashion in this House, on motions of censure, and also on other motions, to delay decision by proextraordinary composition of the present Golonged speeches. that honourable members on one side are more to blame in this respect than honourable rr.tmbers on the other; but I do think that the Minister of Defence, who spoke last, and who contributed a speech lasting nearly three hours Mrj McCAY -Tw o hours and twentty minutes, to be accurate. Mi. learned gentleman might very well have eliminated the two hours, for everything he said pertinent or relevant to the subject could have been uttered in twenty minutes.

I believe that this House and the country knows sufficient of the facts whole Ministry. Out of eieht members in not to accept any partisan interpretation of them. Windy declarations cannot obscure the fact that the late Government were denied the privilege usually accorded to Governments of reconsidering, under proper circumstances, an amendment to an important measure, carried by a snatch vote in Committee. The country will know also that the amendment was one which, in the opinion of those for whom we intended to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the workers of Australia, would render that measure of little use. workers. workers are not members of unions, but the great majority of Australian democrats, the men who have rendered advanced legislation possible, are members of industrial unions. I say that the action of the majority, in taking the business of the House out of the hands of the Government on the occasion referred to, has no parallel in the parliamentary history of Australia. An Honorable MEMBER --There is no precedent for it anywhere. conceive such procedure being adopted by any party with even rudimentary appreciation of fair play. The last speaker sought to cloud the main issue by digressions having only a remote bearing upon it. An opponent might accept many of his conclusions, so unimportant are they, without in any degree mitigating his antagonism to the present Ministry. Those of his fallacies which are calculated to mislead the House on any material point will, no doubt, be exposed by subsequent speakers. WhatI should first like to draw attention to is the I do not mean to say vernment. Prime Minister cheers that statement. means by contrast with the last Government. trations, and any comparison must be to the. disadvantage of the existing one. The last Government, at all events, fairly represented the various States of Australia, with, perhaps, one exception. Looking at we see that the two principal States of the Commonwealth practically dominate the the Cabinet, New South Wales and Victoria are represented by six. The Prime Minister now professes the utmost solicitude for the effacement of the unhappy jealousies that have been rife in the several States, yet, in forming his Government, he supplied some of the States with a first-class grievance. He has practically ignored the smaller States in the formation of his Ministry. Certainly he has given Queensland and South Australia representation in the Cabinet, but not from this House; so we have the curious and sinister situation that the two larger States control the entire Cabinet in the House of Representatives. It is true that all I ask the right honourable gentleman why he passed over Western Australia in forming his Government.

I cannot put my hand on the quotation at the moment, and, therefore, I propose to read from Hansard, a few extracts as to the right honourable gentleman's opinion of the Tariff, which he previously pared to carry on.

In contrast with this artificially constructed paradise of labour every other country in the world has proved more attractive than Victoria. I am told that Victoria is becoming a ruinous place even for lawyers, and when a country is in that state it is almost near its end.

I thought that these little sidelights on past history might prove interesting to the House. debate as this, to one like the honourable member for Corangamite, who had not an opportunity of being present during the last Parliament. I have shown that the Prime Minister denounced the Tariff as a robbery of the wage-earners, and' I will prove from his own remarks, made after the Tariff was passed, that he actually advocated what he now condemns in the honourable and learned member for Indi. I will quote first what he said on the 15th January, 1902, after the Tariff had become operative: The Government brought in a tolerably sound protective Tariff. . . . We, on this side, who consider that the Tariffhas been moulded on absolutely wrong principles, have a very difficult task in endeavouring to alter it ; but it must be understood that we in no sense recognised the Tariff when altered as being founded on sound principles. I call the attention of the House especially to this passageIt is impossible to create a hybrid production such as this Tariff will be, without having a number of striking anomalies which must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity possible. The honourable and learned member for Indi and those who are acting with him have in that declaration by the present Prime Minister sufficient justification for advocating the reopening of the Tariff. The Prime Minister cannot get over his declaration that there are a number of striking anomalies in the Tariff which must be radically altered at the first opportunity possible. In view of this declaration that the Tariff must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity, how can the Prime Minister resist the demand for revision? electors decided against me. I have to bow to the will of the people, as every good democrat does. 8 Q r gentleman cannot get over the passage that I will next read. cannot get over. gentleman is pretty bulky, but I believe he can get through most obstacles. He came to Western Australia in 1903, and on the 20th January he made the following statement to an interviewer representing a newspaper known as the West Australian. able gentleman cannot get over he will repudiate. Is that so? Would he repudiate the interview if it were favorable to his present position? He said thisHe had a profound conviction that the Tariff, not only was thoroughly unsound and injurious, but that the people would at the earliest opportunity repudiate it. He believed, if he were content to sink the fiscal issue and allow the Tariff to stand, the Free-trade l'arty would come into power without any delay. talk. the statementBut he was not in the public life of Australia to make clever arrangements of that sort. that I would not sink the fiscal issue, but it sunk me. quite so bad as that, though it is clear enough that some people at times get very low down. Then the Prime Minister went on to sayAnd he was determined to fight for a genuine revenue Tariff. Then it is claimed that the right honourable gentleman came into power to restore responsible government. vernment. oe measured by bulk there is no doubt that r the Prime Minister has restored it. But I take it that responsible government is not to be restored by a Government which puts before this House a programme of absolutely rion-contentious measures, and wherever it mentions a Bill about which it is possible to have two opinions informs the country that the members of the Cabinet have a free hand.

The Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department, Post and Telegraph Department, Melbourne. Dear Sir, In reference to your advertisement in the Commonwealth Gazette, that you will receive tenders in Adelaide on the 21st September next for telegraph material, as verbally explained to you today, I beg leave to point out that on a former occasion, when I tendered for such material, although my price was the lowest, my tender was declined, on the ground that you were giving the preference to goods of British manufacture. As I am agent here for Messrs. John A. Roeblings, Sons and Co., of New York, and would be offering their well-known manufactures, I have been asked by these friends whether it is still your intention to give a preference as regards price for British goods. In an article like copper wire, the difference in price between British or other manufacture would only amount to a few shillings per ton, so you can see there is no room for any margin, and if there was such a preference given, my friends would not care to go to the expense of cabling over their tender. I shall be much obliged if you will kindly let me have a reply as to this to-morrow, so as to enable me to write to New York by Saturday's mail. If there was not any preference as to price, I should, of ccurse, be very glad to submit a tender on account of Messrs. Roebling's, as before. I am, dear sir, Yours faithfully, ALEX. FRASER. Upon that I wrote this As the writer says the difference in price between British and American wire is small, I think he may be informed that we intend to take the British article -H.M., member is blaming the Government for doing the same thing. given the agent to save him the expense of cabling. I recollect the incident. My impression at the time was, and this letter shows it, that the difference at stake would be represented by shillings rather than by pounds, and that there was no real advantage in taking the American article. As this agent wanted the information at once, and did not appear desirous of obtaining the contract, it was to his advantage, and to that of the Department, to act as I did. honourable member for adopting that course; but he has declared that he did not do so. eral could not find something stronger than that to support his statement, it would have been wiser of him to have kept it in the background. member is blaming others for doing what he himself did. politician who, having made free-trade the great cause of his life, declares that he lives politically only to advance its triumph, who secures office through its instrumentality, repudiating his professions when in power and practising protection. I regret having to introduce into this debate anything of a personal character; but the speech delivered a few evenings ago by the right honourable member for Swan compels me to do so. For a man of such broad and generous instincts, I think that he betrayed almost incredible pettiness upon that occasion. He was good enough to say that I am his per>sonal friend. I do hope that the relationship is reciprocal, and that he is also my friend. If he is, all I can say is that he has a very remarkable way of manifesting his friendship. What has he done ? I think that he has really misrepresented facts, not merely for the purpose of damaging me, but to injure the other labour representatives of Western Australia in conminutenexion with the Transcontinental Railway. He also went to the length of threatening opposition to me. Of course I suppose that the opposition will come, and that I must i^/y/'on. meet it as best I can.

The preservation to the world of this unity and solidarity is the reason why its meetings are in secret and no record is kept. Of course there may be from time to time comparatively unimportant measures which are allowed to be open. Buti f a measure is of sufficient importance to appear in the opening speech, or later, to be proposed as a Government measure, a 'Minister must agree to it in to to or resign. If he so far differs when he has ceased to be a Minister, he can, by permission of the Crown, explain to Parliament why he has resigned, f t is because of his oath as an Executive Minister that he must have permission to explain to Parliament his resignation.

786,,"Sir JOHN FORREST I am quite contentsorry that I have been obliged by these interruptions and interjections to detain the House so long. The right honourable gentleman's action towards the Labour Party is very unjust, and if hefindshimself to-day a derelict politician, high and dry on the back benches in this House, he has to thank himself a good deal for it. His own actions have largely influenced the course of events in that regard. I regret very much that he is not representing Western Australia in this Ministry. It is little short of impertinence for the Prime Minister to say that he is going to be the reprehe should have arrested them. sentative of the western State in the Cabinet. It is a curious coincidence that when the right honourable member for Swan denied the gold-fields representation in the State Parliament, he made precisely the same excuse which the Prime Ministei now makes for shunting him aside. The right honourable member for Swan then declared that he would act for the miners in Parliament. This personal affront to the right honourable member for Swan, and this injustice to Western Australia is now being justified by precisely the same pretext used to disfranchise the 'gold-fields. fluence though, as if he were in the Cabinet. Buti f Western Australia has to depend upon the Prime Minister for representation, then God help that State. We shall take care that the Ministry does not neglect it, and.I feel sure that the right honourable member for -Swan will be with us in that respect. I hope that this motion will be carried first of all, because I regard the Ministerial combination as hopelessly immoral. It is composed of men who have absolutely nothing in common, except a hatred of the progressive party in this House, and of democratic legislation. It is not in the interests of this country that men who show so little regard for political principles should be intrusted with the administration of great Departments. Australia should not trust its destinies to men who carry out a policy in which they say they do not believe. Prime Minister declaiming against the operation of the White Australia policy, and yet carrying it out. tralia policy. to contract labour. The Prime Minister was grossly unjust to his predecessor in the Department. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney carried out the law as he believed it should be carried out, and the right honourable gentleman had ample opportunity of reversing that policy if he chose to do so. It is mere hypocrisy for him to pretend that he had no option but to adopt the policy of his predecessor. He is in a responsible position now, and if he is the man he professes to be before the House, he should have had the courage of his convictions, and whatever stage these proceedings might have reached For these reasons, amongst others, I trust this motion will be carried. The country never called these gentlemen to take up the reins of government. On the contrary, the constituencies pronounced against them. They hold office in abrogation of constitutional principles, and in flat defiance of the people's will. Do they challenge this statement? If so, why do they cower at' the mere mention of a dissolution ? We invite-nay , we challenge-the m to remit the issue to the electors. They tremble at the prospect because they know, as we do, that an appeal. to the country is to them equivalent to a sentence of death. They know, as we do, that it means the disappearance of most of the reactionary politician's who surround them, and the triumph of the party of progress, whose policy I am convinced makes' for the true welfare of the people of Australia.
