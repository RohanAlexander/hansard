23,Mr Joseph Cook,"To displaythat I cannot suit h i m both ways. understand that under our present arrangement, and with the present outlook, the completed rolls w ill be displayed for about sixteen days, and all names not appearing on them w ill have to be enrolled on the supplementary rolls, which are bound to be large. We cannot help that. The circumstances are abnormal, and we have to administer the Act as we find it . list include those who have registered during the sixteen days? the Postmaster-General, I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a matter which I think has serious import in connection with the coming elections, and, with your permission, sir, I should like to preface my question with a few words. I have recently received from a postmaster a notice that in future all letters addressed to my last place of residence will be forwarded to the dead letter office. The Prime Minister must see that a regulation of that kind w ill have a most important bearing on men who get a twenty days' notice to show reasons why their names should not be struck off the roll. I am told that in Adelaide a new regulation has been issued which instructs postmasters that, in the case of persons who have removed to a new locality, all letters addressed to the former residence must be sent to the dead letter office. W ill the Prime Minister make inquiries into this matter ? realize all the hearings of the question which the honourable member has asked. I advise him to put the question on the notice-paper, and I shall have the matter f u l l y inquired into during the day. am coming more and more to the conclusion that one of the best ways of getting a proper roll, of stopping duplication, is to put the penal clauses of the Act into operation. ' done sol have never been applied. some instances. some persons have been prosecuted lately. on the ground that we cannot get a clean suppose that for every hundred irregutions I larities one person gets fined; and, what is more, if we were to p ut the Act strictly in force, my honourable friends would have the greatest outcry about their ears. is right, why not do it? is, if the honourable member desires my opinion, that we want a new Act very badly. ter whether, in his consultation last night with the Leader of the Opposition, he discussed the advisability of introducing In the absence of electors' rights for the forthcoming election? not discuss the general provisions of an Electoral B ill . The only thing we were considering was how best to wind up this Parliament, so that one side or the other can get an authority from the electors to get a new Electoral Act. We w ill never do any good with the Act in its present form. ing statement, made by the permanent head of the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department before a Select Committee on electoral matters in 1913The rolls used at tht elections were undoubtedly the most effective that have existed since the establishment of the Commonwealth, and unquestionably the electors as a body were more nearly enrolled for the electorates in which they lived at the time of the closing of the rolls than on .any previous occasion. The poll taken on the 31st May, 1913, was the heaviest poll ever taken in Australia. Official inquiries do not disclose that any organized system of improper voting was resorted to; if any cases of improper voting did occur, they were apparently isolated cases, and had no effect on the result of any returnon what grounds does the Prime MinisI ter now allege, w i th the view of influencing the electors of the country, that the present Electoral Act is most unsuitable, and that we should have a new one ?

That is what he says. able members cease interjecting? direct the attention of the right honourable member to the many suggestions for improvement which have emanated from that officer himself? May I direct his attention to the last conference of Mr which has been, growing up of indulging Oldham with his State officers on this very matter, and the strong representations there made to get a different set of regulations altogether to deal with the absent voting. I invite the right honourable member to get to the mind of the Ohief Electoral Oflicer, and, if he does, both he and his confreres will agree to some very substantial alterations being made, even before the next vote is taken. All that I want to say is that when these statements are made they are not the officers' statements, hut the right honourable member's. That is the trouble with the latter. He never quotes a correct statement, and sticks to it. He quotes a statement, and then says something quite different as a deduction. statement is wrong? all right, but the argument is the other way round. wrong statement in my life, or a misleading one. versations across the floor are disorderly. view.

I must ask honourable members to cease this practice in a chorus of cross-firing across the chamber, and unnecessary interjections. Honourable members should support the Chair in preserving order, and allow every honourable member to ask a question, and the Minister to answer it, without attempts on. the part of other honourable members to get in other questions at the same time on the one side, or to endeavour simultaneously to answer the same question on the other. Questions may not be asked by any member while seated, and this applies also to answers, ter see that insufficiently addressed claim cards to Electoral Registrars, which are obviously on electoral matters, are opened' and taken to the Electoral Registrars, in stead of being forwarded to the dead-letter oflice? member asks me a very serious question, namely, whether we are prepared to differentiate the regulations relating to insufficiently addressed letters connected with electoral matters.

I found that he had taken an office in a portion of the city, totally removed from the great body of the electors of East Sydney, and I endeavoured to interview him to see if he could have his office moved to the nearest possible spot to suit the electors. I likewise found that he had no conveniences to conduct the business of the office. He told me that he had borrowed a table and a chair, and I said that that state of things ought not to continue. I also found that he had no telephone communication. I thought it my business to make this statement here, so that these officers might be given proper facilities to carry out their duties. I also found that this officer hardly knew a street in the electorate, and I likewise told him that I would give hi m the names of persons who would be of great assistance to him in his present position. explanation, let'me assure the honourable member that I acquit him of any wrongdoing.

I shall secure the information. desire, as a personal explanation, to correct a report that appeared in the Argus this morning relative to the conference that took place between the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General and the honourable member for West Sydney and myself yesterday. The report is not only garbled, but Avords are put in in inverted commas that were never uttered, and that are not true in fact. The words I complain of most areWhen the leader ( Mr Fisher) was asked if any decision had been come to, he stated that thero was nothing to be said about the meeting. "" All that happened,"" said Mr Fisher, "" was that the Prime Minister and I came to an arrangement on a-certain matter, but just before we met at dinner-time he varied what he had said. We met again to-night, so that thc Opposition might hear what we had done afterwards."" As that statement has been made, the Prime Minister will permit me to say that we met prior to the dinner hour, and came to certain conclusions. Subsequently, near the time of the rising of the House, the Prime Minister asked to see me, and made a statement varying one of the understandings that we had arrived at.

The honourable member must not make a reflection on the Parliament. should not reflect on the Parliament, but you will pardon me, I hope, if , in speaking, not excitedly, but collectedly aud judicially, I should use any words which are not parliamentary. reflection I made, because I do not want this speech to be sullied or stained with anything that is not strictly parliamentary. the Parliament just the reverse of what I expected to find it when my aspirations led this way thirty-four years ago. For that period I have fought in the democratic movement-no t as-a hireling of the movement, not as one of the men who have looked for a Government job when they have been out of work, and preyed on the Government, or done anything of that kind, not as one of the men who have always been looking for a paid position when they have been outside of Parliament, but as one of those who believed that a cause which was worth fighting for was worth working for-nay , worthy making some sacrifice for. These years I have put, into this movement, not only with the accord of my better-half, but with the sympathy that any true man would value of both my wife and my daughter, who have joined me in travelling in the democratic path of reform, and it is hard to think that I am in a Parliament where the Government, if they get power in both Houses, will upset the whole of what has been done in this country for the last thirty years. a blow at manhood suffrage by a re-distributio n of the senatorial electorates if they get the power. They showed us last session what they were prepared to do by their Electoral B ill , when they proposed to undermine the secrecy of the ballot, the most valuable and sacred thing which Democracy possesses. They have shown us what they were prepared to do with a majority of one, and he in the Speaker's chair. What will they came into this Parliament as I do if they can get an unfettered majority in each House? If that should occur, this Parliament and the country itself will be put back a quarter of a century before the party that may come after us rises to the seriousness of the position, and again realizes its obligation to posterity. Before that party gets a chance to undo what the present Government will do if they come back with a majority in both Houses this generation w ill have passed away, and another generation will I know, sir, that I only live to read the records of those who betrayed the country for the sake of a paltry reward, of holding office for its emoluments-no t for the honour, because in such instances it cannot be an honour. you know. honour to hold office in circumstances like I will say, instead, that I found these.

I do not know why there should be any words to use against the King's representative, serious objection to informing the House and the country as to the f u l l text of the recommendation of the Government, and I know it is an absolute the reply of the Governor General thereto. It does not matter to me whether there is precedent or not; the Government have broken through many of the most cherished traditions of Parliament which it is I rise to a point of order. suggested we should hug to our bosoms. In my opinion section 57 of the Constitution has practically been abrogated by the advice given and accepted. It is, I know, out of order to criticise H is Majesty's representative, but honourable I said, that what the members and the citizens generally are entitled to know exactly what passed when a double dissolution was asked for and granted. The people have to find the £80,000 to pay for the general election, and, as the most interested parties, they should be made aware of what transpired. Last night the honourable member for Kennedy referred to the occasion when the late Sir Thomas Bent asked for and obtained a dissolution of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. When the new House was returned after the geneI wish to call attenral election, it was urged that, to put it mildly, correct advice had not been given to the State Governor, and the Government were called upon to lay on the table of the House -the f u l l correspondence and records of conversations I withdraw the words, that had taken place when the dissolution was granted. All that information was embodied in a parliamentary paper, and is now on record. My own opinion is that the Governor General is very much concerned in connection with section 57, and with the dissolution recently granted. I do not propose to criticise His Excellency, but I may point out that members of a State Parliament of a different I say that Mr complexion of politics from that of Labour have criticised the action of GoverOrder! nors in the past.

210,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [12.25]. Tude Of His Responsibility. These Were Strong,"but if dissolutions were to be permitted as they had been in recent days the pistol was pointed at the forehead of representative government in a way that would cause serious students of the problem to feel a great anxiety for the future. The inevitable result for the future would be that men might be threatened by the man who held the power with the terrors of a dissolution, and if they were weak-kneed would refrain from casting a vote in the in terests of freedom and material prosperity. This would be one of the great and important constitutional issues that would have to be fought immediately the new Parliament met. So it appears, from the language used hy prominent members of the State Parliaamendments to legislation is a very real oue. ment, that they had no hesitation on the If thc Senate chooses to assert itself as a hustings, and even after being elected, in factor in party government tliere is nothing in speaking very boldly and plainly in rethc law of the Constitution to prevent it . spect to the advice tendered by the Goof The vernment to the Governor, and even with to strengthen the Senate, for it is entitled to respect to the reply given to that advice exercise an effective control by means less by the Governor himself. Professor Harrison Moore, one of the the bringing the machinery of government great constitutional authorities of the to a stand-still-is a contingency so remote as Commonwealth, published in 1910 a very hardly comprehensive work on the Australian Federal Constitution. In this he said the He was dealing there with the financial following with regard to section 57Tlie solution is curious and unique. In the first place it w ill be noted that the scheme ber was not within the range of practical applies only to measures initiated in the House politics, because machinery had been proof Kepresentatives, a fact significant of the vided whereby an amicable settlement parts which the two Houses were expected to could be arrived at. play in government. Secondly, tliero is ample that he thought could occur was in conprovision made for delay and for consideration by the House, and there is no obstacle to nexion with some financial measure, and a resort to the familiar means of conference. I believe that is correct. The application of the principle of dissolution lieve the present situation is a dead-lock at to the second chamber is not wholly a novelty, all. and was inspired in a measure by the Constitution of Soutli Australia. But in South Auscan be regarded as real. Only when there tralia a dissolution of the Legislative Assembly is no possibility of carrying measures for must precede the dissolution of both Houses, the national benefit can there be said to and the Constitution of the Commonwealth be a dead-lock between the two Houses.

All tlie States have Agricultural Bureaux, and a great deal of money is spent by them in t r y in g to educate farmers, pastoralists, vignerons, and others in their respective avocations. In the circumstances, therefore, I thought it very wrong that the Prime Minister, who pretended that he was anxious to restore sound financial administration, should propose to spend probably £100,000 per annum in duplicating a great deal of the work at present being carried on by the States. I repeat that the Government deserve the censure of the people of Australia for bringing about a double dissolution. They had no right to secure one.

Honourable members opposite strive to appear cheerful, but we know that they have been dragged at the heels of the Attorney-General, who is the most intolerant Conservative in Australia. The honourable gentleman has a tyrannical type of mind, and would ride rough-shod over the poorer classes. He believes that they ought to be kept down, and that their proper place is that of hewers of wood and drawers of water. It would be well for us, perhaps, to occupy the few remaining hours of the session-and , after all, I am not quite sure that they will be few; everything depends on the way in which the Ministry conduct themselves I would remind the honduring the next day or two-in contrasting our policy with the performance of the present Government. We have previously described them as a Ministry of bunglers. They bungled with the sugar excise, the small-pox outbreak, and the quarantine system. They bungled in a dozen different ways.

The PRIME MINISTER ( Mr Joseph Cook) When opportunity offers. All these answers to my questions may he seen in Hansard of 15th May, 1914. The point that I wish to make is that if the Ministry could "" gag "" the Postal Vote Restoration B ill through this House last year, and the Government Preference Prohibition B ill last session, and again this session, it was in their power to pass all the measures I have just outlined through the House of Representatives. Indeedi t would not have been necessary to "" g a g "" these measures through the House. whole of them on their merits. We might possibly have proposed certain amendments, and, having regard to the history of the present Government, it is only reasonable to assume tliat it would have been necessary for us to do so. I take the view that the Attorney-General, who is leading the Ministerial party, and who has enforced his wil l upon them, does not desire the passing of any legislation of a progressive character, although he would be quite willing to pass legislation imposing further burdens upon that section of the community which is .^really unable to bear any increased burden. We have in this community several classes of politicians. There is, for instance, the politician who does not believe in any change whatever. People who think in that way are to be found principally amongst the large in vestors of capital. They do not wish any change, because they think that any change will be bad for them. A year or two ago it was suggested that Parliament should be shut up altogether, and we should cease to multiply Acts of Parliament. That would be satisfactory to large capitalists, whose time is chiefly taken up . in looking through stock and share lists, and watching the operations of companies in which their capital is in vested. They may be getting 10 per cent, out of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, 5 per cent, or more from Burns, Philp and Co., 10 per cent, from an electric light company, the Metropolitan Gas Company, and so on. Such men who have invested their money under the laws existing at the time in companies that continue to prosper are satisfied that there should be no change in the law. ber enjoying any prosperity from shares ? disregard for money. Unhappily, when I wish to buy anything the seller will demand coin for it , otherwise I should not bother at all ahout money. I do not wish honourable members to think for a moment that in my opinion the capitalist is not quite entitled to so invest his money as to get a good return for it , but I take the view that if , in order that the capitalist may get 10 per cent, on his money, the workers are deprived of the means to earn a decent living, and are compelled to live and bring up their children in slums, legislation to remedy We would have discussed the such a condition of affairs is necessary, and the capitalist must be content with less than 10 per cent.

I was dealing with the evolution of a capitalist. ing Attorney-General larly in the Federal Parliament, do not desire any legislation. how the man who has the capacity to make money, and is economical, t h r if t y , far-seeing, and sober, could, if he devoted his attention to the money market and share companies, if he had reasonably good fortune, become a capitalist. I did not complete my description of the evolution of the capitalist because there is one important fact which I failed to remark upon. man with a genius for money-making is possessed of £1,000. shareholder in a company which is able to pay 10 per cent. Immediately a company of any standing such as the Melbourne Gas Company, the ElectricL i g h t Company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Howard Smith and Company, or any other company of like character, commences to pay 10 per cent., the shares, if worth, say, £ 1 each, double in value on the market. do not pay anything. money-making genius, not of those unfortunates who never know when to sell or to buy. The company pays 10 per cent. There are always in the community a number of trustees and investors who are prepared to put money into companies that will pay 5 per cent., so that they are quite willing to pay £ 2 for those £ 1 shares that return 10 per cent., and a man who has a thousand shares sells out at £ 2 each and immediately shows a profit of £1,000. day in the week, and probably no one knows that better than the honourable member for Corangamite. The honourable member does not appear to be an individual who is very much disturbed; that is to say, he is not a restless man. He is a man with a temperament that does not seem to become at all agitated. He is always rosy-cheeked and generally smiling, but there is no doubt he has a financial brain, and does not take long to size up the balance-sheets of a company. He sees that a company is about to pay big dividends, and he buys up shares at £ 1 each, and when a 10 per cent, dividend is declared he sells out at double the price at which he bought in . This kind of financial operation out that the class which the takes place every day, as honourable represents, particumembers will observe by watching share quotations. As I was saying, capitalists I was showing and investors, especially large investors, such as trustees and others, invest large sums; it may be £100,000 or £200,000 or even half-a-million, but the total runs to millions if one recollects the in vestments by the whole of the investing capitalistic class. I am not angry with the individual capitalists at all, because in the present state of the world's affairs, if a capitalist does not avail himself of We w ill assume that a the opportunity of making money, he will probably find himself working for some He becomes a other capitalist who does avail himself of that opportunity. I complain of the system under which such large fortunes are made by some capitalists at the expense of the wage-earners and wealthproducers in the community. I was pointing out, before lunch, the reasons why the capitalistic class, which the Attorney-General represents particularly, do not want any change. When the Colonial Sugar Kefining Company feared that the Australian Labour party would secure the pasI am speaking of the sage of the referenda and interfere with the company's large dividends, the shares dropped in value a few pounds. I think they were about £ 4 5 per share a few years ago, and they dropped to £ 4 0 ; but when the Liberal party came into power the confidence of the capitalistic class was restored, and immediately the company's shares commenced to rise, and are to-day worth nearly £48. That is done every Darwin knows that if any one is going to attack his rent he w ill go out of business. honourable member only supports my statement.

The Liberal party stand for protecting the interests of the capitalists, interests which they consider are being challenged by the people's party. Let us for a moment look at what is being done by the Labour party in the Federal Parliament. I shall refer to a few of the measures which we have passed. The chiel piece of legislation, I am inclined to think, was that establishing the Commonwealth Bank, and I pay tribute to the honourable member for Darwin for the work he did in connection with that bank. The speeches of the honourable member in the House and in the country cultivated that public opinion which resulted in the passing of the Commonwealth BankB ill . It would have been better, no doubt, as Ihe honourable member for Calare suggests, had we accepted more of the advice of the honourable member for Darwin; but there is still time, and there will be opportunity later on, to amend the measure and bring it more into line with his ideas. Some day I trust we shall see representatives of the States on an Advisory Board working in harmony with the Governor of the bank. The Labour party are always open to reason and to suggestions. AnotherB ill which the Liberal party fought as strongly as they did the Commonwealth BankB ill was that which imposed the Commonwealth land tax. All kinds of most objectionable slanders were uttered by the Liberal party against the Labour party in connection with the imposition of that tax. It was said that the Labour party desired to tax the farmer off his holding, but. the measure had no such result. We know that £1,300,000 is collected annually as revenue from the land tax, and we know that a number of large owners have had to cut up their estates, whereby farmers have got their land cheaper than they could have got it had the B ill not been passed. Coming to other legislation which more directly concerns the poorer in the old-age pensions and gave pensions to the blind. The Attorney-General is opposed to that class of legislation. He maintains that it will destroy the virility of the race. I have never been able to agree with the argument that helping a person will destroy his in dependence of character. If that is so, how is it that the independence of the honourable member for Parkes has not been destroyed ? That honourable member was probably very caref u l l y nurtured in his youth, and given all the advantages that 'wealth could give; he was educated at universities, and was not sent out to work in a u ine at ten years of age, as was the case with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has proved himself a very able tn.in, but has thrown in his lot with the capitalist class. Had he had a gentler time in his youth, he might have been in a different party to-day. My argument is that, taking a child and bringing it up carefully, educating it well, and surrounding it with all the comforts of life will not destroy its independence of character. By the same token, when we give to the pioneers of Australiaover sixty years of age in the case of women and over sixty-five years in the case of men-10s . a week for the rest of their lives we are not interfering with their independence of character or with the independence of the character of the Australian race.

The sum for which we ask is £3,060,020, and includes £80,000 for refunds of revenue, £200,000 for the Advance, and £208,578 for payment to the Admiralty for stores. refund of revenue is the ordinary vote to enable the Treasurer to refund amounts collected which do not properly belong to revenue, such as the proportion of cable rates due to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company and the Pacific Cable Board, the value of postage stamps re-purchased by the Postmaster-General's Department, the value of postage stamps attached to postal notes, amounts paid in error, and so on.

There is no extraordinary or special expenditure included, except in two cases. One is the amount of £208,578, before referred to, which is required to pay the Admiralty for stores taken over in connection with the transfer of Garden Island. The agreement to pay this amount was made by our predecessors, but it was too large an amount to pay out of the Treasurer's Advance, and it was not anticipated that such an amount would be required from this source. The Government, however, wish to make the paymentwhich is long overdue-as soon as possible.

The other is an amount of £1,200 included as a gratuity to Brigadier-General Gordon. This amount is equal to twelve months' pay, and it is thought that, acting Treasurer's on precedent, that is all that can be offered on retirement after thirty-two The years' honourable service.

Sir JOHN FORREST I am merely expressing my opinion that this is a poor reward, having regard to the time that Brigadier-General Gordon has been in the Service. H a d he been in the C i v il Branch, he would have retired with a pension of probably £500 a year; and he suffers under a further disability; he expected to retire at the age of sixty, and, even then, there was a chance of a furthe r two years of service at the option of the Government. About two years ago, however, the age of retirement was reduced from sixty to fifty-eight, and Brigadier General Gordon has not only lost his chance of remaining in the Service unti l he is sixty-two, but has had to retire at the age of fifty-eight. This officer has had a long career, in regard to which I might take the opportunity to say a few words.

Customs and Excise revenue was £14,900,000, and this, too, it is gratifying to say, will probably be realized.

When the Budget-speech was made, it was intended that such lands should be paid for out of loan moneys.

Honourable members opposite, I think, are a little b it That was the position after the late unreasonable. course of my Budget statement last year, that, taking credit for the £2,653,000 which we inherited by way of surplus, we estimated to expend the whole of our income, just as in the previous year the right honourable member for Wide Bay estimated that his expenditure would be equal to the whole of the revenue received, plus the accumulated surplus. As a matter of fact, the actual revenue which he received was f a r more than he estimated, while his expenditure was considerably less tlian he estimated it would be, and his surplus, which he is constantly referring to, is solely accounted for in that way. If his estimates of revenue and expenditure had proved accurate, he would not have had any surplus at a l l . We have, however, discussed that aspect of the matter before. I wish to congratulate honourable members on both sides, and the country generally, on the fact that, notwithstanding the pessimistic forecasts of both friends and foes, such a good result has been obtained. When we reach the Works and Buildings Estimates, I shall have a good deal more to say; but I shall content myself now with moving the motion. desire, at the outset, to congratulate the Treasurer on the fact that, as time goes on, he is becoming more frank in his statement of the finances. There are behind him honourable members who, .when seeking the suffrages of the free and in dependent citizens of Australia, denied everything that the righ t honourable gentleman now asserts. They indulged in wilful straight out lying about the matter. understand the right honourable member to say that honourable members have been lying ? Notwithstanding this estimate, been settled.

The Treasurer speaks now of an absolute cash surplus!-""audited, "" as he saysamounting to £2,653,000, which he in herited from the Fisher Administration . I pointed out, in the Government had paid every bill that could be paid. I asked that every bil l presented should be paid. Sir JOH N FORBEST -That is the law. observed. The complaint now made by the Treasurer is that in my last estimate I appropriated the surplus revenue accumulated by us during the preceding years of our administration, b u t that we did not spend the whole of it , whilst, at the same time, the revenue received by us was larger than that which I estimated to receive. In this way, he says, we secured our surplus. The fact is that we showed a surplus on the actual transactions of the year. On the other hand, what has been done by the present Government? Even making every allowance for the economy which the Treasurer says he has practised, we find that, during the one financial year of their administration, the present Government have spent all that they received by way of revenue and income, and have, in addition, eaten into the surplus which they inherited to the extent of about £1,653,000. I s it any wonder that the honourable gentleman congratulates honourable members on both sides ? Customs revenue for this year was much less than the receipts from that source in the previous year. We estimated that it would be £653,000 less than during the previous twelve months. that-eve n if we allow for a fallin g off in revenue to the extent of £350,000-the Treasurer, during his twelve months of office, has eaten into the surplus which he inherited to the extent of £1,300,000.",38,Retiring Allowances For Military And Naval Officers

Whose money is it? of the people of Australia. plaint of honourable members is that the toiling masses of the community, the mothers and fathers, and especially those with large families, are over-taxed. means of the maternity allowance some semblance of justice can be done to these people, even if we view it from no higher stand-point. It is time that the facts of the case were put clearly and distinctly in this Parliament. If there is a duty resting upon this Legislature it is that of protecting the mothers and the infan t l if e of Australia. It is our duty also to see that a section of the people are not unduly taxed; but wherever indirect taxation is imposed, the burden of it falls, and falls unfairly upon the toiling masses, whose incomes are comparatively small. have to spend all they earn in obtaining the actual necessaries of life, and a few comforts, nearly the whole of whicli are taxed through the Customs and Excise.

Although they say that they have a majority and a ' [76] policy, and are the financial brains of the country, the fact remains that we are about to have a double dissolution, and this Government, after administering the affairs of the country under great odds for twelve months, are still on the Treasury bench, and controlling the places of power.

Why did the right honourable member for Wide Bay merely acting a part when he advised that I should be asked to undertake the burdens and obligations of this position ? With a divided Lower Honse, and with our opponents in a large majority in the Senate, we had a right to expect that he would give us some help in meeting the obligations put upon us in the carrying on of the King's Government until we could appeal to the country again to redress the balance of parties in Parliament. Have we ever received one fraction of help from the other side? Have they not tried, from the very first moment, to prevent us doing our duty to the country ?

There is a great deal yet to do, and we cannot do what we would like for lack of legislation. We cannot even administer effectively until we get more legislation to permit' us to do so. A great deal requires doing, and we have not been permitted to do it ; but we have done something.

I take the view that the Governmeut and their supporters are afraid that the Democracy of Australia would answer in the affirmative the questions submitted to them. What a grand opportunity is going to be lost! The Prime Minister asked my colleagues and myself, after we had been told that there was to be a double dissolution, to allow the Government to pass certain anti-Trust legislation. I assented at once. Directly the honourable gentleman mentioned the matter, I said that we would do everything possible to facilitate the passing of legislation considered necessary to protect the interests of the public. But the Government know as well as we do that this Parliament, having regard to its present limited powers under the Constitution, cannot pass any legislation that will protect the people as they should be pro-' fcected. The Government w ill not afford the people another opportunity to decide these matters for themselves. I am not a native-born Australian, but it is humiliating to me to find young Australians unprepared to raise a hand to protect themselves, although they know what is taking place in other countries, and are aware that Australia is being invaded by foreign trusts and combines w it h octopuslike powers.

We said in our statement of policy that if the referenda questions, which were then to be submitted a second time, were carried, we should provide for the new Protection; but that even if they were not affirmed we should still take an early opportunity to give effective Protection to Australian industries. That was our policy, clear, direct, and clean-cut, and that is our policy to-day, so far as the Tariff is concerned. The rest of our .policy is too well-known to need recapitulation. I have laid bare the Prime Minister's in consistency and the inaccuracy of his statement regarding his LoanB ill and his financial policy. I have now only to point out that he and his Treasurer in herited from the Labour Government a surplus of £2,653,000, and that during their first year of oflice they have spent not only their anticipated income, but a very large proportion of the surplus which they inherited.

It is just as well that the people should understand the position occupied in this respect by the right honourable gentleman. Coming now to the Commonwealth Bank business, I think that the Prime Minister, in his references to the opening of the Kalgoorlie railway, and to the laying of the foundation stone of the Commonwealth Bank premises, took up a position unworthy of the Prime Minister of Australia. saying. suggestion to the Governor of the Bank as to when or how the foundation stone should be laid. to him on the part of my Government.

We took care when appointing Mr Denison Miller to be Governor of the Commonwealth Bank not to interfere with him in any way there.

That shows the inconsistency of honourable members; one day they say one thing, and on the next day another thing. They are speaking only for the moment, and not dealing with the policy of the country. Regarding the construction of the transcontinental railway, honourable members claim that the Labour Government laid only a few miles of rails, whilst they have laid a much greater length. They omit to mention the fact that all the preparatory work had been done for them. One does not commence the building of a railway by the laying of rails. When the present Government took control, they found the machines to hand and the rails ready to lay, and that the road had been partly made for them.

It would have paid us to have incurred the expenditure on a temporary line, so that we might have made another start, and saved time in the building of the line. We have lost in interest and depreciation far more than can be imagined. But there are few people with minds big enough to grasp the possibilities of Australia. There are very few people who can really contemplate what this great country will be. We want men who, though strenuous supporters of a party, will recognise that there are some -questions which are far above party considerations. The opening up of Australia from north to south, and from east to west, whether by water or by land, is a national duty, and the mere fact that we expend a few millions on such work does not matter. The credit of the country can be safely pledged, because, not only does the railway represent an asset for the actual amount expended, but that asset increases in value as the years go by, -and, therefore, such expenditure is proper. orable member's time has expired.

In trying to cover the laches of previous years-£580,00 0 for defence alone. £380,000 for the Postal Department, £450,000 for old-age pensions. That is what made the deficit of that last year, and that deficit was incurred in view of the altered arrangement which was being proposed, and by which our successors received fifteen millions of extra revenue. Those are the facts, and it is time to repeat them when the honourable member for Wide Bay repeats the stale old story that the Labour Government paid for the Navy and did everything else out of revenue. but let honourable members tell the country that we replenished the coffers for them, and filled them to overflowing) and all the money we provided for them, £15,000,000 of extra' revenue, in addition to the four and a half million pounds which they themselves raised, they spent. They had a high old time, and left us £4,000,000 worth of commitments when they quitted office. Please remember that. Meanwhile, my statement stands clear and unchallengeable, that when we introduced the Naval Loan Bill we had not the remotest certainty that we would get one penny from the new arrangement then being made, and the Braddon clause did not expire until fully twelve months after the agreement had been made, and the obligation had been incurred. What foolishness it is, therefore, with these facts on record, for the right honourable gentle-n an to try to bamboozle the people of the eountry, and make them believe that, with all this revenue flowing in, we deliberately introduced the Naval Loan Bill. That is one of those half-lies which is worse than a whole one. It is more misleading and more difficult to catch up, and that is why I have taken time now to prick that little bubble. main. contradict the statements made by the honourable member's leader two minutes ago. I am glad to hear a statement from my right honourable friend, that, whatever conies in the future, he will not borrow money for the construction of naval bases. That leads me to say that nothing is more certain under Heaven than that, if he succeeds to power after the ensuing appeal to the country, he must at once begin to impose additional heavy taxation upon the people. That is the alternative, and that is the position made clear by the right honourable member's statement to-day. He cannot otherwise finance this country, no man can; no financial genius in the world could carry on the commitments of this Government, give effect to the legislation which has been passed, and pay for the naval bases and other capital works of that kind, out of the revenue of this country, without further heavy taxation of the people. defence scheme down. that statement. I hope that the country is taking note of it. But does that statement represent the views of the honourable member's leader? how many honourable members, I wonder. Is it the view of the majority? BecauseI should like the country to know that honourable members opposite intend to put the knife into the defence scheme. have a few on your own side who are not too sure about it. the Opposition has left the chamber, but I wish to ask him a question and place it on record. I wish to know what difference there is between constructing a Naval Base at Cockburn Sound out of revenue and buying one at Cockatoo Island out of loan moneys? When the right honourable gentleman bought his Naval Base in Sydney he did not pay for it out of revenue. What difference is there between erecting a dock at Fremantle and purchasing a dock in Sydney? The former has to be paid out of taxation-the right honourable gentleman says he will not borrow for it and the other out of loan",52,Retiring Allowances For Military And Naval Officers

Another point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that the Labour Government paid off so many loans during their term of office. did they get the money with which to do so? £9,000,000 in the shape of notes which they circulated.

Mr Hannan, who seconded the motion, said It was very clever. that in Victoria there was no difficulty in appealing to the people on the question of Protection, but in some of the other States the case was different. A great change, however, had come over the people of New South Wales since Federation on the question of Protection, That and he believed that the Labour party could now appeal successfully to the people of that State on the subject of effective Protection, provided that the speakers could convince the workers that it would improve industrial conditions.

The Ministry did not wish to repeat the mistake of the past by re-opening the Tariff before the people had given to the Commonwealth the power possessed by the States in industrial matters. For three years they stood behind that rock wall. A t Maryborough, the honourable member for Wide Bay, for electioneering reasons only, threw this policy overboard, and said, "" If we cannot get the referendums, we will give Protection without conditions. We offer Protection for your votes, and hang the workers."" But notwithstanding the abandonment of the platform of the Hobart Conference, the people threw over the Labour party. They went to the country with a majority of ten in the House of Bepresentatives, which was the equivalent of a majority of ninety in the House of Commons, and returned in a minority of one. That was the answer of the people to all their protestations. Now, let me say, in conclusion, as my time has gone, that I would rather lose my position than stay here and be able to do nothing. My statement still stands. This Government will either get on or get out. Honourable members opposite have now their chance to make us get out if they can. is evident that in the very near future a change in the political situation is considered probable; so much could be learned from the two speeches of the Prime Minister. In these speeches he has not endeavoured to deal .with the proposals for Supply, but has merely presented a case for his appeal to the country. your leader. member is in this position, that he cannot point to one legislative act for which his Government is responsible, which is of any material benefit to the people. A f t e r twelve months of office, and two sessions of Parliament, nothing has been accomplished . portance attempted. ter tells us that we would not permit the Government to do business. H a d Minisand had they proposed measures for the benefit of the country which could be accepted by both sides, much would have been accomplished. But in the first speech of the Governor General for which the Prime Minister was responsible, he threw down the gauntlet, leading us to understand that measures which had been placed on the statute-book by the Labour party, and strongly supported by the members of the party, were to be repealed, if possible. How could the Labour party assist the Government under those circumstances ? Having no legislative acts to boast of, the Prime Minister endeavoured to make out a good case by drawing attention to the administration of his Government. He stated that over £1,000,000 had been spent this year on the transcontinental railway, compared with an expenditure of only £600,000 by the Fisher Government. Does he forget that the Liberals, although they talked a great deal about the need for the railway, never endeavoured to pass legislation to bring it about ? It was the Fisher Government which made provision for the construction of the line, and was responsible for its commencement. Every one knows that it takes months of preparation for the actual work of construction when a great undertaking like this has""to be faced. There is a great deal to be got in readiness before large sums can be spent on construction. The Labour Government paved the way for considerable expenditure on the construction of this railway by their successors, and I venture to say thab had they remained in power they would have spent more money on the line than this Government have spent. The Prime Minister left it to be inferred I had tp reply to that the money spent on the construction of the railway was obtained fro m revenue, although every one knows that it is loan money, on which interest must be paid.

It was openly advocated by supporters of the present Government that the Navy should be built out of loan money, and they pointed out how a sinking fund had been provided, by which the debt would be extinguished in a given number of years. The Prime Minister endeavours to make it appear that the Labour Government had millions of money placed at their disposal owing to the repeal of the Braddon section. fact, there was considerably more revenue, and it was absolutely necessary. He and his Government had been unable to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth on the means at their disposal, ancl they left for the Labour Government a deficit of over £400,000. There was no money for pressing works of national importance; and whatever Government were returned would have to find additional revenue somewhere. Further, the Prime Minister seeks to make it appear that the Labour Govermnent expended money in an extravagant way; and on a previous occasion went so far as to say that there had been wanton wastefulness. The electors were told that if a Liberal Government were returned there would bo no difficulty in cutting down expenditure, and, with the extra revenue, making ends meet; but the Government and their supporters forgot to tell the people that Air.

Even the Treasurer and the Prime Minister adm it that the position this year is not to as good as it has been in previous years. I remember the time when the right honourable gentleman would have taken up the position that the existence of a Labour Government made the that conditions of the country worse than The Prime they otherwise would be. In this case, although a Liberal Government has been in power for twelve months, the conditions of the country have been gradually getting worse, the revenue has been falling off, and everything has been going to the bad so far as Ministers are concerned; and, according to to the Prime Minister, it is a further justification for their return to power policy. to follow a like course. I venture to say that the people are not going It comes strangely to be satisfied with that kind of thing, and will not be humbugged. They now realize that in the past they had in power a party who gave effect to He has been in office their platform, and showed no hesitancy. It is realized now that the Labour party made no excuses, but simply went right ahead with their platform. We gave Treasury effect to our views. Notwithstanding what the Prime Minister or any other person may say about increasing the taxaIt is their tion of the people, I assert that the Labour party never imposed an additional burden on the general taxpayer. The only thing we did was to impose a land tax, which fell upon the shoulders of It is those who were well able to bear the burden. The Liberal party have complained about the Acts which were carried by The the Labour party, but they have never mustered up suflicient courage to say they They take too keen an interest in are prepared to repeal those Acts. There is only one honourable member on the promises or excuses. The other side who has shown that he has addicourage, and I believe that if the electors Parliament. should return him again his will will predominate. I refer to the Attorney-General, who has told us plainly that, as far as he is concerned, he would do away by with the Maternity Allowance Act . The the Treasurer seems to be coming round to that view, for to-day he said that he does not believe in giving the money away to persons who can do without it , practically showing that he is gradually coming round to the view of his colleague. is just as well for the people to know that there is a danger to be feared, and that is that the maternity allowance, which has done so much good for the mothers of the couutry, is likely to be taken away, or that, if it be retained, they will have to declare themselves paupers to obtain ifc. the hour of need this money must be made available to the mothers of the country, just the same as we make a pension available in certain cases. maternity allowance is not an act of charity, but is intended to enable the mothers to get proper nursing and medical attention. deavours to repeal the Act will be able to obtain the support of the people of this country. the Attorney-General to declare openly that they believe either in repealing the Act or in so restricting its operation as to prevent a large number of the women from obtaining this money in the hour of need. If Ministers will not declare their policy in this regard, we shall have to judge them by the statements which have been made from time to time, and we shall be justified in pointing out to the people the danger which they run in this respect. vernment w ill muster up suflicient courage to let the people know exactly their platform, and what they intend to do before they appeal to the country. regards the Labour party, our opponents can rest assured that we shall make our policy clear to the people. carry out our platform in its entirety, and anything additional which may be considered necessary w ill be given effect to.

The Treasurer is asking for a grant of £3,060,000. That means that a fourth of the year w ill have expired before we shall have an opportunity of hearing the right honourable gentleman introduce It his Budget or go into the matter. When he introduced his last Budget, he foreshadowed that, after borrowing about £3,000,000, he would just make ends meet. During the last electoral compaign the people were told that the Labour party had been extravagant, that we had estimated to spend in 1912-13 some We on this side say that in £21,000,000, which was extravagance, according to our opponents. But when the present Treasurer delivered his Budget we learned that he anticipated to The receive about the same revenue, and expected to spend about £24,000,000, and, in addition, to borrow over £3,000,000, which he also proposed to spend.

SirJ OHN FORREST I never said otherwise-gentleman has admitted that every penny which has ever been expended for the Commonwealth has always been accounted for. Aet requires that to be done. every penny to be accounted for, as the Treasurer admits. During the last general election many fairy tales were told. I shall not say, as was remarked by another honourable member, that they were deliberate misrepresentations, for I think that some made these statements in ignorance. The honourable member for Gippsland, however, will now be able to tell his constituents that he is responsible for the continuance in office of a Government which brought forward a SupplyB ill providing for the expenditure of no less than £841,593 under the headings of "" Contingencies "" and "" Miscellaneous."" He is undoubtedly responsible for their remaining in power, since, if he voted against them, they would at once be defeated. I say, as I have often said in this House, that every penny of expenditure under these headings must be accounted for, and that every penny of expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth since the in auguration of Federation has been accounted for. Supply Bills and Estimates will be introduced in this Honse long after we have passed away providing for the expenditure of large sums in respect of "" contingencies"" and miscellaneous items. Sir JOH N FORREST -Such items must occur. last Federal election the honourable member for Gippsland made this statementNowI will tell you a little about the Labour Government's financing : Prime Minister's Department-thousand s pounds.

The figures to which he referred appeared in a pamphlet entitled The Financial Carnival, which was issued by the honourable member for Parramatta before he was returned to power. moment at the contingencies for which we are asked to provide in the SupplyB ill now before us. In the first place, in the divisions relating to the Department of the Treasury, there is a proposed vote of £15,000 for ""Contingencies"" in connection with the Land Tax Office. Every one who has held Ministerial office, knows that a voucher has to be produced for every penny of expenditure, and thab the Auditor-General will not pass an account in respect of which a voucher is not forthcoming. And so this item of £15,000 for contingencies relating to the Land Tax Office will be accounted for. Then, again, in respect of the Department of External -Affairs, we find in this B ill , as introduced by the present Treasurer, an item of £15,000 for Contingencies in connection with the Administrator's office in the Northern Territory; whilst in respect of the Defence Departmeut, we are asked to vote the following amounts:-Roya l M i l i tary College, Contingencies, Small Arms Factory, £ 1 0 , 0 0 0; Permanent Force (Sea-going), Contingencies, £ 2 4 , 0 0 0; Universal Training, Contingencies Citizen Forces and Senior Cadets. £107,000. All this expenditure must be accounted for so that when candidates assert that no return is obtained for the money so expended they are stating something for which there is no foundation. In this SupplyB ill , which covers only three months, we have the following totals in respect of contingencies:-The Parliament, £ 2 , 5 4 0 ; Prime Minister's Department, £ 3 , 6 1 5 ; Treasury, £ 3 0 , 1 0 0; Attorney-General, £ 6 , 7 9 0 ; External Affairs, £34,500; Defence Department, £ 2 4 8 , 4 5 0; Department of Trade and Customs, £35,300; and Postmaster-General's £316,000. I do not blame the honourable member for Gippsland and others, who at the last general election made wild statements concerning expenditure under the heading of "" Contingencies ""-or "" Miscellaneous,"" as much as I blame the Prime Minister, because they took them from The Financial Carnival, a pamphlet issued by the honourable member for Parramatta. We were told that if the honourable member for Parramatta and his party were returned to power the financial carnival would cease. But what is the position now that they are in power ? Has the Treasurer, in his pre-Budget statement, foreshadowed any alteration in the finances of the country ? any economy. He has told us that the Government will not spend quite as much as they estimated. But what does that mean? works. of public works for which provision was made on the Estimates, and which could have been started during the financial year now closing, have been held upThe Treasurer mentioned incidentally the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) B ill , and I asked hi m if there was any schedule attached to it , and the right honourable member answered, "" No."" Apr parently there are no new works to be sanctioned in that B ill , which w ill be confined to those works already authorized by Parliament. Therefore, the works al£9,000: ready authorized have not been proceeded with during the present financial year. We told the Treasurer last session that he would not be able to expend the money mentioned in his Estimates of expenditure, and, therefore, a loan was not necessary. The Treasurer admitted to-day that, although he had not been successful in passing the LoanB ill last session as he introduced it , the Government have not been able to expend the whole of the amount for which he had obtained authority in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) B ill passed last September or October.

The day after the Treasurer introduced his Budget last year, the Age had the following comments in its leading columns:The keynote of the Cook Government's financial policy for 1013-14 was struck hy Sir John Forrest in his peroration of his Budget speech. After showing that the Labour party, during its three years' tenure of office, had received £18,342,771 more revenue than any of its predecessorsa fact which "" naturally encouraged a vastly-increased expenditure that could not have been possible, or even thought of otherwise""-the Treasurer informed the House that the Cook Government "" does not intend to stop the expenditure to which the country is committed."" Later on, in the same article, the statement appearedThe Labour Government left a total accumulated surplus of £2,653,223. Sir John Forrest, including the surplus, w ill have £24,115,223 available for expenditure, and lie proposes to spend thc whole of it ; that is to say, he w ill they have not lifted a little finger to alter spend £2,G07,360 more than did the Labour Government last year. In addition, he proposes to raise £3,080,000 by means of Loan Bills for new works and other matters; BO his gross estimated expenditure for 1913-14 is really £27,105,223-a n excess of £5,687,360 over the amount spent by the Labour Government. odd. gentleman proposed to mop up the whole of the surplus of £2,653,223, and, in addition, to spend £3,080,000 whicli he proposed to borrow, and he thus proposed to spend more than was spent by the Labour Government to the extent of £5,687,360. so. Sir have the figures here. surer was going to spend the whole of the surplus, and to borrow £3,080,000, so that what he proposed to spend was £5,687,360 more than the amount spent by the Labour Government in their last year of office. that is what we said at the time, but he has spent over four millions and a half of it. And the Treasurer himself has had to admit to-day that he is unable to spend that amount. This is the Government that came in with a great flourish of trumpets as the Government of economy and the Government that was going to reduce the cost of living. They have not taken a single step during the time they have been in oflice to carry out any of the promises they made in that direction. vernment saved over £1,000,000 by withholding expenditure on public works. the present Treasurer has said to-day that he expects to save £1,000,000. The Treasurer explained to-day that every work included in the Supply Bill was provided for in the Works Estimates of last year. That proves that the Government have hung up works expenditure, and have failed to redeem one pledge they made to the people when they were last before the country. When they go before the people again, they will have to explain that the cost of living is higher to-day and rents are higher than they were when they assumed office, and that that condition of affairs, although they were returned upon a direct promise that they would move in that direction.

It is a serious matter to throw people off the rolls. man leaves his place of work, and goes across the street, and a letter is sent to where he was working on the last occasion, he does not answer it because he never gets it , and very often the letter is burnt. That has been done in my electorate. Then they proceed to throw him off the roll, and in order to drown the outcries of the disfranchised there is an uproar of a sham battle over preference to unionists. It will not work. Let us fight this election honestly and justly, and if honourable members on the Ministerial benches can put us down, we shall take our medicine. I wish now to touch on the question of finance. On the 2nd October, 1913, the Treasurer, in presenting the Budget, saidIn presenting the last Budget to Parliament on the 1st August, 1912, the Treasurer announced that, in order to meet his expenditure during the financial year 1912-13, it would be necessary to expend, not only the revenue estimated to be received during that year, but also the accumulated surplus amounting to £2,261,673, which was on the 30th June, 1912, at the credit of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund and the Naval Defence Account for Construction of the Fleet. Instead, however, of this surplus of £2,261,673 being required to supplement the revenue of the year, the revenue exceeded the expenditure by £391,550, the accumulated surplus on the 30th June, 1913, amounting to £2,653,223. In the Budget-papers it appears, on page 69, under the head of Trust FundsInvalid and Old-age Pensions Account Naval Defence Account This amount of £2,653,223 accumulated out of the revenue of 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, and is available for expenditure this year, .1913-14. To-day the Treasurer admitted that after the operations for the year tliere would still be a surplus of about £800,000. I congratulate him upon that surplus. Bad as the times are, we should be satisfied on both sides of the House that we do not run behind, but had it not been for Mr Fisher providing and gathering that surplus there would now be a deficit of £1,800,000. I had a lot of trouble with has been made use of only once since the ex-Prime Minister. Y o u had no conspend that money, but he would not let always me have it . I wished to spend it on the Electoral Department, and do exactly what Ministers are now doing, and I wished to spend it on buildings throughout the country, because I claim that our activities and national enterprises should When a working always be kept up-to-date. We had not painted Government House for ten years. When I went to look at the building, I thought it would tumble over. It cost a lot of money to renovate the place. These were the things to which I turned my attention, and if the present Prime Minister w ill turn to the savings book in the Department of Home Affairs, he will find that "" t h e man who has no business knowledge"" saved Australia £194,000 on certain transactions. Parliament has not done much during the last year because we have been fighting as to who should be on the Treasury bench, but honourable members of the Opposition have always been ready to help the Government to carry non-contentious measures. Ministers could have brought down their irrigation proposals, their break-of-gange proposals, their scheme for organizing the banking, credit, and financial system of Australia; and the Tariff ought to have been in the forefront of their programme. However, they put in their whole time fighting about a littl e tinpot preference to unionists B ill . It was really not a B ill . The trouble arose over a minute issued by me giving preference to unionists; and the present Government having abolished preference, the matter was done with, and it was not necessary to put in a whole year bothering about it . ... 702,433 doing it again. I gave preference to unionists because it was a collective bargain.

The Governor all the time had the right to hang a man, although he exercised it only once in t h i r t y years. Let me deal now with the Tariff. Every one knows that our iron industry is going to the dogs. Goods can be brought here from London and from New York for less than is charged to transport them from Sydney to Western Australia. The present Tariff is no barrier against the cheap labour of Europe. workmen can be got for from 9d. to ls. a day. How can Australian manufacturers pay high wages if they have to compete with manufacturers who can employ cheap labour, and are not controlled by boards or industrial laws? I am a Protectionist, dipped in the dew, and dyed in the wool. No new country can be successful without Protection. Yet we have monkeyed our time away when we could have dealt with the Tariff. I believe in the initiative and referendum, and in the recall. In America, they recall mayors of towns and members of Parliament who do not do their duty. I believe, too, that we should be paid better salaries. To come to another point. We have made no arrangements yet for dealing with the debts of the States. Australia has one of the biggest debts in the world, but we have made no arrangements for meeting it .

His statement in support of high Protection constituted a Tory speech. He is not satisfied with the Tariff, whicli in many instances protects the Australian manufacturer against his foreign rival by an amount equal to the wages' cost of the article, and in some cases by an amount equal to from three to twelve times the wages cost. spoke on behalf of the big man, and on behalf of the trusts and combines, which he condemns when on the public platform, but which he promises to assist still further if returned with a majority. It is by Tariffs that rings and trusts are created. pressed regret that many members of the Labour party understood so little the true interests of the bulk of the workers that they were ready to vote for high duties. should be limited in each case to the difference between the wages paid here and abroad; but in one or two instances they voted for duties whicli gave one hundred times as much as that. It is true that certain members who are now associated with the Liberal party made the same mistake, but they have seen the error of tlieir ways, and are determined hencef o r th that all taxation on the people shall go into theTreasury, instead of into the pockets of trusts and combines. If honourable members opposite are in earnest, they know that in every country in the world-in Canada, America, and elsewhere, and even in Australia when Mr Kingston introduced the first Tariffifc has been always proposed to lower the duties in the case of trusts and combines. The President of the United States has to fight these corporations is to expose them to competition as fa r as possible. Out of the total production of Fleet Total. £205,000,000 in Australia, over £145,000,000 is due entirely to our primary industries; and the men who sell £ £ wine, wool; wheat, hides, tallow, mutton, 918,587 918,588 1,837,175 beef, and even rabbits have to meet the 146,256 278,242 424,498 low wages and the competition of the 885,947 -494,397 391,550 world. ber has not learned the story by this time, he is too old to do so now. Sensible, reasonable men realize that the Labour party ought to keep down taxation, but in Australia they are the absolute antithesis of Labour parties on the other side of the world. There they endeavour to keep down Tariffs, because it is recognised that the people have to pay the price. When the Tariff was before this Parliament, and I and others pointed out that the burden would have to be borne by the people, the fact was reHe cognised by a certain proportion of Labour members, who voted accordingly: but, unfortunately, a majority decided that high taxation should prevail. Honourable members opposite were warned that high taxation would mean trusts and combines; and, personallv. I said that Sof a r back as 1901, I exif I remained in Parliament for another ten years I should see the melancholy spectacle of members of the Labour party condemning the corporations which they were then themselves creating. combines in England. What about Coates' cotton? mythical trusts and combines in England. Large combinations of capital cannot be prevented, and every blow that the Labour party has made at capital in Australia has really meant the encouragement of the capitalists already here. The Labour party declared that they would prevent the capitalists of Australia from having any competition, and, consequently, those capitalists were able to raise interest by 1^ per cent, and 2 per cent. The Labour party also said that they would "" p u t down "" the banks; and yet the dividends of banking and other companies are higher than ever.

Honourable members opposite t r y to im pose taxation on wealth, although the same has been tried tens of thousands of times before, with the inevitable result that the poorer people have to pay. That is the view of sensible, thoughtful, genuine Labour men elsewhere, who are not Tories masquerading in the guise of Labour. Honourable members opposite glory in the falso name they have assumed, knowing that it is a bluff which conceals the real acts of the party. A true Labour party acts in the interests of the public, but it is manifest that the so-called Labour party here legislates for the wealth of the country. 10,000 persons with over £1,000 a year, and some 25,000 with over £700 a year, and it is idle to suppose that the Liberal party can depend on these for success. No real politician ever appeals to the wealthy of a community, but to the sensible workers, who are kept down, not because of capital, but because of the absence of capital. Yet honourable members opposite go about the country preaching a doctrine of hate, stirring up prejudice, and setting man against man, instead of proclaiming the religion of humanity and brotherhood. What they ought to endeavour to create is that spirit of confidence which has the effect of in creasing capital. Sometimes it is said to me of the Labour party, "" Oh, they mean well do. Labour party do not do, or if they do well, it is only at the expense of the genuine workers of the community. Whatever claim to the name "" L a b o u r "" the party once possessed was lost the moment they became the representatives of only a section of the workers of the community. workers, and of these only 400,000 are unionists; and yet the Labour party I know scores and scores claim preference for the minority. At that moment they abandoned even the faintest tittle of right to call themselves Labour men, because if that other great part of the community are not to he conA n d , of course, if I had the sidered merely because they are not organized, then the party opposite represent only the strength, and not, as they should strive to do, the weakness of the community, so that the wrongs of the weaker section may be righted so f a r as it is possible for legislation to do it . I do not say that legislation can effect everything. No legislation can add to the production of wealth in a country, although some honourable members opposite seem to think that they add to the wealth of the community by taxes, and by calling taxes protective they reckon on deceiving the mass of the public as to their real incidence. If , for instance, a tax of £6 per ton is put on sugar, it does not stop the competition of the sugar-growers on the other side of the world. It simply transfers the burden of that competition from the shoulders of In Australia there are only the growers of sugar to the shoulders of the customers. I am sorry to say that owing to the iniquitous legislation of the Labour party, and the wanton waste and extravagance that has taken place in many Departments, I do not see how, at the present time, there can be effected that reduction of taxation which alone w ill give the people the real value of their wages. Whatever advance has taken place in wages has been solely due to the great advance in the value of our great primary industries. Out of the £60,000,000 of manufactures, at least £50,000,000 is absolutely dependent on the natural productions of the country, and out of about from £205,000,000 to £206,000,000 of national dividend, as I might call it , over £195,000,000 is derived absolutely from and I admit that they frequently matters that are outside the range of legislatures or individuals. In these circumstances it is extraordinary to hear a man We do well, too! like the honourable member for Darwin talk about the little t a i l wagging the dog.

Otherwise this sum of £15,000,000 a year could never be paid. Do the Labour party think the bloated importers pay taxes for the mass of the people, and do not get them back from them? If they do, and do not collect them back, they are a body of philanthropists whose names ought to be written in letters of gold, so that the whole mass of the people might bear them in mind. the revenue then? to pay taxes, but at least our duty is to see that those taxes go, not into the pockets of combines or trusts, or favoured individuals, but into the Treasury itself. If that had been done the people would have been saved £1,500,000 in respect of sugar subject in other cases we have the report of their own Inter-State Qommission, two out of three of the members of which are Protectionists. They point out that under the T a r i ff 95 per cent, of one trade goes to a little ring or trust. So much then for the attitude of the Labour party so-called, because, really, the more one considers the way they act the less one can excuse it . They may say they mean well, but that excuse ought not to save them from the condemnation of the peojle. Take again such a matter as defence. there is ono thing which a genuine Labour party ought to regard with the most jealous eye, it is the growth of militarism in a community. If one told a man on the other side of the world that the Labour party.here was advocating militarism, he would immediately ask, "" Do they call themselves Labour? palm themselves off as Labour men?"" One would reply, "" Simply by the repetition of it wherever they go."" He would ask, "" Surely the public are not deceived by it ? "" and when one assured him that they were, he would say, "" Australia must be a strange place. It is truly the Antipodes, because there you have a self styled Labour party acting in the reverse way to what they should. side of the world would call them the High Toryp a r t y ."" I unhesitatingly assert that, if necessary, every man must bear his share of the defence of the country in which he lives, because the activities on which we all depend, and our very lives, hang on the manner in which we undertake that defence; but we ought to scrutinize carefully the way in which we intend to go about it . I . have no doubt that if honourable members opposite were asked, as a matter of geography, if Australia was an island, they would glibly answer "" y e s , "" but, at the same time, they seem to overlook that important fact, seeing that they forget that an effective naval defence would prevent the landing of foreign troops here in any large numH o w would you raise bers. And so, instead of voting first for naval defence, they proceed to build up a military force by calling out, not the men, but the children of the country. It is these that this courageous Labour party are seeking to bring into military life. To be associated with such a thing is the greatest possible shame and disgrace to any party calling themselves alone. On that men -> tian. members of the party have good sound sense on the subject, but, taking them as a whole, they are the other way about, and, as a consequence, we must go against them. I should have been only too anxious to join any party that recognised what was really necessary for the genuine defence of the country, but no one can honestly defend a policy whose first requirement is the compulsory training of Surelyi f boys between the ages of fourteen and eighteen.

It remains for the party on the other side to take action on the hustings against us for desiring to abolish it. The time at my disposal does not permit me to make long quotations from many of the books on penal codes, one or two of which I have here. was this? Senator Pearce, the great Labour man, who is ""supported by honourable members on the other side, though not by all of them, I am pleased to say. reason why I do not utterly condemn them all is because I know that there are at least one or two chosen spirits who are overruled by the Caucus, else they would vote absolutely against solitary confinement. whether we would not vote against it. while my honourable friends think one way, they have to vote the other way. Just to show what solitary confinement means, and how the Judges themselves regard it, I will quote a case in which Mr Justice Hood, who wished to be very severe on a prisoner, and said that he proposed to make him feel the real effects of gaol, decreed that the prisoner should spend three days in solitary confinement at the beginning of the third, the sixth, the ninth, the twelfth, and the fifteenth month of the term; that is only three days at intervals of three months, and a doctor, newspapers, I will mention that a year remember, to visit the man every day to see how his mental health was faring. But here we have a party who made a regulation to put boys up to eighteen years of age in solitary confinement for a period up to ten days, and to be kept there soldiers to leave another shore to attack for twenty-two hours out of every twenty four. If there was any manhood in the party on the other side, they would have swept away a regulation of this sort long No ago. I am glad to say that, on our side, at least, an iniquitous regulation of that sort would be utterly swept away, and one result of the coming elections, if they return our party to power, will be that never again will boys convicted merely of an offence against military discipline undergo the awful ordeal of solitary confinement. Fancy lads being in solitary confinement from twenty to twenty-two hours day after day! We have a party of men here who have allowed such a thing to take place. I wish that I could take all the members of that party who have supported this legislation-indeed , if I knew any on this side who have done so, I would do the same thing-and give them from a week to ten days in solitary confinement, so that they might understand the evil of what they were doing to the community. ter of Defence in solitary confinementThe only Senator Pearce, or anybody else. with the question of the big expenditure on defence. As regards boys from fourteen to eighteen years of age, the fact that every other nation has abolished training for them, after trial, is sufficient proof to me tliat we, also, should not indulge in it. I have consulted dozens of military men, and they are all against the Labour policy of training for boys between those ages. But the party still continued the system, and I do trust that the Liberal party will alter it. I shall never cease fighting until the age is raised to at least eighteen years. I go further, and say that if our defence system is to be a good one, it must be a naval defence. The more we consider the introduction oi aeroplanes and submarines, the more should we give our attention to this matter.

He is just about as erratic in his conduct ns he is in his arguments. I cannot understand why he spoke at this juncture in this crisis. The situation in which we find ourselves would not have arisen had he displayed any consistency. I understood clearly and distinctly that the last thing he was going to tolerate was a double dissolution. I certainly thought that in a crisis of that character he would have left the Government. What reliance can be placed upon his attitude in regard to militarism? Or what reliance can be placed upon him in connection with this matter of solitary confinement? He denounced the evil, but he is prepared to support it. He supports the Government who tolerate and put into execution a regulation of this character.

I am just as accurate as the honourable member was when he was reproving certain honourable members in the corner. Here we have a Parliament which believes that the country needs to be defended, and which, believing that, passed a Defence Bill in which all members of Parliament are specially excluded from the fighting line. We brave and heroic men are to look on while others do the fighting. Who honestly believes that Australia stands in immediate danger of attack on the part of a foreign Power? Surely no section of the Parliament can do so, otherwise provision would have been made to ward off the danger. A country which believed itself to be in imminent danger of assault at the hands of a foreign force would begin at once to train and arm its men. But we are leaving the work to boys.

669,Mr Anstey,"Oh, yes. Do not connot the special prerogative of any particular party. The Parliament as a whole is responsible for the present defence system, and we are now told by General SirI a n Hamilton that it is going to cost us twice as much as was estimated. To defend a territory almost as large as Europe we were to have an army of 100,000 men, at a cost of £2,000,000 per annum. our land forces are already costing us twice as much, and before we are able to place in the field an armed force of 100,000 men we shall have to face an annual expenditure of £6,000,000. And yet our anti-militarist friend, the honourable member for Werriwa, talks in this way. He is an anti-militarist only in respect of some trifling matter, and not upon the general principle. All that he has said counts for nothing, inasmuch as when he is called upon to vote he is prepared to support th© very system that he condemns. The whole system is fizzling out. General SirI a n Hamilton says that we must have an adequate defence system ; and an adequate defence, if it means anything at a l l , means a system of defence adequate to protect the territory question of Supply we are debating various matters. attention this afternoon to the Prime Minister, who spoke of patriotic sacrifices. no doubt about it ; we are a band of patriots!

He is the noble opulent gentleman who denounces the maternity grant because it means extracting certain moneys fro m the wrong people and giving it to the wrong people. But the righ t honourable gentleman did not object to draw a pension from the Imperial Government for many years. God knows what the pension was for ; but the fact remains that he drew it , and that he had no scruples about drawing it , although it represented money extracted from men and women in the slums of London and Liverpool. It was extracted from the struggling millions, but he had no scruples about taking it. Imperial, but from the West Government. Mr Anstey. the bill just the same. The right honourable member was prepared to take this pension from the Government of a State, which had well rewarded him for his services. The receiving of that pension did not undermine his moral fibre. It was not a mere allowance of £ 5 . By way of the pension which he drew he So far, we have not 35,000, yet took in one year fa r more than is paid to scores and scores of poor women in respect of the maternity allowance, and which uncloubtedly is doing good service. The Prime Minister this afternoon talked about the fine work the Government had done. They had been twelve months in office, and yet had not got r i d of the surplus left to them by the Labour Government! His position is very like that of the man who, starting off with £ 6 , finishes up with £ 1 , and then claims that he has wound up with a surplus of £ 1 because he has not got r i d of the whole £ 6 . The speech made by the honourable gentleman this afternoon was in striking contrast to that which he delivered recently at Mount Gambier, where he talked of the immense responsibility with which the Government were loaded. to be defended. On this He spoke there of its growing expenditures from day to day and month to I listened with great month, and said, "" I do not know how to cope with it .

This capable man admits from a public platform that he is confronted with a situation which he does not know how to meet. Then he says that the revenues of the Commonwealth are declining. In other words, the revenue is declining while we have in power a Government which said that a Labour Administration would be ruinous to the progress of Australia. No sooner had the Liberal party got into power than the revenue of the Commonwealth began to decline. How do they explain that fact? The Treasurer tried to explain it with the statement, "" How can our revenue grow in view of the increasing number of strikes and the industrial unrest which is m u l t i p l y in g ?

They said that in the very first session of Parliament they would rectify Tariff anomalies if they were returned to power. They have made no effort to do so. They have given no evidence of their bona fides. They have no constructive policy, and never had any. They are the quintessence of reactionary legislators. They desire now to go to the country without presenting a financial statement, so that, if possible, they may come back with a majority and carry out their reactionary projects. And yet the Prime Minister talks of patriotic sacrifices and of the necessity for a Parliament that will go on with business! What business do the Government propose?

When the honourable member was asked before the last election what his policy was, he said, "" To get the Labour party out of office."" If the honourable member asks me what our policy is, I say that it is to do the same good turn to the Liberals. contest will be to give one party or other a definite majority, so that they may do something to prove themselves. That is what we have come to after eighteen months of battling.

It is all very well for the Government to tell us that they intend to appoint a Commission to take evidence in regard to the condition of the meat trade, but they are doing this only to stave off the evil day. When the Government are in a position to bring forward legislation the trust will have control of the meat trade in Australia, and, having a monopoly, will not be afraid of any legislation that may be passed. In my opinion, their policy in this matter is alone sumcient to condemn the present Government. This is a matter of vital importance to the people. The meat industry has grown very considerably during the last few years, and yet the whole of the benefits of the trade are about to pass into one of the greatest trusts in the world. We are well acquainted with the history of this trust in America, Argentine, and Great Britain, and as they have ruined the trade in those countries, we feel convinced they will do +he same thing in Australia. told by our opponents that cattle and sheep are bringing a better price to-day than they were previous to the trust coming to Australia. We are well aware of that. That is usually the case in a country when the trust make their first appearance. grower, and consequently the price of meat naturally increases. But when they have assumed control of the trade, the retail price of meat is never reduced, but the price to the cattle grower is always reduced. This is a matter which should have engaged the attention of the Government, and safeguards should have been adopted to prevent those people repeating the same tactics in this country as fhey have pursued in other parts of the world. The export trade from Australia last year increased by 12 per cent, as compared with the previous year. That Mr Sharpe. is not a very great increase, but when an industry of that description shows such an increase, there is need for the Legislature to give attention to the matter. In 1912, 1,700,000 head of cattle were slaughtered in Australia, and with a proportionate increase in 1913, the slaughterWe ing is far exceeding the growing which is taking place. If legislation is nob brought forward to protect the cattlegrowing industry, we shall find in a year or two that we are not growing suflicient cattle for our own consumption, and, instead of looking to other countries to buy our surplus meat, we will not have sufficient for ourselves. a lb. world the people do pay 2s. 6d. for prime cuts, and at the rate the price is increasing in Australia, it is quite possible that we will be paying something like that price here. The honourable member for Werriwa said that we are looking to the other countries of the world to buy our meat, wool, hides, tallow, and other exports. But. the American Beef Trust will take very good care that no hides, tallow, or meat of any description shall be sold to the people of any other country except through them. they did in America. America is what they propose doing here. We are Legislatures in other parts of the world are giving some attention to this great question. In the Argentine Republic we find the people prepared to exercise their legislative powers to effectively deal with the operations of this trust. Five of the nine meat works in existence in the ArgenThey raise the prices to the tine are controlled by the American Beef Trust at the present time, and not content with that, we find from the latest accounts from that country, published in the Pastoral Beview of the 15th May last, that they have secured the whole of the refrigerating space provided by the steam-ship companies trading between the Argentine and America. That is one of the tactics adopted by the trust to keep out competitors from any country in which they are operating. We understand that three or four ships have been ordered for the Australian trade, and it is clear that they intend to do the same kind of",76,Tkanssebred To Tetjst Pointed Out That The Only Effectual Way

681,Mr Sharpe,"What they _ did inthing in this country. Swift and Company have already started operations in Queensland. They began on the 1st of this month, slaughtering 150 head of cattle per day, and they w ill be in a positime in passing the legislation necessary tion to slaughter 1,000 head of cattle per day if the supply is forthcoming. The other people, Armour and Company, have worlcs treating stock for them. In my opinion, they have secured control of the Lake's Creek works, because meat shipped from those works is now being branded with Armour's brand. The manager of the Lake's Creek works has made a statement to the effect that Armour and Company have not secured control of the works, and that they are merely selling their meat to these people. But the fact remains that the meat is being exported with the brand, "" Armour and Company, Kockhampton, Queensland."" They are shipping meat to the United States, where the price is higher than in any other country in the world, and it is clear that the profit which these people are making out of Australian meat at the present time is something enormous. This trade could he secured for the benefit of the Australian people, if proper legislation was passed by this Parliament. Morris and Company are also about to start works in Queensland, so that these three powerful branches of the American Beef Trust w ill shortly bo operating in Australia. These three names are commonly used by the trust in securing control of any new country in which they discover that a plentiful supply of meat is available. Last year Australia and the Argentine exported to the Smithfield market 744,109 tons of meat, which represents about three-fourths of the whole of the meat supply of the London market. In 1906, the average weight of stock slaughtered in Queensland was 666 lbs., whilst in 1912 the average weight had dropped to 5S0 lbs. These figures show that our cattle industry is gradually deteriorating, and that Ave are nOAv slaughtering immature cattle. Unless the Government bring forward legislation to prevent the slaughter of immature cattle, our meat supply w ill decrease more rapidly than AVOUM otherwise be the case. Althoughi n 1912 we slaughtered 556,000 cattle, the number of hides sold on the market Avas only 343,000. The reason for this was that many of the cattle slaughtered Avere immature, and m their hides could only be classed as skins. This is a matter of great importance, and one to which the Government should give strict attention. We should waste no to deal with it . When the statistics for 1913 are received Ave shall find that we have been slaughtering f a r more stock than we grew during the year. ^We know that our export of meat has considerably increased, and Ave must conclude that the growth of our stock was not as great as in the previous year. We are slaughtering two-year-old cattle to-day, when for consumption Ave should not slaughter cattle until they are four years old. We might have protected the industry to some extent under the Agricultural BureauB ill , and if we had done so we would have had a greater supply of meat for the outside markets of the world. We should endeavour to secure the markets of the Avorld for the Australian producers, and should not permit foreigners of any description to come to our shores and rob us of this great opportunity to benefit our stock-OAvners. The Government should have taken this matter into consideration at a very much earlier period of the session. Their delay in dealing Avith the matter proves that they are not serious in their professed intentions Avith regard to it . The American Beef Trust is undoubtedly the greatest trust in the world. One of its main resources of power is found in its attachment to one political party. Looking into the history of the trust we find that it has subscribed very liberally to the funds of a particular political ""party. Its nominees have been accepted by the party, and on many occasions elected. In 1906 Armour and Company subscribed no less than $400,000 to the funds of a political party in America. We have to take into account the influence which may be brought to bear by this powerful trust upon a political party in Australia. They can protect themselves by subscribing largely to political funds. The present Government have hesitated to deal with the operations of this combine so long that Ave are forced to the conclusion that it may be doing something of the same description in Australia. member suggest ? be subscribing liberally to the funds of one political party in Australia.",77,Tkanssebred To Tetjst Pointed Out That The Only Effectual Way

711,Mr Hannan,"Yes. The honorablethe manufacturers must be protected from unfair competition of rivals abroad. It was the first duty of the National Parliament to give this protection. Every Fusion candidate in Victoria at the last election said thati it would be the first duty of his party, if returned to power, to alter the Tariff, but no attempt has been made by the Cook Government to do that. Ministers promised the people that they would bring in Protection, and would establish sound financial economies; but, instead of dealing with national questions, they commenced by trying to pick a quarrel with the Opposition, in order to bring about the dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament. The measure introduced to bring about the dissolution was that for the abolition of preference to unionists in Government employment. As a trade unionist, I have always held that if there are any in the community deserving of preference, they are the members of unions, who have fought for, and paid for, the bettering of working conditions. But as a measure on which to dissolve both Houses of the National Parliament I say that the Bill was not worth the paper on which it was written. The question is not a national one; but this ""shadow of a sham"" was introduced of set purpose. The majority of honourable members on this side had the honour of being trade unionists before they were members of Parliament; and under no circumstances could they accept a measure that meant anything in the way of an attack on the principle of unionism. affect a great number of people, I was bitterly opposed to it, because if it were allowed to pass without opposition it would have been regarded by some people as an indication that, in a certain degree, we were prepared to swallow our principles. The great show-card of the Government at the last election was a system of national insurance to provide against unemployment, accident, and general disasters to workers. What has become of that proposal? people who are unfeeling enough to say that there are no unemployed in Victoria; but in the metropolitan area to-day there are between 6,000 and 7,000. If the Government were desirous of carrying out the principal planks of their platform, why did they not introduce their measure for national insurance? Had such a measure been introduced with, the object of alleviating the hardships undergone by the average working man, all honourable members on this side would have been only too pleased to give it whole-hearted support. But the Government never had any intention to give effect to such a system. It is generally admitted, and it was recognised by the Attorney-General and every supporter of the Government, that the Constitution does not give Parliament the power to pass a measure of the kind. An appeal is to he made to the electors; but we have no proposal to alter the Constitution, though I have no doubt that a system of national insurance will again be the trump-card of the Government. Eveni f the Government were returned to power on that issue, what would be the result? The Bill would be placed on the statute book, but it would receive the same treatment at the hands of the High Court that was given to the Excise Tariff Act, the Trades ""Union Marks Act, and the Seamen's Compensation Act. I ask the Attorney-General whether he considers that this Parliament has the necessary power to give effect to a system of national insurance as advocated by his party at the last election? This is a question on which the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister should be absolutely candid. When the Attorney-General opened his campaign, he proclaimed from every platform that the Liberal GoAlthough this Bill did not vernment, if returned, would abolish the system of old-age pensions. He also said that he did not approve of the maternity allowance, and would substitute something better in the shape of national insurance. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That statement has been repeatedly denied hy me. gentleman would give an oflicial denial through the press in which the statement There are appeared. The statement has appeared again and again that the Attorney-General said that if he had the power he would immediately abolish old-age pensions, because the system "" sapped the moral fibre "" of the men of Australia. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That statement has never been made in the press.",81,Tkanssebred To Tetjst Pointed Out That The Only Effectual Way

IBVINE -The statement the honourable member has made has never appeared in the press. quoted the statement, the name of the newspaper, and the date on which the speech was made; and no person can forget words of that description. At the outset of his election campaign the Attorney-General tried to direct the attention of the people to the importance of the Government scheme of national insurance; and at the latter end of the campaign he was asked by one of his audience whether he considered there was the necessary constitutional power to give effect to it. TJp to then the honourable gentleman had never expressed any doubt; but when he was brought face to face with the question he made the reply, "" I believe we have that power; but, if not, we shall ask the people of Australia to give the power by an alteration of the Constitution."" I shall confine my remarks mainly to the questions of Protection, initiative and referendum, and elective Ministries. We shall never have a proper protective system until the people have the power of controlling the Parliament. The present Government cannot claim to have introduced any protective policy whatever. If they sincerely wish to introduce a protective Tariff, let them take the business out of the hands of the Inter-State Commission, or make the Commission hand in a report on certain matters that can be dealt with. If they say that our Government did not bring in a definite and f u l l time that any British Dominion has ever Tariff, I will admit it ; but many articles were dealt with by us in the 1910 and 1911 Tariffs. Those measures were not merely a rectification of anomalies, but benefited many trades and callings. It is only by a technical legal twisting of the Constitution, and the bringing in a B ill that was a farce and a fraud, that the Government have brought us before the people. The Prime Minister said we went out with a majority of ten at the last elections, and came back in a minority of one. As a matter of fact, we did not lose in actual numbers. If we take the two It has appeared in Houses together, we actually gained one majority was in another place. creased our numbers from sixty-five to sixty-six. On the other hand, the Ministerial party in the Senate went out fourteen strong, and came back only seven strong, thus losing 50 per cent, in a House of which the franchise is more equitable in its incidence than the franchise of this House. On the other hand, our increase in that Chamber was 175 per cent., let me remind the Prime Minister. He also said that we boasted that we had done away with borrowing, and taunted us with having actually incurred a debt of £9,000,000 through the note issue. Was ever such a ridiculous statement made? The present Treasurer has gone out of his way to insist on a gold reserve of 25 per cent, up to £7,000,000, and pound for pound after that. cent, all through. the Treasurer has not kept himself posted in what the world is doing in reference to its gold reserve in comparison to its liabilities. When the banks held the gold, it was supposed to be held only against the note issue, but it must not be forgotten that they had a large fluid liability in the shape of current accounts or deposits at call. In addition, every deposit receipt held by the Associated Banks at interest was a liability upon them. I propose to show that it is ridiculous to say that the money raised by the note issue was a loan. It is bringing in interest to the Commonwealth, because a large portion of it has been lent to the States. This is the first been so fortunately placed. The Australian Insurance and Banking Record for 1909 shows that the notes in circulation by all the banks in the Australian States before the Commonwealth note issue entered into competition with them totalled £3,397,677. Adding the Treasury notes issued by the State of Queensland to the amount of £1,540,103, we get a sum total of £4,937,880 of notes issued. That has been doubled.

Otherwise, how in so short a time could such an increase of notes be utilized throughout the length and breadth of Australia ? keep certain notes of issue in their coffers at all times.' knowledge, but do not want to go into details. I was in a bank for seven years, and therefore I know something about the matter. WhatI want to show is that, whereas the banks had a certain amount of gold, they had many liabilities. But the gold reserve which the Treasurer is holding up to 46 per cent 43.85 per cent, at the present momentis one which no country in the world has ever had. The only liabilities against that issue are the notes. current accounts, no deposits at call, no deposits at interest. There are none of the liabilities which mount up to the banks, and which in hours of need and trouble that we hope will never come again are unrealizable when they t r y to bring in their advances. I propose to quote from page 204 of the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record for 1909 to show the ridiculousness of the Treasurer holding a gold reserve of 43.85 per cent Messrs. T. J. Thompson& Sons, in their stock and share report, dated Sydney, 1st March, preface their notes on market operations with the following remarks:"" One hears and reads a lot of rubbish about gold and about the advantage to the world and nations and people to stock up large supplies of the metal. Well, the experience of the world must, on a very large scale, bo very much what ours is. We buy and sell hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of securities in a year, and how much gold do we handle? Practically none. A little small change is needed for retail purposes, but to have more than a pound or two in coin in your pocket is a positive nuisance. What we want is a good banking balance. but it means nothing of the kind. You could get gold, doubtless, if you were silly enough to burden yourself with it ; but, then, you do not do anything of the kind. It may be said that your bank keeps your gold for you; but we know of an instance where a Sydney bank cleared many tens of thousands in cheques in a day, and at the close of business its difference settled at the clearing was infinitesimal. There are in New South Wales £18.000,000 in current accounts and £26,000,000 in deposits at interest, and the banking transactions in the course of the year run up to It shows that fully £500,000,000; but the gold banks hold is less than £10,000,000, and we could double tbe banking deposits and pass £1,000,000,000 in cheques through the banks with a smaller stock of gold than they hold to-day."" An y statist shows that, as regards the transactions of the New York Stock Exchange for one month only, the whole of the gold, silver, and copper currency in the world could not settle them. Quoting from page 929 of the same volume, the gold reserve of all the banks was £26,000,000, but they hadtotal liabilities of £122,000,000-namely , current notes, £4,900,000; deposits at call, £45,000,000 ; deposits at interest, £69,000,000; that is, only 21 per cent, as against 40 per cent., or to be more accurate 43.85per cent, which the Treasurer wants to hold against the Australian notes. I intend to show that whereas the whole of the gold in the banks of Australia at that time was £26,000,000, the amounts dealt with by the clearing house for Melbourne There are no from 13th A p r i l to 11th May, 1914, totalled over £27,000,000, and the balances, which were settled by certificatesthat is IOTJ's, so to speak, which are generally printed on parchment, going up to £1,000 in value-amounte d to £1,700,000. The actual balance of that huge amount settled in coin was only £1,119,000. Although the settlement in coin was not 5 per cent.,yet the Treasurer says that we ought to keep a big balance of 43.85 per cent. That means that forty-three sovereigns must be kept for every £100 of a certain currency. There is not a banking institution that could possibly exist to-day if it were carried out in such a stupid and blundering fashion. No country yet has succeeded in being great that has had a Free Trade policy. The trade of Great Britaini n the earliest part of last centur y was buil t upon possibly the strongest Protectionist Tariff that it has had. Out of the 200 death penalties which then degraded the statute--book, ' T h a t means gold,' many will say; seventy-five were for breaches of the Customs and Excise Acts. Take the history of any country in the world. Whenever manufactories have sprung up in the cities they have become populous, rich, and dominant.

There is not one dominant Protectionist The on the Inter-State Commission. I should not mind if we had a genuine Free Trader and an out and out Protectionist on the Commission, with Mr Lockyer to hold the balance between them.

The vote of Connecticut was the final one required of three-fourths of the States to secure the adoption of the amendment. Thirty-six States, with Connecticut's action included, had, up to 9th April, adopted the amendment.

In only one instance have the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of Victoria heen called upon to select a senator to represent this State. On that occasion the members of the two Houses met in conference, and a division was called for by Mr Prendergast and myself; The late Mr Robert Beid was elected by a mighty majority. Later on, after he had vilely Cameron Kingston, he and his firm were proved in the Courts of this country to have been' guilty of from eighteen to twenty-two separate cases of robbing the Customs. He was so careless of the statements which he made on oath while in the witness-box that the presiding Judge said t h a t ' h e could view his statements merely as the foolish words of an irascible old gentleman.

We are told that of bhe dead we should speak no evil, but I consider it my duty to speak the truth , and the truth of what I have said about the late Mr Robert Reid is shown by the public records. If the Government would bring in a B ill to provide for the initiative and referendum ib would receive the support of every member of our party. Thei n troduction of such legislation wonld be the greatest monument bhab could be raised to bhe memory of the man responsible for it . How can the Governmenb refuse to trust bhe people who created this Parliament ? We as a party have adopted the principle, and will give effect to it if we come back w it h a majority. Eveni f we do nob secure a majoriby, we shall fight for the initiative and referendum as one of the planks of our platform, be'lieving bhab ib is a power bhat bhe people should possess.
