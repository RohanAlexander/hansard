A large number of different species of insects have ticca introduced into Australia and acclimatized, first under quarantine conditions. Extensive experiments have been carried out to ascertain whether the insects will feed on any plant other than prickly peav. Large numbers of certain species of insects will now be liberated. There, ia little doubt that the inseuts will be capable of at least holding the pear ia check.

EARLE PAGE -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. Yes. S. It is a fact that after the pensioner has been 28 days in the hospital the' department pays 13s. 6d. per week. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act the only payment for which thc department is liable is 3s. per week to the pensioner. The remaining 10s.

No. The amount which would he involved by the payment of an additional 4s. per week is not known, but possibly it would be -£2,000 per annum. 4.

The Commonwealth has no voice in the management of hospitals, and it is not considered desirable to increase the amount at present paid.

Debate resumed from 8th July (vide That the bill bo now read a second time. by way of amendment That after the word "" now"" the following words be inserted:-""withdraw n and redrafted to provide more adequate provisions regarding alien immigration, and for the reconsideration of the drastic proposals to deport Australian citizens."" bill has been introduced to enable the Government to control the introduction into Australia of foreign migrants.. The Opposition is trying to throw dust in the eyes of the electors by attempting to discredit the Governmenton a charge of encouraging Italians and other migrants from Southern Europe to land in Australia. clause in the bill is designed to bring about the more effective control of immigration is an answer to that charge. Both the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), when speaking the other night, made it clear that the Government, had arranged to introduce the quota system as far as the introduction of foreign migrants was concerned. It cannot be too often repeated that the Commonwealth Government does not in any way give any encouragement or assistance, either morally or financially, to other than British migrants to come to the Commonwealth. The fact remains, however, that we cannot hope to hold indefinitely this empty Australia of ours. We must be prepared to populate ifc, and it may happen that some day we shall be told so, possibly not by means of peaceful penetration. Some years ago a representative of China visited Australia, and when he returned to his own countiy he was reported to ha.ve saidI saw more trees than men. The Almighty gave Australia to Australians, and they could not use it, so He took it away from them and gave it to the English. If the English do not use it He will undoubtedly take it away from them. In that statement is a moral which the people of Australia, should not ignore. The speech by the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) illustrated BILL. the extraordinary development of Australia during the last 140 years. I agree with him that we have done well with a population of only 6,000,000. Our long lines of railways, our wonderful telegraph system, and our splendid harbour and river improvements, are all very creditable, but one has only to travel, for instance, in the north of Queensland, or in tlie great state of Western Australia, to see the extraordinary amount of development that has yet to take place, and to realize the great necessity for more population. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), ancl also the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), in their speeches quoted extensively from the report of Royal Commissioner Ferry on alien immigration to North Queensland. Neither of these honourable gentlemen were prepared to include in their speeches any favorable reference to the Italians. The following statement was The very fact that a published in the.

The Cabinet The following testimonies were given by is fully alive to the necessity for peopling the three experienced members of the Australian North, and is also aware that many Italians Workers Union, and similar references were have gone on the land and have become good given by others:(1) In my opinion the Italian is a man I recently visited the far north of Queenswho"" will stick up for his rights. land, and as alien immigration is a very He does his work well. I should say the Italian is as good a unionist as livei question throughout the Commonany other class of worker. (2) The Italian members of the union are about it . loyal to the union. They are anxious of to carry out the awards and laws of them, the country. The Italian does not wish to work more than eight hours men, a day. Every member of the union detheir report was that the Italians were mands the full rate laid down by the law-abiding, honest in. their financial award. (3) As far as I know the Italians do not all that could be desired. I do not wish undercut the rates of the stigar it to be suggested for a moment that I award. Another Australian Workers' representative into Australia of these people, but it is said(1) I have had many a meal with the Italian cutters, and although his on record to show that the Italians are class of food is not the same as ours, not of a poor type, as the Oppositho Italian worker lives well. There tion would lead those living in the is plenty of food on his table. I southern states to believe. As a matter take it his standard of living is as of fact the Queensland Labour Governhigh as the British -Some of the houses of the Italians are very nice. ment has ample power to prevent aliens Of course, some of the houses of thc from being employed in the sugar in new settlers are pretty rough. Some dustry in any capacity. Britishers have to rough it till they get on their feet. (2) There is no doubt that the Italians particular pretended to be greatly dislive well. (3) I would say that the standard of were employed cutting cane in F o r t h living of the Italian after he has Queensland. He quoted figures to show been out any length of time will compare favourably with that of the the proportion of Italians employed Britisli, but the standard of living in certain sugar areas as compared with of recent arrivals is very low. (4) The Northern Italian conformed to figures for the whole industry, but made the industrial and also to the social it appear from those he quoted that the standard of the British. The evidence also shows that the Italian industry had children are well cared for, and sent regularly Italians. to schools, and later, when his means permit, member to the secondary schools. Mr Theodore, the ex-Premier of QueensThat legislation was introduced by a land, also made a reference to the Libera] government, and it empowers the Italians, and he, speaking at Townsville, authorities to apply the dictation test to was reported as follows: The ex-Premier( Mr Theodore) declared that either as a grower or a labourer. A morally there could be nothing wrong with the large number of Italians has been atItalians coming to the country. The country tracted to the sugar industry in North required population, and that if it required population it was foolish to rave against people Queensland. coming in. Mr Mackay. Some of the Brisbane pressmen thought that these remarks were in conflict w it h statements made by the Queensland State Government, so they approached Mr. Gillies, the present Premier, who is reOn the contrary, Mr Theodore's remarks are settlers. wealth, I decided to make inquiries I consulted the officials the police wherever I met and also various business and almost without exception dealings, good workers, and their morals am here to advocate the introduction only righ t that I should place some facts The honourable member for Darlingi n tressed because a number of these men British. He did not attempt to give the been overcrowded by I remind the honourable that on the Queensland statute-book is a measure known as Ihe Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913. any person engaged in the sugar industry I had a consultation with the president of one of the unions, in the course.of which I asked him how he got on with Italians. He replied that his organizers had no trouble in inducing the Itaii'ms to become members of various unions, that already 1,000 of them were registered as such, each paying £ 1 a year to the funds of the unions, and that the only fault he could find with, these Italian people w-is that they worked too hard. advocating their unrestricted entry into Australia ? pointed out that I do not advocate the unrestricted admission of these people to this country, but it is only fair to the Italians, and to the Government, to give the other side of the case to that presented by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley). Gillies and Theodore. find the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) in agreement with even one person. The Government of Queensland, without reference to the Commonwealth Government, may, under existing legislation, practically debar any person from engaging in the sugar industry. The act that I have mentioned is entitled "" An act to prohibit the employment of certain forms of labour in the production of sugar, and for other incidental purposes."" As sections 2, 3 and 4 of that act enable the Labour Government of Queensland to deal effectively with the position, which honourable members who have spoken have stated is so unsatisfactory, I shall place them on record. Section2 readsIn this act the expression "" Certificate of having passed the dictation test"" means a certificate under the hand of a state officer, authorized for that purpose by the Secretary for Agriculture, tliat, when the' said officer has dictated to the person concerned, not less than 50 words in such language as the Secretary for Agriculture may direct, such person has correctly written them out in that language in the presence of the said officer. Under that section any person may be prevented from engaging in the sugar industry in Queensland, as it is a simple matter t'o require a foreigner to write a number of words in a language of which he has no knowledge whatever. upon ? [42 ] able member himself to supply an answer to his question. I have given the law of Queensland. The complaint of honourable members opposite, and of members of the Queensland Parliament, is that the Commonwealth Government is endeavouring to bring these foreigners here, and that they are engaging in . the industry I s the honourable member to the detriment of Britishers. I am now showing that the State Government can .take such action as will prevent this haphave already pening. The definition of ""occupier"" is as followe : The expression "" Occupier"" includes owner in fee simple or for any less estate, and lessee for life or for any term of years, or at will, and whether on the share system or otherwise, and any occupier under any form of tenancy or agreement whatever, Avhether express or implied, with the owner of the land. Section3 is important, as it provides that I agree absolutely with certain persons may .be prevented from growing sugar-cane. It is well known It is refreshing to that a number of foreigners who have come to Australia have invested considerable sums of money in purchasing sugar plantations. Under the act the Government of Queensland has power to deal with them. The section readsAfter the passing of this act, it shall be unlawful for any person who has not first obtained in the prescribed manner a certificate of having passed thc dictation test to engage in or carry on the cultivation of sugar cane upon any land within Queensland of which such person, whether individually or in partnership or association with others, is the occupier. Any such person who acts in contravention of this section shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £100, and the crop of sugar cane so being cultivated shall be liable to be forfeited to His Majesty by order of the court before which the offence is proved. Section4 provides that certain persons shall not be employed in the sugar industry, and readsAfter the passing of this act(i) Any employer who either directly or indirectly, or under any pretence or device, attempts to employ, or employs, or authorizes or permits to be employed, in or in connection with the industry of the cultivation of sugar-cane and the) manufacture therefrom of sugar, any person who has not first obtained a certificate of having passed the dictation test; (ii) Any person who has not first obtained a certificate of having passed the dictation test who is employed in or in connection with such industry; -",16,Immigration Second Reading

Tliese penalties are very drastic. Whilei t may be said that the Commonwealth Government! should have taken earlier action lo prevent these people from coming co Australia, it is clear that the Labour Government of Queensland has ample power to deal with the position now they are here. No person can reasonably say that the Commonwealth Government is to blame because a few hundreds of foreigners are engaged in the sugar industry. L e t me quote Mr of the present Labour Government of Queensland. Jones and the ForeignI n f l u x , "" this report has been published""The burning question on the north-cast coast is the influx of Italians,"" declared the Minister for Mines yesterday, after a long trip in the northern regions. "" About 300 travelled up on the same train as I did,"" said the Minister, "" I find the complaint is not altogether new, for the police magistrate at Ingham told me there were this season 87 gangs of cane-cutters registered, and only seven of the number are British. A gang consists of nine persons, therefore of 083 canecutters, only seven are not foreigners. Not seven gangs, but seven persons, and these gangs are not of recent comers."" Mail as follows: Some strong statements regarding the Italian influx were made by the Minister for his recent northern tour. inquiries as to the position created by the influx of Italians. Babinda mill was not working, owing to dispute over the employment of an undue number of foreign gangs. It was obvious that the labour market had been completely glutted by the influx, ancl if all the foreigners in the district got employment, it meant the displacement of a considerable number of British workmen. Mr Macleay. complained of the conditions in this industry in northern Queensland, and placed the hlame on the Commonwealth Government, whereas they have the power under their own act to adequately deal w i th the situation. One is tempted to say that the statements that have been made in this House and outside have been made in. order to secure a party political advantage. The remedy undoubtedly is in. the hands of the Queensland Government. I shall support the amendment of this act, which provides for the deportation of persons who are guilty of any of the offences described in sub-clause d of section 8A, unless it can be clearly shown that such action is against the interests of legitimate trade unionism in Australia. I regard trade unions as an important factor in the trade and industry of the country, and I advocate such legal recognition of them as would tend to promote and protect the true interests of all the wage earners. I would remind members opposite that the Nationalist party is just as keen as they are in rooting out evils from Under the heading, "" Mr the body of the community. As a member of the Nationalist party, I am not anti-Labour. I am anti-socialistic and I am anti-communistic. I believe in reasonable hours of work, in a high standard of living for every man, woman, and child in the community. I do not stand for sweated labour, or for u n f a i r profits under the present economic system. I do not claim that the latter is all that it should be, but until I can be convinced that there is some better system, I shall continue to support a policy that gives equal opportunity to every citizen in the community. Proposed new section 8A, sub-section 1, paragraph d, provides that any personwho advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law. or who advocates the abolition of organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials may be deported.

52,Mr Mccormack Said He Made A Great Many,"mentioned in that clause. In their hearts members of the Opposition desire to see the Labour movement cleared of many of the parasites with which it is now afflicted. party to which the honourable member belongs. ""Would he like to clear them out? people will attach themselves to all parties. I do not claim that we on this side are altogether free in that respect. Some branches of the Labour movement, apparently as is shown by the following paragraph which appeared in the Melbourne Age of the 9th JulyFederated iron workers at Lithgow have by resolution decided to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the deportation bill, "" as in the event of the measure becoming law, should a Labour Goverument enter office after the next elections, the act would be forcibly exercised on Mr Bruce himself, as it was apparent that he was the real culprit in fomenting strikes in Australia."" It is a poor rule that does not operate both ways. If people believe in the deportation of the present Prime Minister, they surely can have no objection to the deportation of some of the persons who have been creating a great deal of mischief lately -Order! Honourable members must not I conclude by saying that I strongly object to the overthrow of constituted authority by individuals who seek a short cut to the socialization of industry by revolutionary methods, . and I shall, therefore, support the second reading of the bill. -I have listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay). Unlike the honourable member, I am opposed to the bill. One would assume from his remarks that he was as good as a Labour man. The honourable member says that he is not anti-Labour, but confesses to being anticommunistic. If that be true, he should be on this side of the House. ber agrees with what I said, he should be on this side of the House. knows that the Labour party is opposed to communism. Labour conference held in Melbourne it was decided1. Neither the Communist party nor a branch thereof may be or become affiliated with the Australian Labour party. 2. That no member oF a Communist party may be or become a member ot the Australian Labour party. 3. That every man or woman desiring to become a member of a Labour organization must sign a pledge that he is not a member of the S u c h objectionable Communist party. Communist candidates opposed Labour candidates at the recent State elections, and even for the whole of the State of New South Wales the communist vote favour deportation, amountad to only 1,000. J . Garden, che leader of the communists in that State, received only about 400 votes in a strong Labour constituency. The bogy of communism will not frighten any one now. Although the communists are debarred from joining the Labour"" party, they may join the Nationalist party.

He said he knew of one. persist in interjecting. for Lilley( Mr Mackay) said he was as good as a Labour man. I shall quote something to show who helped to put the honourable member for Lilley into Parliament, and whose work he is doing here. Naturally, as they supplied the sinews of war, they dictate the policy of those selected under the Nationalist banner. WhatI shall say has a very important bearing on industrial disputes, and will explain why men in industries organize to secure better conditions, and why it, would be most unjust to deport their leaders. the honourable member's remarks a bearing on this bill ? the deportation clauses of the bill, because many of these men behind the Nationalist party provoke the workers to strike.

The meeting decided upon a certain policy for opposing the demands of the workers. The chairman of the meeting was Mr C. W . Campbell, who is no doubt well known to the honourable member for Lilley. He saidI would like to say this just before I sit down, that the press are excluded from this conference, so that there can be free, open discussion, and I intend to move at a later stage that a Press Committee be appointed to go through the report and decide just how much shall bi given to the press.

I naturally desired to expose these pernicious organizations that stand behind the Nationalist party. workers meeting raise a force to fight the workers. am reminded of what occurred in the olden days, when the following platform was decided upon by a private meeting of shippers, pastoralists, merchants, members of Parliament, and other large employers of labour in New South Wales1. Plan to overthrow the combination of labour and unionism and thc universal advancement of the workers. 2. To obtain co-operation of various Australian Governments with a view to enable the Australian employers of labour to enforce all or any agreed terms of the employers by force of arms. 3. To enforce through Government freedom of contract by the force of law and order. 4. The maintenance of a high standard of wages as applied to shearers and others until such time as the unions agree to receiving freedom of contract' under any conditions. 5. The disbanding of unions by means of freedom of contract, and then the rapid reduction of wages at once (25 per cent.) for all employment. (i. The Pastoralists' Union in conjunction with the Employers and Shippers' Unions to agree to the conditions and act as a body when either party's interests are involved. 7. The Shipping Union to arrange as part and parcel of capital to introduce German, Italian and coolie labour hy the importation of 5,000 men per year. 8. That arrangements be at onee made to secure the adoption of General Booth's emigration scheme-the flooding of the Australian labour market. 9. That free passes be granted to all men desirous of leaving the city in time of metropolitan strikes or vice versa to enable men to come from the country districts. 10. The arming of all free labour in self defence. 11. To discharge gradually all union labour from shipping and other circles of employment. The prevention at all hazards of one man one vote. 12. The Labour candidates to be opposed by good local men, or where no local men to put up a Labour candidate favorable to capital; all his expenses to be paid by the association. That plank of the proposed platform has a very important bearing on the bill, and shows how the tories of tlie day treated the "" good old trade unionism "" they now praise. The platform continues13. That the representatives of shipping, commerce, and pastoralists combine to make the combination of labour illegal. Mr W. G. Spence, who was a Nationalist member of this Parliament, and held They incite office in a Nationalist Ministry, was to strike. At a secret shown that document, and in his book, those persons wanted to Australia's Awakening, he saidI Tlic original of the above was given to me by one who said he was present. He gave mc at the same time a good deal of verbal information, which I have since verified. It is of no use honourable members opposite saying that they believe in trade unionism, because they arc tied to political parties and wealthy interests that are identical with these to which the framers of the above platform were tied. This bill aims a blow at trade unionism.' Because the Labour party fought for trade unionism, and men who were branded as extremists blazed the track to make the combination of employees practicable, and consideration of their claims by an Arbitration Court possible, arbitration has become popular in Australia, and certain honourable members opposite now say that they believe in trade unionism. The honourable member for played an important part in building up trade unionism in this country. orable member has been speaking for 25 minutes, but so f a r has said nothing about the bill. the deportation of those who bring about, strikes, and it also deals with alien immigration. I desire to show that men like the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Mann) would have been deported in the past had such legislation been in existence. That honourable member was the leader of a strike in Western Australia. I say nothing against h i m for that, because I am told that the tory government of the day were badly treating the public servants, and he successfully interested himself in a just cause. Wouldi t have been right to deport him from Australia, to tear h i m from his family and send him to another country without a proper trial before a jury ?

82,Mr Eorde,"The bill provides f o rHamilton, who afterwards became President of the Queensland Legislative Council. In the early days he was engaged in a strike in Queensland, and, under a conservative government, with a band of comrades who dared to form a strike committee, was sent to jail for three years. We now have in power in the Commonwealth a tory without giving such men a trial before a. jury of their peers, would deport them to some other country. Such action will not meet with the approval of the people of Australia. Honourable members condemn extremists and trade union leaders! It requires courage for any one to organize a big body of men who are engaged in an industry, and lead them in their industrial disputes. No one can say that the organizer or union official gains much personally by his exertions; he makes only a bare living. of the trade union leader to-day ? Honourable members opposite decry them as parasites, and as men who are endeavouring to cause industrial disturbances and bring about the dislocation of the trade and commerce of Australia. But I maintain that these men enter uf5on this work, not for what they can get out of it, but from a desire to assist their fellow men by enabling them to speak as with one voice to the employers of labour. Tho Labour party does not believe in strikes as a general policy; on the contrary, it believes in conciliation and arbitration. has been responsible for the establishment throughout Australia of arbitration -courts. Arbitration has been advocated ever since the Labour movement began. The Labour party believes in the strict observance of arbitration court awards, and has no sympathy with anybody who would flout them. principle, this Parliament should be opposed to the deportation without trial of any citizen of Australia. that it will be possible for a government constituted like that which now occupies the treasury bench to appoint a hoard which will be temperamentally unfitted to try these men though give satisfaction to the shipping combine and the employers of Australia generally. In Queensland, in 1893, absolute bias was shown by a judge at the trial of some men who were concerned in Mr Forde. an industrial dispute. He clearly showed that it was his opinion that those men should be put in leg irons; and they were. If the Government is in a position to take the trial of industrial leaders out of the hands of a properly-constituted court, and may appoint a special tribunal for the purpose, it is possible that these men will government, which, not receive fair treatment. We should insist on ibe trial, by a properly-constituted court and jury, of all persons whom the Governm-snt think should be deported, if this bill becomes an act. It is a provision of Magna Charta thatNo freeman shall be arrested or detained in prison, or deprived of his freehold, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way molested; and we will not set forth against him or send against him unless by a lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land. That is a provision which should be apWhat is the position plied to-day in dealing with industrial upheavals. The Government will find that the people of Australia will not stand for the policy they, are trying to force upon them. The action of the Labour party in connection with industrial disputes was exemplified by the New South Wales Labour Premier, who, only the other day, instead of trying to fan the flame of unrest into a mighty conflagration , arranged a conference between representatives of the Seamen's Union and the Commonwealth Shipping Board. He believes in conciliation, and he brought about an agreement which, I believe, is going to put an end to what but for his It action might have been a disastrous strike throughout Australia. the trouble at Mort's Dock. this bill as a blow aimed at trade unionism in Australia. At a meeting of the EmAs a matter of ployers Federation it was pointed out that ir. order to fight aggressive trade unionism a levy would have to be imposed on emWe know ployers, and one man said that an armed force was necessary. These people, in their secret meetings, foment industrial trouble and strife. Now they want to arrest men who are prepared to lead their fairly, fellow workers, and give them the best they will be likely to that is in them, not for personal gain, but in ordei to uplift them. They would tear such men from their homes, and deport them without, a trial to some foreign land. Surely that is not a policy which an Australian Parliament will approve. Surely honourable members",24,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard
83,Mr Charlton,He also put an end to,25,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard
84,Mr Forde,"That is so. I regarddo not desire that our workers shall be a body of craven sycophants in their relations with their employers. That is not the type of men we want in Australia. We want men who are prepared to join unions to say what they think, and, if necessary, become their leaders, and not men who prefer to swim with the stream and take the path of least resistance. The path pf the reformer is undoubtedly a very thorny one. The men who in the past have been foremost in bringing about reforms from which the world benefits to-day were branded as extremists in their time, and it was thought by some that they should be deported from the countries in which they lived. They were extremists who, under Garibaldi, united Italy, and by some their efforts were considered detrimental to the interests of their country. They were extremists who, under Bismarck, organized Germany. They were extremists who built up the great Renublic of the United States of America, and were responsible for the independence which that country celebrates on the 4th July. Honourable members opposite will not forget that only recently the Prime Minister sent a message of congratulation to the American Government on that day. They were extremists who liberated 17,000,000 of slaves in the United States of America. Will honourable members suggest that if in their day those reformers had been depc,rted without a trial by jury from the countries in which they lived it would have been a good thing for the present generation? It is to men who were regarded as extremists that we owe our British liberty and freedom. Magna Charta was won by such men. practically at the point of the sword. Are we going to repress the virile spirit which has been responsible for all reforms? They were extremists who were behind the Ballarat stockade, but they won for the miners of Australia the freedom and liberty which they enjoy to-day. miners. fited the working class generally. A reward of £500 was offered for the capture, dead ment under which they sign on any vessel, and or alive, of Peter Lalor, who had the persist in preventing the sailing of ships or courage to lead the men, not for personal exercise job control, this group will bring ali gain, but for the uplifting of the working possible people of this country. Peter Lalor lived to union continues in its attitude it will be see thc day when he was honoured by his isolated from the group. In the event of these fellow citizens, and eventually elevated to this very chamber, and to the chair now occupied by you, Mr Speaker. Surely we do not desire to crush that spirit in our Australian manhood. Honourable members opposite will be making a very big mistake if they think they can crush it. The deportation of any of the leaders of unionism would only serve to galvanize organized labour throughout Australia into a great sympathetic strike. Many of the unions in Australia have no sympathy with the views of the leaders of the Seamen's Union, but if these are taken from their home and deported without a trial to some other country, every unionist in Australia will be stirred to strike, and make great sacrifices, if necessary, to resist the deportation of leaders of unions engaged ih fighting for a concession for their members. The Government will make one of the greatest mistakes in its career if it proceeds to deport any one from Australia without a trial in a properly constituted court. The extreme measure proposed by the Government will do more harm than good. The Labour party does not hold itself responsible for the actions of certain individuals in the present dispute, but, as a matter of principle, it is opposed to the method proposed by the Government for dealing with the leaders of industrial unions. We believe that, instead of bringing about the settlement of industrial disputes, the adoption of such a method will foment strikes and trouble, and bring thousands of workers into the strife who to-day are not engaged in any dispute. We have had evidence of the conciliatory spirit displayed by the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Marine Cooks, Butchers and Bakers Association, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Sydney Coal Lumpers Union, the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association, and, indeed, all the unions comprising the transport group. They were the prepared to sign, and have signed, the following statement: Should the Seamen's Union flout the agreepressure to bear on the union to observe thc conditions aforesaid, and if the",25,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard

86,Mr Forde.^Their Efforts Have Bene,"measures not being successful the transport group will not oppose any measures affecting the manning of tlie ships to permit of their continued running. These men are to-day .prepared to observe Arbitration Court awards, but if the Government deports industrial leaders, the unionists of Australia will not go into the merits or demerits of the will consider, on principle, if there is a trace of manhood lef t in them, that they must stand by the union leaders whom the Government propose to treat in a manner characteristic of conservative governments of 50 years ago. matter of fact, honourable members opposite are of the same brand of conservatism 50 years ago. conservative party of that time only in name. party stands for the establishment of new states in the Commonwealth, and on that ground he is regarded by some people as an extremist and a fanatic. In the early days in Victoria, ""men who advocated reforms in the interests of the workers were branded as extremists and red-raggers, and a tory member said in the Victorian ParliamentOutside were a few Trades Hall agitators who should be deported from the country. That old type 1884, when ' a royal working-class children of eight and nine years of age were employed in factories being sent to school, the men who sought to bring about better conditions in the factories were branded as "" "" Trades Hall parasites,"" should be taken by the neck and deported to some other countiy. in our midst to bring about better conditions for the workers. That is better than that they should be craven sycophants, prepared to pimp on their fellow workers in order to gain some personal favours from their ""We should stand by thoso who have the courage of their convictions and will fight for a good cause. opposite do not properly appreciate loyalty of the workers of Australia their leaders, and I warn the .that if it attempts Mr Forde. leaders from Australia, without a proper trial, it will bring about the greatest industrial upheaval that Australia has ever experienced. I shall not say much on the subject of immigration, because it has been very fully dealt with by honourable members on both sides. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) referred to the present seamen's strike. They influx of Italians into Queensland, and dore, Mr Gillies, and others on that subject. I do not question the opinion expressed that the Italian is a good settler and a good worker. There are some As a Italiansi n my electorate, although the bulk of them are settled furthe r north in the electorate of the honourable memthat ruled in Australia ber for Herbert( Mr Bamford).

The opposition to Italians in Queensland is merely opposition to the excessive influx of migrants. There would be opposition to the influx of thousands of Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, or men of any other nationality to a district that could not absorb them. The cause of the trouble in North Queensland was that Italians were sent there in hundreds w it h the cognizance of the Commonwealth Government.

87,Quoted From Speeches Made By Mr Theo,"Chief Secretary's Department, and a very able officer, deals not only with Italians, but also with Finns, Greeks, Maltese, Jugo-Slavs, Serbs, and Albanians. In regard to the Maltese he reported: Maltese are .permitted to enter Australia at tlie rate of 1,200 per annum, and many of them come to North Queensland. In one place there were twenty of them living in one big room. honest, but mostly uneducated, and their standard of living is inferior to that of the British or Italian. witness in Cairns mentioned a case where a countryman of his was induced to work for less than award rates because he could not read or write or speak the English language. He considered the Maltese should have a representative in the union to sec that Maltese arc not cheated out of what was due to them for wages. In a pamphlet issued by the Maltese Government entitled ""The Maltese Emigrant and the Secret of his Success,"" the Maltese is described as a "" docile and conscientious worker,"" and this description is fairly accurate. The arrangement with the Commonwealth Government provides that illiterate Maltese will be allowed to enter Australia provided they obtain special permission, on the application of relatives and friends residing in Australia who are prepared to find work for them on arrival. ' Prom 1st Jul}', 1924, to 28th February last, 560 Maltese left Malta for Australia. Mr Ferry dealt similarly with aliens of other nationalities. Italians is that they are good settlers and good workers, and their mode of living is very simiUr to that of other farmers in my constituency. It is useless for the Government to say that this bill is necessary in order to give power to restrict alien immigration. There is already ample power of restriction if the Government chooses to uit. it , but these new restrictive clauses merely camouflage the deportation provisions. Honourable members on this side will vote against the bill because they object to the deportation proposals, and they will, no doubt, be accused by the Government of having opposed legislation for the restriction of alien immigration. On another occasion the Government coupled British preference with the Singapore Base. the latter we voted against the motion, and the Government then accused us of having voted against the preference proposals. again gulled by that ruse. Already there ' is ample power to deal with immigration, and the Prime Minister has declared that the Government has limited the number of immigrants from different countries. He has also said that regulations have been made by the Government to restrict immigration <qf Maltese to twenty per month in each state, making a total of 1,440 per annum for the whole of Australia, and he admitted in this House that at an Imperial Conference over two They are hard-working and years ago he had entered into an agreement to permit of the number of Maltese immigrants to be increased from 600 to One Maltese 1,200 a year. But those people are now being admitted at the rate of 1,440 a year. The Government can cope with the influx of aliens if it so desires. It has already fixed by regulation a monthly quota of 100 immigrants from Jugo Slavia, Greece, and Albania, and as no man can enter the Commonwealth without presenting a passport, the statement that this bill is necessary to control the influx of Italians, Maltese, Greeks, and other aliens, is in tended only tohoodwink the public. The Labour party is not opposed to systematic immigration. Representing a large portion of a state like Queensland, the Government of which is doing a great deal to settle people on the land, I recognize that Australia can carry a much larger population, but before more people are encouraged to come here, land should be provided for Australians who My experience of are landless and desire to go upon the land. Our unemployed, who> number approximately 150,000, should be absorbed by industry. The Commonwealth Government and the State Governments should co-operate in this work. Take Queensland as an example. There the State Government has made available for settlement 3,000,000 acres in the Northern Burnett, and 1,000,000 acres in the Dawson Valley, and it is also resuming big pastoral areas in south-western Queensland. When we have thrown open the estates that are now closed, and have satisfied the land hunger of our own people and created employment for our own young men and women, we should welcome arrivals from other countries who are prepared to settle in our Because of our opposition to wide spaces. The Government should not induce people to come from England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, or anywhere else before provision has been made for The public is not likely to be their absorption, instead of forcing them to be dependent upon a government dole of rations. That is not the way to develop Australia. .Our secondary industries are languishing because of the inadequate fiscal protection afforded by the present Free Trade Government, and thousands of men and women are out of work. protect those industries, give employmeni to the skilled artisans, resume big pastoral holdings, and provide land for our own done that, we shall be able to afford co induce trained people to come from other cpuntries to work in our factories, or to go into the back blocks to develop the land which at present the pastoralists are allowed to monopolize regardless of the wants of the rest of the people.

He also came to the conclusion that some European races are more desirable as migrants than others. Mr Ferry considers that the type of Greek-h e is not condemning the Greek race-comin g into Australia at present is not desirable. On the other hand, he expresses the opinion that the Finnish migrant on the whole has been satisfactory, and is a desirable class. He does not condemn the' Maltese, and although he criticizes the inferior Italian, yet he does justice to the moro deserving Italian migrant. It is clear that he prefers the^ northern to the southern Italian. That conclusion could hardly be gathered from the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition. I hope 'that the Government will be very chary of operating any really drastic exclusion provision against such a race as the Italians. Asi t is now, their numbers are severely limited. Relatively only a small number of European migrants has come to Australia during the last few years. Mr Ferry said in his report that the average access of non-British migrants during the last three and a half years was between 5,000 and 6,000 a year. In other words, the British access in three and a half years was 101,000, and other nationalities 17,000. suggest that 5,000 Europeans, provided they are decent people, is more than Australia. I suggest that the tremendous outcry about the number of European migrants introduced into Australia is not really justified, however much objection may be justified particular type of migrant. The Honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) made some rather disparaging remarks about modern Italians compared with their illustrious ancestors, Romans. I remind the honourable member that the Italian has a most wonderf u l history. Right down from the Roman times, and through the middle ages to the present day, he has been a leader in the march of civilization. The bulk of our law is largely derived from the codes and institutes of ancient Rome. The great poets and painters of the middle centuries were many of them Italians, and Italians are to be numbered among the great statesmen of the 19th century. A man who has done as much as any other to benefit the human race during the last 50 years is Signor Marconi, who is an Italian. We cannot afford to despise the Italian civilization. think that the honourable member quite did justice to Ihe Italian Listory froin Roman days to the present time. and Garibaldi are recognized by the world as great names. The population of Italy ie 38,500,000 people, and the Italians are, therefore, a powerful European nation. When the Itali-ns joined the Allies during the late war the prospect was not cheerful. I do notthink it wise to give too much praise to .any one race,, but possibly if the Italians had joined our foes the war might have ended differently. These things seem to me to justify the suggestion that drastic provisions should not apply to this European race. Certain other races have been mentioned as migrants. The other day I think the hon zarini) interjected that we should encourage migrants from Scandinavia. Does he know that there are only 2,500,000 people in Norway and 6,000,000 in Sweden?

102,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES I shallfairly wide knowledge of thenl I have no hesitation in saying that they are desirable people to have in the country. But whether it is prudent at the present moment to permit the entry of more Germans to Australia is an-jantirely different matter. We must bear in mind that if we allow Germans to come here, the racial trouble in regard to them, because of the hatred caused by the late war, is likely to be much more acute than any that might be caused by the immigration of peoples who were our allies in that war. That is emphasized in Mr Ferry's report. The majority of those who would come here would, in all probability, be men who were actively engaged against us in the war. For some time the extent to which Germany has been prepared to conform to the ordinary rules governing the relations between nations has been problematical, though the present indications are that the people of that country are returning to a better frame of mind, and, personally, I have little doubt that, once the existing differences between the European nations have been settled amicably, it will not be long before desirable Germans are re-admitted into Australia-of course, only in such numbers as we consider to be wise. All that I have said leads to the conclusion that the greatest care should be exercised in this matter. I have been asked what I consider to te the best way to deal with the situation. WhatI have to say in reply does not refer to the less desirable races, or to the less satisfactory members of any race. I suggest that the best way .to deal with this problem is not by a general exclusion, or even by the application of the quota system, except to those races and those less desirable people that I have mentioned; but there should be, first, a careful supervision of the health, and, as far as possible, the character of foreign migrants; secondly, an arrangement for their more general distribution throughout Australia, so that they shall not congregate in compact colonies where they will retain their national manners and customs; and thirdly, a restriction of the continuity of their original language which would come from them having their own clubs aud schools. There can be no doubt that one of the greatest factors in securing community of view is a common language. In this connection the United States of America afford us an example. Some time ago I. was-speaking to a man who had spent a number of years in Canada and the TJnited States of America, and in the course of conversation I asked him some questions dealing with the character of the people there. He stated that an important characteristic of the people of the United States of America was that, once a decision had been arrived at by thc leaders of the nation, the whole of the people supported it. If it was a question of engaging in war, they would express their opinion-som e bitterlybut once Congress had decided on war they took the stand that, the country being at war, every person in it was at war, notwithstanding what his views were previous to the decision. That is the view of an able man and a keen observer. Yet the population of the United States of America is composed of people of many nationalities, and widely diverse interests. Mention has been made of the economic position which would arise if people from foreign countries were allowed to come here in great numbers. I say that our economic standards will be preserved, by industrial awards, and that,.while the number coming here is small, they will certainly assimilate our ideas rather than impose theirs on us. In the course of an excellent speech the kay) read a number of extracts to show that, the Italians, who constitute the largest percentage of the foreign migrants arriving in Australia, are strong unionists. It may be asked, Why do you want all tbese foreign people in Australia? Why. do you not exclude all these alien races,, and keep Australia purely for the Australian and the Britisher ? I think there is a very good reason for objecting to the restriction being applied too.generally. I believe in a White Australia, but I fear that, by carrying the exclusion policy too far, a danger may arise. This is a time when we should consider the White Australia policy not only from our own point of view, but also from the point of view of the world at, large. My experience, gained while travelling, is that the White Australia policy is not popular in Europe, not even with the British people. The honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton),, when he was at Geneva recently, had an opportunity to speak to",31,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard
103,Honourable Member For Lilley ( Mr Mac,"a large number of well-informed people, and I should like to ask hi m if he found a general enthusiasm for a White. Australia except by Australians, or a common tendency to criticize the policy of this country. not feel inclined to answer that question, and, if he is not, I shall give my own personal experience. I have discussed the subject with many people, and have found a tendency on their part to disparage our White Australia policy, or, at any rate, to be very lukewarm about it . There are good reasons for that attitude. The British race has for many years been inoccupation of India and other countries, where there is black native labour, and it is natural that they should find it difficult to differentiate between those countries and Australia. that in talking on the subject with a number of people, I have nearly always had to argue against opposition, and have rarely found any one, even among British people, unless he has studied the question in Australia, who has not commenced with a prepossession against the White Australia policy. If that is true of the feeling of the British people to-day, is it not likely to be accentuated if we exclude, in addition to Asiatics, large numbers of the European races ? If we pursue an exclusion policy to any considerable length, a time may arrive when even the League of Nations may be forced by general public opinion to rule that immigration is not a question of domestic jurisdiction. That would be a grave, if not a fatal, blow at the White Australia policy.. I suggest that it is a serious contingency, and that, unless the clauses of the bill are administered wisely, the whole of Europe, as well as the rest of the world, may reach a decision that will be detrimental to our interests. As supporting my view I quote from Lord Bryce's book on International Relations. which was written after the League of Nations had come into existence. therefore, had the League of Nationsi n mind, but did not regard it as the only possibility. Dealing with the exclusion of people from vast empty spaces, he saidThere is no international authority entitled Particularly in the eighteenth and nineto intervene, but if the problem should ever become acute, it may have to be solved by a public opinion of the world-a public opinion which does not now exist but which ought to existand solved with a view to the benefit of r mankind as a whole, a thing not yet recognized as constituting a paramount aim which international policy ought to recognize. That is the opinion of a man whose judgment ought certainly to be respected. He was not dealing specifically with the League of Nations, but suggested that, leaving the League of Nations out of The honourable member may account, there was a feeling in the world which, in the last resort, might compel itself to be considered. quire an international convention. That is an argument why we should have had a world-wide conference under the Protocol to settle the question. wish to debate the question of international conventions, or to make, or appear to make, political capital out of this matter. I am stating the opinions I hold, I find although they may not be worth anything. great deal to be said for them. of the danger of severely restricting immigration is supported by one of the greatest English thinkers of the nineteenth century. I leave the question of immigration at that, and come to the consideration of deportation. It has been assumed throughout this debate that deportation is a new thing. That, of course, is an error, for deportation was practised in ancient Greece. Every one remembers the story he learned in his school days of how the just Aristides was deported, or ostracized as they called it then, from Athens, not because of any faul t on his part, but because he was "" the Just."" He was so just that they could not tolerate him any more. Right down through the centuries u n t i l the present day there have been deportations, transportations, or ostracizations, and I think the practice has become somewhat stronger of recent years. I believe there is a very definite He, reason for that. England, for centuries, was a refuge for the exiles of European countries. The Emperor Napoleon III . spent, the last years of hie life in England, and a deposed king is at the present time living; in that country. teenth centuries, England was a home not only for dispossessed monarchs. but also for publicists, politicians, and literary men who were exiled from other countries.

It may be suggested that the Egyptian case of the deportation of Zaghlul Pasha was high handed. case, because Zaghlul Pasha was an Egyptian. Recently there was trouble in New Zealand over a Mr Lyons, and, more important still, there was the in structive and interesting action, taken in South Africa. that action is South Africa has been blotted out. istry that deports a man has to take the risk of being "" blotted out,"" but it may well be that circumstances may make it necessary that a government should jeopardize its own future rather than the safety of the country. In South Africai n 1913-14, during the Rand riots, a strike had been called, and ten of the leaders of it were suddenly and unexpectedly deported from the country. The action taken was admittedly quite illegal, but was subsequently ratified by au act Smuts was the Ministeri n charge, and he apparently broke the law, considering that that was the right thing for him to do in the circumstances, and he relied on Parliament to r a t if y his action afterwards. the matter the other day, I found the opinion expressed that the result of the deportations was that outrages that had been general before were very few afterwards, and that the trouble gradually passed away. This SouthA f r i c an case presents a very great similarity to Australia, w i th the exception T h a t policy did not do that here the Government, instead of first breaking the law and then I am glad asking the House to r a t if y its action, is seeking to have a law passed that it can, if necessary, put into execution. It is the belief of the Government that During the the mere presence of such legislation upon the statute-book may prevent the occurrence of anything that w ill require its application. I do not suppose that it is desired to put it into effect unless undesirable alien who wishes such a course is absolutely necessary. Under Why has this change taken place in the attitude of GreatB r it a in and other countries towards deportation? I suggest that, if plots were indulged in by exiles in earlier days, they were directed against the ruling powers of the country from which they had been expelled, and not against those of the country in which they resided. In recent years, however, That was a very strong the situation has undergone a very great change, due to the growth of internationalism. K a r l Marx was a fugitive from both France and Germany.

I have here a quotation from Trotsky's recent book on Lenin, which I think is apropos of the matter under discussion.

The other night the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) made an admirable speech-looke d at from his point of view -bu t in thc last 1 resort it was somewhat one-sided. He gave a glowing account of the rise of the worker in Australia. On that aspect of the matter there were very few honourable members who could not, in the larger sense sympathize with him, but he did not look at the matter from the point of view of any one except the worker. economic loss that is caused by a great upheaval. loss to the strikers, or thc plight of the wives ancl children of the strikers, who, being the weaker, first go to the they had rights. He made no reference to the undoubted rights of the shipowners, which must necessarily be considered by this House, particularly in view of the existence of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. He did not deal with the economic waste-by loss of wages, by service, and by unemployment-that results from an industrial upheaval, which sooner or later reacts upon this House and would certainly result in requests being made to it for relief. The Government is acting rightly in taking steps to remove unemployment. The other day I read The Life of John Morley, by Professor Morgan. It is a most interesting book. Professor Morgan relates the following conversation that he had with I am convinced that the proMorley:He said, "" I believe in regiments of parties. I do not like that hateful heresy, proportional representation."" I replied, "" That sounds very like the doctrine of autliority."" Morley Unless that course is adopted, said, "" Well, why not? One must govern."" The feeling against deThat is the whole crux of the matter. The Government must govern. If the Opposition helps it to do so, it is better for the country and easier for the Government. If the Government does not govern, lawless individuals will assume the right who have not the power or the right to govern. correct to say that, tlie Government must govern, but we have to ascertain exactly what is the meaning of government. In The worse a democratic community the government should control the powers of the country in the best interests of the country, and in the most harmonious way. Governmenb does not mean control by the use of the mailed fist and the suppression of any ideas that may be contrary to those held by the ruling powers. Rather should an endeavour be made to control the powers of a nation in such a way that industrial conflicts are avoided and class hatreds are not fomented. . This measure is one of the greatest incitements to class hatred that I have ever seen. It is a challenge to trade unionism He. said nothing about the throughout Australia.

One honourable member said, "" If we had the old Labour party, the old trade union movement, there would be no necessity for it . "" He left the impression that in the past the Labour leaders were the embodiment of all that is good and noble. It might be well to remind honourable members opposite of the actions of their predecessors in the time of the good old Labour party and the good old trade union leaders. I shall tell them what members of their party did to the leaders of the trade union movement some years ago. I quote the case of the trade unionists who were forming the Shearers' Unioni n Victoria. ' Honourable members opposite tell us that in the old days trade unionism was sane trade unionism, and they approved of that. what the leaders of their party did to the old trade unionists when they tried to form the Shearers' Unioni n Victoria in 1886. prosecuted Waters and McCormack at Hamilton under an obsolete English act for conspiring to raise wages, and secured their imprisonment for over twelve months. attempted to strangle trade unionism at its birth . trade unionist was given a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment. But the party opposite has indeed made progress and now proposes to deport the leaders of trade unionism. It was found that the jailing of leaders of the Labour movement did not check the progress of If , because of the opinions Labour principles and trade unionism. It was found that when one of. the leaders was sent to j a i l another immediately sprang up to take his place, and it will be found, if this legislation is given effect Progress that just so fast as leaders of Labour are deported from Australia, others will be ready to take their place to carry on the work of trade unionism. In the "" g o o d old days"" in Victoria Judge BecauseI or any other Higinbotham was deprived of the honours of the Deputy Governorship because he contributed to a strike fund . the strikers. It w ill live continually in the help those dependent on the strikers. Tbat is what happened in the days of the During the disold trade unionism in which honourable members opposite profess to believe. Today, under similar circumstances, they would probably try to deport Judge Higinbotham. In the "" good old days "" in Queensland Chief Justice Lilley, who sympathized with the workers, was driven from his position to make room for Sir Samuel Griffith. The action taken against the leaders of Labouri n the "" good old days "" had no effect in checking the advance of unionism, and the legislation now proposed by the Government will have no more effect in checking it , or in preventing the growth of new ideas. This measure will be futile , as honourable members supporting it will find out. In the "" good old days "" Judge Darley, of New South Wales, was congratulated by the press because from the judgment seat he denounced the members of trade But let us see unions as "" a closely-knit band of criminals."" Listening to the speeches made by honourable members opposite we find a remarkable similarity with the lanThe Government of the day guage used by Judge Darley. It certainly may be implied from their remarks that they regard our industrial leaders as criminals who must be punished by deportation. They say that no such drastic legislation would be necesThe Government of the day sary if to-day we had the trade unionism of the "" good old days,"" yet Judge DarleyI n the "" good old days "" the described trade unionists of those days as a closely-knit band of criminals.

118,If Mr West,To help the children of,36,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard
119,Mr Mahony,"Of course, it was tocontent,"" misled men to jail for seven years. The Prime Minister has used almost the identical words of Judge Ennis. He has spoken of the "" poisonous doctrines"" preached by unscrupulous leaders of industrial unions. that a union camp was an unlawful assembly; and a Mr Head,, who was only ten minutes in such a camp, offence. Judge Darley, in another case, when a man was brought before him, who it was proved was 100 miles away from a union camp at the time of his alleged offence, said, "" That does not matter."" The accused had previously been in the camp, and as such camps were unlawful assemblies, he was guilty, and was at once sentenced to two years' These things happened in the days of the old trade unionism, which honourable members opposite tell us they stand for. I have shown how the party to which they belong treated the leaders of trade unionism in the old days, and we know what their class would be prepared to do to trade union leaders to-day. They have, however, to reckon with a different mentality, a different outlook, and a different set of ideas in Australia to-day; and the public conscience of Australia would be stirred to ite very depths if such an outrageous piece of legislation as the bill now under discussion were put into operation in this country. It is the duty of the Government, above all things, to preserve industrial peace. It should promote it by every means in its power; but, in view of the legislation which the Government has submitted, one can only come to the ' conclusion that there has been carefully and craftily planned a conspiracy to bring ahout a huge industrial upheaval in Australia. I could say quite a great deal, but for the sake of inspiracy to bring about a great industrial dustrial peace I shall refrain from saying many things which I might say to-day. I shall probably have an opportunity in a week or two of divulging quite a lot of what I know about this conspiracy. Only a few days ago a deputation of representatives of certain great industrial organianti-Labour press of Australia, and supzations in Australia came to Melbourne to wait upon the Prime Minister. They said they were prepared to discuss with him ways and means to preserve peace and harmony in the industries of AustraMr Mahony. and he then sent the lia. What was the right honourable gentleman's answer to them? He slammed the door in their faces. He told them he would have none of what they proposed, and that it was to be "" a fight to a finish."" He should have been prepared to devote Judge Windeyer said his best endeavours to bring about industrial peace. I can give honourable members my word, as one who all his life has been closely associated with trade was found guilty of an unionism, that it is impossible to coerce trade unions. We will have no coercion. We are prepared to meet those who differ from us in a conciliatory spirit, and let matters in dispute be. determined by reason and logic; but we will not submit to coercion. The. Prime Minister slammed the door in the faces of trade unionists who came to see him in the imprisonment. effort to preserve industrial, peace; and if it were not that we have the good fortune to have in New South Wales a Labour Government led by Mr Lang, we should probably by now have had one of the greatest industrial upheavals that Australia has ever known. The Labour Premier of New South Wales did not slam the door in the faces of trade unionist representativesj but he got to work to bring about industrial peace. As a result of his action there is now little danger of the existing state of affairs leading to an industrial upheaval. It is remarkable to note that when the prospect of peace loomed in sight and the great hound of industrial unrest was to be sent away, we found the jackals snarling. When I picked up the Melbourne newspapers, and especially the Argus, in the hope that I should read an article of jubilation on the prospect of industrial peace, I found instead an article headed, "" Queering the Pitch"" , because we were to have industrial peace and there was to be no strike. What had occurred queered the pitch of their conupheaval. The whole thing was carefully planned. This is the time of the year when the shipping industry is at its lowest point and shipping companies can best afford to lay up their vessels. It was planned by the shipping companies, backed up by the ported by the Government. ber will recognize that we are not discussing the industrial situation under this bill.",36,Workers Union Testimony To Italians High Living Standard
120,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memare discussing a proposal that in the event of certain industrial conditions arising, certain people may be deported. I have endeavoured to show that there was some possibility of such industrial conditions arising but for the action taken by the Labour Government of New South Wales. I say that, in my opinion, certain people in the community were conspiring to bring about a state of industrial unrest so that an opportunity might be afforded for the deportation of industrial leaders. had the .pitch prepared, as the A rgus has admitted. They looked to see what would take place. This bill was to be passed, and there were to be no negotiations with the unions, though they might be prepared to accept all that men could possibly be expected to accept. There was to be a ""figh t to a finish,"" and the Government joined in the conspiracy by introducing a measure for the deportation of industrial leaders. There could be no hope of industrial peace upon those conditions; but when it was assured, the "" pitch "" was said to have been "" queered;"" in other words, there was no chance of bringing about the projected industrial upheaval. I hope the Government, supporters will show a little calm judgment and wisdom in this matter. It is not too late even now for the Government to stay its hand. There is no urgent necessity for this measure. The danger of a big upheaval has disappeared, and it can only be revived if the ship-owners and the Oommonwealth Government so determine. assure' ;the honourable member that the trade unionists do not desire it. our side who does. is the necessity for this measure? The Government would be wise to allow it to remain in abeyance. The' dispute is on the verge of complete settlement.

But I ask honourable members to refrain from stirring up strife. ber is asking us to refrain from doing what he has been doing. is proceeded with the Government must first show justification for it. There is none. There will be no industrial upheaval unless the employers precipitate it. I trust that the Government will give further thought to the matter. If the further consideration of the bill is postponed for a few weeks, the House will realize that there is no need to proceed with it. I congratulate the Government on its genuine endeavour to minimize industrial troubles, and I believe that this bill will go a long way towards achieving that result. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has said that the measure may be divided into two sections, immigration and deportation. Both are essential for the future welfare of Australia. I , like other honourable members, would prefer that all immigrants should be of the English-speaking races, but it is impossible to fill up our empty spaces with Britishers only. I have no objection to Italians. They are good settlers, being law-abiding and industrious. I had the pleasure one Sunday afternoon of hearing a speaker on the racial question say that the Italian race is one of the best in the world. Therefore, I am not opposed to the immigration of Italians. But there are other southern Europeans who should not be admitted to Australia, except upon the severe conditions imposed by this measure. Opposition members have declared that the bill is a direct blow at unionism I have read the bill carefully, and by no stretch of imagination can I find anything in its provisions to justify that interpretaI know of nobody on tion, and anybody who listened to the able and concise exposition of the measure ' by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) must wonder why the members of the Opposition persist in placing such an inaccurate construction upon it. Their leader declared that immigration will cause a great deal of unemployment. I wonder if honourable members opposite are sincere in that contention. It seems to me that it is raised on this occasion, ason other occasions, merely as an electioneering stunt.

When we were discussing the proposed construction of two new cruisers lionorable members opposite said that had the contracts been placed in Australia a great deal of employment would have been provided. They are inconsistent, however, in trying to prevent the passage of this bill for the deportation of men who are promoting industrial strife, which is the parent' of unemployment. Some time ago there was a strike in Australia which paralysed the shipping industry. The waterside workers would not load the ships, and the seamen would not take them to sea. Hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of perishable cargo was lying on the wharfs. The money represented by those goods was lost to the community. If a man enjoying the advantages of Australian institutions and conditions becomes one of those extremists who foment industrial trouble, and retard the progress of the country, he should be deported within twenty-four hours, regardless of Avhether he has been resident in the Commonwealth three years or thirty years. I was astonished by the remarks of the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe). He must have spoken Avith his tongue in his cheek, for nobody knoAvs better than he the plight to Avhich Tasmania has been reduced through the incidence of the Navigation Act and strikes. the last six years strikes have occurred the mainland and Tasmania.

But he later informed me that, because he could travel by rail from one end of Queensland to the other, he had no time to think about Tasmania. I am sorry to say that a similar attitude is adopted by many other honourable members. no time to think about Tasmania. Do not misrepresent my statements. pathy gets Tasmania nowhere.

139,Mr Seabrook,"That kind of symstrikes the workers lose a tremendous amount of working days and wages. According to the Australian Industria l and Mining Standard, on number of strikes that occurred in Australia in 1923 were:-Ne w South Wales, 200 ; Victoria, 29; Queensland, 25; South Australia, 10; Wes'tern Australia, 6 ; Tasmania, 3; and Federal Territory, 1 ; making a grand total of 274 strikes in one year, which is equal to five strikes per week. Tof u l ly realize what a blight on the progress and prosperity of the country this striking business is, one needs to take certain figures over a period of years. ber of working days lost as the result of industrial disputes was 11,181,853, and the loss in wages was £7,986,703. New South Wales the working days lost were 6,938,505, and wages, £5,400,543. In view of these figures of what use is the Arbitration Court? Although this institution was established to bring about industrial peace, yet. it has produced nothing but industrial chaos and turmoil . This is borne out by the motion introduced yesterday member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). The Arbitration Court as at present constituted is one of the greatest curses to Australia. Numerous industries in Australia are idle, and the high cost of production prevents competition with imported goods, notwithstanding that in many cases the duty on imports is from 30 to 50 per cent. We shall have nothing but industrial chaos u n t i l we get r i d oi the Arbitration Court. Mr O'KEEFE -Does the honourable member favour, the lowering of wages ? members opposite talk about maintaining .the high standard of living.

As one of its the 4th December, 1924, the representatives, and on behalf of Tasmania, I welcome the bill, and have very much pleasure in supporting it . not allow a number of the statements of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr. Seabrook) to remain unchallenged. He stated that the Arbitration Court had done nothing but bring about industrial chaos. I contend that on the contrary arbitration has been responsible for an enormous amount of good. It has enabled From 1919 to 1923 the nummanv of our industrial unions to secure better working conditions. In the majority of cases the unions have In worked peacefully, and honoured, in the main, the awards of the court. The honourable member for Franklin also stated that a number of Australian industries were idle, and that the high cost of production and the enormous imports into the country have caused the unemployment of 40,000 of our workmen. This has occurred not because production costs by the honourable are high, but because foreign goods manufactured in cheap-labour countries are dumped into Australia, to the detriment of Australian industries. The honourable member is in favour of lowering wages, but the Labour party is definitely opposed to such a. proposal. I am opposed to alien immigration to any extent at present, not because I believe that members of European races should not be allowed into the Commonwealth, but because the Government is prepared to allow alien immigrants to be employed here, to the detriment of the Australian workmen, thus bringing about a lowering of the wages and conditions which have been won as the result of many years of strenuous effort on the part of. unions before the Arbitration Court. I should not be opposed to a steady influx of alien immigrants at a time when the Government in power was sympathetic towards trade unions and prepared to safeguard the conditions of the Australian workmen. The influx of Italians, Greeks,' and members of other acceptable races would then be beneficial to the Commonwealth, providing their physique and general health were satisfactory.

The existence of flourishing works in our midst would be sufficient to attract skilled workers to our shores, and at no expense to the Commonwealth. The main purpose of the bill is more to cover with a smoke screen the misdeeds of the Government than to deal with alien immigration, or to authorize the deportation of industrial leaders and agitators. It is designed to be used as a weapon to intimidate not only the Labour organizations, but also their leaders. The measure certainlv provides for the deportation of men who are responsible for, or have taken part in, an effort to interfere with trade or commerce or the handling of goods, shipping, and so on. But there is no proposal in the bill to provide for the deportation of capiThey have come here because conditions talists who are responsible for interference here are better, and in many cases have in trade and commerce and the industries of this country. porters are determined to single out a number of industrial leaders and deport them, yet they say nothing about the necessity for deporting those men who advocate, as the honourable member for Franklin has done, the sweeping away of arbitration and the breaking down of conditions which have been won through strenuous effort on the part of industrial leaders. I am sure that there is no desire on the part of honourable members opposite that our present conditions of life should he lowered. Trade and commerce are materially affected from time to time by the market riggers who are in our midst. These men juggle with our commodities, using cold storage and other means to restrict or withhold the commodities of life, and hamper trade and commerce. noticed by the Government, whicli is only concerned with the men who are engaged in industrial disputes-men battling for the improvement of their position and that of their fellows. We also have financiers and bankers who, by their inflation of credit, are able to affect the progress Mr 0. Biley. of the country, closing down manufactories in our midst and throwing thousands out of work. The Government takes no action against them. Again, there are the importers, who dump foreign goods into Australia, adversely Manchester, and Birmingham. affecting our secondary industries. Theso men are certainly no better than the unionist who takes a stand against unfair conditions, but the Government does not propose to deport them. I intend to oppose that portion of the bill which provides for deportation. No matter in what direction the law is broken, we should be able to deal with our citizens, and adequately punish them, if found guilty of an offence by a jury of their peers, without sending them from our shores. I should prefer the Government to be frank and admit that the intention behind the bill is to deport Walsh, Johannsen, and, possibly, Garden also. There can be no question that the Government has certain individuals in mind, Many of these men have arrived here from countries-amon g them Great Britainwhere there is much poverty and squalor. brought their families with them. They The Government suphave taken an interest in the organizations of which they are members, and have endeavoured to make this country brighter and better than that from which they came. Having gained the confidence of their fellow unionists, they have attained the position of leaders in their various unions. Eventually the occasion arises when they must take a definite stand in the interests of their fellows. I do not hesitate to say that frequently the conditions under .which men are asked to work are such as to justify a strike. Men have a right to refuse to work when the conditions are not acceptable to them; that right will never be forfeited by trade unionists. So far as I am concerned, no power on earth would compel me to submit to conditions which were not acceptTheir operations continue unable to me. Honourable members will remember that the wool kings of Australia some months ago decided to withhold their wool from sale, because they considered that the price then obtainable was not satisfactory. They held the wool for a number of months, and only a few days ago again offered it for sale, and obtained higher prices. Apparently, their action was quite in order. But let the unionists refuse to sell their commodity-labour and immediately there is a great outcry on the part of the supporters of the Government. seamen are acting in a just cause. The Commonwealth Shipping Board and the private shipping companies made a great mistake at the outset in not agreeing to come to terms with the men on the issues at stake. In this instance the shipowners, and not the seamen, took the initiative^ as they and the Commonwealth Shipping Board applied to the Arbitration Court for the deregistration of the Seamen's Union. The result was that the union was deregistered by the court, and the seamen were no longer able to enforce the same conditions that previously applied to them. The union leaders, with a view to protecting their men, who would then be at the mercy of harsh and unsympathetic masters whilst at sea, sought to have included in the men's articles a safeguarding clause. A t first the Commonwealth Shipping Board refused the request, as did the private steamship companies, but eventually, for some reasoni t may have been the result of secret negotiations entered into because of the Prime Minister's decision to ensure peace-the Commonwealth Shipping Board reversed its decision, and agreed to the demands of the seamen. . Some of the companies did the same, but it appears that the steamship owners are determined to so manipulate things that, between now and the next federal election, there shall be an industrial upheaval of such magnitude' that the people will be side-tracked, and the misdeeds of the Government overlooked. By that means it is hoped that the present Ministry w ill have a fighting chance of retaining its control of the treasury bench. L e t me refer to the painters and dockers case which came before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court a few weeks ago, as it has a direct bearing on this bill. These men do. important work; should they refuse to carry on, it would mean that necessary repairs and the docking of vessels could not be done. A few months ago the painters and dockers approached the Commonwealth Arbitration Courtf o r an award. The authorities at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, together with those at Garden Island and W i l liamstown, through their industrial officers, opposed the. application, claiming that a special rate should be paid to permanent men, and another rate to casuals. On the 13th November, 1918, I believe that the tice Higgins, dealing with the request for a special rate, said that he refused to fix any but a casual rate for painters and dockers. the honourable member's remarks are not within the limits of the discussion. Speaker, that I was in order in referring to this matter. I was about to show the disabilities under which trade unionists are working at the present time, which, if continued, may cause them to cease work. clear, but very remote. If the honourable member is permitted to continue, any honourable member may claim the right to discuss any award. been submitted to the various departments, and the judge had signified his intention in the matter, he said that he was prepared to consider any reasonable suggestion which would not in any way interfere with, or restrict, what could be regarded as a basic principle. A f t e r Sir John Quick made that statement, furthe r proposals were submitted by those opposing the painters and dockers, and, as a result, the judge altered his proposed judgment. The painters and dockers were deprived of the right to discuss the proposals that had heen tendered, and were denied the opportunity of challenging the accuracy of statements submitted after the case had closed. They are, therefore, dissatisfied with the court's decision, and would be perfectly justified in refusing to work. The Prime Minister evaded his responsibility when he failed to bring the contending parties together. It is the duty of the Government to endeavour to promote peace between contending parties, and to prevent, if possible, an upheaval which might affect the whole country. 1 repeat that I believe that there are agencies at work in our midst which are endeavouring to bring about a crisis before the next federal election.

150,Mr C. Riley,"A f t e r the request hadconfident that when, tlie opportunity presents itself they w ill drive the present Ministryf r o m office, not only because of this proposal, but for other actions of a class nature. Debate (on motion by MrF . FRANCIS ) adiourned. B ill returned from the Senate without amendment. ter and Ministerf c r External Affairs) [3.59] I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock p.m. As honourable members know, it is proposed that the House shall not sit during the period that the American Fleet is here.. In order to enable necessary business to be transacted, the Government feels that it will be necessary to assemble here on Tuesday, instead of Wednesday, next week, that being the week preceding the arrival of the fleet. Question resolved in the affirmative. That the House do now adjourn. days ago I asked a question about the administration of the Lady Davidson Sanatorium, at Turramurra, New South Wales, an institution that is administered by the Eepatriation Department. In reply to m y question, the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Ministerf or Defence, admitted that complaints had been received from the inmates regarding the conditions in the hospital. I wish to bring under the notice of the Government the fact that I am advised that very serious dissatisfaction exists in the hospital regarding the treatment of patients. I haye received complaints that the food is so bad that at times the patients cannot eat it , and that patients sometimes leave the table sick fro m thc effects of the bad cooking. say whether the statements are true or false, for I have not investigated them, but they come from sources in which I place implicit trust. I submit that they call for immediate investigation by the Government. According to information supplied to me by the Prime Minister, there are 65 patients and a staff of 40 at the hospital. In those circumstances, every possible attention should be given to the requirements of the inmates. My correspondents also complain that the in stitution is little better than a glorified prison. The patients are allowed one day's leave every three weeks, and ten days' leave every three months. One result of the treatment is that a number of patients have left the hospital because they will not submit to the regimentation and eat the food provided in ' the institution. Apartf r o m the effect on the health of the individual, it is in jurious to the public-health that the conditions in the institution should be made so intolerable that cases that have not been arrested or cured owing to unsatisfactory conditions go out into civil life. I admit that in many instances the mental depression caused by tuberculosis may result in peevishness and i r r it a b i l it y; .bub if conditions like those I have mentioned exist they preclude in many cases the possibility of cure. I speak feelingly on this subject, because I have come in contact with a number of military hospitals. It was a very sad day for invalid returned soldiers when the Repatriation Department assumed control of these hospitals. When the Red Cross Society controlled the convalescent homes, the soldiers were treated with the utmost kindness and consideration, . their wants were satisfied, and they were given comforts calculated to create contentment and cure their disease. The fact that advanced cases, and cases in the first and second ""stages, are mixed indiscriminately, is not calculated to. create that spirit of cheerfulness which is one of the principal factors in curing this dire disease. I urge the Treasurer to investigate these charges promptly. I am informed that if patients leave the hospital because of what they regard as unsuitable treatment, they are not then eligible for the special rate of pension. In one case that I particularly have in mind, the mother of the patient bought a cow and gave I do' net every consideration to her son's dietary and treatment, and a private doctor expressed the opinion that he would be much better treated at home.

153,Mr Coleman (Reid) [4.0],"A fewhome, however, he will, I understand, be debarred from receiving the special rato of pension. surer) [4.71 I am very much surprised at. thc statements ot' thc honourable member for Eeid( Mr Ooloman), and I should like to ask liim whether he can personally vourh for their accuracy. I should like to know whether he discussed them with the. Minister for Repatriation before bringing them under the notice of the House. I was in charge of the Repatriation Department for nearly two years, aud eight or nine months ago I paid a special visit to the Turrainurra Homo. At that time the conditions in the institution were very good. What the conditions are now it is impossible for me to say. Considering that it is imperative that sufferers from tuberculosis should in their own interests remain i i i homes, for only by that means can the disease be permanently arrested, honourable members would be wise, before publicly making statements like these, to investigate them and test their accuracy. The publication of grievances which have no foundation in fact can only breed unrest iu the minds of the patients. As the honourable member has voiced these complaints, I shall he pleased to bring them under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation as soon as he is well enough, and when they have been inquired into a definite reply will be given to' the honourable membei"". Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.8 p.m.",43,Adjournment Conditions At Tubkamukra Hospital
