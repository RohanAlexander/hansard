A member may have something to say in regard to the recommendation of an appropriation for Supply, or he may have something to say about the other message, yet he may not wish to discuss, both messages. I object to this bunching together of separate messages.

I enter my protest against the course which is being pursued. merely as a matter of form. each message was read, should have moved that it be referred to the Committee of Supply. Had he done that, probably one message would' have been dealt with immediately, and perhaps only two or three words said regarding the other. The right honourable gentleman has not told us why the Government desire Supply at this time of the year, when it is in no need of it . The Appropriation Act and the Appropriation Works and Buildings Act provide for the ordinary services of the current financial year and for the construction of additions, new works, buildings, tas., and the Treasurer will have no need for Supply until the second week in July. Some Bpecial inducement must have been offered to the Governor General to obtain his recommendation of the proposed appropriations, and the House has a right to know from the Treasurer just what the proposal is. member who, more than another, usually clear, it is the Treasurer, and I am surprised that at this juncture he should Mr Speaker intends to rule.

12,Mr Mcdonald,"I do not know howthat it has been taken quite a number of times. Sir member, when Speaker, allowed it , I think. but I have known messages to come from the Governor General to which his signature has not been attached, and whioh thereforo have not been read to the House. I suppose that the messages which have just been read are in order. I have known, too, messages to come from the Governor General dated as if signed on the day on which they were received here in Melbourne, although the Governor General himself was at tlie time nearly 600 miles away, in Sydney. Facts like these show how necessary it is to have the fullest discussion, so that we may Be informed of the reasons for the messages which have been read. The Treasurer has not spent within 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, of tlie votes authorized by the Appropriation Works and Buildings Act for the current financial year. do with it? The votes lapse at the end of the year. lapse. This helps the Treasurer to inflate his Budget by the starving of the Departments, which is what we should guard against. are public works urgently needing attention, on which the Government has not spent a threepence, although money was voted for them months ago. has been spent during the current financial year than was spent in the financial year preceding it . expenditure sanctioned by us last year, in connection with the Works and Buildings Estimates, has been carried out by the Government; or, at all events, if there has been any considerable expenditure, it has not taken place in constituencies represented by the members of the Labour party. The Government, apparently, are anxious to make the people believe that the deficit on the year's undertakings will be less than it would have been if they had not been in power. statement from the Treasurer, since the lowed in this case is in accordance with financial year will probably not have the custom of the House. ended when Parliament is dissolved. The Government, therefore, will be able Sir to go to the country and make all sorts of statements regarding the finances of JOHN FORREST -The honourable the year without fear of contradiction. We shall not be in possession of the information necessary to enable us to refute their allegations. They hold the key to the financial situation. The Treasurer should be candid enough, therefore, to tell us now what proportion of the Works and Buildings Estimates remains unexpended. We want to know why certain works for which provision was made in those Estimates have not been carried out. We desire, also, to know when the general election is to take place, and upon what roll it is to be conducted. I appeal to the Treasurer to tell us what reasons he assigned for asking the Governor General to send down these messages to enable us to appropriate certain sums of money. I do not know whether His Excellency is, in this respect, like a former Governor General, but I trust that he first looked, as he should do, through the proposals submitted to him. Honourable members desire to know what information the Government gave the Governor General when they asked for these messages. 1 regret that the Treasurer should have seen fit to propose that the two messages should be discussed practically at the one time. There must be a separate Throughout the country there Bill and a separate Resolution in' respect of each of them. A t a later stage on the motion that you, sir, do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply, we shall be able to deal with grievances, and I propose then to give expression to my feelings regarding the way in which public works have been starved by the present Administration. Even during the drought, in the early years of Federation, when we were suffering from great depression, the Departments were not starved as they are to-day. I do not know whether the Treasurer is under the influence of the Attorney-General, or the Prime Minister, but I appeal to him to deal with these two matters separately, so that we may consider them in a legitimate way. We shall have no financial honourable members that the course fol-",11,Supply Bill Suppl Y Works Tries To Be Candid Straightforward And

If the Prime Minister will give this information I sliall endeavour to meet him as far as practicable in these matters. I see no reason why the House sliould not be informed of the actual day of the election. There is no need to finesse in regard to the matter. that until I get Supply? must bo informed as to what they propose to do. They are asking for a certain amount of Supply, and they must bo,contemplating an appeal to the country within the period covered by that Supply.

The trouble is that no one will wait for any one to tell him anything. Honourable members bail us up and catechise us at any time they please, when they could get all the information they desire if they would only wait a little. My own impression is that we can get a clean roll and an election in the early part of SeptemberI think as early as the 5th September. allow between the printing of the rolls and the issue of the writs? that I could give the right honourable gentleman the exact time. To have an election on the 5th September, and allow a month afterwards for the return of the writs-it was 24 days last time-woul d mean that the dissolution should be published on the 20th July. If we have the writs issued ten days afterwards and nomination day seven or eight days after that again, and the election twenty-one days after nomination day Ave shall be brought to the oth September, but we ( shall also require nt least a month's Supply to cover the period for the return of the writs. That is why the Treasurer proposes to ask the House for three months' Supply, because if we proceed on this basis-and that is practically forthwith-w e shall need at least three months' Supply to tide us over the period covered by the elections. that AVC shall be able to get the new rolls printed in about a month's time.

Then there is thc question of the accuracy of the rolls. It seems to me that, in the circumstances, the better plan would be to make the revision of the printed rolls on supplementary rolls. These would necessarily be a little larger than in ordinary circumstances, because there will not be suflicient time to correct the principal rolls after they are published. There is, however, no reason why every name that is inadvertently put on or taken off rolls that are printed should not be accounted for on supplementary rolls. Whether names are on or off printed rolls, the matter can be put right on supplementary rolls. As to all these matters, I wish to say, right here and now, that the Government will co-operate with the Leader of the Opposition in any way he can suggest, and do anything to facilitate the election being carried out without a tittle of advantage to either side. ing the police to deliver claim cards?",14,Dissolution Of Parliament

CASE OP MR . S. SMITH. Colonel RYRIE asked t h e M in is t e r of H o m e A f f a i r s , u p o n noticeWith reference to the letter dated 12th May, written by the Resident Engineer, Jervis Bay, to S. Smith, an applicant for employment1. Why was the applicant asked for the name of bis union? 2. Was Smith's application subsequently refused ? 3. If so, why? 4. Isi t correct, as stated by the honourable member for West Sydney, that the late Grovernment never asked the name of an applicant's union ? 5. Isi t correct, as suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney, that every applicant for employment is now asked the name of his union? . 6. Was another painter, of whose name the Minister was made aware by the honourable member for West Sydney on 28th ult., subsequently employed? honourable member's questions are as f o l low1. Smith was asked for the name of his union, because in his letter to the Resident Engineer, while stating that be was a unionist, he did not state to which of the two unions he belonged. There nre two painters' unions in Sydney. I am informed that there is a federated body registered throughout Australia under the name of the Federated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees of Australasia. then registered under the State Act in the name of the Amalgamated House and Fhip Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees Association of New South Wales. The federated body then formed another branch in New South Wales, which, [ understand, has not yet obtained registration. 2. Yes. -3. Because, in the opinion of the Resident Engineer, his statement of experience was not The answers satisfactory. The reply sent to Smith was on a stereotyped form to the effect that there were no vacancies at present. '4. Under the late Government the Works Branch was instructed to write to or inquire df the Secretary of any Trade Unioni f any men were required, or if men applied at tbe office they were asked whether tbey belonged to a union. 5. No, it is not correct. The Government has no objection to its employees belonging to unions, and throws absolutely no bar in the way of the employment of unionists. The principle of every artisan having an equal opportunity for Government employment is the only innovation it has introduced. An instance of this is the case of the employment of Painter C. York at Jervis Bay mentioned below. 6. The painter in question-C . York-applied for work on 21st April, 1914, nineteen days before S. Smith applied, and, as his statement of experience was satisfactory, he was employed. When applying he did not state the Resident Engineer did not ask him before employment whether he was a unionist. Painter York took up work, and has continued to work to date. He was not asked whether he belonged to a union until the matter was referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney. It has now been ascertained that York has been a unionist for 15 years. address a question to t h e P r i m e M in is ter. Leaveg r a n t e d .

I pointed out that in consequence the Parliament was unworkable, that it was impossible to manage efficiently the public business, and that, in my opinion, a dissolution of both Houses should be granted. His Excellency's reply was to accede to my re; quest, and to grant an immediate simultaneous dissolution, on. condition that a definite assurance was given that the financial position was such that adequate provision could be made for carrying on the Public Service during the period of time covered by the elections. In reply to that, I reminded His Excellency that adequate provision existed for Supply to the 30th June, and that I proposed, with His Excellency's peimission, to inform Parliament of His Excellency's decision, and to at once ask Parliament to make provision for Supply to cover the election.

The House may take my assurance tliat it is now in full possession, in every particular, of the decision of His Excellency. No material fact, and no material word, have been omitted from my statement. I make that assertion solemnly to the House. -The Prime Minister has given what he assures us is au exact statement of what has taken place between him and His Excellency the Governor General; but we have not heard any of the reasons which must have been supplied to the Governor General to induce him to take the gravest step yet taken in the history of the Commonwealth. Surelyi t is not too much to ask for the memorandum which, we understand, was sent to His Excellency, setting forth the constitutional and other grounds for a dissolution of the two Houses. The Prime Minister says that his relations with the Governor General are confidential. It is no doubt proper and necessary that these sliould be confidential ; but this is a matter which touches His Excellency Parliament vitally. Parliament has rights, and is surely entitled to the fullest information concerning the reasons which induced the Governor General to grant a double dissolution. Before the Governor General agreed to do this, ho must have required something more than the mere assurance of the Prime Minister that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution had been fulfilled. The Prime Minister's statement on this particular point is meagre to the point of vacuity. A ll he tells us is that he advised His Excellency, in accordance with the provisions of section 57, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate ancl the House of Bepresentatives, and that he assured His Excellency that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. But surely this is not all! No Governor General will assent to any Bill until he has received a certificate signed by the Attorney-General that it has been passed by both Houses, and that there are no reasons why he should not assent thereto. Are we to assume that the Governor General was satisfied, without some definite legal assurance to that effect, that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution, so far as the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was concerned, wore fulfilled. Being a layman, he must have had recourse to legal advice, and to whom would he go for it but to the Attorney-General? Surely a bare statement by the Prime Minister that the conditions of section 57 had been complied with would not suffice to satisfy His Excellency, without precedent, legal training, or even knowledge of the facts to guide him? The Prime Minister says that he does not propose to furnish to the House a copy of the memorandum suggesting reasons why the Governor General should dissolve Parliament. He says these should be regarded as confidential. Let me remind him that it has been the practice to publish memoranda of this kind. In the Votes and Proceedings of tlic Yictorian Legislative Assembly are to be found various memoranda submitted to Governors, givingreasonsfor the dissolution",23,Supply Dissolution

163,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [8.7].,"-of the State Parliament. Keith, in Responsible Government' in the Dominions, gives many such cases. Not only has the head of a Government supplied Parliament with the reasons which he furbished to a Governor for a course that he desired to be taken, but Governors have been called upon to furnish, and have furnished, memoranda of the kind. I am unable, on the spur of the moment, to quote particular cases; but every one knows the outcry in the press of Australia, so recently as tlie other day, when, the Governor of Tasmania having refused .a dissolution to Mr Solomon, and having then granted it to Mr Earle, the correspondence between him and Mr Solomon was not forthcoming, having been destroyed, or, at any rate, not being .on the, file. It is surely suggestive as. showing how widely the attitude of the press in that case differs from its present attitude. In any case, the question of whether or not the publication of such correspondence is sanctioned by precedent is not yery much to the point. It is not so much whether it has been done as whether it ought to be done. The dissolution of the Senate is itself without precedent. For -we have to remember that the Senate is an integral part of the Constitution. It has rights co-ordinate with those of this branch of the Legislature'. It acted strictly in accordance with those rights, and for doing so it is to be dissolved. We want to know why. We have a right to know. The Treasurer has furnished the House and the country with admirable reasons why that course should not have been pursued. Had he, instead of the honourable member for Parramatta, been at the head of the Government, the Senate would not have been dissolved. the right honourable member's excellent reasons', but some of my honourable friends will put them before the House. drafted to meet a real dead-lock on national questions. I call attention to the fact that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was introduced with the deliberate purpose of creating a deadlock. The Bill does not deal with a vital question, it deals with a dead one. The thing it proposes to do has been already done. Yet the Senate has been dis 7 solved. It is most material, therefore, that we should have the recital of the facts put before the Governor General in order that we may know whether His Excellency was correctly informed as to what the facts were. I am perfectly persuaded that on an imj>artial review of section 57 no Court would say that the Senate ought to be dissolved in such circumstances. Let me put this to the Attorney-General: Supposing he had to argue before a Court-if such a thing were possible-whethe r the action of the Governor General was or was not constitutional, would he, for one moment, expect the Court to believe that, uuder section 57, the Senate, which was created as the foundation of the Federal system, must be dissolved because it had thrown out a petty measure that it was invited to throw out? No Court would so hold. It is, consequently, most material that we should know the terms of the memorandum to the Governor General in order that we and the country may learn whether His Excellency has been correctly advised in this matter. In the very nature of things, His Excellency could not be familiar with the facts, except upon information given to him by his Advisers. He had not the advantage of being a resident here for any length of time, and of knowing the facts first hand. He had to take everything as it was stated to him. It is clear that when it is to the advantage of a party that the Senate shall be dissolved, and when it is the avowed intention of that party to create a dead-lock which will technically satisfy section 57, the reasons, which that party furnished to His Excellency in support of the request for a double dissolution should be available to the Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister will furnish us with those reasons. If he declines to do so, we must assume that they will not bear public examination. If they were sound, if they will bear examination, why should he hesitate to lay them on the table, and to let us see what they are? The provisions of section 57 have been abused in order that party interests may be served. The scope of section 57 is qualified by other sections of the Constitution. The Constitution as a whole must be looked at. The section cannot be taken as standing by itself. It has-",24,Supply Dissolution

It has reference to a real dead-lock-a n actual stoppage of public business. Buti u this case there is no dead-lock, no stoppage. On tlie contrary, indeed; for no sooner had the Government Preference Prohibition B ill been rejected than proposed legislation was showered on .'the table. fewer than five Bills, I think, were introduced jection of this measure by the Senate a second time. be a dead-lock when it was proposed to go on with all this legislation?

And how could the Governor General-, if he was supplied with a f u l l and detailed statement of the facts,, say that a dead-lock within the meaning of section 57 had been reached ? In these circumstances, it is obvious that this Parliament has a right to see the reasons submitted to His Excellency. We shall want something more than a mere capitulation about the practice being to treat all communications with His Excellency as confidential, or ""any other mediaeval doctrine, to satisfy us. reasons themselves. Gbvernment will supply us with those reasons. General will enable us to understand the extent to which his advice was sought, and the nature of that advice. These things are very material. We must suppose, in view of the difficulty that a layman feels in the face of section 57, that neither the Governor General nor the Prime Minister was capable of giving a satisfactory interpretation to it , and I hesitate to believe that the Governor General would have acted if it had not been upon the advice and the assurance, in writing, of the Attorney-General himself. MrW . H . IRVINE (Flinders-At torney-General) [8.24] -The honourable member for West Sydney has put forward what I believe to be an entirely new view It has reference not to a deadof the relation of Cabinet Ministers to the Governor General. He has stated the proposition that upon the demand, of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Ministers, who, on taking office, enter into relations of the most absolute confidence, and subscribe to the oath ofsecrecy' as to every communication that is made, are bound to tell the House the substance and the exact details of the advice which they have tendered to. tlie Governor General. That is a position which has never been put forward in any repreNo sentative House in the British Dominions. dissolution before. How could there "" MrW . H . IRVINE No ; and probably the honourable member does not want one now. The honourable member for West Sydney has also said-and it seems to me to be a very remarkable position for a lawyer, and especially for one who has occupied the position of Attorney-Generali n a Federal Government to take up-that there must have been a certificate by the Attorney-General upon which the Governor General acted.' The honourable gentleman has probably in mind the fact that before any B ill which passes this Parliament receives the Royal assent, through the Governor General, His Excellency must receive a certificate from the Attorney-General. MrW . H . IRVINE E v e r y one knows that. But what has it to do with the exercise of the Governor General's discretion in granting or refusing a double We want to see the dissolution?

The latest criticism of this kind is a statement by the honourable member for West Sydney, which appeared in the press yesterday, and which, I take it , was communicated by the honourable member himself. It is not the report of a speech, but a deliberate, carefully prepared statement by the honourable member as to the position of the Governor General, and of the Government, when dealing with questions arising under section 57 of the Constitution.

175,Mr Aethuk,"I s that the gist of hisby the Constitution to do the very thing it did do. . . . Tbe question is: Was tbe Senate, under the Constitution, within its rights in rejecting this measure? A little lower down he refers to a supposed analogy, on which he presumes that advice was tendered to H is Excellency, between the powers and basis of the House of Lords and the Senate. the second one? In the first he argued the other way. MrW . H . IRVINE I have read only the one. The honourable member for West Sydney went on to point outThis point needs special emphasis. There seems to be good reason for the opinion that in the present case this fact has been ignored, or has been ingeniously glozed over by the legal advisers to the Crown. What right had the honourable member to say that? He knew nothing. He did not know whether the legal adviser of the Government had given any advice to the Governor-GeneralA supposed analogy between the powers and basis of the House of Lords and the Senate, and of those reasons which afford sufficient grounds for granting a single dissolution, have apparently been considered sufficient, but the rights and liabilities of the Senate are determined, not by the traditional ,relationship between the Commons and Lords of Great Britain, nor by expediency, but by the terms of a written document. The honourable member's argument is that it is entirely false and wrong to suppose the same principles to apply in the granting of a double dissolution under this section as had been applied in connection with a dissolution of the House of Commons. than the 17th A p r i l , 1914, the same honourable member, speaking on the Addressin-Reply, said thisSection 57 was passed to deal with deadlocks legitimately arising on great questions between the Houses. As to the position of the Governor General in this regard, my contention is that, as to a double dissolution, the Governor General will be guided by exactly the same reasons as in an ordinary dissolution in the Lower House. The honourable member had forgotten his own argument when he rushed into print with an entirely new one. ter he went on to sayAnd this must be interpreted according to its spirit, and always with the presumption that, as the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor General under section 57 must be resolved in favour of that presumption, and so against a dissolution of the Senate. As to the question of expediency, the same may be said. What does that mean? I w ill read it again, and show how I read it , and I challenge the honourable member to say whether his argument can bear any other construction. And thisreferring to the written document or Constitutionmust be interpreted according to its spirit, I do not know. and always with the presumptionWhat presumption? that as tbe Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor General under section 57 must be resolve.1 in favour of that presumptionthe presumption that the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senateand so against a dissolution of the Senate. That entirely confirms the view which the honourable member put forward before, that so long as the Senate is acting within its constitutional rights, there can be no double dissolution. circumstances there can be no double dissolution. MrW . H . IRVINE The honourable member says that whenever the Senate is exercising its constitutional rights there can be no double dissolution. I am not going to take up time with this matter, nor am I going into the so-called merits which occupy the last portion of the honourable member's argument. But in one place he saysiB u t I find that no longer ago The discretion of the King's representative as to tbe dissolution of the lower House is unfettered. Tbe Constitution does not bind bim in any way. He may accept or reject any advice without other consideration than the public welfare and traditional practice. But with a double dissolution the position is quite different. The honourable member said less than a month ago that the position is exactly the same in the case of a double dissolution as in the case of single dissolution. His argument now is that, although the Governor General has discretion to act in In the latdependently of the advice of his Ministers in granting a single dissolution, in the case of a double dissolution the case is quite different, and he is bound to act on the advice of his Ministers. of the sort.",27,Supply Dissolution

Then he saysBut with a double dissolution the position is quite different. What conclusions are we to draw from that? with a double dissolution the Governor General must first be satisfied that the conditions of section 57 have been complied with. Mr W. H .

For unless that be so, the question of whether it is expedient-expedient , I mean, in tbe interests of the people, not in the interests of partyto dissolve does not arise. That is the position of the Governor General' under the Constitution.

But the Governor General must look to the Attorney-Generalf o r advice. Look at section '58 of the Constitution. Mr W. H . IRVINE member says he has been told this, and other honourable members say they have been led to believe that, but the real fact is that honourable members on the other side have been so long fed by their legal advisers with a kind of constitutional soothing syrup that when they suddenly awaken from their slumber, and find this horrible thing facing them, they are not quite masters of their intelligence. The honourable member for West Sydney has invited my attention to section 58 of the Constitution, which saysWhen a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the GoW h a t the honvernor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents'in the Queen's name or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure.

An essential part of the policy of the Government was to put an end to that system of spoils to the victors which his Government initiated. If we had not, as one of our very first acts registered, as far as we were capable, in this House, placed it beyond the power of any Government to do that again, we would have been guilty of an absolute betrayal of the trust we were given. If there is one man in the House who ought to be the last to talk about spoils to the victors it is the honourable member. Does the honourable member talk of spoils to the victors in connection with the retainer he now holds? Does he tell the country that, while the Commonwealth is in conflict with a company that may cost us tens of thousands of pounds, he is receiving his salary as Attorney-General, and yet is so tied, because he is in the hands of this company, that he dare not give the Government advice in regard to the matter? Yet we have the honourable member coming down here talking about spoils to the victors.

Not only have I seen hundreds of justices of the peace created for political purposes, but I have also known all these positions given to political supporters time after time.

It is a common thing for such matters to be published from time to time, yet the Attorney-General tells us that it is a sacred thing that ought not to be touched, and that the advice given by the Attorney-General should not be made known. Had we any such thing. This is all imagination. General said that these matters should not be made public, and that they were sacred, and that he would not make them public.

While they are considering the measure a pistol will be held at their head. Is that the sort of Constitution we want to create in this country? Is that what we desire?-that the Upper House sbould be coerced at the beginning-that it should be told, "" If you do not pass this measure in the way that we have passed it, you will be dissolved.""

It w ill be seen that Sir Edmund Barton took the point that there is no dead-lock unti l the whole machinery of government has been stopped, and that this can be brought about only by the stoppage of Supply-the very view to which the A t torney-General to-night took such strong exception. I do not attempt to question the legal knowledge of the Attorney General, but I refer him to the words of Sir Edmund Barton. The present situation has been brought about by means of a measure of no importance, whether it be passed or rejected, because the Government have already declared that there shall be no preference to unionists. No one accused honourable members opposite of favoring preference to unionists. What, then, was the need for an Act of Parliament to prohibit it? Wasi t necessary to assure the country of the views of the Liberal party on the subject? Wasi t thought that the people did not believe Liberal members wben they said that they did not favour preference? Or did honourable members desire to advertise themselves, and to pass the measure as a monument to their wonderful intelligence? McMillan said, speaking at the ConventionI do say that if you create any machinery which, under tbe guise of settling dead-locks, will really be used to create dead-locks, you will strike a blow absolutely at thc power and dignity of the Senate. Sir George Turner also expressed himself in this wayI am quite in accord with those who say that we are not to allow one House to dominate the other unless we know that particular House has the people at its back, and that in endeavouring to force certain views upon the other Chamber, that House is simply carrying out what is really the will and desire of the people of the Federation. Sir Josiah Symon, referring to the double dissolution, saidIf it exercises that function, you are to give bring Federal politics into the political it credit for honesty and bona, fides. If it is still out of harmony with the Lower House, let the Lower House go to their constituents with whom the Upper House says the House of Kepresentatives was not in harmony. If the members of the House of Bepresentatives come back from their constituents with the mandate for that particular piece of legislation, this Senate, like every otber Second Chamber, will be bound to give"" way. If the Senate does not give way, then I say, at once and unmade before the Constitution was framed, and therefore do not apply. statements of men who assisted to frame the Constitution, and express their views of the mauner in which section 57 should be interpreted. They were averse from its use by a Government to gain a mere party advantage, as in the present case. The only legitimate and honest course for this Government to follow was to ask for the dissolution of this Housei n order to obtain from the country a mandate as to whether certain legislation should pass. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -Would that have been effective w i th the Senate? MrM c DONALD The mandate of the people would have been recognised. In Victoria, a measure dealing with the franchise was rejected by the Upper House nearly a dozen times, and the legislation of the Lower Houses has been similarly treated by Upper Houses in all the States. But do we hear the Liberals advocate the dissolution of the Legislative Councils of the Parliaments of the States? No . Liberals do not do that, because these Councils are composed of men of their This is what SirW ill i a m own way of thinking politically; of representatives of vested interests. Their members are the landed proprietors, and big capitalists, against whom the members of the Liberal party have not the courage to say a word, because it is they who support the party, and give to its members their political significance. But while Liberals are not prepared to attack the Legislative Councilsf o r opposing the w i ll of the Lower Houses of the State Parliaments, they are very ready to attack the Senate for opposing the will of this House. That is because the Senate represents the working classes of Australia. The one desire of honourable members opposite is to strengthen their party by hook or by crook. I do not find f a u l t with them for that, but they had no right to drag in the Governor General, and to mire by violating every constitutional principle and right. The Prime Minister told us on Friday last that the Governor-",33,Supply Dissolution

MrM c DONALD we known the conditions it is probable that certain statements which had been made concerning the Governor General would not have been made.

The Premier then asked for Supply, but the Opposition refused to give it . Then what was done ? The Government induced the Governor of Queensland to sign an Executive minute granting them a large sum of money to enable them to carry on over the elections. Having done that, their first act was to create 300 odd justices of the peace to go round the country and canvass votes for them. But in spite of the struggle which they made to uphold the action of the Governor, the people ""turned them down by an overwhelming majority, and with the advent of the Kidston Government to power we witnessed the humiliating spectacle of their predecessors having to ask for an Indemnity B ill to cover their i l correspondence? legal acts. of the difficulty. MrM c DONALD I s that the proposal of the honourable member for Werriwa?

DoI understand the honourable member to in fer that the Governor General will grant a double dissolution even if Supply be not granted ? the kind. able member mean then ? MrM c DONALD If the honourable member did not mean that when he suggested that there was a way out of the difficulty, what did he mean ? Let me tell him that if the Governor General attempted anything of that character, he would be the sorriest man in Australia. member not to drag the name of the Governor General into this debate, in such a way, and especially to refrain from making statements that imply, if , indeed, they are not actual, threats.

MrM c DONALD I do not hesitate to say that to save the whole situation which has been created, and to stop the statements which otherwise will be made A from the public platforms of this country, the first thing which the Governmenb should do is to bring down the exact document which was presented to the Governor General, so that we may know exactly where we stand. Such a step would clear the political atmosphere very materially. We would then know the position that we occupy, the position occupied by the Senate, and also by the country. Until that has been done, there is bound to remain a certain amount of suspicion. I wish to know whether the Attorney General prepared a document setting out the reasons why a double dissolution should be granted, and sent it on to the Governor General. The Prime Minister in his statement admitted that there was other correspondence which he does not feel it would be proper for him to disclose.

Now that that prediction has been fulfilled, the members of another place seem to be quite unaware of the discussions which took place in the Federal Convention at the time section 57 of our Constitution was being framed.

Buti t is a position that cannot and will not be ignored. It calls for action, and that immediately. shortly. The idea that the Parliament can go on with the threat of a double dissolution hanging perpetually over its head is unthinkable. It is also absurd. Section 57 provides a solution for dead-locks. the section is that the legislative machine having been brought to a standstill by disagreement between the two Houses upon some matter of such grave importance as to make further progress impossible, a double dissolution may, if His Excellency pleases, be granted. The essence of the whole tiling is that, legisbe brought forward ; but I went much lation being impossible, an appeal to the electors must follow. He then went on to say that, if Mr Cook liked to delay, the position would be entirely changed, and addedThe provisions of section 57 having been technically satisfied-( 1 do not even admit this)-the Government may ask for a double dissolution. True, they may ask; but only if they do so at once. Did uot the Government do so at once ? Are they not accused now of doing it at once? And on this point there can bo no doubt at all. The situation having been created, it must be nt once resolved one way or another. Inaction is fatal in the matter. I quite agree witn the honourable memberBut in the meantime the right to ask for a double dissolution on the first test Bill is Mr Conroy. I do not wish to lost. And such a position is in accord with common sense. Time is the essence of the contract. Eveni f Parliament would allow Mr Cook to hold this threat over its head indefinitely, the section would not allow it. And here are very important words, utI n fact, tered after careful consideration by an honourable member who has just given us The Attorney-General a dissertation the other wayTherefore, either Mr Cook must summon up enough courage to ask for a double AbIf solution at once, or must for ever hold his peace. That statement by the honourable member was a complete answer to his letter of the following day. He has refuted his argument out of his own mouth. When honourable members opposite cheered the He did not other day on hearing that a double dissolution had been granted, it appears now it was only a sham cheer-anothe r instance of bluff. I did not want to hear it , and I confess that I did not cheer. When they cheered I really began to wonder how many sensible men there were in the House except myself. If a body of men are in such a state of mental confusion that they do not even know the plain words of the Constitution, Let me state the position and act in such a manner as to force a double dissolution, it does not lie in the mouths of members on the other side, or in another place, to complain of it when they get it . They asked for it , and now they are howling because they have got The principle underlying it. They do not like the taste of it . in. I admit that I was one of those who suggested that some such proposal should further. I suggested that the test should be not only as to preference in the Government service, but as to preference anywhere-in the Courts or otherwise. I hold that no Parliament has the right, under laws, to grant preference to any citizen, but that every citizen ought to be able to go before the H i g h Court of justice of his country, as Parliament should be, and get a f a i r field and no favour. That principle is being entirely departed from . The provision I sugHe went on to saygested ran as follows:Notwithstanding anything contained in the Arbitration Act, no Court or Judge shall grant preference to any citizen or class of citizens.

It was brought forward again this session, passed by this House, and again sent up to another place, where it was rejected without a moment's consideration. It was treated in the way in which we were told Labour senators would treat all legislation brought forward by the Liberal party. In the circumstances, what other course was open to our party but to ask for a double dissolution ? Every requirement of section 57 of the Constitution had been complied with. the honourable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the Labour Government-a n opinion given as late as Priday last-that everything had been done to create the required situation under section 57. how the honourable member was able tonight to go back upon that expression of opinion, unless it was that he thought thab the public would remember only the last and not the first statement made by him on the question, or that they would not imagine that any public man would be so lost to what was due to himself as They to say one thing one day and something quite different a day or two later. He also thought, perhaps, that the speech whicli he delivered to-night would be published in Hansard, and read by thousands who would not see his first statement as published in the Melbourne newspapers. was published in the Sydney press. surprised at the audacity of the honorHonorable members on the able member for West Sydney. He would seem to be more indifferent as to what he says than I at first imagined him to be. The honourable member for Kennedy, another member of the Labour party, has pointed out that this situation was foreseen years ago. Surely, in the circumstances, everything has been done to justify the granting of a double dissolution. Let us test the situation by changing the position of parties. If there the Labour party had a majority of one in this House, does any one imagine for a moment that in the event'of the Senate twice rejecting legislation passed by this House, and the right honourable member for Wide Bay advising the Governor General to grant a double dissolution, his advice would not be followed. There is no doubt about the matter. The position of the Prime Minister for the time being, no doubt, is made all-powerful, but I have not heard of any case in which advice tendered to the Governor General by the late Ministry was rejected. They cannot quote an instance. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Kennedy, who has occupied the position of Speaker, advocating the publication of all documents. He would not do that as between members of a Cabinet. that is no reason why every one should do so. that is no reason why we should all do so. I cannot understand orable member that some men do. That is why we get so tired of him. NoM in ister would dream of publishing correspondence as between himself and the rest of the Cabinet without the consent of every member of that Cabinet.

If the honourable member had his way, he would destroy, not only the country, but the towns w it h it , because he has not grasped the fact that the towns depend for their prosperity on the country. deal w it h that matter to-night. again express the hope that honourable members wil l show a return to sound common sense, and if . they think they have got their gruel, let them swallow it without making a wry face. adjourned. following message from the SenateThe Senate requests that the House of Representatives will give leave to the Honourable William Henry Kelly to attend and be examined by the Select Committee of the Senate on Mr Teesdale Smith's contract-Kalgoorli e to Port Augusta Bailway.
