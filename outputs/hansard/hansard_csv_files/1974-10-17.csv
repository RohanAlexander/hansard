The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be burdened with addidonal psychological strains because of inabihty to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most nnancial benefit from our society should give the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Austrahan will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of thenby Mr Kevin Cairns. choice-The care of the ill and the prevention of disease.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child Endowment received by families has declined relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission into poverty recommended a substanual increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This repon pointed om that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from 50 cents to $ 1.50 for the first child; from SI.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the founh child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children.

And your petiuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petition received.

6,By Mr Mckenzie.,"That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already overcrowded and under-staffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian Government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important nnancial contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your pedtioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973/1974 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Mathews. Petition received.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray and strongly urge that you will resist its becoming a law of Australia by opposimately 4 or 5 weeks. I cannot mention precisely ing it in Parliament. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received.

There are showeth: That the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology dealt with outside the country and at my level. I which has catered for tertiary needs of Melbourne for should add that Mr Menzies, as he then was, and nearly 100 years is still without any location where Mr Holt were away for just as many days as I students can gather in a social context That a properly constituted meeting of students supported the policy of the elected Students' Representative after they became Prime Ministers. Coundl that Union Facilities should be the First priority of the Institute. That the S.R.C formulated a Definitive Plan that is an acceptable constructive and reasonable amendment to the present planning schedule at the Institute. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House ask the Australian Commission on Advanced Education to consider in their 1976-78 Triennium Report on allocation of funds to ensure the provision of Union Facilities at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Oldmeadow. Petition received. to undertake a visit to Europe of approximately 6 weeks begmning in December and including such countries as Russia, West Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom? Is the Prime Mimster aware that the Australian public believes that the problems of inflation and unemployment are sufficiently serious to demand the full time attention of the Prime Minister and his senior Ministers? Will he, therefore, instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs to undertake the European visit in his place or, at least, to undertake some proportion of the trip on his behalf? I might say by way of final comment that, of course, I do not question the right of, and need for, an Australian Prime Minister to travel abroad for purposes of consultation, but I do question it at this time. at this time or in this place the countries that I shall be visiting but among them clearly will be the Soviet Union which for some time has been pressing for a visit, particularly since I have already visited the United States of America, Japan, China and Britain.

For that purpose we believe that the various sectors of the petroleum industry-the major oil companies and the trade unions associated with marine and land transport-shoul d be brought together so that we can get a co-ordination of effort, and goodwill and understanding. Australia's fuel demand is supplied essentially by local industry. There is a very small margin; there would not be more at any time than 14 days supply of petrol and the various distillates which are required. A further distorting factor is that the major oil refineries are located in Victoria and the major consumption is in New South Wales. Further problems arise from the fact that particular refineries are structured to deal with particular types of crude. So, industrial trouble, the shortage of tankers or even other matters such as bad weather can have a very serious and quick impact. There is a need for a greater storage capacity. There is a need for a better transport system. In particular, there is an urgent need for a greater number of rail transport cars for this purpose. In addition to that, there is a need for more careful co-ordination. Let me deal with the attitude of particular compames. I might cite here the example of the Transport Commission of New South terms of the product-swap arrangement. This is a matter which transcends matters of mere political advantage. It is essential that we should secure the fullest co-operation of all sectors of industry associated with the gathering of the crop and soil cultivation. We will take the same energetic steps to ensure that the situation is adequately covered as we did in December of last year and January of this year when we were able to solve the bunkering fuel shortage. Our action then enabled us tp export successfully the Australian wheat crop. tion. I hope he will recognise it has the refreshing novelty of being non-political. My question concerns retailers' mark-ups. It has particular reference to the reported profit of the Myer emporiifm, which exceeded $27m. I would like the Prime Minister to reaffirm that the activities of retail mark-ups do come within the scope of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Joint Parliamentary Committe on Prices. IfI presented evidence to the honourable gentleman that the company that I have mentioned bought a large quantity of cheese cloth blouses from India at $1.62 each and sold them over the counter for up to $8 each, would he have inquiries made to establish that this is a king sized rip off which benefits neither the Indian worker nor the Australian consumer? Would he agree that action such as this negates the intention of both the cottage industry imports scheme and the 25 per cent cut in tariffs which the Government introduced last year, and also seriously adds to inflation. honourable gentleman has on such matters I will be very happy to process insofar as it comes within my jurisdiction. Such evidence can certainly be given directly to the Prices Justification Tribunal and would be relevant to the periodic inquiries it makes into retail profits. I would think also that the evidence can be given directly to the Prices Committee of the Parliament, which has members from both sides in each House.

They have to report regularly to the Prices Justification Tribunal on their operations. I have no doubt that the Prices Justification Tribunal within the limits of the time scale in which it has to operate and the staff available to it, does its very best to check these matters. I shall be very happy to pass on any information that the honourable gentleman gives to me. the Minister for Services and Property. The Minister will recall the very difficult conditions imposed on divisional returning officers and their permanent and temporary staff at the last elections in May. Does he also recall the use of rather unsatisfactory makeshift voting booths caused by the emergency situation associated with the double dissolution? I ask the Minister if action has been taken or is likely to be taken to remedy these unsatisfactory conditions? Can he also indicate that the status and remuneration of electoral officials, permanent and temporary, have been or are likely to be increased so as to be more commensurate with their responsibilities and work load? for Barton will agree that the last election made unprecedented demands on the staff of the Australian Electoral Office. First, there was an election for the Senate and in some cases the number of candidates was a record. In addition to that there were 4 referendum questions and an election for the House of Representatives. That, unprecedented event imposed demands on the staff to which they responded remarkably well, I think. But it was inevitable that certain arrangements had to be made to meet this situation and one of them was that the Government called in a firm of consultants. In co-operation with the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr Ley, certain arrangements were made for additional booths and in the circumstances I think they worked reasonably well. I am not unmindful of the fact that the Electoral Office has been a neglected office after a long period in office ofthose who sit put a lot of technical information into a single opposite, and probably other governments for question. AllI suggest is that we thought it pruthat matter. The Electoral Office has in effect dent to announce the particular date from which been looked upon as the Cinderella department this tax will operate, that is, the valuation day. when in fact it ranks in a democracy as possibly That is the single, most essential matter to be the most important because the highest degree of determined. I issued a memorandum which integrity is required of its staff. The Office renders explained broadly enough the areas in which the to parliamt -> people services for which it gets little crt many people. I have em.c«tvoured to remedy this situation and I have supported increases in remuneration for all sections of the Australian Electoral Office. The Government is in the course of building up not only the remuneration of the staff but also improving the facilities available, the staffing of the office and all that goes with it. Recently W. D. Scott and Co., afirmof consultants, was commissioned to investigate and bring back a speedy report on all facilities and conditions associated with the Electoral Office. It has visited all parts of Australia and asked for submissions from the leaders of all political parties in this Parliament. I am hopeful that individual members of the Parliament and the Opposition parties generally will co-operate with the company. I think that we will not only improve the status and efficiency of the organisation but also in every other respect there wul be an improvement all round of benefit to the public and members of the Parliament. I am hopeful of that co-operation being given. I am also hopeful that out of this will come a more efficient system, more happy staffing arrangements and in every way an uplifting of the status and efficiency generally of the Australian Electoral Office. addressed to the Treasurer, deals with the Treasurer's Budget announcement and explanatory paper on the capital gains tax, and the fact that it will operate from valuation day, 17 September. Is it reasonable for the Treasurer to announce such a tax which is already operative before many very vital details in relation to it have been announced or even worked out? Is it a fact that as yet no decision has been made about disposal of depreciated assets and about assets under section 75 and section 76 of the Income Tax Assessment Act? Is it also a fact that it has not yet been decided whether provisional tax will apply to capital gains? When will those details be announced? When wul we know the answers?

45,Mr Dalyi Think That The Suggestion Of The,"still functions under almost the same conditions as it did when the membership of the House was about 75 members. The membership has almost doubled and the procedures have become somewhat complicated. I would like to advise the honourable member, though, that a major review of the procedures of the House was undertaken in the early 1960s and that this culminated in extended alterations of the Standing Orders effective as from 1963. A joint committee has recently been established to inquire into, report and make recommendations for a balanced system of committees for the Parliament and its integration into the procedures of the Parliament. I might suggest that that committee could well give consideration to the factors that the honourable member has mentioned. I think that the proposal that the committee should take the suggestions outlined in the honourable member's question within the scope of its activities is one which would be worthy of consideration. If his suggestions were submitted to that committee I have no doubt that in the course of deciding how the committee system should work, the question of the proceedings of this Parliament must inevitably be covered. I therefore naturally support the suggestion of an inquiry. I would suggest to the honourable member that he might take into consideration what I have suggested and refer this matter to the committee during the course of its deliberations. That action may bring about the desired results. Minister for Science. Does the Minister agree that weather forecasts broadcast from radio stations and those issued for aircraft and marine operations play a most valuable role in preserving life and property in times of natural disaster and in the safety of the day to day air and sea operations over and around Australia? If so, why has it been decided to cut down the number of daily weather forecasts? Has he consulted with his colleague the Minister for Transport on the safety aspects of this decision? How much does the Minister intend charging radio stations for the privilege of broadcasting weather forecasts? Will the Australian Broadcasting Commission be charged the same amount? cutting down on weather forecasting or the broadcasting of forecasts. The intention is to rationalise present programs. There is no question of charging broadcasting companies for the have previously asked Ministers to be reasonably material they use. If the honourable member has any particular questions that he wants pursued I shall be happy to oblige him. COAL MINERS to the Minister for Minerals and Energy follows on his statement to the House the day before yesterday that Australia's coal export trade is increasing rapidly. Can the Minister tell the House what steps are proposed to recruit and train coal miners who will be needed in excess of those that we now have in order to cope with the increase in the coal export trade? able member for her question. There is a very urgent need to relate an increase in the labour force in the coal industry not merely to our prospects but also to the certainty of substantial increases in the export of coal. For that purpose there are 3 alternative avenues. The first is to induce men who are trained and experienced miners to return to the industry. The second one obviously is to recruit young men to come into the industry, to upgrade it and to give them the certainty of a career. The third one, of course, in default of a sumcient number being available from either of those sources would be to recruit from overseas skilled miners from the traditional mining counties in the north of the United Kingdom. In respect of the first group, I have already approached the Miners Federation and put the position to it. I have removed for all time the fundamental fear that it has had of a redundancy oflabour. We have had information from the Japanese as to their exact requirements. We will step by step and in close co-ordination with them expand production from our existing mines and, where necessary, we will open new ones. We need to attract to the industry men who normally could be going into other trades. We need to explain to them that there are excellent opportunities in what will be the most important industry in Australia. Let me remind the House that during World WarI men who were skilled coal miners were brought back from the trenches.

72,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister forScience)-Fo r the information of honourable members. I lay upon the table the second annual report of the Department of the Media. granted to the Minister for Labour and Immigration to enable him to clarify a matter. Minister for Labour and Immigration)I thank you, Mr Speaker. In my answer to question on notice No. 363 from the Leader of the Opposition-a n answer circulated on 18 September 1974-it was stated in part (1) that in the period January to June 1974,65 persons had applied for migrant entry from Indonesia. In part 2 it was stated that 1,517 persons had been approved for migrant entry to Australia from India. I am now advised that regrettably an error occurred in the preparation of the answer to the right honourable member's question and that the figures referred to should have been 598 and 1,096 respectively. The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment: States Grants Bill 1974. Adelaide to Crystal Brook Railway Bill 1974. Tarcoola to Alice Springs Railway Bill 1974. Assent reported. move: That, in the opinion of this House, some provision should a wife by death, but still a tragedy, and in some be made for assistance to widowers and deserted husbands cases almost as severe for him. He is then faced with dependent children. We have a system of social services in Australia support it. If, as I said, he has a relative to which has been progressively improved over the housekeep for him maybe he can cope, but not years. This has gone on under governments from all have that assistance. both sides of the House. Nevertheless there are still and there always will be, I think, gaps in our system which should be filled progressively by last census some figures were taken out on familnew and improved services. While I was Minister ies where husbands did not have wives and there for Social ServicesI believe I filled some of these were dependent chUdren under 21 years of age. gaps. OthersI should like to havefilled.HonourThere were 12,000 families where there was one able members will notice that I have on the such dependent child; 7,000 families where there notice paper today 5 motions which relate to were 2 such dependent children; 3,500 families gaps in our social services structure. I have where there were 3 dependent children; 1,500 moved the first of these motions because I believe it is the most urgent. The things which I have put on the notice paper are the things which I would have recommended as Minister had I so continued. I cannot, of course, guarantee that our Government would have carried them out, but I believe it would. The next cab on the rank, and one which I would have hoped to have moved off the rank earlier, was the matter of help for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children. These are people who really deserve the sympathy of the House and of the country. I want us to consider the position of the young husband with children whose wife has suddenly died. He has lost his wife. He now may have to face up to the breakup of his family. If he remains in employment who is to look after his young children? Unless he has a fairly big salary he cannot afford a housekeeper. He may be lucky enough to have a mother or a sister who will come to his aid and housekeep for him. Some are fortunate in this regard; some are not. But young husbands whose wives have suddenly died find themselves in this appalling predicament. They have lost their wife-that is perhaps as big a tragedy as can occur to any man-and they then find the position compounded by the fact that their young children cannot be kept at home because they have not the means to do so. This is an appalling position in which no Australian should be placed. It is, I think, a shame to all of us that it has not been remedied previously. Then there is another class of people, not quite so tragic perhaps but tragic enough nevertheless. dren. I say with some regret-unfortunatel y the statistics establish this-that although the deserted husband with young children was comparatively rare a few decades ago, he is now bewife-perhap s not the same tragedy as the loss of with the same possibility that his family will be broken up because there is nofinancialmeans to What are the numbers of these people?

He suffers the loss of afamilies where there were 4 dependent children; and 1,000 families where there were S or more children thus dependent.

They deserve immediate relief. I do not say for one moment that nothing has been done by the present Government. I shall be as factual as I can about this and I hope to approach it in a non-partisan spirit because this is a proposal which, as I said, I believe we should have introduced when we were the Government. I believe we would have done it last year if we had remained in government and I believe it should be done here and now. I know that special arrangements have been done here and now. I believe that here and now made by this Government and I give it credit for we should make widowers with dependent chilthe maintenance of children in institutions.

But I would husband who wants to keep his children with regard this as an interim measure and not a comhim would prefer. I know that provisions have pletely satisfactory one.

For a one relaxation of departmental practices in this child family it is $100 a week; 2 children $110; regard. I hope still that it will. But it is still not for 3 children $120; 4 children $130; and 5 chilquite what is wanted, I suppose for 2 reasons. dren $140. These levels are something above Firstly, there is a discretionary aspect in the starvation wages. granting of such benefit which is not really suitable for the kind of federal bureaucracy which we have. Secondly, it is not given as a right; people have to beg for it and establish special bottom of the scale, but it is not satisfactory. I do hardship. The granting of the benefit would not think that anybody would really say that a 5 seem to be incompatible with the maintenance of child family on $140 a week is doing very well any kind of employment. I say that there is proindeed. This is particularly so because of the vision under the Social Services Act for a more peculiar situation of the widower or deserted generous administration of this special benefit, husband. If he is working he has to have some but even if it were administered in that way I do kind of housekeeping arrangements unless some not think that it would quite meet the case. I shall ofhis children are old enough to sustain the burnot take up further time of the House by emphaden of housekeeping themselves. Housekeepers sising the plight of these people and that somewould cost money, and even some kinds of ad thing should be done to help them. I now come to the question of what should be tion-it is not-bu t as an immediate interim done. The first and most readily available measure which should be introduced here and remedy would be to make such fathers eligible now. It is not good enough simply to maintain for widow pensions on the same basis as women the special benefit provisions, for the reasons that with dependent children are thus eligible. I think I have given. I appeal to the Government to do this could be supported as an interim measure this immediately and, perhaps, to amend the Bill for 2 reasons: Firstly, it is logical in these days of relating to social services, which is before the women's lib that we should not have discrimiHouse for consideration, to include a provision nation against men. If a widow with dependent of this character. Under the provisions of the children is eligible for financial help should not a man similarly situated also be eligible? I find that this is not altogether a watertight argument because if one followed it to its natural conclusion one would say that a widower without dependent children should be eligible in the same way as a widow without dependent children. I do not tliink any of us would say that. There are differences in earning capacities and family practices, but still there is some logical basis for introducing this benefit as an interim measure. Secondly, as honourable members know, there have been deputations to this House by representatives of the Supporting Fathers Association and they have asked for this as a first measure. Because it is readily available and could be done quickly I think that this should be Such payments are helpful to those right at the hoc arrangements would cost money. SoI would regard this proposal not as a satisfactory soluConstitution I could not move such an amendment to the Bill. But I ask the Mimster for Social Security whether he would consider moving, when that social services Bill is being debated, an amendment wbich would put the widower or deserted husband with dependent children on the same footing as the widow with dependent children. As I have said, I do not regard this as the final is one means, but not the only means, of adding or even a fully satisfactory solution. It does not to the liquidity of the banking system and meet the position of the man who needs to go out preventing the wholesale bankruptcy which will to work if his children are to be raised above occur if we do not restore liquidity to the banking what is in reality a threshhold starvation level. system. Nevertheless, it will be of immediate relief. Even if it allows a little income for the men who work to enable their children to be home at weekends, only a few months ago, might have been quite that would be something. Let us look at this from a human point of view than the brake. For that reason, I believe that and remember that a man who has lost his wife here and now we could make widowers and should not be subject to the additional strain of deserted husbands with dependent children elihaving his young family broken up. For the gible for pensions on the same basis as women future, I believe that our policy has to be tied up who are widowed or deserted. Do it now, even with a review of the means test as it applies to though it is only an interim measure and even widows with dependent children. Honourable though more fundamental matters should be members will recall that I have on the notice dealt with when we come to revise the structure paper at present a proposal to debate exactly of our social services. As an interim measure, that position. I will not have time to deal with it please, Mr Minister, do it now. Put this provision now. But it does seem to me that we have to be into the social services Bill which awaits the conlooking at the widow with dependent children as sideration of the House now. I cannot move an well as the widower and that the means test as it amendment to that Bill, because of the prodefective and in need of fundamental overhaul. The question will be asked: Where is the need help. They deserve help. I think that thenmoney to come from? That is a very reasonable area of need represents the biggest gap in the question. I do point out to the House that the poswhole system. ition now with respect to the Budget is quite different from what it was even a few months ago. A few months ago, we were worried as we member's time has expired. Is the motion should have been with the over liquidity of the seconded? banking system. It was leading to inflation.

The ngures are somewhat higher than the honourable member for Mackellar outlined to the House and, of course, there were some changes last night For a widower with one child the income limit would be $107 a week, with 2 children $124, with 3 children $141, with 4 children $158, with 5 children $175. Now, there are a lot of questions of equity raised in this sort of thing which I think would readily present themselves to honourable members' minds. Of course we want to help the people in this position and we are exploring possibilities, as I mentioned, and we have an interim arrangement with special benefit. There are also other people we are concerned about and we are exploring ways of helping them-familie s on low incomes, impact families. We have got to do something to help them. There would be many of them with 5 or 6 children on an income of much less than $100 a week. I know of many such families, with a husband and wife too, and we have got to help those people. The Government has done a lot and it is quite proud of its record. We will hold our record in social welfare up against the record of any previous government. In fact the 20 years prior to the election of this Government was a period of neglect. Accordingly, to test the feeling of this HouseI will move the following amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House condemns the neglect of the real needs of sodal service pensioners and beneficiaries over two decades up to December 1972 and commends the many initiatives taken by the Australian Government since then to rectify the defects and injustices within the social services benefits system caused by that earlier long term neglect. The House also commends the undenaking of the Australian Government to continue improving the system of social services benefits and particularly its concern about the needs of widowers and deserted husbands with dependants.' Mr DalyI second the motion and reserve my right to speak. second any amendment moved by a Minister. any doubt the credentials of this Government, I point out that in the 1972-73 Budget the previous Liberal-Country Party Government increased expenditure on social security and welfare by 15.8 per cent. In the 2 Budgets which we have introduced we have increased expenditure over its expenditure in that Budget by better than 66 per cent and we are not satisfied. We will be spending about $3,500m this year in that field. We regard that as being a quite creditable achievement and as an incentive for us to try to do even better in this community so that we can provide the sorts of standards that are normal in other advanced, concerned countries of the world.

I ask the honourable member for Mackellar to connne his seconded? amendment moved by the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) is not in conformity with an addendum or addition to the motion moved by Wentworth).

103,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Leade r of the House)sought to sheet all the blame of 23 years of neglect onto this side of the Parliament and, because we have condemned his actions, he has objected to an amendment that seeks to place on record his record and at the same time give effect to his motion. Mr GarlandI rise to a point of order, Mr way for the Opposition to try to dodge its Speaker. The Minister took a point of order a moment ago in relation to exactly the same offence as he is committing now when he said that the honourable member for Mackellar was not speaking to the motion before the House. speak to the motion as to why my ruling should be dissented from. ruling is one which I think is sound, Mr Speaker. If you study this amendment carefullyI will read is for the benefit of the House-yo u will see that it states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subDaUey who was a very distinguished Treasurer stituting the following words: 'this House condemns the of this House, was accused by five of his neglect of the real needs of social service pensioners and beneficiaries over 2 decades up to December 1972Does the honourable member for Mackellar say what one might describe as a subtle form of emthat the people mentioned in this respect-the bezzlement. They accused him of using funds husbands, wives and others-ar e not pensioners that were for people-pensioners , unemployed so that they are not covered by that section of and so o n itand commends the many initiatives taken by the Australian Government since then to rectify the defects and injustices remind the honourable gentleman that the within the social services benefits system caused by that motion before the chair is dissent from the earlier long term neglect. Surely he does not mean that that does not exentitled to speak only to that motion directly. He clude widowers and deserted husbands with deis not entitled to introduce any extraneous pendent children. They are all social service rematter. cipients. Therefore the amendment clearly relates to the motion that has been moved by the honourable member. The amendment continues: merely inferring that there was a measure of The House also commends the undenaking of the Australian Government to continue improving the system of honourable member for Mackellar. WhUstI am social service benefits and particularly its concern about the sure that it is impossible for you officially to comneeds of widowers and deserted husbands with dependents. ment on what I am saying I have no doubt that Has that no relevance to the motion that the the point of my words is not lost on the honourhonourable member has moved? It is: That, in the opinion of this House, some provision should be made for assistance to widowers and deserted husbands Security) (11.44)I oppose the motion of dissent with dependent children. This dissent motion has been moved, Mr Mr Wentworth). I want to put 2 propositions Speaker, not because your ruling is wrong, but quite firmly to honourable members. Thefirstis because the amendment has sheeted home comthat the amendment in fact gives strength to the pletely the blame for any neglect in respect of motion moved by the honourable member for these matters right where it belongs, and that is Mackellar which is seriously defective. In fact I to the person who moved the motion. If honourable members opposite play the its present form is a waste of the time of the game the hard way and try, by a motion of this House. The reason for that is simple. The kind, to take a rise out of a Government that has honourable member's motion is that in the done wonders in the field of social services they cannot object when we move an amendment which says that we have in rnind these questions and which at the same time puts on record their neglect. I say no more. The motion moved by the honourable member for Mackellar is a clever responsibilities, but we have sheeted home the responsibility for any shortcomings. Accordingly I believe that the ruling is in order. to support the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) because I am confident that the integrity of his argument will not escape the honourable members who sit on this side of the House. I would remind you, Sir, as the member for Sydney as well as the Speaker of this House, that during ancient times in an earlier ParUament an equally distinguished person of equal standards of integrity representing the Australian Labor Party, namely the honourable member for colleagues, including the father of the present honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), of Speaker's ruling. The honourable gentleman is integrity in this motion that has been put by the able member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). moved by the honourable member for Mackellar would go so far as to say it is meaningless, and in",37,Objection To Ruling

109,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for Socialopinion of this house some provision should be made for assisting widowers, deserted husbands and so on. Th""! motion says 'some provision'. But that in fact is already done by way of special benefits. So that is a fairly meaningless and fairly useless sort of motion. We have sought to help the honourable member. We have sought to strengthen the proposition which he is putting to the House. I come to the second proposition I would assert, that is that I can see nothing wrong with the democratic test of the feeling of the House by putting this matter to the vote. After all, this is the traditional and democratic way to test the views of the Parliament. If a vote is taken we will then see what views members of the Parliament hold on this issue. I am not certain of the outcome of a vote but I tend to suspect that the majority of members will be intelligent enough to support the view I am putting and that is that this amendment really strengthens and gives point to the whole course of the debate this morning. The amendment ties together in a highly relevant way what I think the honourable member for Mackellar was trying to get to. The first point that came out by implication from what he said and from the motion that he moved is clear. It is neglecta shocking record of neglect. Twenty years of it, the worse 5 years under his administrationing the subject matter. I ask him to keep to the question, which is that the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. The Minister is not entitled to debate the subject matter itself. was quite innocently done. I was seeking to defend your ruling which I think is eminently reasonable and just. I want to justify the relevance of the amendment which is a condemnation of the neglect of the real need of social service pensioners and beneficiaries over 2 decades. It may be-and I am not clear, Mr Opposition who initiated this debate and thereSpeaker-that members of the Opposition do not want to condemn the neglect, that they do not mind the neglect I find that hard to accept. Therefore I do not think that there is any real quibble about this. Let me move therefore to the second part of the motion. May I remind you, Mr Speaker, that it is important to tie together what the essential ingredients of the point moved by the honourable member for Mackellar are. The essential ingredients are that these unfortunate menwidowers and deserted husbands with dependent children-d o not have adequate benefit at this stage. They do not have it because there has been neglect in the past. So the 2 things do tie opposes the undertaking of the Australian together and they are highly relevant. Of course, the neglect did take place consistently over 20 years. Mr ChippIriseto order. There is a tradition in this House that the Opposition's spokesman is given an opportunity to speak. This is obviously a dirty, grimy, political tactic where the Minister is now filibustering to stop the Opposition's spokesman from speaking. If he moves that the question be putmember for Hotham will resume his seat. I will not permit language of that nature. I ask the honourable gentleman to contain himself when he is speaking and not to use such words. Mr ChippI will not withdraw those words, MrSpeaker. My hands are clean. Is your mind? The second part of the amendment states: The House also commends the undertaking of the Australian Government to continuemembers day. You know that this debate will conclude at 12 o'clock sharp and that this allows only another 14 minutes for debate. I ask you, in accordance with the practice of the House, to appeal to the Minister to sit down and to let the spokesman for the Opposition speak on this matter. certain amount oftimein which he can speak if he so desires. He can speak as long as he keeps to the motion before the chair, which is that the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. bounden duty to defend the distinguished position of the Chair in this matter. FinallyI want to say, if I am not interrupted by members of the fore eroded their own speaking time, that I do not think anyone in the Opposition would oppose the second part of the amendment-the commendation of the undertaking of the Australian Government to continue improving the system of social service benefits and particularly the Government's concern about the needs of widowers and deserted husbands with dependants.

Second Reading Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (12.47)I move: That the Bill be now read a second tirne. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation Works) Act 1970 to provide additional nnancial assistance of $4.4m to the Queensland Government towards the cost of completing certain works in phase 1 of stage 1 of the Bundaberg irrigation project. Under the 1970 Act, a grant of $ 12.8m was provided for the construction of Monduran Dam, which will provide the main storage of the project, Gin Gin Channel and an associated pumping station which will link the Kolan River and Burnett River sections of the project. The state undertook tofinancethe balance of the works in phase 1 out of its own resources, involving the construction oftidalbarrages on the Kolan and Burnettriversand water distribution systems. It became clear by mid-1973 that the cost of the works being financed by the Australian Government would considerably exceed the funds available under the Act and the Queensland Government submitted a request for a further grant of $4.4m. The cost increase was attributed, in the main, to the unusual and rugged nature of the terrain through which Gin Gin Channel is being constructed, to the limited experience in Australia in the design and cost estimation of the pumping equipment to be installed in association with Gin Gin Channel, and to substantial increases in construction site allowances which were not envisaged when estimates for the project werefinalised.The general escalation in salaries, wages and construction materials also contributed to the increased cost of the works being financed by the Australian Government. The Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation was engaged by my department to advise on the revised cost estimates. Monduran Dam will provide a storage capacity of 584,000 megalitres and provide an assured supply of water of 128,000 megalitres annually. The dam is virtually complete, Gin Gin Channel is about 60 per cent complete and the pumping station is at an advanced stage of design. The State has completed the Kolan tidal barrage, construction has commenced on the Burnett tidal barrage and one of the supply this year.",44,Parliament Bill 1974

They are quieter than the earlier Boeing 727-100 models in use in this airlines to provide the community with the most suitable modern aircraft types. Hence, I look forward to the earlier practicable introduction of wide-bodied jets, together with the greatest possible spreading of timetables. In more detail, the wide bodied jets are parposes because they are noticeably quieter than the present jets in operation here. It will be recalled that this Government has taken definite steps to ensure an alleviation of the noise nuisance to people living near airports, particularly when the noise occurs at night. Another favourable consideration is that the greater passenger capacity of wide body aircraft, which will be used on the very high density routes, will enable airline schedules to be reduced, say to a level of once every 2 hours for each airline between Sydney and Melbourne. With sensible timetabling a resultant spread on this route could provide the public with a service every hour without parallel flights. I see no reason why services on other routes should not become more attractive also. Another real benefit of wide bodied aircraft is that they are less demanding on energy and resources. Fuel required per passenger/kilometre on these larger aircraft will be less than that on present airhne aircraft. This cost but should retard the rate of future fare increases.

That entry would result in huge savings for the people of Western Australiaa State where air travel's advantage can be used to the maximum. Under the present monopoly situation MacRobertson Miller Airlines Ltd offers only one fare and TAA will offer first and economy class with the economy fares 20 per cent below current MMA fares. An example of fare savings is: From Perth to Port Hedland, a saving of $48.20 on a return ticket; and from Perth to Darwin, a saving of $85.40 on a return ticket.

AIR NAVIGATION (CHARGES) BILL 1974 accept that the general taxpayer must subsidise Bill presented by Mr Charles Jones, and read people who travel. To this end, the Bill provides afirsttime. Second Reading for Transport) (2.33)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Air Navigation (Charges) Act imposes to provide and maintain them. Special aerocharges on the operators of aircraft for the use of dromes for general aviation aircraft, Archerfield, aerodromes, airways facilities, meteorological Bankstown, Cambridge, Essendon, Jandakot, services and search and rescue services provided, Moorabbin and Parafield, have been provided in operated and maintained by the Australian all capital cities-by the taxpayer. Last year, Government. The purpose of this Bill is to these aerodromes alone cost $10m to operate increase the rates of air navigation charges, and and maintain. In addition, facilities have been to make other changes in the Act which the provided at other airports largely for general aviGovernment feels to be desirable. In 1973-74, the cost of providing, operating and maintaining air navigation facilities and services throughout Ausualia amounted to $140m. ties and services totalled $75m. Of this amount, $33m came from air navigation charges paid by aircraft operators, $ 11.5m from hangar and building rentals and terminal concession charges and the like, and $30.5m from aviation fuel taxes. This left a deficit between revenue and expenditure of $65m, a deficit which the Ausanother way, the Australian taxpayer was asked to pay more than $6 for each passenger who travelled by air within, to or from Australia. In 1960, the then Liberal-Country Party Government adopted as a long term objecuve the eventual full recovery of the cost of air ttansport facilities provided by the Government. That Government set no target for achieving its objective, either in full or in part. Last year, this Government decided to accelerate the cost recovery program. It decided on a policy aimed at raising the then unsatisfactory rate of recovery-somethin g like 49 per cent-to 80 per cent by 1978. This, despite recent speculation Basic to this approach, and equally applicable to all transport modes, is that the user and the beneficiary should pay. The Government cannot for an increase of 15 per cent in air navigation charges. These higher charges will become effective from 1 December 1974. They are payable 'across the board', that is, by all operators, domties and services. General aviation makes heavy demands on aviation facilities and on the funds ation aircraft, things like light aircraft aprons",51,Airline Equipment Loan Guarantee Bill 1974
167,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle,"Minister estic and international, making use of our faciliand taxiways, traffic control and flight service units, communications and fire units. In 1954, there were 168 airline aircraft in Australia. By 1974, this number had fallen to 138. In sharp contrast, in the same period, the number of general aviation aircraft increased from 677 to 4,012. The airlines flew some 265,000 hours in 1954, and the same in 1974-a reflection of greatly increased productivity through the operation of larger and faster aircraft. But hours flown in general aviation increased almost ninefold, from 145,000 in 1954 to 1.3 million in 1974. About 30 per cent of this represents private and business flying. Light aircraft movements at most airports throughout Australia have increased more rapidly in the last 20 years than airline movements. Last year, Tamworth had about 7,000 airline movements, and 30,000 Ught aircraft movements. Canberra had 21,000 airline movements and 42,000 Ught aircraft movements. General aviation places an exceptionaUy heavy demand on our airways and airport facUities. The Government believes that the contribution which general aviation makes towards the cost of those facUities should be more closely related to the demands which this section of the aviation industry places upon them. Honourable members might be surprised to learn that at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, for instance, an estimated cost allocation for 1973-74 shows that the domestic airUnes contributed some 77 per cent-$9.7m-of the costs attributable to their own operations, international airlines also contributed some 77 per cent or $ 11.1 m towards the cost of their own operations, whereas general aviation only contributed some 0.4 per cent towards the cost of their own operations at that centre. I might add that the general aviation cost in this context was calculated on the basis that it was the minimum unavoidable increment to cater for these aircraft at Sydney airport. Such tilings as general runway costs and interest and depreciation were not included. Accordingly, the cost was the lowest cost that could reasonably be calculated. Despite the large expenditure on faciUties for general aviation, all that the Government recovered last year from general aviation operators was about $5m-jus t half of what it cost to operate and maintain the general aviation airports in the 6 capital cities alone. It is proposed, therefore, to increase the charges payable by general aviation operators. The charges in respect to general aviation aircraft weighing less than 9,000 ltilograms wUl be increased by an additional 50 per cent over and above the basic 15 per cent increase in air navigation charges. Aircraft above 9,000 ltilograms, on which higher additional charges were imposed last year, wiU not be subject to this increase. At the same time, the amount of remission granted on aircraft not ordinarily kept at government aerodromes, or aerodromes in receipt of governmentfinancialassistance, wUl be increased from one-third to one-half of the charges payable. A small but active element is emerging in general aviation which places few demands on the aviation infrastructure. I refer to aircraft enthusiasts who have a hobby concerned with historical aircraft. Owners of private aircraft of an historical nature, used for pleasure and not for the purpose of personal transportation, may apply to the Department for special consideration in regard to the level of their charges. I am referring to those few historical aircraft that are kept on the register fromtimetotimeand which wouldflysome 20 to 30 hours only in any year. WhUe on the subject of special groups, I should add that the 15 per cent across the board increase that I mentioned earlier does not apply to very small aircraft with weights less than 500 ltilograms. However, the 50 per cent increase does apply. It is proposed to impose additional charges on foreign-registered aircraft used for private or aerial work purposes in Australia. These aircraft wUl be subject to an additional charge, over and above the basic 15 per cent increase in air navigation charges, of 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. No additional charges are proposed for aircraft in the international charter category. The proposed increases in air navigation charges are expected to yield an additional revenue of $3m in the remainder of the current financial year, and $6m in a full 12 months. This estimate takes no account of traffic growth, which may be expected to result in a higher additional revenue. Certain other changes in the Air Navigation (Charges) Act are proposed. They wUl have no significant effect on revenue, but are desirable to facUitate the administration of the charging system. It has been suggested that the Government's cost recovery program, and its effect on air navigation charges, is forcing domestic air fares upward. WhUst this could be true to some extent, it should be noted that increases in air navigation charges have been no more than 15 per cent at the most a year. In any case, only 2.8 per cent of the recent domestic fare increase can be attributed to increases in air navigation charges and 7.5 per cent to fuel tax. Some 78 per cent of the latest fare increase represented nothing more than a response to the significant wage increases revenue is not the Government's sole concenaffecting the airlines. We should not exaggerate the cost burden of that infrastructure. The Department of Transair navigation charges on air travel, domestic or port is critically reviewing all of its air transport international. Air navigation charges paid by activities with a view to effecting economies Trans Australia Airlines amounted to about wherever they can be made in consultation with $6.7m in 1973-74. Its total costs exceed $150m. the airlines , the general aviation industry and In percentage terms, air navigation charges . representatives of the various employee orrepresented some 4 per cent only of the airline's ganisations concerned. In addition the provision total cost. Perhaps the following simple illustraof services at the less busy provincial centres is tion will place these charges in their proper being examined in order to effect further cost perspective: If air navigation charges were savings. As an example, flight service units have reduced by half, the cost of a journey between been withdrawn from Flinders Island, Woomera Sydney and Melbourne could be reduced at the and Mangalore at a saving of about $60,000 a most by about 70c, and of a journey between year. In addition fire services have been withSydney and San Francisco by $9-a t a cost to the drawn from Mangalore, Derby, Narromine and taxpayer of about $ 16m. It is often claimed that Australian air navigation charges are amongst the highest in the world. Let there be absolute clarity about this: Our charges are all-inclusive. Charges in many countries are not. Landing charges are only one of several charges and taxes, payable by the airlines and their passengers, which affect the cost of operating to and from other countries. For example, on top of the landing charge for a Boeing 747 of $A449 at Honolulu there is a communications charge of $A53, a passenger holding area charge of $A25, a baggage claim area charge of $A13, a customs overtime charge of $A48, plus a United States transportation charge, paid by the passenger of $3 per head. At an absolute minimum, these costs would total $1,096. At San Francisco, where the landing fee for a Boeing 747 is $216, the communications charge is $31, passenger holding area charge is $109, plus amortisation and interest on the capital expenditure made there by Qantas of $193, a baggage claim area charge of $41, customs overtime $137, United States transportation tax of $3 per head, once again paid by the passenger, plus a San Mateo County property tax of $ 134. These costs could total $1,369 at the absolute minimum. This compares with an airline terminating in Sydney which is charged a total of $2,912. May I say that Australian air navigation charges are based on a consistent pricing structure for both domestic and international airlines. Further, there is absolutely no discrimination, in the treatment given, between our own international airline and any other international airline, or between any international airlines. The increased charges for which this Bill provides are a further step towards the eventual recovery of Chairman, you may recall that last evening when 80 per cent of the costs involved in mamtaining I was speaking on this subject. I was referring to our aviation infrastructure. But increased the problems of the individual members of this tration in this area. The Government is rigorously pruning every cost associated with Broken Hill at a saving of about $ 100,000. The Department of Transport believes that to justify the retention of these costly facilities, the airports where they are located should cater for certain minimum traffic demands. In the case of fire services and rescue facilities, it believes that, as a minimum, aerodromes should be served by F27 aircraft, should handle at least 8 regular movements a day and cater to at least 25,000 passengers a year. In the case of flight service units, the aerodrome should accommodate at least 12,000 aircraft movements a year. Naturally there are other factors which will influence any decision to withdraw such existing facilities at aerodromes as do not meet these basic minimum requirements. The gap is being narrowed from the cost side. The Australian community will no longer have to bear the cost of inefficient allocation of resources. The Government will achieve a balanced, coordinated transport system with a proper allocation of resources based on demonstrated community needs. It will achieve a system in which every transport method performs the role for which it is best suited, to provide the maximum benefit to the nation. I commend the Bill.

168,Mr King (Wimmera) (2.50),"Mr Deputyplace in relation to their parliamentary duties and responsibilities, how difficult it was for some of them to get to this place, and other problems that they confront whilst trying to operate efficiently and effectively as members representing various constituencies. I instanced the assistance that the Australian Country Party receives in this place. I speak on behalf of my own Party because I am not so familiar with the members of the other parties represented in this Parliament. One typist is allocated to the Country Party in this place. I do not want to imply that her efficiency is not enough for the job. On the contrary, I believe she does a magnificent job, but she is completely overworked. It is not uncommon for members who go along to see her to find that they have to get in a queue to get their dictating done. Finally, they may have to wait, in many instances, for days before they can secure her services, which are sometimes urgently needed. That this problem exists can be proved by the fact that many members of the Liberal and Country Parties have to employ staff themselves privately. I think it is disgraceful that members of a political party have to employ private staff and pay the salaries of staff themselves so that the work that is necessary in this place can be carried out. I do not know how many staff are privately employed by the ruling Labor Government. I would doubt that any are employed doing the same type of work as is carried out by private employees of the Liberal and Country Parties. However, that is by the way. I want to refer to somefiguresunder division 101 in the estimates for the Parliament. The appropriation for salaries and overtime for people who operate within the Senate totals $1,161,400. Under division 102 the appropriation under the same item for the House of Representatives is $1,322,000. You might say that there is not a great deal of difference. How true. Yet the total membership of the Senate is 60 whereas this House has a total of 127 members. Surely to goodness that proves the pointI am not suggesting that we should have double the staff of the Senate-that at least members of the House of Representatives should be given a little more consideration in terms of the workload that is carried in this House. That is after all what we are dealing with. FinallyI make mention of parliamentary proon a clear poticy of denigration of the Parliament cedure. What has been concerning me is that the and its members. Only last weekend we saw Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has made statePress articles purporting to suggest that members ments outside this place, and indeed inside it, of Parliament had different rights in relation to threatening to call the Parliament out before the taxation from other persons when, in fact, every people in the event of certain legislation not person in the community who receives an overbeing passed by the Senate. We have heard night allowance does not have that questioned about the so-called obstruction of the Senate. If ground exists for a government to resign because parties or Houses reject a Budget, what is the difference between that situation and members in this chamber making alterations to Budget decisions brought down by the Treasurer? The question is: Who does make the decisions? I always thought it was the Cabinet, but it appears today that Caucus has a very big say. Finally we see a situation in which individual party committees almost have power in this place. Recently the chairman of a committee suggested that this and that should be altered and finally the Treasurer agreed. I believe that this committee system eventually will break the procedures and principles of the ParUament itself and that is why I draw attention to it. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. pathise with the problems of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) related to staff in ParUament House as I have had considerable experience in Opposition under a former government. Adequate staff in this place and in the electorates has never been avaUable to honourable members but the position is no different with different governments although there may be times when staff is increased but those increases are usually for members at the leadership or ministerial level. I think, however, that the ParUament should pay some tribute to the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) who has done more for backbench members than any other Minister, irrespective of his term of office as Leader of the House or of his political colour. The one exception may possibly be the Minster who originally provided staff in electorates for members. That was a major break through and was an enlightened decision at the time it was made. However this is not the subject to which I wanted to refer in this debate. My concern, in speaking to the estimates of the Parliament, is related to the standing of the Parliament and its members. The honourable member for Wimmera has echoed what I consider to be the most dangerous situation the Parliament faces at the moment. Over a considerable period the AustraUan Press has embarked",54,Appropriation Bill No 1 1974 75

170,Mr Scholes (Corio) (2.56),"I can symprovided he does not claim more for expenses than the amount allowed. Members of the Press are included in tnis category, but they always seem to forget their own privileges when talking about the excessive privileges of others. I do not want to discuss this aspect at length but it should be pointed out that the articles which were published were of a scurrilous nature and were deliberately biased against members of the Parliament. The people who wrote them knew they were untrue and also clearly knew that many other people in the community-in fact all people who receive expense allowances for various reasons; tax free allowances-d o not have to vouch for such expenses provided they do not claim in excess of the allowance. I mention this matter because I think it important to point out the exact position. Another matter which concerns me seriously is the campaign, which has been going on for as long as I can remember but which has moyed strongly in recent months, to suggest that only certain persons elected to this Parliament have any right to any say in decisions of the Goverament. Many of the articles which I have read suggest that only one person has any right to a say in the government of fhe countiy-o n economic and fiscal decisions and on government policy. It is not unusual, in fact it is quite regular, to read Press articles suggesting that if the Prime Minister makes a decision no other member of Parliament, especially a Government supporter, has any right to query it. It is being portrayed that if members collectively of the Government Partymembers of the present Opposition never had this problem because they had no say when in government but were only ciphers for those at their head-disagre e with the decisions of their executive,, they should have no say. I disagree with that contention. The people of my electorate elected me to come to Canberra and accept responsibility for Government decisions, and I do whether I like them or not. That is what this business is all about and it is what we have to do. disagree with Government policy? Do they ever cross the floor? Party room, the same as does any other member. danger that could possibly exist to democratic House. of the honourable member, but I have never seen electing members to Parliament-thi s applies a member of the Opposition parties cross the equally to Opposition members-is that they floor when in government and that government's shall vote on election day, that those they elect position was on the line. It is usually a paper tiger shall come to Canberra and vote for a leader and operation for good publicity and the honourable member knows it. My concern is that proper democratic processes should be carried out. Members who are expected to vote for Government policies in the Parliament should be entitled to exercise their rights to challenge matters when they consider it necessary and to express opinions on decisions of a smaller group of their members, no matter what positions they may happen to hold. But when they express their opinions they are denigrated as being disloyal and not carrying out the functions of government. It is my opinion that members who sit in this Parliament and support government decisions-as members do, no matter which party sits on this side of the House-ar e entitled to challenge the decisions of government within the proper confines of their Party rooms. Mr Donald Cameron-Before those decisions become legislation? Mr Donald Cameron-You intioduce a Budget, then you change it. propriation Bill (No. 1), which we are presently discussing, has been altered in any way. Subsequent legislation mentioned in the Budget statement may have been altered, but none of it is included in this Bill. The honourable member should understand the processes of the ParUament before he makes interjections of that type. The danger I talk of is not a danger which comes from within the ParUament; it is a danger from without. A series of articles continually appears in the Australian Press seeking to prevaU on supporters of the Government not to express an opinion and not to dissent from any decision of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister irrespective of whether they think it right or wrong. To my knowledge, and I may be wrong, there have been about 2 occasions only in the last 2 years when an opinion of the Prime Minister has not been carried in the Caucus room. That, I think, is but it is irresponsible to say that Caucus and members should have norightto express an opinion within their own Party on matters on which they are expected to vote in the What these Press articles are saying is that the",55,Appropriation Bill No 1 1974 75

176,Mr Scholes,"No matter included in Aphaving chosen that leader for the next 3 years they will have no right to exercise any authority over that leader or members of the Cabinet. In the case of the Opposition their leader chooses his Cabinet but our Party elects the Cabinet. What the articles suggest is not what parliamentary representation is all about. Those newspapers which carry these stories are mischievous in the worse possible way. They are seeking to establish, under the guise of a democratic parliament, a principle whereby there is an elected dictatorship. I do not care which side of politics is involved, I believe that members who are elected to Parliament should seek to represent their constituents in the best possible way the system enables to do so. The Westminster system is a crisis system. Everytimethe bells ring in this House there is a crisis for the Government. That is what the Westminster system is all about. It is a competent system. There is no provision in the Westminster system for a government to be defeated and survive. This is not like the system in Washington where the President stands above the Congress and can be defeated every day of the week but stays in office for 4 years unless something happens as happened to recent Presidents. While we have the party system we will have, of necessity, members voting in blocs in the Parliament. They must therefore be able to express their opinions elsewhere, and elsewhere is in the Party room. If that is denied the democratic system does not exist and cannot exist. In the Labor Party members have that right. It is an unalienable right and one which, I think, ought to be defended, not denigrated, by people who profess to defend democracy but in fact attack it on a daily basis. by the honourable member for Corio( Mr haviour in this chamber as it will be judged by an Scholes) as being a sincere description ofhis own increasingly intelligent and perceptive outside problems. I suppose that it is now open knowlviewing and listening body. In this, the people's edge that his Party is a hopelessly divided and House, we must more than ever mirror the best unhappy one under its current leadership. He has attitudes of the community and not the worse. to accept that that is so.

Nevertheless, I believe we will, and States house but has become a purely PartyI believe we should, take this step in due course. house it is, of course, the members of the Labor Party. It was not until they banded together that the significance of the Senate as a States House was negated. Other parties out of sheer self protection fromtimetotimehave had to adopt the same policy. Let us have no more nonsense in relation to that problem. I refer now to the estimates for the Parliament which is the matter now before the House. I think it is fair to say that this House continues to act in a somewhat more colourful fashion than its equivalent House in, say, the United Kingdom, Canada or New Zealand. I noticed the other day man of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff in a manual for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which I think is called 'Parliament', in which he draws attention to a list of phrases allowed by precedent in this House in contradiction to others. The one that attracted my attention most, regrettably, was one that states: 'He would not know if he sat on a corkscrew'. That may be amusing to some initially but a plethora of similar phrases probably would detract from the priorities and needs of proper debate in this House, and indeed would detract from the peculiar and necessary role of this House as a check and balance on Executive action. The problem of the public image of Parliament in the eyes of the community is a factor that this House must not forget, as it must not forget the Parliament's authority in the eyes of those who listen to and view its proceedings. From my point of view, I do not seek major reform nor any less colour in phraseology which I think is needed in a lower House, but I think that a lot more thought should be given by all members of",56,Appropriation Bill No 1 1974 75

178,An Article Printed Under The Name Of Mr Bridg,"The advent of the political commentator has totally castrated the reporting of individual members' speeches and questions. These commentators, hard working, if sometimes a trifle inexperienced, perceptive if not heavily endowed with properttainingfor their job, do not worry any more about reporting political facts. They interpret the facts in the daily or weekly commentary which cuts across the capacity of the backbencher in this House to identify with his electorate. Backbenchers rarely today warrant a mention. This illustrates the difficulty of the averplete numbers. Certainly there are sociological age member of Parliament whose city electorate, for instance, must wonder whether he ever says or does anything to represent its views and aspirations. It is primarily for this reason that I believe of Parliament in the House of Commons tends to the interests of Parliament, as an essential part of the democratic process, will be best served by opening up the process to the scrutiny of the community by such action as televising parliamentary sessions with careful consideration being given to those sessions selected for viewing. Cheap political capital can, I think, always be made byridiculingthe Chair. I did not always hold that view. I suppose to one degree or another these attempts toridiculehave always been made by an Opposition that feels frustrated. However, I believe it behoves all members to meditate on the erosion they may cause to the institution by taking frivolous or undue political action with the Chair. This leads me to the matter of quorums. On any international comparison the quota needed for a quorum in this House of one-third or 43 members is too high. This in turn becomes a tactical weapon in the hands of an Opposition subject to insufficient debating time and to gags and guillotines on important Bills which the Opposition regards as unreasonable. It is worth consideration by this House that other parliaments have taken away the power of individual members to call quorums. Certainly, and not only in this Parliament, quorums are called frivolously and constitute a serious erosion on the capacity of various parliamentary and party committees to operate efficiently. On the other hand, before the sitting of the House was suspended for lunch the bare minimum of one Minister, who was ponderously introducing his Bill, one Opposition front bencher, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), and the Speaker constituted the entire number present. It is obvious that the responsibility of the Opposition in these circumstances should be to call a quorum, and it is equally as obvious that the responsibility of a government is at all times to at least hold a reasonable number if not a quorum on such occasions. In any viewing of the operation of other parliaments the first main difference that is made quite apparent to any intelligent observer is the programming of the procedures of the House. It is well known to honourable members that a three-line whip in the United Kingdom states that a division on the Budget will take place at 9.30 p.m. the week after next and the members turn up for such a major division in their comand distribution differences between the United Kingdom Parliament and the Australian Parliament. I get the feeling that the average member be more of a part-time person and not such a captive audience as people who travel vast distances in Australia and live in Canberra at least for the time of the sittings. I think that the larger the membership of this Parliament becomes and the more immense the work it undertakes, the more necessary it will be to attempt to program the proceedings accurately. The business of Bills listed but not eventuating, of new Bills coming from the clouds and appearing for debate creates practical problems to the efficient and effective functioning of the Parliament. In the minute remaining to me I should like to get personal. Honourable members will appreciate the fact that I am the newest comer to join the illustrious people such as yourself, Mr Deputy Chairman, who deputise for the Chairman of Committee. I want to make a few terse comments. When one sits in the Chairman's chair one notices that people like the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Riordan) always pay respect and observance to the Chair as they come and go in this chamber. Many members of this chamber strut arrogantly past, do not stop to check when crossing in front of the table, and take no regard of the Chair whatsoever. In general they make one feel that one is quite redundant when one sits up high in that important position. member for Prospect dare to comment on that aspect. Order!

His normal place on these matters in this Parliament but too character seemed to be in abeyance for a while. few people pay attention to them.

By and large what this Parliament needs lieve that should not occur. One of the problems is some mechanism that would enable it to deis that although there is a great deal of expericentralise its business so that there can be more ence in the United Kingdom and a good deal of debates of the kind that there was on the ConcUiexperience in Canada, where the parliamentary ation and Arbitration (Organisations) BUl last system is roughly similar to ours, so far we have night. For that purpose we would need 2 special not established an effective committee system. A purpose committees. There would be a floating number of things could easily have been done. membership so that when a matter was before a We need some special purpose committees committee which at present do not exist-for instance, a viously the appropriate balance of numbers beHouse ofRepresentatives committee on expenditure in addition to the Public Accounts Comtween mittee.

This of Commons isand Committee in the United Kingdom does not sit importance. just for a few days between the introduction of the Budget and the passage of the Estimates. The If there were 2 committees of this kind they House of Commons Estimates Committee began would enable matters of lesser importance to be in that way about 40 years ago and very soon refened to committees of the House and we I think that in this Parliament, with the These are examples of special purpose comwhich honourable members had an interest in they could attend the committee. Obthe Government and the Opposition have to be maintained. But in the United there are 4 general purpose committees and, as I understand it, there is a steering second readings are given in a second reading committee thus the business of the House kept free for matters of major could have 2 committees sitting contemporaneously. In every hour one could do 2 hours of the work that is now done and in a smaller, more intimate forum I think it is very likely that the work would be done much better. There would be less debate and, if I might say so, on occasions, less grandstanding and more commitment to the particular matter in question. There would need to be a steering committee. For the decisions of that committee there would have to be unanimity. Otherwise the matters would have to come into the full House to be decided. That steering committee, comprised of Government and Opposition members, would determine which matters were of sufficient significance to be referred to the full House and which should go to one of the 2 general purpose committees. I argue for general purpose committees following the United Kingdom practice because there are just not enough members of this chamber to establish a whole series of specialist committees dealing with the whole ambit of governmental affairs. If there is not a specialist committee a matter automatically has to be decided in this chamber if it is a matter involving legislation or something of that kind. Therefore the less important business could not be moved to a committee as could be done if special purpose committees were established. In addition, if one followed the French practice where there have been specialist committees of the French Parhament through at least the first 4 RepubUcsI have not kept pace with the Fifth or Sixth RepubUc-on e saw that fact of having special purpose committees breathing down the necks of Ministers was one of the things which led to the instabUity of Ministers and of governments in the French Parliament. I do not think it is a good practice and in any case members of ParUament rarely want to specialise specificaUy in one issue. It is much better for members to have a broad knowledge and understanding of several issues so that they can develop the capacity for judgment over a wider field. A wide acceptance of special purpose committees as a way of solving the problems we have would not work and would not lead to an effective decentraUsation of business, which is the only way we can have adequate time for debate and at the sametimemake sure that honourable members have time to do things which are necessary and must be done away from Canberra. In the present circumstances we wUl be sitting longer and longer and other parts of our activities, therefore, will get cut back. We would need somewhere for the 2 proposed committees to sit. I am talking about committees not of five or six, or nine or ten members each. For general purpose committees we would need a substantial membership. I tliink in the United Kingdom the membership might be between forty and eighty. I do not want to be held to ransom because it is some time since I have read the papers on the subject, but in this Parliament if there were 2 committees of say thirty eachagain they would need a floating membership so that the particular interests of honourable members could be met if they wanted to attend for one particular subject and one alone-w e would probably need to construct an additional place where the second committee could sit. Probably the closest and best place, if an underground raUway were established, would be the bowling green. I know that a number of people might not like that, but the effective business of this Government and ParUament is more important than the bowling green. That could probably be moved slightly further afield. I conclude on this point*. Nothing that is done in relation to committees will be effective unless there is a government which wants the committee system to work. If the Government wants a committee system to make members busy and so stop them getting in the way of governmentthat is often the view of governments-ther e will never be a committee system that works. But if the Government wants to see a committee system which wUl contribute to the good government of this country-if we had a government of that kind-it would co-operate in developing a committee system for the House of Representatives that could be effective and that could work. Earlier, I showed to the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) a paper. It is a lengthy one. It is a paper prepared by a Party Committee of the Liberal Party and the Country Party two or three years ago. I have asked those members of that committee who are still members of this Parliament whether they have any objection to that paper being made pubUc. None of them have. It contains some remarks in relation to the committee system and it draws information from the United Kingdom practice. Therefore, I think, especiaUy in view of the joint committee that this House has established with the Senate to inquire mto the parUamentary committee system, that there could be some advantage in this paper being incorporated in Hansard. leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)-",58,Appropriation Bill No 1 1974 75
183,The Deputy Chairman ( Mr Lucock),"IsMET IN CANBERRA ON 13 AND 14 JULY 1971 t. The Leader of the House referred six matters to the Committee for report: (i) Days and hours of sitting. (ii) Allocation of times fbr speeches. (iii) Procedure for the suspension of Standing Orders. (iv) The quorum. (v) Parliamentary committees. (vi) Methods by which Party Members may be better informed of the House program. 2. The Committee wrote to all Members of the Government Panies in the House ofRepresentatives to canvas their views on these and other matters which Members felt should come before the Committee. As a result several additional matters were discussed. These included: (a) Measures that might be, taken to reduce the last week's rush. (b) Matters of public importance. (c) Petitions. (d) Secondment of motions and amendments. (e) Procedures relating to private members' motions. 3. Days and hours of sittingA significant majority of members who wrote to the Committee supported a return to the old system of days and hours of sitting in the four week cycle. Arguments put forward and discussed by the Committee included the following: (a) It was felt that the three week cycle system made a proper division of time between parliamentary and electoral work more difficult. It was strongly felt that Members liked to know that Mondays and Fridays will remain clear fbr their own commitments. (b) Whatever may be the merits in theory, the new system just did not work. Very many Members sought to get leave on Fridays and few use the weekend in Canberra for its intended purpose. It was significant that reversion to the old system was supported by a number of Members from remote areas. The Committee recommends that the present sitting arrangements be abandoned as soon as possible and that we return to the old system of three weeks on and one week off. The Committee further strongly recommends that Government business should not be pursued after 11 p.m. unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. If the rule is to be broken the Panies should be given an explanation, preferably before the event, by the Leader of the House or by the Minister concerned, who must take responsibility. The Committee also strongly recommends that the House should sit for more days, rather than late at night. The Committee also discussed the adjournment debate. The Committee believes that we should seek to reach arrangements under which as many Members possible could go home once the adjournment debate has staned. The Committee believes that the Government parties should, however, maintain a majority in the House during the adjournment debate and suggests that substantial pairing by roster may be arranged. The Committee was not in favour of an arbitrary time limit on the adjournment debate. 4. The allocation of time for speeches-The Committee recommends that no change be made in the present arrangements. 5. Procedure for the suspension of Standing Orders-The Committee recommends that the time for speeches on a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders be reduced from twenty minutes for the mover and fifteen minutes for other Members, to ten minutes for the mover, ten minutes for the first reply and five minutes for all other Members. The Committee is not in favour of a definite time limit on the length of the debate. 6. Quorum-The Committee recommends that the quorum be reduced to one-fifth for all purposes. 7. Seconding of motions and amendments-The Committee recommends that a seconder for motions and amendments be no longer required, because the provision achieves no effective purpose. The House of Commons dispensed with the requirement ten years ago. 8. The House Program-The Committee strongly believes that the Government must avoid the traditional end of session rush. The Committee understands that its recommendations may require some alteration in the methods and procedures of Cabinet or departmental business, but nevertheless is strongly of the view that if alterations are required to achieve the Committee's recommendations, then these alterations should be made. The Committee recommends that no bill should be introduced into the House less than four weeks before the end of the session, if it is to be passed through all stages in that session. The Committee accepts that emergency situations could arise, but suggests that in such situations the Minister concerned would need a good explanation. The Committee recommends that bills be introduced into the Parry Room in one week and debated therein the next week, or alternatively that bills be introduced into the Party Room, that some preliminary debate takes place, that the bill then be referred to a committee of the Panies and that that committee should then report back to the Pany Room in the following week. The Committee also recommends that the Leader of the House should at the end of each week inform the Parliament of the intended business for the following week, detailed day by day. This recommendation follows House of Commons practice. 9. Petitions-The Committee recommends that a petition in a particular form be read only once in each sitting week and that if petitions in a similar form are received, the Clerk should merely announce that such a petition has been received from the Member concerned. The Committee does not recommend other changes in the petiuon procedure. The Committee believes that Question Time should not be reduced because of petitions, especially if the new procedures are adopted. 10. Matters of Public Importance and Private Members' Motions-The Committee discussed matters of public importance and the procedures for handling private members' motions, but recommends no change. 11. Messages-The Committee strongly beheves that the means of getting messages to Members quickly in the Parliament Building should be greatly improved, and expresses the view that the present system of pink slips is not working and is too slow. The Committee also suggests that the question of electronic devices should be further examined. 12. Parliamentary Committees-The Committee had lengthy discussions concerning the development of a committee system for the House of Representatives. It was conscious of the fact that our parliamentary system is markedly different from that in some other countries. The Committee leant, therefore, towards British experience and practice rather than the experience and practice of the United States. In many respects the two systems are not compatible. Our executive is directly responsible to, is in and part of the Parliament. Ministers are responsible to the Parliament for all matters under their administration. In the executive in the United States' system their members of cabinet are responsible to the President, but at the same time they are subject to a floating membership which varies depending upon the questioning before congressional committees. The division of power and responsibility between the legislature and the executive is clearly denned in the United States. In the Ausopportunity of being on the Committee concerned. tralian and British system the executive is directly responsible to and is part of ParUament. It should also be noted that refers the second reading of cenain Bills to a Second Readmany of those who appear before United States committees ing Committee. This practice could also be adopted to the for questioning are presidential appointees rather than career pubUc servants. In the Australian system it is important cerning this Committee is also attached. to avoid the possibility of the anonymity of pubUc servants being destroyed by ParUamentary enquiry. Our system depends upon senior pubUc servants being able to serve alternative governments. For these reasons the Committee believes that British practice arid experience is much more applicable to ours than would be the American. The Committee strongly recommends after much deliberation that an forms would be required for Second Reading at Committee Expenditure Committee with terms of reference similar to that of the House of Commons' Expenditure Committee, should be established from the House ofRepresentatives. Its House only cursorily could be referred to the Committees by prime purpose should be to see how, if at all, policies implied the House. An example may be departmental annual reports in the ngures of expenditure and in the estimates may be carwhich now receive virtually no notice. ried out more economically. It should be noted that our PubUc Accounts Committee's prime task is to determine if moneys have been spent as Parliament ordered. There is also general purpose Standing Committees would be preferable a House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee which serves a similar purpose to ours. Standing orders relating to the United Kingdom Expendiload could be very uneven, depending on ParUamentary ture Committee and to the Public Accounts Committee are attached, as is the relevant extract from our Public Accounts would achieve the best use of available resources. Act. An extract from May 1971 edition is also attached. Establishment of an Expenditure Committee would involve close co-operation with the Public Accounts Committee. In the United Kingdom this used to be achieved by the Chairman of one being a member of the other. There would be no diminution in the importance of the Public Accounts Committee. Its prime task would not be touched. An Expenditure Committee's task would be of a different nature. A House of Representatives Expenditure Committee would achieve a better examination of the means and manner of the preparation of plans for departmental expenditure Wannon, Victoria. within the guideUnes of announced policy. An Expenditure Committee of the kind established in the House of Commons would not stand in the way of or replace our normal Estimates debate, but it would provide a continuous and an in depth review of the expenditure plans of different departments. The Committee strongly beUeves that such a parliamentary committee established in the House ofRepresentatives would provide more effective parUamentary scrutiny of Australia. expenditure plans and departmental estimates than has so far been achieved. The Committee also recommends the formation of two general purpose Standing Committees of the House of Representatives. The purpose of these committees would be to decentralize the business of the Parliament to achieve a better and more intimate debate on many matters that now pass through the Parliament virtually without scrutiny, and to relieve pressure on the House itself. Such committees would Tasmania. not detract from the powers of the House: they would be servants of the House. Generally such committees would not examine controversial matters in which the House would be strongly divided on Party Unes but legislation which has the general suppon of both Parties could be referred to such committees. If the joint Parties were attracted to this idea a good deal of additional examination would need to be undenaken, but the Committee has attached to this report an extract from the Standing Orders concerning the working of the standing committees for the House of Commons. The Standing Committees of the House of Commons have matters referred to the Committees. This makes sure that any members with a particular interest in a matter would have an It should also be noted that the House of Commons now House of Representatives. An extract from May, 1971, conAs the Committee understood it, it is only committee stages of Bills that are referred to the Standing Committee while the second reading of non-controversial Bills is referred to the Second Reading Committee. Both practices could be adopted here. While different stages, the same Committees could be used for both purposes. In addition, other matters that now pass through the The House Procedures Committee believes that two at this stage to a system of special purpose committees covering all depanments. In our small Parliament there would be difficulties in having too many Committees, and the work business. The Committee felt that its own recommendations If these recommendations are accepted, the Committees would of course be additional to those now operating. The Committee strongly recommends that any Committees now existing, or to be established, should be equipped with adequate staff. The Committee points out that adequate Parliamentary scrutiny and an effective Committee system depend significantly on provision of staff. Chairman: The Honourable Malcolm Fraser, M.P.

Select Committees Public Accounts Committee-The Committee of Public Accounts is appointed under S. O. No. 86 'for the examination of the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Parliament to meet the public expenditure, and of such other accounts laid before Parliament as the Committee may think fit.' The number of members of the Committee is fixed by the same standing order at fifteen. They are nominated at the commencement of each session. The main function of this Committee is to make sure that the parliamentary grants fbr each financial year, including supplementary grants, have been applied to the object which Parliament prescribed, and to consider the matters brought to the nouce of Parliament in the reports made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as a result of his audit. For this purpose they have the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Committee also scrutinizes the causes which have led to any excesses over parliamentary grants. The researches made by the Committee, and the publication of their reports, ensure, on behalf of the House of Commons, an effectual examination of the public accounts. The Committee was appointed for the first time in 1861 (C. J. (1861) 130). It does not take evidence in public. Estimates Committee-An Estimates Committee was appointed regularly from 1912 to 1970 (0Its most recent order of reference was to examine such of the estimates as seemedfitto it, and to report how, if at all, the policy impUed in those estimates might be carried out more economically. The Committee had power also to consider the form of the estimates, and the principal variations between the estimates and those relating to the precedingfinancialyear. The Committee conducted its investigations by means of sub-committees which in their inquiries were concerned with matters arising from the estimates other than those of policy which fell within the scope ofbusiness of supply in the House. In recent years, the scope of the Committee's order of reference has been subject to some criticism (g) in response to which certain alterations were made to the ordering of its business by the Committee (h). In 1970, however, a report of the Select Committee on Procedure (i) recommending that the Estimates Committee should be replaced by a Select Committee on Expenditure was substantially accepted by the government. It was hoped that the changes proposed would enable a strengthened Committee to focus its attention on public expenditure rather than on the supply estimates and to examine a wider selection of issues arising in this field. (0 In the war years 1914-20 and 1939-45 examination of war expenditure was entrusted to the Select Committee on National Expenditure (see Fifteenth edition, p. 658). In 1960 the appointment ofan Estimates Committee was laid down by Standing Order. For a general survey of the development of the Estimates Committee, see Select Committee on Procedure, 1st Report H.C. 410 pp. 87-96 (1968-69).

Public Bills 37 -(1 ) A Member may, after notice, present a bill without previously obtaining leave from the House to bring in the same. (2) When a bill is presented either in pursuance of an order of the House or under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this order, the bill shall be read thefirsttimewithout any question being put, shall be ordered to be read a second time on such day as the Minister presenting it shall appoint, and shall be ordered to be printed. (3) If a Member informs the Clerks at the Table of his intention to take charge of a bill which has been brought from the Lords, the bill shall be deemed to have been read the first time on the day on which the Member so informs the Clerks, and to have been ordered to be read a second time on such a day as he shall appoint, and shall be recorded in the Journal of the House as having been read the first time and ordered to be read a second time on the day so appointed, and shall be ordered to be printed. 38 -(1 ) Where a public bill (not being a bill to confirm a provisional order or certificate) is ordered to be read a second time on a future day, and it appears that the standing orders relating to private business may be appUcable to the bill, the Examiners of Petitions for Private Bills shall be ordered to examine the bill and they shall proceed and report with all convenient speed whether the said standing orders are applicable thereto. If they find that the standing orders are applicable, they shall further report whether they have been complied with. (2) If the Examiners report that any standing order applicable to the bill has not been compUed with, and the Standing Orders Committee report that such standing order ought not to be dispensed with, the order of the day relating to the bill shall be discharged. 39 -(1 ) If on an amendment to the question ""That a bill be now read a second time (or the third time)"" it is decided that the word ""now"" stand part of the question, Mr Speaker shall forthwith declare the bill to be read a second or the third time as the case may be.

XX1-PROCEEDINGS IN PASSING PUBLIC It is a general principle of legislation that a public bill, being of national interest, should be debated in Parliament upon the grounds of public expediency; and that the arguments on either side should be restricted to Members of the House, while peculiar interests are represented by the petitions of the parties concerned. Questions of public policy can be discussed only by Members; but where protection is sought for therightsand interests of public bodies, or others, the parties have been permitted to represem their claims, either in person or by counsel. Counsel have also been heard at various other stages of bills, as well as on the second reading. In the case of bills of pains and penalties, disabilities, or disfranchisement, it has been usual to order a copy of the bill, and the order for the second reading, to be served upon the panies affected, and to hear them by counsel (t). The Attorney General has also been ordered to appoint counsel to manage the evidence, at the bar of the House, in support of the bill (u), or to take care that evidence be produced in support of the bill (a). Bills Referred to a Second Reading Committee Under the provisions of S. O. No. 66, adopted in November 1967 following experiments with sessional resolutions in sessions 1965-66 and 1966-67, a public bill, instead of being debated on second reading in the House, may be referred to a Second Reading Committee on motion made by a Mimster of the Crown at the commencement of public business. At least ten days' notice must be given of any such motion, and no motion can be made until the bill to which it relates has been printed. The question on the motion is put forthwith and must be decided without amendment or debate; but if not less than twenty Members signify their objection byrisingin their places, Mr Speaker must declare that the noes have it (b). When a Second Reading Committee (see p. 600) has reported to the House whether or not they recommend that the bill ought to be read a second time, a note of their recommendation is appended to the order for the second reading of the bill among the Remaining Orders of the day; and when the bill subsequently comes before the House, the question for its second reading is decided without amendment or debate (c). Since its first introduction this procedure has been generally regarded as suitable only for bills ""which are not measures involving large questions of policy nor likely to giveriseto differences on party lines"" (d).

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (3.27)-I hope not to take the 10 minutes allowed each speaker to discuss the estimates for the Parliament. May I take up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles)? I did not hear the whole of his speech. I support his reference to, and I assume to some extent approval of, the proposition that there ought to be fixed times for divisions. What happens at present is quite ridiculous. I do realise at the same time that it is in the interests of the Government to have fixed times for divisions. Oppositions expect to lose divisions whilst governments require to win divisions. Therefore, having a fair knowledge of when divisions will be called or will become necessary obviously is in the interests of a government. An opposition has nothing to lose if the number of its members present for a division is down by 2, 5 or 20. An opposition expects to lose a division anyway. But a government must always have a majority. It is therefore in the interests of a government to have established times for divisions. At a time when many people see some volatility in the political processes of this country with the possibility of changes in those in government and those in opposition, it may well be in the interests of the managers of this House and of parliamentarians as a whole to get together and to come to some agreement on the question of fixing times for the holding of divisions or, at least, of having some range of times within which divisions are likely to be held or are not likely to be held. I did not accept the point made by the honourable member for Angas who seemed to deplore the fact that some members fail to pay special courtesy to the Chair. If the honourable member meant by his remarks what we consider to be the normal courtesies in any situation of taking note of what the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker or the Chairmen of Committees have to say, I have no quibble. But I do deplore the proposition that we are supposed to bow and scrape to the occupant of the Chair when we come into this chamber or leave it. I object to propositions of that type. I must admit that I try to avoid those situations whenever possible. I know that they are traditions. I suppose that that is part of the reason why I oppose them. I consider that such practices are quite pointless. I wish to take a couple of minutes now to deal with a touchy subject as far as the general public is concerned. I refer to the question of remuneration for parliamentarians. Earlier this yearI think it was in Julya report was table from the Remuneration Tribunal which, in effect, made a new award for parliamentarians. Legislation to establish this tribunal had been previously agreed to by the Parliament. I think that it was passed unanimously in this place. That legislation provided for the setting up of a Remuneration Tribunal before which people would be entitled to give evidence both for and against salary rises and improvements in conditions for parliamentarians. When that report was presented, the Liberal and Country Parties were panicked by a sanctimonious and hypocritical Press into disallowing the regulations which were necessary for the recommendations of that report to be adopted. I emphasise that that was the reason for the behaviour of those Parties. I think that probably many Liberal Party and Country Party members now will agree with me in what I say, having seen the 'beneficial' results which flowed from their action. The denial of parliamentary increases has not led to any restraint on the part of any other parliamentarians or public servants. I think I read in a newspaper yesterday that Queensland parliamentarians are receiving higher salaries than we receive. Aldermen in the Brisbane City Council also receive higher salaries than we do. State parliamentarians in New South Wales and Western Australia, I believe, also receive salaries which are higher than the salaries paid to us. In many cases, these parliamentarians live in the capital city in which the State Parliament is located. Their parliamentary work is performed in their city of residence. In other words, a large proportion of State parliamentarians in New South Wales have their homes in Sydney and attend Parliament there on the days when it sits. Members of this Parliament must travel to Canberra every week that Parliament sits to attend parliamentary sittings. I deplored at the time and I still deplore that panic reaction on the part of the Oppositionister? to criticise people on your own side; and I will not-",60,Appropriation Bill No 1 1974 75

185,Dr Klugman,"Well, it is not the usual thingintestinal fortitude. make my remarks broader. I deplore the fact that some parUamentariansa minority on our side and a majority on the Opposition side-were panicked by what I called earUer a sanctimonious and hypocritical Press. Mr Donald Cameron-Hear, hear! member for Griffith for his support. It is important to remember just how sanctimonious and hypocritical the journaUsts of that Press and the Press itself were. Sob stories were run-comple tely untrue stories-about the sort of income that parliamentarians receive. The 'Canberra Times', the local newspaper, was leading one of the attacks on increases in parliamentary salaries. It ran big editorials on the subject. In the very week that we were discussing the report of the Remuneration Tribunal it increased its advertising charges by a greater percentage than that by which it was proposed parliamentary salaries should be increased. Soon after that, the Fairfax organisation increased its charges very significantly for a number of its pubUcations. I suppose other similar organisations did too. In my remarks now, I am criticising not only, as I normaUy do, the owners of the Press but also the individual journalists and reporters who behaved abominably. These same reporters had recently received a salary increase and at the time when this matter arose were putting in an application for another 30 per cent increase in their award wages. They were attacking us hypocriticaUy. I was not expecting to speak on this issue. If I had expected to do so, and if time was avaUable to me, I would have brought into the Committee Deputy Speaker, and I thank the honourable cial pages of last week's Sydney 'Sun'. It dealt new member I am particularly pleased to take with so-called perks for parliamentarians. The part in this Estimates debate. I tliink everybody article was completely wrong and if the reporter has initial reactions when one comes into this researches his nnancial articles as well, it is no place and, although one may become hardened wonder his foUowers lost a lot of money. Many by experience over the years, it is probably worth of the statements which appeared in that article, recording what those initial reactions are. The as aU parUamentarians here would obviously most noticeable thing that I found on coming to know, were completely wrong. I was pleased to Canberra is the conditions that exist in ParUahear the honourable member for Griffith make ment House. I am one who supports the conthe point that it is justridiculousto say that there struction of the new parliament house and I are a large number of perks associated with voted for the Capital HU1 site. I am very pleased being a parliamentarian. At present we receive that this site has now been agreed upon and I sinabout $22 a day as a living away from home alcerely hope that planning wUl start very shortly lowance. I would be surprised if many people for the construction and early occupancy of the who receive living away from home aUowances, new parliament house. The average member of whether they be journalists or pubUc servants, Parliament probably spends something like \5Vi are paid allowances for that purpose of less than $22 per day. If you calculate your expenses you find that actual expenses are much more than the $4100 which is provided as a tax free allowance to members. I was a medical practitioner before I came into this ParUament and, as I have said before, I earned more in 1969 as a medical practitioner than I earn now as a parliamentarianand medical incomes have increased quite considerably since then. The other point I make is that, unlike the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) I do not have 2 other incomes. I do not vote myself wool subsidies and wheat subsidies and then deplore in the newspapers handouts by governments and get paid for writing that. I try to be reasonably consistent in my attitude, but I am not the slightest bit ashamed to say that members of Parliament deserve more, that many of us have made a significant financial sacrifice and that the ridiculous action taken by the Opposition earlier this year will make it extremely difficult for us to get any more increases, because there wUl never be a time when we can adopt the next report from the remuneration tribunal. If it performs its job as a remuneration tribunal, the increase next time will be so huge that again we wUl not be able to accept it. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

192,Mr Lusher (Hume) (3.37),"Thank you, Mrhours a day in this place, cramped into a very small room-sometime s sharing a room-and with not terribly adequate facilities. This often, and I think probably quite unreasonably, causes unnecessary hardship for members. As a younger member it does not concern me so much, but I am at least aware ofit. The accommodation which members are given is far from satisfactory and the assistance that members are given is also far from satisfactory. I have heard a lot about what the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) has done for the back bencher. I do not have anything to compare it with but, insofar as I have heard those statements made, I commend the Minister for the improvements that he has been able to afford to back benchers in this Parliament. I think we have to take into account a number of things when the new parliament house is being planned, and adequate accommodation obviously must come fairly high on the list. I think that secretarial assistance also must come fairly high on the list. I do not necessarily mean that every member should have a secretary, but we ought to be able to devise a workable system whereby a secretary is allocated perhaps to every three or four back bench members. A similar comment would apply in relation to research facilities. It would be a very great boon to back bench members and it would certainly improve the standard of debate in this place if a little research assistance were made available to groups of six or eight back bench members. These are 2 things which should be borne in mind particularly by those who are given the charter to plan the new parliament house. Another thing that could be taken into account by the Government is the question of the expansion of the number of members of Parliament, both in the Senate and in the House ofRepresentatives. This may be a touchy subject but it seems to me that the time has come, as the population continues to grow, when a sizable increase should be made in the number of members in the chamber. This is something which can obviously be planned in the light of the construction of the new building in which to accommodate the Parliament. I speak as a country member and as a country member who is facing a redistribution, and the comments that I make have some relevance to the fact that a redistribuuon is going on. My seat is by no means the largest seat in the Commonwealth; as country seats go it is not all that big-abou t 13,000 square miles. I have an enrolment in my electorate slightly in excess of 50,000 people. As I understand it, the quota will be 66,000 in this redistribution and, with the 10 per cent variation which the Government has imposed upon us, electorates will be drawn up within boundaries of between 60.000 and 72,000sand in 1957. The quota is 64,000. the Minister for that. This will mean that the traditional argument will be applied to country electorates and country members will probably be rated at the top end of the scale when it comes to drawing the boundaries and allocating the number of electors. In a seat Uke Hume that is going to mean perhaps another 20,000 electors. involve a significant addition to the size of the seat. Riverina. member for Prospect in a minute, join him with pleasure. The point I am trying to make is that in a seat like Hume and in the adjoining areas where there are no significantly large towns it is going to involve the tacking on of a great number of small towns. This wUl vastly increase the geographic area in order to bring in the numbers of new electors that will be necessary, and that is assuming that the seat of Hume is one of those seats which is staying. The increase in electoral area is going to impose serious difficulties not only on the member but also on the electors. We have a situation in Hume where there is no centre for the electorate. There are about 12 towns which, broadly speaking, are of equal importance and if other towns are added this wUl add to the number of comparable sized towns. A member has to travel incredibly long distances now to serve an electorate of this size. I place on record for the information of honourable members that I have travelled 10,000 miles in 3 months, and that has been during a period when most of my time has been spent in Canberra. I hate to think what mUeages will be involved when I am spending two and three months at a time back in the electorate. I raise this point because I beUeve the standard of representation is obviously going to suffer and the work load which is applied to individual members is also going to expand. I realise that there are differences which will apply between city and country areas.

It may be in the interests of the electors-and that it what it is about reallyand in the interest of a member being able to do his job more efficiently that there be an increase in the number of members in this chamber. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) drew attention to the subject of parUamentary salaries and aUowances. That is a field in which I have little inclination to get involved, but I would mention the allowances section of it. It does seem to me that there are a sigfuture about the truthfulness of Ministers. I do nificant number of members of this ParUament for whom $4,100 is merely a pittance when it comes to trying to meet the cost of running and getting around one's electorate in a manner over and above the use of those services provided by his eminence the Minister for Services and Property. I estimate that there are a large number of members who are probably exceeding their electoral aUowance by 150 per cent. I do not think that it is at all reasonable for any member of ParUament, no matter what his colour, creed, race or nationality, to be penalised from his salary for the cost ofhis out-of-pocket expenses. I conclude on the note that when a charter is given, if another one is to be given, to the Remuneration Tribunal it be requested to take this matter into account and that we not be left in a situation in which, because of rampant mflation, the cost of staying at a motel and making a couple of telephone caUs runs as high as $20 a night and in which members of Parliament are being penalised one against another according to whether they have a large electorate to cover and service adequately or the traditional pocket handkerchief size electorate which we know some members of ParUament do have. Several matters have been raised in this debate so far. I agree that members of this chamber are, on the whole, very poorly paid. I think it was inevitable that the last proposed salary rise would be knocked back because of the circumstances in which we found ourselves. But I do not see that that should in any way be a precedent for the future. It should be remembered-to our credit, I suppose-that we are one of the few groups in the community not to accept an award of a properly constituted tribunal. We are not even going on strike for extra pay. Perhaps the country would be grateful if we were to do so. Mention has been made of the faciUties avaUable to members of ParUament. I take this opportunity of saymg how much I and I think other services of the Parliamentary Library, which have been buUt over past years. The Parliamentary Library is really providing a tremendous service to members of this Parliament. I , at any rate, would like to say that the officers who are providing the services are showing a quite remarkable degree of competence and initiative. I have risen this afternoon reaUy to draw attention to the necessity for Ministers to be truthful and to carry out the promises that they make in this chamber. As honourable members wUl know, I have a motion on notice for the not intend to follow that proposed motion, but I do want to draw attention to an incident that occurred in this chamber fairly recently. On2 October-honourabl e members will find this recorded at page 2034 of Hansard-I asked the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns), who at that stage was the Acting Prime Minister, about the various interest rates being charged by the Reserve Bank of AustraUa as the lender of last resort to the trading banks. He replied: I am aware of the widespread view that the rate of interest in this respect is high and may cause difficulties that could be avoided. I am not specifically aware of the rate of interest that is charged but I will have that checked and inform the honourable member. That definite commitment to give information to me was made pubUcly in this chamber by the man who at thattimewas Acting Prime Minister and who therefore had full authority to give it. I have tried since that time to extract from the Mmister for Overseas Trade the information that he promised to give to me. His acting private secretary telegraphed me yesterday to this effect: In Dr Cairns' absence I am acknowledging your telegram of 4 October requesting informadon as to rate of interest charged by the Reserve Bank to the various member banks for last resort facilities. Dr Cairns has asked me to pass on the following information. 'In accordance with traditional banker/customer relationships their terms and conditions of loans by the Reserve Bank under the terms of LGS convention are not made public. The bank may charge ""penal"" rates on such loans if it considers this justified.' I apologise for the delay in transmitting this advice. I wrote back to the Minister for Overseas Trade yesterday to this effect: Dear Dr Cairns, Thank you for your telegram of 15 October signed on your behalf by your secretary refusing to give me information regarding the rates of interest charged to various member banks by the Reserve Bank in its capacity as lender of last reson. You will recall that on 2 October, as recorded at page 2034 of Hansard, you as Acting Prime Minister gave me an unequivocal assurance that you would ascertain the rate of interest and inform me ofit.",69,Bills
199,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) (3.47),"The question at issue is whether you intend to welsh on this promise or not.

The way in which the media often seems simply to appease baser psychological instincts in individuals should worry us. But we must never forget that it was the Press that saved the day as far as Watergate in the United States of America was concerned and it is the Press which can do as much and I am afraid to say very often more than we in this ParUament can do to prevent Watergates in this country.

210,The Honourable Member For Wannon ( Mr Mal,"is, if you like, to be an opposition to the government of the day. It is in this area that one often despairs when we come to discuss the Estimates and we find that the resources simply are not voted to enable us to perform our tasks properly as members. People in the community might well say that it is a matter of perks and privileges for members of Parliament, but it is so far from that that it is not funny. It is a matter of the rights of people; it is a matter of bringing people back into the democratic process. Unless we reform and bring the whole of the parliamentary procedures up to date it will not be we who will suffer; it will be the people. member for Chisholm( Mr Staley) has touched upon a very important aspect of Parliament. He referred to the machinery by which members of the Parliament may participate in the activities of government so that members themselves may scrutinise, as he said, attack and oppose where necessary. What he has said might well be comprehended in the question of what happens when government continues to accelerate the growth of boards, authorities, commissions and so on, thereby expanding the Public Service and increasing the bureaucracy of the country. The question becomes: Who will control the controllers? That is what the members of these boards, commissions, authorities and so on are. They are the controllers of so many aspects of our daily Ufe. Who then wUl control them? If at least in some sense ParUament cannot control them, what hope is there for the people themselves? So it is of the utmost importance that the ParUament of AustraUa has a close look at the machinery by which the Parliament itself operates. That is why the committee which has been estabUshed to look at a system of committees for the ParUament is so important. In the short time avaUable to me in this debate not only more staff in the Parliament but also I wish to speak on another aspect of the activities more staff in his electorate, and that would of members of Parliament. This is something necessarily require more accommodation. I have that has been touched upon by other honourable one secretarya very good secretary-wh o members. It concerns the facUities for members handles the inquiries of constituents who apthemselves, both in Parliament and in their elecproach my office while I am in Parliament, and torate. I was elected to the ParUament in for that I am exceedingly thankful because withDecember 1972 and, Uke other honourable out an efficient and capable secretary at home in members who also were elected at that time and my electorate all hell might break loose upon my those who have since been elected, it did not take politician's head. very long to realise that the facilities for members were totally inadequate if they were to carry our their functions properly. Like other ment, I have access to 3 typists who are available members, I praise the efforts of the Minister for to all the back bench Opposition members. That Services and Property( Mr Daly), who is sitting is totally inadequate. Some members have a lot at the table, for what he has done for members more daUy correspondence than others which and in particular the dealings I have had with him because he has been courteous and prompt in attending to matters that I have raised with him. The accommodation for members in this buUding is appalling. It is appallingly inadequate, however one might look at it. Some members have a room to themselves; they are fortunate. In other cases 2 members occupy the one room. In my own case, 3 members occupy the one room. As a new chum to Parliament I am often told by older members: 'Well, you are lucky. You are well off. You should have been here 20 years ago.' I am fortunate that I am both younger and a more recent member of ParUament. tell the Minister that I am going to double it the next time, have no fear about that. So when we get our new parliament house it is of the utmost importance that more rather than less accommodation be provided for members of Parliament. If there is to be any skimping of space or scraping to provide accommodation for others in the new buUding certainly it should not be in respect of accommodation for members, nor should accommodation for them be reduced in order to provide for someone else. It would be better to erect another buUding close to the chamber itself for use by members of Parliament or for the parliamentary staff and the people who provide the ancUlary services for the operation of the ParUament. Not only is there a lack of accommodation here but also there are difficulties back in the electorate. I am fortunate in that I have a new office in the heart of my electorate. For that I am extremely thankful. But if a member is to do his job properly I firmly believe that he must have In respect of secretarial staff in this ParUa-",72,Bills

But there are simply not enough secretarial services available to the ordinary member to fulfil all the work that he requires to be done. It has been suggested that there should be a pool system of secretarial staff which would mean an expanded pool system compared with what we now have. I do not think we ought to accept that proposition for one minute. I think the proper thing is fbr each member of Parliament to have his own secretarial assistance that he can call upon at any time. He should not be put in the invidious position of lining himself up in a queue. The same idea applies in respect of a proposal for research assistance. I think it was the honourfind out what the thinking is within the electorate able member for Perth( Mr Berinson) who briefly touched on this and suggested the same kind of tning. AgainI beheve it is totally inadequate for a member of Parliament to have to line up in a queue to get some research assistance. As the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has said, the Parliamentary Library staff do a wonderful job but how can they satisfy all the demands of members of Parliament? They cannot. When one looks at the range of very sigcould nificant legislation that is brought before this fore it, such as the National Compensation Bill, Order! The honourable member's time has the Family Law Bill and the National Parks and expired. Wildlife Conservation Bill.

Firstly, you, Mr Deputy Chairman, one have been brought into this House. I mention of our most senior Liberals in this place and a them as some that immediately come to mind bemember of the Standing Orders Committee cause of my interest in them. But I cannot posraised this matter last night. You said, and I sibly cope with the work that I would like to do agreed with you, that there is much room for upon the various Bills hat I have mentioned. improvement in the procedure of question time. The National Compensation Bill is a massive You mentioned various aspects such as the piece of legislation which has far reaching conselength of questions and in particular the unquences within the community.

I beUeve that there who have direct access to them and who are rewould appear on the face of it to be considerable sponsible to the individual members. I could merit in the suggestion. I have always found it engage two or three quaUfied people to look at the BUlsI have mentioned and come up with suggestions for me. I would expect them to be able to make a much more effective contribution to the operation of this Parliament. But apart from that, back in one's electorate, where I beUeve that a member of ParUament must be a representative of the people within his electorate, how can he represent them when he has only one person to do the typing for him, to answer the telephone and take account of the daUy correspondence that comes in? Every member needs more people to back him up at home so that those people can go out into the electorate and on specific issues as well as the attitudes and the opinion of his people, because they are his people whUst he remains their member of the House. Unless he knows fully what those attitudes, views and opinions are, then he cannot represent them effectively in Parliament. If we had that kind of representation then I believe that some of the trenchant criticisms that are heaped upon the party system of government would be overturned because the member would be more truly a representative of the people and system. more effectively operate within the party I notice that the Leader of the House( Mr notice paper now a proposal that some Senate Ministers",73,Bills
214,Parliament One Sees Bills Which Are Currently Bethe Deputy Chairman ( Mr Drury),,74,Bills
215,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) (4.17),"We haveincomprehensible that Ministers in the Senate representing a Minister in this place should be questioned, sometimes at great length, for some hours, about a department when, with the best will in the world and the hardest work in the world, they cannot know fully the ins and outs of that department. But unless the Ministers from the House ofRepresentatives give better answers in the Senate than they give in the House of Representatives then I do not think the Senate will be much better off. I think that at a time like this we should not only consider some minor change of that nature but also look at the whole aspect and machinery of question time. Should we have a Westminster system? In other words, should we have questions on notice rather than, as happens here, questions without notice and questions on the notice paper? As we know, in the Westminster system notice is given of a question. This enables the Minister to check the details and get his ngures accurate. No Minister, no matter how well he knows his Department, can always have on hand every figure that he requires. I know that a considerable amount oftimeis spent by Ministers looking for example, at the daily newspapers and wondering what sort of question is likely to be asked and considering whether they have the answer to it. Time is spent which I think can on occasions ill afford to be spent. Under the Westminster system notice is given of a question. When the Minister is ready to answer it, the member who gave notice of the question says: ' I ask question No. 20' or whatever it is. The Minister reads the reply, very often prepared by the department. I was told that on one occasion a Minister had not read through the reply before he read it out and did not realise that at the end the department had written: 'We believe that a supplementary question will probably be asked by Bloggs. We find him a tedious bore'. I feel that a system like that is worth looking at because I think Ministers would be better informed, supplementary questions could be asked and members would get better answers than they get at the moment. A second question is whether adequate time is But then the Leader of the Opposition in the 27th devoted to question time. I realise that we have Parliament decided that there was some merit in nominally 45 minutes, but of course prayers and having a fantastic list of questions on notice. In petitions probably cut that down to about 40 the 27th Parliament there were all told someminutes. This week we have had a reasonably thing Uke 6,577 questions on notice, of which the good record. Yesterday 19 questions were asked Leader of the Opposition asked 2,117. I do not and on Tuesday there were 15 questions. The beUeve for a moment that he thought them all up previous week on which the Parliament sat was himself. I think that he would have been flat out not as good. On the Tuesday of that week there even signing that number. It was quite obvious were 14 questions, on Wednesday nine and on that he asked that number of questions to clutter Thursday eleven. There was a total of 34 questions in the week of which Opposition members asked eighteen. Of those 18, of course, the Leader and Deputy Leader of the 2 Opposition Parties asked half. That left 9 questions to be divided amongst the 57 members of this Parliament on the Opposition side who are not entitled to a call everytimethey stand. It is not difficult to work out that at this rate they are able to ask one question about every 6A sitting weeks. But of l course the Parliament does not sit for 2 weeks in every six so that would mean they would be able to ask one question every 2 calendar months. That is simply not adequate under any standard. SoI believe something should be done to see that adequate time is made available for questions. There are various ways in which this could be done. Thefirstis to see whether we can cut out some of the excessively long answers which you mentioned, Mr Deputy Chairman, in particular. Looking through Hansard for the last 2 sitting weeks I found that answers taking 4'A to 5 minutes were not uncommon. We have limits imposed on the length of most speeches. Why should there not be a limit on the length of answers at question time. If necessary Ministers can give supplementary written replies or make a statement after question time. We know that very often question time is used by a government to make statements. Dorothy Dix questions are handed around to members on the Government side in reply to which a Minister makes a statement which he could just as well make after question time. Then, of course, we are asked to put questions on notice. This is farcical. As I pointed out yesterday, I have had questions on the notice paper for about a year, although only a small number of them, because I do not believe in cluttering up the notice paper. When the Parliament was dissolved I put them on the notice paper again. The Minister to whom they were directed has no intention of giving me answers to those questions and there is nothing I can do to get them. In the old days when a member put a question on the notice paper, as you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, he received an answer fairly quickly. up the machinery of government. A large statement and are not prepared to face a subnumber of questions on notice does clutter up the sequent debate on it. machinery of government, because if Ministers are to prepare answers they must divert unof this ParUament. If any businessman connecessarily members of their department from ducted a fish shop with the efficiency with which working on more important matters. I have said that we should get answers. Should would go broke as quickly as we are all going there be a limit on the time taken to give ansbroke under the present Labor Party Governwers? I have said that this could be done. ment. I do not necessarily blame the Parliament Perhaps2 minutes would be quite long enough. for what is happening in Australia today but if It would be quite easy for the Clerk at the table the electors of Australia realised how inefficient to turn on a machine which would show when an organisation was this House, they would the 2 minutes were up.

Consequently the honourable member's problems are not great in that respect. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) mentioned questions on notice and things of that nature. I might have been in a Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet different ParUament from hun but I remember some lengthy delays and some lengthy repUes to questions. On one occasion 2 of our members had questions on the notice paper for two fuU ParUaments. I think the time of the second ParUament expired before the questions were answered. I think the honourable member would have been on much better ground had he not had such a sorry record with his Ministry. It probably was not so much that the questions were not answered but the answers were really awful. Consequently not only were they delayed but also they were unacceptable when we received them. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) said that a businessman in a second rate fish shop would not run this Parliament Uke it is being run. I am pretty pleased we do not have the businessmen from Cambridge Credit, Leyland or Mainline runnning the Parliament otherwise we might all be out of work in a very short time. To say that businessmen run everyment. I thank honourable members for what has been said in a very constructive debate. Some politics were introduced, which is inevitable. On the question of facUitiesI wUl keep in mind what has been done and in every way try to meet the wishes of honourable members. I still agree that a considerable expansion can be made in regard to staff, travel facilities and things of that nature. Those demands are not unreasonable. I appreciate that honourable members in country districts are entitled to additional secretarial assistance. 1 was in agreement with the Tribunal's report which would have given members certain opportunities for travelling allowances in respect of their activities. I am not unmindful of the huge areas of the electorates of Kalgoorlie and the Northern Territory and other electorates in far western mands made on them which must impose great strain not only on their physical capacity but also Proposed expenditure agreed to. Proposed expenditure, $88,851,000. Department of the Special Minister of State Proposed expenditure, $66,296,000. Although it may seem unusual in relation to estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to be discussing matters relating to child care, such is now the case. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has assumed the responsibility for matters relating to child care. I intend to refer specifically to the appropriation of $187,000 to establish an interim committee for the Children's Commission. Child care undoubtedly is a very important matter. This is recognised, I believe, by members on both sides of the chamber. There is a great and growing concern in the commumty that child care should, firstly, be made available to those people who have a real need but ought to be available also to any woman and to any family wishing to have facilities for minding their children if those people wish to be employed or wish to exercise some freedom of choice in regard to working or undertaking other activities. I am not complaining that moneys are allocated for child care or for child care facilities. I note that in the Budget an appropriation of $75m was made for child care. It is important to observe the rather brief history that we have seen in this area. It is of some anguish to me. Honourable members will recall that in 1972 the Child Care Act was introduced into this Parliament. Certain development was undertaken and certain programs were developed to meet special needs. I note particularly the special needs in the Dundas Valley in my own electorate that were being met. The Telopea Church of Christ was establishing a child care centre with a grant pursuant to this Act. Unfortunately the area was not clear from the point of view of what would happen and what programs would be developed. We saw a multitude of reports. We saw firstly, the Fry report of the Pre-Schools Committee. Secondly, we saw the report of the Social Welfare Commission and more recently, and thirdly, the report of the Priorities Review Staff. It was certainly clear that the Government did not know where it was going, did not know what programs it wished to adopt and did not know which Ministers should be responsible for the administration of programs. The Priorities Review Staff report was designed to tie together a lot of these loose ends and problems and to reach a solution. The solution offered was to set up another commission, another committee. Honourable members will recall that on 22 July it was indicated that the proposed programs for child care promised in the April policy speech of the Prime Minister could not be introduced. In fact it was said that they would be postponed until 1975-76 in terms of the administration of the Government's promises in the policy speech of the Prime Minister in April 1974. As a result of the great public concern the Government became aware of the need to review its policies in this area once more. We therefore saw in this Budget the grant of $75m, presumably to meet the need. But although the need is there and is evident to everybody, the program was not available. There was no program to be administered. So the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen), who is now in the chamber presumably to deal with these matters, made a ministerial statement on 19 September in which he detailed the reasons for the establishment of the Children's Commission. What he said was that an interim committee would be formed ultimately to establish the Commission which will take over responsibility for administering all existing commitments in the areas of child care and pre-schools, and will immediately set to work to enable a substantial beginning to be made on the new program no later than January 1975. I think that statement made it quite clear that there was no program to be administered and that an organisation had to be created to bring into operation a program to meet the great public demand that I know exists. But what has been the effect of the establishment of another commission? I draw the attention of honourable members to a report titled 'Social Issues News Statement' by the Brotherhood of St Laurence commenting on the child care proposals. In paragraph 3 the author of the statement, David Scott, states: The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy making and the administrauon of child care and family welfare programs. It will also create a precedent for establishing other commissions with execuuve functions to provide services fbr other age groups or people with specific categories of handicap. The trend should be to integrate and not fragment family and child care programs. He went on to say: The Government should be aware of the diffculties created by a semi-autonomous commission with policy making funcuons which has to rely on Public Service departments to implement its policies. This division of responsibility leads to delays, confusion, cumbersome procedures and can encourage misunderstandings and conflicts between the policy making commission and the executive departments. He concluded by saying: If the Government proceeds on its present course of action, it will fragment policy making and administration, create confusion and slow down the introduction of urgently needed, locally-based child care services. It has become evident from the way in which this program is being administered in my own electorate that the real problems are being",77,Bills
219,Mr Ruddock (Parramatta) (4.42),"overlooked and this commission is being used as a means to fob off important developments that ought to be occurring. I mention the first child care centre that was to have been established in my electorate in the Dundas Valley at Telopea, a housing commission area which certainly has self-evident and widely acknowledged social problems. Tbis centre was designed by the Telopea Church of Christ and in accordance with standards supervised formerly by the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley). A grant was made available. This worthy group of people that is endeavouring to open a child care facility in January of next year has found that it is almost impossible for a church working in the area with limited facilities to be able to gather together the funds necessary for it to commence operations from the completed centre. The group sought through a letter to the Mimster for Education, who was formerly responsible for the administration of these programs, a grant for the establishment of personnel in the centre. When I talk of a grant for the establishment I mean funds to meet the costs in the initial period before fees and before the government subsidies that will be payable towards the salaries of omcers start to flow to the church committee. Of course the obvious answer in the past was that an organisation such as this that would receive government funds by way of subsidy should go to a bank and get an overdraft to see it through. As Reverend J. Bacik for the management committee of the Telopea Church of Christ Child Care Centre has pointed out, it is not possible in the present economic climate for the organisation to go to its bank and to borrow funds for this purpose. The apphcation to the Minister for EducationI beUeve it was back in July-for an estabhshment grant has been fobbed off, by a reply which stated that there is no provision under the present Act whereby such grants could be made avaUable. The Telopea Church of Christ wrote to the Special Mmister of State on 4 October and mentioned specificaUy the problem that it is suffering. The answer received to date is that this matter has been referred to the interim committee. This child care centre has to be operating by next January. I beUeve there is no way that a committee or a commission not directly responsible to this ParUament can act fast enough when matters are referred to it for report in this way, and bring about a situation where the chtid care centre in Telopea and the many others that are seeking to be operational next year will be able to function and be functioning to meet these urgent needs that are evident to us all. ise very greatly with the problems which the dock) has just been outtining. They occur in his electorate as they do in my electorate and in many other electorates across the country where expanding urban populations and increasing numbers of working mothers are creating the demand for child care centres. But I think the complaints which he raised in the latter part of his speech are a very clear example of the way in which members of the Opposition often want to have things both ways. When the allocation of funds for facUities such as child care centres is determined by Government departments under direct rninisterial control, the complaint of the Opposition is always that political patronage is being exercised and wUl become the basis on which facUities are made avaUable. In this instance, as in so many other areas in which the Government is allocating substantial funds for social amenities, we have chosen to set up an independent, expert, investigatory, recommendatory and advisory committee which wUl ultimately become a commission. In other words, we have made sure that the aUocation of funds for chUd care centres and pre-school centres wtil be determined on an expert and impartial basis. And the honourable member for Parramatta criticises us on that score. As I said before, this was a very clear instance of members of the Opposition wanting to have it both ways, being prepared to jump on the Government in whichever direction it moves, to say the Government is damned ifit does and damned ifit does not. The foreshadowed establishment of the ChUdren 's Commission, the appointment of the interim committee for this Commission, and the initiation of the national pre-school education and chtid care services program is a momentous step forward in the social history of Australia. It began in the face of a very real demand indeed. Honourable members wUl be aware that no fewer than 365,000 Australian children under 6 years of age have mothers who are engaged fulltimein the work force and that there are places available in chtid care centres at present for no more than 34,500 of those chUdren. What is more, those 34,500 places which are avaUable are very often administered and financed under present conditions by charitable organisations, municipalities and the Uke which are operating under conditions of greatfinancialstringency. It is no exaggeration to say that if the Australian Government were not stepping in to fill the breach the number of places avaUable, far from increasing, would be very likely to decline.",79,Bills

221,Honourable Member For Parramatta ( Mr Rud,"On the pre-school education side, the position is almost as bad. While it is most difficult to obtain precise pre-school education statistics for Austraha as a whole, it seems certain that the position is still one in which there is a pre-school place available for fewer than one in every four of the children whose parents would wish to take advantage of it ifit were there. It is notorious that pre-school education has become available most readily in the areas where the need for it is least acute, that is, it is in predominantly affluent areas where the people are already sufficiently highly educated to appreciate the value of pre-school centres that those centres are being provided. It is those areas of the inner and western suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney and certain rural areas where the overwhelming majority of our low income families or our non-English speaking migrant families are concentrated which lack proper provision for pre-school education. The Government is presently setting out to remedy both of these deficiencies in our social arrangements. It is the aim of the Government to see within half a dozen years that there is a place in a pre-school centre free of charge for every child whose parents want to take advantage of it and that there is a place in a child care facility of one kind or another available for every child whose parents want to take advantage of it, at a charge related to incomehigh standard, as the honourable member for out of their homes to work on the basis that the Darling Downs interjects.

I am always a little surprised to hear members problemssuch as the honourable member for Parramatta complain that undertakings such as the child Order!

The honourable member for Parthis country is being railroaded. Expenditure by ramatta is well aware that it took many years of this Department in 1973-74 was $53.855m. This urging on the part of members who now sit on year the proposed expenditure has increased to this side of the Committee before the last $88.85lm. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) Government moved in the matter of pre-school education and child care at all and that, indeed, it was only in the last year of office of the former Liberal-Country Party Administration that a child care program was launched. Significantly, it was launched under the administration of the then Minister for Labour and National Service. It was tied very strictly and very exclusively to the idea that more and more women should be encouraged to go back into the work force. It was purely a facility for working mothers. The concern of the present Government is a good deal more comprehensive than that. While we recognise on the one hand that there is an enormous number of mothers in this community who are obUged to go out to work by economic circumstances and who have a pressing need for chUd care centres, equally there is an enormous number of women in the community who would simply welcome an occasional break away from their famUies. That is why we are emphasising the provision not only of full time day care centres but also of occasional day care centres, of play groups organised on a voluntary basis under expert guidance and supervision, and a variety of other forms of child care. I must say that one of the examples which has commended itself most to me is the program being implemented by the City of Knox on a project basis-famU y day care.

But time is running out for them. The appointment with the greatest political overtones was the appointment of Mr John Menadue as Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As I am reminded by the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Menadue is a former private secretary to Mr Whitlam and a defeated Labor candidate at the 1966 Federal elections. I object on behalf of the electors of Darling Downs to the appointment of people like Mr Grassby to a plum job, newly created, with negligible responsibUity and doubtful value, after he has beenflooredby the democratic count in an election campaign. I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Riverina( Mr SulUvan) who has displayed in this House the gentlemanly characteristics that the people of Riverina want in their representative in this ParUament.

Honourable members wtil note that there is no indication on page 89 of Appropriation BUl (No. 1) 1974-75 of the amount spent on salaries and payments in the nature of salary. I take it that that is intended so as not to let us know approximately how many people are employed by that Organisation from year to year. I think that is wrong. If there were a sudden increase or decrease in the number of people employed by ASIO I think it is important that the ParUament should know about it. The Parliament should be entitled to ask questions about ASIO in relation to general issues and the sort of work it is doing. I deplore the fact that the Government, which was elected on the basisI strongly support that basis-of open government as far as possible, does not co-operate more in relation to this item. In passing I mention the item in division 430 which relates to state funerals. I note that last year an amount of $9,000 was appropriated for state funerals and that $8,346 of the appropriation was expended. This year the appropriation is for only $2,400. days. introduction of the Government's health scheme that there is a more optimistic approach to the subject of state funerals. I hope that whoever is responsible for setting thefigureis right. In relation to the subject of the conveyance of the Governor General by aircraft, I notice that the appropriation to the Royal AustraUan Air Force last year was $1,015,574 and expenditure was $1,015,573. That is nearly up to the standard of ASIO, in relation to which the appropriation and the expenditure are exactly the same. I titink it is a pity if that is not reaUy an accurate figure. I turn to division 447, which relates to the Prices Justification Tribunal. I congratulate the Government on establishing the Prices Justification Tribunal. I think that generaUy speaking it is making a good job of a very difficult position, particularly in view of the debate about the powers of the Tribunal. I think it important that there should not be any suggestion that things are not completely above board as far as the Prices Justification Tribunal is concerned. In that connection I note that the Prices Justification Tribunal normally deals with appUcations concerning Sydney companies in Sydney and Melbourne companies in Melbourne but that the application in relation to the Fairfax organisationa Sydney organisation-wa s dealt with in Melbourne. Because the hearings by the Prices Justification Tribunal of the appUcation by the Fairfax organisation were held in Melbourne it was much more difficult for some people to participate and submit evidence in that case. I turn to the appropriations for the Department of the Special Mmister of State, which appear at page 1.13 of Appropriation BUl (No. 1). I refer in particular to the item concerning the royal commission which is inquiring into the maritime industry. I am pleased that a royal commission has been set up by the Government on the initiative of the Mmister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) to inquire into this matter. I know some of the people who are mvolved in the royal commission and I have tice Sweeney and Mr R. St. John, QC. I have one reservation and it is a significant reservation. Bemg one who feels very strongly that the trade union movement should, as far as possible, be a separate organisationa completely separate entityI think that the Government should have as Uttle power over the trade union movement as possible. If we want to preserve Uberty in a democracy we must insist that in a pluraUst society the different sources of power have as much power as possible. Therefore I deplore one of the terms of reference of that royal commission. I refer to the one concerning the legaUty of the payments or demands and their propriety having regard in particular to AustraUan trade union principles and ethics. Superficially that may be a very simple and reasonable thing to ask a royal commission to decide, but I do not feel that a royal commissioner should decide the ethics and principles of the trade union movement in AustraUa. I have the utmost confidence in the royal commissioner in this respect but I think that it is a wrong precedent to set to leave it to a non-member of a particular organisation somehow to decide fundamentaUy the principles and ethics of the trade union movement of Australia.

I pay tribute to the Special Minister of State( Mr Ministers. Today he went so far as to say that Lionel Bowen), who is at the table, for his presence in the chamber. I criticise the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) for his absence from the chamber. Surely it is a primary responsibUity of any Minister to be in the House of Parliament in which he sits when the estimates for his Department are being debated so that he can hear the views being put forward by honourable members. The debate on the Estimates is one of the few occasions on which the representauves of the people have the opportunity of asking questions and commenting upon the many items that make up the Estimates. I would Uke to know what is of greater importance to the Prime Minister than being present today in the chamber of the ParUament of which he is a member. Franklin, who is a supporter of the Government, says that he is away water skting. I hardly think that is Ukely. It is more likely that he is at a museum and more likely still to be at a museum overseas. This brings me to the first point I want to make. As the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) wUl know, the Prime Minister or his Department was good enough to provide honourable members with some short notes on various items which are covered in this vote. I can comment briefly on some of them only because I have only 10 minutes in which to speak. FirstlyI support and join with those who criticised the Prime Minister's too many visits overseas and, what is of course of much more importance, his extended absences from this country. I certainly believe that a Prime Minister should travel overseas to attend important conferences. But these conferences need to be impor-. tant because there are many other demands on the Prime Minister's time. I do not believe that it is necessary for him to go away as much as he has. Also, I do not beUeve it is necessary for him to visit all of the tourist attractions that he has visited. If he wants to see tourist attractions he should visit AustraUan tourist attractions equally. But it is certainly of the utmost importance to the country and its people that he spends more time addressing himself to the main problems that affect this country, and the major problem that affects this country today is our economy-the condition of stagflation which the Prime Minister in his own speeches has admitted to be the main problems facing his Government. He is away too much and he attempted to defend himself when questioned about this at question time today and yesterday by making a lot of misrepresentations about the visits and activities of former Prime some former Prime Minister had spent much more time than he did at WUUamsburg in the United States of America. I do not know whether the Prime Minister was referring to Sir Robert Menzies when he said that. Sir Robert Menzies, of course, was in residence at the Richmond university there for many months, but he was not the Prime Minister at the time. He gave 6 very erudite lectures in that historic place in the United States which were recognised by scholars",84,Bills

He was there as a former Prime Minister and consititutional authority. We have the spectacle of the Prime Minister making these misrepresentations day after day. Mr Deputy Chairman, I do not wish to introduce a matter which is not the subject of the estimates we are now considering but I would just like to mention that the Prime Minister yesterday, when speaking of the Baltic States, gave an illustration that disproved his case and did not substantiate it. One can speak of the standard in which he lives in this country and travels overseas. No one denies that he must have adequate facilities and advisers. But consider the vast entourage that he takes with him when he goes overseas; the apparently limitless chartering of aircraft; the keeping of a residence in Canberra and in Sydney which are manned all the time by servants; and the purchasing of the second largest Mercedes car that was available after he had said when he was elected to office that a Galaxy LTD would be good enough for him. All of this shows a recklessness of conduct and an irresponsibility in the expenditure of pubhc funds whichhave? Do not be such a knocker. if the honourable member is interested. But the point I am making is that the Prime Minister says that the Government's policy is one ofeconomic restraint, but what we see is just the reverse. The Prime Minister has set up a lifestyle, to use the modern jargon, in a most expensive way and he does not Umit himself at all in time or in facUities which go far, far beyond what any Prime Minister would need. Page1 of the document prepared by the Prime Minister or his Department, which I mentioned earUer, refers to the creation of 107 new positions in the Department of the Prime Minister and 45 more which I gather at present are vacant. Page 12 of the document refers to the acquisition of art. I just briefly say that if art is to be acquired surely considerable emphasis should be put on encouraging Australian art and large sums should not be spent on a few pieces of overseas art when there are so many pieces of art avaUable here. There is a reference on page 14 to the entertainment of heads of State and other dignitaries to AustraUa. I agree with such expenditure. But I beUeve it is going a bit far for the Prime Minister to stand here as he has and say to members of the Commonwealth ParUament: ' I have invited you to my function and you wUl behave in the way that I set down'. After all we are being invited to a pubUc occasion which is being paid for by public money. Mr KellyI thought he was paying for it himself. impression that he was paying for it himself. In fact the taxpayers are paying for it. People are invited to the function because of the office they hold and not because of his generosity. Page 21 of the document gives the last instalment of the cost of the survey to determine the national anthem and everyone in this country who has taken an interest in this matter knows the survey was cooked. says, it was a farce. The survey was not fair but it did cost a lot of money. I refer briefly to the fact that the Government since it first was elected to office has set up approximately 110 commissions for the purpose of mvestigating. We must be the most investigated country of all time. But this is perhaps the least important thing. The important tiling is that the Government's legislative program is so full, so packed and so overflowing that it has no hope, even if it intends to do so, of bringing in for decades thefindingsof these commissions. BUl after BUl has been brought into this Parliament in haste and the backlog is tremendous. In many cases legislation has been poorly drafted. We in this place and then senators in the other place have had to look at this legislation and have it amended. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) must have the course record in this respect because I think that every BUl he has brought in here has had to have the heart cut out of it as a result of its being found to be completely impractical. The chambers have the role to look at such legislation and certainly the Senate has a role to review it. The fact of the matter is that the Government is trying to do too much too quickly. This is where I disagree with the poUtical phUosophy of the Government and the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister beUeves that progress should be made in certain areas he should bring in the relevant legislation at a pace at which it can be digested here and in the country. The legislation should be thought out before any attempt is made to have it implemented. If the Prime Minister avoids making such a mess of things",85,Bills

I must refer briefly to that part of the 1973-74 annual report of the Auditor-General which deals with the AustraUan CouncU for the Arts. Some very critical comments were made in this area in the report. Some of them were: No procedures or instructions for uniform processing of grants; conditions applying to grants inadequately stated; inadequate support for expenditure from grants suppUed by organisations; evidence of expenditure from grants for the benefit of the CouncU for the Arts rather than to grantee organisations; grants used for payment of staff engaged on duties for CouncU or boards; and so on. I would like to quote from a papagraph which appears on page 191 of the report which states: Numerous unsatisfactory features and errors were located in the accounts for travelling allowances and similar payments made to members of the Council and the Boards and to members of the staff. The incidence of error disclosed by the audit indicates an unsatisfactory standard of accounting. I beUeve that so much has been said pubUcly about waste, the high administrative costs, the high expense accounts by administrators in this area and about too Utde getting through to the artists and the performers, that it is time that the Prime Minister himself-it is his responsibilitydid something to have tnis matter cleaned up. FinaUyI join with those who have criticised the Government's poUcy to make the PubUc Service, as they are attempting to do in other fields, a poUtical arm of the Government instead of recognising the great tradition in the PubUc Service of independent advice that is given to the government of the day. Mr Menadue who is partisan in favour of the AustraUan Labor Party has been appointed to the Prime Minister's Department by the Government. This appointment is breaking down the system. The Prime Minister is apparently impervious to the rightful criticism which thinking people have made of that decision. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. this debate quite a bit of petty criticism about the Prime Mmister( Mr Whitlam). In fact criticism has been made to such an extent that I wonder whether the contrast between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) is not putting a Uttle bit of green eye on the other side of the House. There were also one or two nights of fancy from members of the AustraUan Country Party in regard to the Prime Minister not bemg accepted or acceptable in the countries he has visited. This is atypical of Country Party flights of fancy. I wish to refer to that part of the estimates for the Department of the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen) which concerns the Grants Commission. Local government bodies, as aU honourable members will know, are being caUed upon to play an ever-increasing role in our community, and rightly so, because this is the level of government closest to the people. It is regrettable that over recent years, due to pressure of finance, loans and repayments, councils and councUlors have been forced into bemg more business oriented rather than community oriented. The involvement of the community in determining their own destiny and planning their own future in their cities is or has been declining at a time when it should be on the increase. All councUs would welcome, and many do welcome, more and more communication with their ratepayers and more and more help with the numerous problems that councUs now have to face. The years when garbage, roads, parks and gardens were all that councils had to deal with are gone forever. They are now involved in providing a huge range of social welfare services on a very closely integrated basis. They are heavUy involved in preservation of the environment as their ratepayers become more conscious of the problems of poUution. Garbage disposal in 1974 is no longer just emptying bins and driving the trucks to the tip. It is becoming a problem of a lack of avaUable holes and the need for destructors. Councils are now providing open space for recreation, adventure playgrounds for chUdren, increased parklands and gardens, and as their role in society has changed dramatically over the past years their opportunities for raising money have stayed back in the Victorian era. They have been starved offinancefor many years, and they were the level of government consistently ignored by the Opposition when its members were in government. I was interested to hear the honourable member for DarUng Downs speak of how the grants should be allocated to local councUs. One would think that the previous Government which he supported could have found out how to do so in the 23 years during which it had an opportunity to allocate grants but did not care to do so. Despite that period of 23 years in office when the present Opposition could have set up a scheme of assistance for local governing bodies it preferred to give sympathy",86,Bills

It is only since Labor was elected that any attempt has been made to give practical help to local government to meet the increasing demands which are made upon it. Labor has consistently tried to elevate the status of local government and the recent grants recommended by the Grants Commission which are included in these estimates confirm this. An amount of $56.3m has been distributed throughout councils in AustraUa. I point out that this money was distributed by the Grants Commission which is autonomous and the claims that have been made throughout the country that there are poUtical overtones and political patronage are an insult to the Chairman of the Commission.

Local governments have very great need for this money and the sooner they get it the better they will be able to conduct their affairs. Now they are able to proceed only on the expectation of receiving the money. That is not the matter about which I intend to talk. These estimates are for the Prime Minister's Department. As is well known, the Prime Minister's Department is a rather grab bag Department and embraces a large number of outrider organisations, including such diverse tilings as the Industries Assistance Commission and even the Children's Commission. I assume that the Children's Commission is to go into the Prime Minister's Department. I did not find anything in the Estimates about appointed to conduct these affairs. It is for the any site for a monument for the Prime Minister Parliament expressing the public will to set down ( Mr Whitlam). After the way he has been talking these guidelines. To question at this stage the lately I would have thought it would have been a way in which the funds are bemg distributed is a prime requirement ofhis Department to locate a very necessary exercise, because it is only suitable site for his monument. It has been through wide-ranging pubUc debate that those to suggested that he wanted it to be in a holy place whom falls the task of distributing the funds will and when they examined the price he said: be guided. I am quite sure that those people 'Well, that is far too high a price to pay. After all, would welcome guidance. I am only going to be there 3 days'. But the old story is one which has certainly got a ring of truth disappointing and has tended to centre around about it these days. I do not think the Governpersonalities rather than the substance of what ment of AustraUa is going to be advantaged by we expect of our creative talent in this area. It is these sorts of claims.

Nor wtil I not spend time criticising and, therefore, there must be flexibUity in the the purchases of tea sets supposedly on loan from length of appointment of administrators to the Crafts Board, but I wUl question the desired objective of an Australian arts policy. The total allocation in this Budget for the arts exceeds $31m and increase of more than $10m, almost 50 per cent. An amount of $7.7m has been aUocated for the Australian National Gallery and collection, and $4.6m of this is for the acquisition of works for the National Gallery and the remainder for the construction of the National Gallery. An amount of $20m has been set aside for the funding of programs under the AustraUan CouncU for the Arts. The money involved is a very significant amount. I have supported the provision of that amount. At this point in the development of public patronage of the arts in AustraUa, it is of the utmost importance that Parliament clearly defines the objectives it feels the community wishes to see pursued.

How will we not get criticism? will not be criticism about items purchased; what I am saying is that when money is spent, the way it is allocated and the way the grants are adniinistered should be beyond criticism. If we spend amounts of $ 14m it is obvious that there is a need to see that there can be no questions about the way the money was spent. We do not want to see a situation such as that which developed in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs over the way lavishly provided funds were expended. I tliink this is not an unreasonable request to put to the Prime Mimster and the officers responsible for administering the Council for the Arts. I comment now on a few of the points to which the Auditor-General referred. One of his comments was that the nnancial statements supplied by some organisations were inadequate as regards accounting for grants received. This is a matter of great concern because a lot of money is at stake and if we cannot ensure that the funds are being adequately adniinistered and that the administration is beyond reproach we are heading for a dangerous situation. In another paragraph the Auditor-General says: There was also evidence that arrangements had been made with some grantee organisations for the expenditure of funds from the grant at the direction of the Council or a Board for its own purposes and not for the purposes of the grantee organisation. This is starting to smack awfully.much of the situation that developed in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It has occurred in other instances beforehand and I think we should all be aware of this factor and make every effort to ensure that it does not happen again. As a smaller example, and with due deference to my friend the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) who is interested in the musical side of life, an amount of $27,000 was made available by way of grant to the Musica Viva Society for the purpose of paying the salaries of three trainee adrninistrative and three secretarial staffemployed by the Music Board. The Auditor General states: The terms of the grant to the Musica Viva Society approved by the Minister were 'Training scheme for professional art administrators'. This is the type of area where we are starting to get into problems. In this instance the grant was $27,000.1 dare say that in time, if things are not quickly brought into line, it will be $270,000, and other significant sums of money will show up as having been improperly administered. When we are talking about estimates I think it is imponant to keep in perspective just what are estimates. They are amounts of money made available to departments under specific headings. They are supposed to be adniinistered properly. When they are being sought they have to be sought as a result of submissions and bids which are as accurate as can be foreseen in the circumstances. A fair degree of responsibility must be exercised by the departments, councils and other bodies which are in a position of receiving funds from the Government, to see that moneys are administered wisely and that no suggestion of criticism can be levelled against those responsible for them. pose the Press has had more of a field day than it has had over the last 12 or 18 months at the expense of the Council for the Arts and the purchases of art from overseas. The Press has been stimulated by our colleagues in the barnyard section of the chamber and in general from the other side of the chamber. It is Australian ockerism at its very worse. A similar sort of thing happened back in the days of the Opera House when the New South Wales Labor Government was lambasted in every way shape and form by the New South Wales Liberal and Country Party ockers as wasters and spenders of money. But as the Opera House emerged members of the New South Wales Liberal and Country Parties were prancing up and down with royalty proudly boasting of what they had done for Australian Art. We see exactly the same sort of thing spurred on by the less responsible sections of the Press. There was a headline in the 'Melbourne Herald'-the sort of paper from which we would have expected something better-whic h stated: 'We will spend an extra $77,000 on that woman'. Other headlines were:' ""Painted Ceiling"" here on approval' and 'Gallery's next buy $1.35m'. These are some of the milder headlines. It is a great time for the cartoonists. Like many members of this House, I suppose, I do not propose to have any great knowledge of art. I try in my limited way to appreciate it. I regret very much that my education as a child at a number of schools, both country and city, was sadly neglected in this area. I wish I had had more education in this field at school and after school. I think it is one of the cheapest forms of pohtics that is being played now with this area in which the Australian Government has shown new initiatives.

277,Mr Cohen (Robertson) (6.5),"I do not supthey want to do that with the possibility of winning a few votes they should go right ahead. When the National Art Gallery openshopefully it will be one of the finest art galleries in the WorldI am sure honourable members opposite will be justifiably proud of that gallery and the works of art in it as they were of the Opera House. I have heard the suggestion that we might buy Picasso's 'Guernica'. I do not know whether the suggestion is realistic. I recall when in New York last year that there was one thing the family with which I was staying wanted to show me, and it was that work of art. It is one of the great works of art, possibly Picasso's greatest. I hope that the rumour in the newspaper is a reaUty. I have no doubt it wUl cost a hell of a lot more than 'Blue Poles'. Probably it wUl cost enough to send our Country Party coUeagues squawking from the barnyards in a way we have never seen before. I notice that some of our coUeagues from the other side of the Chamber have constantly reiterated, as I think some Queensland art critic has said, that we ought to be spending the money on Australian art. Let us look at what has been done. From the beginning of the national collection until 1971-72 works of AustraUan art dominated the acquisition program. Between 1965-66 and 1971-72 some $834,365 out of a total of $1,185,180 was spent on AustraUan art-abou t 70.4 per cent. Between 1969-70 and 1972-73 an average of $201,610 was spent. That was mostly in the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. In 1973-74, under this Government, spending on AustraUan art acquisitions for the National Gallery rose to $374,291. HopefuUy that refutes the stupid allegations and the half-witted comments made by some previous speakers, in particular the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) who made great play on this matter. Again it was cheap politics, probably good poUtics, but not strictly an honest collection of the facts. I understand that other members of the Committee have been interested in what is happening. They have a lot of other things to occupy their minds in poUtics and perhaps they have not paid as much attention to the program as they should have but because, I suppose, of criticism and pubhcity wbich the program has received we have taken the time and trouble to contact the CouncU. I understand the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Ruddock) recently visited the CouncU for the Arts. I have arranged to be the guest of Dr Battersby when she returns from her forthcorning trip. I want to have the program fuUy explained to me because I am particularly interested in what it means not only to Australia but also to the people I represent. My electorate is one of the major growth centres of AustraUa. Some 80,000 adults Uve there. It is a provincial area between Sydney and Newcastle lacking any recognisable facUities for cultural performances, art displays or exhibitions of any type. I want to see in what way the Council for the Arts can bring forward these works upon which we have spent a considerable amount. I have an interesting report which shows that some very exciting and attractive programs are on the way. I should like to seeI think this is true of most of the people I represent-wha t we can receive by way of exhibitions, displays and so on in the central coast area of GosfordWyong. I am sure that is true of most honourable members here. I am sure it is true of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Lusher). I am sure he probably would benefit as much as I did from a visit to the CouncU for the Arts. It is important that the people involved with the CouncU for the Arts do not forget the provincial areas such as Gosford-Wyong and Newcastle, and hopefully when it is discovered how desperately short we are of facUitiesGriffithhave to draw the Une somewhere. I know from talking with Dr Battersby that quite a number of sponsored programs are visiting parts of AustraUa but, as has been pointed out, there is a great shortage of faciUties in these areas. Perhaps the next part of our program ought to be to build facUities in these areas so that people can share them. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) made an important point. I noticed a lot of lularity on the other side of the chamber when he said that the purchase of 'Blue Poles' and 'WomanV has created tremendous interest. I understand people are going along in their thousands and standing and scratching their heads and saying: 'Well, I do not know what it is all about. I would not have spent that money on it.' But the important thing surely is that they are going along to look at the paintings. That is part of the beginning, I would hope, of art appreciation and an interest in art. The CouncU for the Arts has had more publicity and more discussion in the Australian Press, radio and television than probably any other department over which this",92,Bills

' Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that the Prime Minister could have delayed his visit to South East Asia, this vitally important region for Australia? The Prime Minister made that visit last February and it was the most successful visit any Australian Prime Minister has ever made to South East Asia. Earlier this year, in speaking in this Parliament, I referred to the statements made by the President of the Philippines, the Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Singapore who praised and welcomed the AustraUan Prime Mimster to their countries. They welcomed him and wished him to come back again. They were pleased to see the new relationship which had been estabUshed since the Labor Government was elected and the present Prime Minister was elected to office.

Hunt was not far behind with 23 flights at a cost of $5,700. And so it goes on. The answer printed in Hansard commences at page 2245 and I commend it to honourable gentlemen for their consideration. I conclude by saying that this Prime Minister on his last trip when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly and performed on the television program 'Meet the Press' in the United States was a great ambassador for this country. His contribution to the reputation of this country was unparalleled. It was unsurpassed by any of his predecessors. It ill behoves ignorant people to criticise now the magnificent job that this man has done for this country. speak about the Department of the Special Minister of State and particularly in regard to child care. I trust that my remarks may be considered by the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen) to be somewhat of a constructive nature. This is an area which no doubt concerns all parties represented in this chamber. I must say in my opening remarks, however, that I feel that in some ways the Minister may be a compromised Minister in that his portfolio seems more closely related to either education or social security. However, I do not wish to reflect on his personal ability. The definition of terms in this area is to my mind most difficult. Reading the publications of the Australian Government Social Welfare Commission or other documents related to the child care area, I find that the terms used seem to conflict at times. Pre-school care, child care, long-day care, play groups and many other terms are used to describe the functions of the care of young children. I would suggest to the Minister that we get firm definitions so that the general pubhc knows what is meant when these terms are used in reports or by people who are expert in the field. Furthermore, I would suggest that we use the term 'child care' to apply as it generally has and traditionally does to long term, long-day child care, where parents may leave their children at a centre from early in the morning until reasonably late in the evening, certainly for 5 days a week. No doubt honourable members are all familiar with the pre-school kindergarten system. The play groups organisation is a new organisation that is gaining great force and is perhaps the fastest growing organisation in the country. Two years ago there were no members of that organisation, and I believe there are now 15,000 cltildren involved in play groups. In reading the reports I feel that, whilst there has been great expertise brought to play in the preparation of the reports, the people who are vitally concerned have been given only a somewhat limited chance to have a say in the direction that these proposals are going. I would suggest that the Minister find the needs, look at the needs, and refer to the people who are involved so as to find out what their needs are. In particular, I would refer him to a recent initial survey done in the Blacktown-Mount Druitt area of Sydney where it was definitely indicated by mothers in a random survey that 90 per cent of mothers would like sessional care of their children or a play group situation. The long-day care to most mothers does not seem to be attractive, and this is not unusual. Mothers right across the country are the same. You cannot divide mothers or motherhood by saying that there are deprived areas or wealthy areas. Their concern for their cltildren and the young Australians that they are fostering is the same no matter where they live. I would Uke the Minister to keep this point in mind when referring to the Commission any matters in the child care area. The project care book that has been prepared has an innuendo in relation to long-day child care that it is something that will take the children, look after them and deny the parents the responsibility that is rightly theirs. In fact, in searching the booklet I found that there are sections that definitely state this. I would also refer the Minister to surveys of married women who are wives of members of the Electrical Trade Union. These surveys, done",96,Bills

It is also evidence of the success of the ciples that have been enunciated by the present policies of the Australian Labor Party led by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) ever since he tookpresent Prime Minister. I do not think that any over the leadership of the Australian Labor country has been ignored by us in the manner in Party early in 1967. Of course, they are the prin-which we approach our foreign policies. It has ciples that have come to be accepted by the ma-been made quite clear to the people of Africa, jority of the people of Australia.

So on the question of child care honourable members opposite of their countries, and that we stand for nonought to appreciate greatly what the present military intervention and for the retention of Government is doing for the women, children friendship with the countries with which we have and families of this country. I shall be very brief in my remarks on the subject of overseas trips. I agree with the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Riordan) in that I canThey are proper, constructive policies which not think of a more shallow attack upon a Primehave been consolidated by the fact that the Minister than to say that he goes overseas too Prime Minister of this country, a person who is much when problems are adding up at home andheld in great esteem throughout the world, has that the problems would not be so large if he been able to visit them personally and to speak to were to remain here. What honourable membersthem at that level. It is rather beyond compreopposite have to understand is the philosophical hension that people should come into this difference between the approach to foreign chamber and say, as a means of trying to criticise affairs of their stale, conservative government of the present Prime Minister, that he travels too 23 years and our young, enterprising governmuch. The only other point I would like to make ment of almost 2 years and the differences beabout that is that I have been led to believe from tween their and our approaches to the people ofinquiries I have madeI have not been a this world. The Liberal and Country Parties member of this chamber for very long-that never understood in all the years that they were whenever delegates are called for from the Opin office the problems of Asia and the relations position Panies for a parliamentary trip overseas that ought to exist between Australia and Asia. there is never any shortage of candidates. ApparThey continued to build their hopes on the alently the travel bug must also exist on the other liances that may have existed between ourselves side of the House. to solve their problems with military intervention. deal to heal the scars that were left by the pregovernment of our country and the governments had alliances over a long period. I do not want to be critical of the Government 's style of government and I am not going to be. The honourable member for Bennelong raised the question of political appointments being made by the Government. If kings can lose their crowns and popes can lose their thrones, surely public servants have to shift over occasionally for people from outside the Public Service. I think that the present Prime Minister has made some very excellent appointments. I think that his judgment in that area is just as good as it is in many other areas. I count myself among those he appointed during the period when I was serving outside this chamber. I know that this matter has been raised in the ParUament on a number of occasions but when one takes into account the fact that a poUtical party such as the Australian Labor Party has been out of office from 1949 to 1972 for all sorts of reasons, includthe arts and by encouraging Australian artists. ing the actions of and collaboration between the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the present Opposition Parties, one must concede that it only stands to reason that a Prime Minister coming into office after such a period would want to have serving under him a mixture of people he has worked with previously and people to whom he has been introduced after he has taken up his new post. That is very shallow criticism. I am quite sure that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden), if he were ever to serve this country as Prime Minister, would follow the lead of the present Government in terms of such appointments. It is not as if anybody has been able to stand up in this ParUament and be critical to the degree of being able to sayI leave myself out of this category-that the Government is employing incompetent people. No one has suggested that. But if honourable members opposite want to present a case on that perhaps we can argue about it. The British system of having a poUtical secretary in every Minister's office has been put up as being the ideal system. We do not want it and the Opposition does not want it. It might be a good idea in Britain. It may be a tradition in Britain, as is the appointment of parUamentary secretaries, but it is the sort of system which I think can be ruled out in AustraUa. PubUc servants are citizens of this country and they are subject to the Government of this country. If the Government of this country wants a mixture of people serving it, the Government of this country has everyrightto do so. I turn to the subject of the arts. A number of people have, unfortunately, said outside of this chamber and in this chamber that the Government can be judged as if the Prime Minister himself was travelling around the world buying paintings or as if, in effect, every painting or every object of art which the Government has purchased has become the subject of a debate in this chamber. Quite frankly, this chamber does not have the expertise for that. But this chamber ought to look at the conduct of the CouncU for the Arts or the body that may be set up by legislation to be put forward in this House in the future, to see whether it serves the community in the manner in which this Parliament wants it to serve the commumty. I reiterate what I said at the outset of this address: It ought to be done on the basis of need. If any criticism can be made of the actions of the CouncU for the Arts in the past, it is for the fact that the majority of the people of AustraUa have yet to be introduced to the arts. We are doing that by spending a great deal more money, by putting a lot more people back into There can be no doubt that in the short term a lot more AustraUans are going to have access to the arts, access to a good education and access to good government leadership by virtue of what has happened since December 1972. (8.40)-It was not my intention to speak during this debate. However this afternoon we saw the introduction of some fairly shaUow red herrings which were drawn across the trati. Perhaps the most provocative speech of all was that which was made by the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Riordan) who told us where the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) travelled in the last couple of years. His speech sounded more Uke a travelogue or someone calUng out the ports of call of Pan American Airlines. Only last Sunday an article of mine appeared in the 'Sunday Sun', the Brisbane Sunday newspaper, which I concluded by saying that I was one who normally did not get too. excited about Prime Ministerial or ministerial trips. But what I am starting to get excited about of late is the Prime Minister's tremendous sense of timing. His last trip of 17 days duration was staged at a time when the nation was yearning for leadership. It was staged at a time when the Deputy Prime Mmister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) was up with Mao Tse-tung and was visiting Peking and Hanoi If honourable members care to name any places in that region, the Deputy Prime Minister would have visited them. Our No. I man visited the United States of America, Norfolk Island, Fiji, Honolulu, Niagara FaUs and Nashville on his visit overseas. It is a wonder that he did not stay for a country and western show when he was in NashvUle after he had seen the Greek exhibition which was the purpose of his visiting that city.",98,Bills
307,Mr Donald Cameron (Griffith),"I come back to the point that I was making. The Prime Minister's sense of timing is completely out. Last January and February supporters of the Government were vocal in their criticism of the Prime Minister because he made a trip to Indonesia at a time when this country was in the middle of the greatest disaster ever to confront it, namely the floods in Brisbane and Queensland. As the water rose so did the Prime Minister. He went off to Indonesia. He left us all behind. He could not care less. He has no sense of proportion. I do not really mind the Prime Minister taking trips but he should take them only when the country does not need a Prime Minister to be in Australia. If ever we needed a man prepared to come to grips with the problems of this nation it is right now. The Prime Minister came back to this Parliament and told us that he was in touch every day. Is he trying to tell me that a direct telex link was connected between Niagara Falls and Canberra? The honourable member for Phillip who spoke a few minutes ago was one of those who tried to reverse the Prime Minister's decision in the Caucus room yesterday. Yet tonight he is defending the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was interviewed on the NBC program 'Meet the Press' while he was in the United States. This program was staged at 5 o'clock in the morning. The only people who are watching television at 5 o'clock in the morning are policemen, the women they are locking up, and milkmen. During the interview at that time in the morning the Prime Minister was asked a question by Mr Brandon, who is the Washington correspondent of the 'London Sunday Times'. Mr Brandon put the question: There is a strong group on the left of you, Mr Prime Minis-ping around was $137,939. As fas as I am conter, in the CabinetThat is an understatement. It is known right are going to be small minded men on these mataround the worldand I gather in the Party CaucusWe could not say that the honourable member for Phillip was one of thosethat sometimes it is very difficult for you to control, and I was attimeswhen we are not in trouble. Everybody wondering whether there is a danger that they might oust knows that at the moment inflation is reaching you. The Prime Minister answered-and get on to we went out of power there were 21 other nations this: They would be cutdng their own throats. Well, what a pompous man he is. The Prime these 2 words are synonymous-ou r inflation rate Minister said that they would be cutting their has soared to such an extent that only seven or own throats. rest ofit. ing it. I will keep going. The Prime Minister having made this pompous cut and dried statement sat back with his usual smug attitude. Then Brandon asked: Why would they be cutting their own throats? The Prime Minister replied: Well, I-yo u come from England, don't you? Brandon rephed: Yes. The Prime Minister then went on to tell the panel: Well, you know perfectly well that this is the stock-intrade of any criticism of any Labor Government-that it is factionridden,that therightand the left are at arms length and the Leader is about to topple; well, it doesn't apply. This is another falsehood. Labor has so many troubles I tliink that the Prime Minister travels overseas to get away from it all. He does not go away because he feels that he is a great ambassador for this nation but he wants to get away from all the problems. The honourable member for Phillip made a nasty comment about the honourable members for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) and Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) in regard to charter nights they had made. These members who come from the bush chartered flights to get them to Canberra or to the main cities where they could connect with other flights. The honourable member for Gippsland spent in the vicinity of $9,000 when he was a Minister and the honourable member for Gwydir, $5,000. If we are to be small minded about this, let us compare their expenditures with the expenditures of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's expenditure in 1974 for tripcerned this is a legitimate expenditure but if we ters let us present both sides of the story. I simply conclude this telling contribution to this debate by saying to the Prime Minister: We do not mind you going away but make your trips record proportions. Let us reflect on this: When in the world which had a worse inflation rate than Australia. Since the Labor Government came to troubleI meant to say 'power' but eight other countries have a worse inflation rate people who thought it was time.",100,Bills

309,Mr Donald Cameron,"I am not distortThe other point I want to make is that unemployment in this country is now in excess of 150,000 people. It is time to tighten belts, not to grandstand in the United Nations, at Niagara Falls or at Nashville, Tennessee. Only when this country gets back on its feet will a Prime Minister, no matter from which party he may come, be entitled to say: ' I am going abroad'. I do not notice this country being beseiged by visits from other national leaders to the same extent as our Prime Minister goes overseas. I know that Mr does him very little credit indeed. One of the Tanaka will be visiting Australia in a week's time and that the Shah of Iran has visited this country. Sure, they are big men. But have we had return visits by the President of the United States? We have not had such visits because the Australian Labor Party and in particular the Deputy Prime Minister spent half of last year hurling insults about the people of the United States being murderers and a great many other unsavoury terms. They want to forget about Austraha. The only reason that the Americans let our Prime Minister visit their country these days is because the United Nations is on neutral ground in that country and they cannot stop him from entering. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Luchetti): I call the Special Minister of State. my feet seeking the call. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN-It will take a decision by the Committee to close the debate.' Special Minister of State) (8.49)-There has been quite a fair deal of debate on this matter. I want to make it clear that it was agreed that the debate would run for 2 hours. However, the debate has ensued for over 2 1 ours now. This arrangement was well known by the Opposition. A number of matters have been raised and I would have thought that some honourable members would have wanted an answer to the points which they put. The leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) took part in the debate briefly to indicate some of the issues which he felt were most important. I think that he was effectively answered by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) who indicated to him the Government's policy in regard to the arts. It seemed that the main weight of the right honourable gentleman's complaint was that someone else should be buying the paintings and that he felt those paintings we had bought were not significant enough. I want to make this point clear to the Leader of the Opposition: I would have thought that if he wanted to downgrade the Prime Minister, which is his forte, he would not have said that the Prime Minister regarded himself as being someone who wouldriseup again after 3 days. That is an insult to a number of people in this community. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition realised that people who might accept that sort of philosophy spend much time looking after orphanages, people in need, the blind, the sick and the infirm. To use that sort of jocular expression tilings on which he could better spend his time would be to make some effective contribution instead of making some half-baked snide remark about people's beUefs or what the Prime Minister might be associated with in order to joke. The Prime Mimster himself would never stoop to that position. I am amazed to think that it was raised in the course of a debate on the Estimates. A matter on which the Opposition wants an effective answer is when Government grants are going to be made avaUable to local government councUs. I would have thought it was obvious that the $56m is part of this appropriation. Until suchtimeas the appropriation BUl is passed and approved we cannot, of course, introduce the legislation to release the money. But it is very clear that once this legislation is approved the grant legislation wUl follow. That is the position because until such time as the ParUament approves the appropriation legislation we wtil not be introducing the grant legislation. It is grant legislation and that is quite clear. I cannot for the Ufe of me understand why a Leader of the Opposition does not know that elementary fact. Let me deal with some of the other matters that were raised. One was the Prime Minister's trip overseas. Surely to goodness honourable members opposite can talk about matters other than that. The real issue is that he represented this nation. He did it in the forums of the world. He did it in countries that matter. They matter not only because of their political significance but also because of their economic significance. He went to nations with which we want to estabUsh better trading relations. One of those nations was China, to which we are anxious to seU wheat and we are deUghted to do so because honourable members opposite could not do it when they were in government. Because the Prime Mmister was successful in being able to go to China before anybody else on this level, honourable members opposite are a bit jealous. It is amazing to think that former President Nixon made his trip to Peking after our Prime Minister.",101,Bills

311,Mr Lionel Bowen (Kingsford,"SmithThe criticisms that are effective from the point of view of the AustraUan nation can give value to the world. If we do speak up as a nation on behalf of the people in Australia when we criticise the bombing of Hanoi it is in the interests of the American people. If honourable members opposite had been in Hanoi they would have seen the hate concept engendered there against the American people as a result of that mistake. The role for AustraUa is to say what it thinks and that is the right sort of attitude to adopt in international affairs. It can only be done if we have a Prime Minister who is respected, who has integrity, who beUeves what he says is right and who beUeves that in the interests of humanity it should be said. On every occasion, no matter where honourable members opposite want to point thefinger,that has been his role. It is a very arduous role. Talking in the forums of the world is not a role that one could say one could accept Ughtly. It is significant, is it not, that the leaders in the Did we get any credit?

Let us have having his surname mispronounced. Again there a look at the issues that were stated. Child care was an incorrect reference here today when was mentioned.

What did you ever do about it stayed in a place caUed WUUamsburg. It is not so. from the point of view offindingout the needs?

If the Prime Minister is in the United allocation you were referring to related to a States it would be for the purpose of saying 'Can ChUd Care Act which was associated mainly we encourage a better Ufe for the people of the with assisting people in industry. world?' because that country is a major power. If he does go to Russia it would be on the basis that he in turn would ask for more collaboration there. Is this not effectiveness from the point of view of Australia's role in international affairs? Honourable members opposite want to drag it down, as the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) said, onto the basis that the Prime Minister has to stay here because a flood is coming. By the same token the honourable member for Griffith was away when there was a flood. He is back here now but he was away when the floods occurred in Brisbane. Mr Donald Cameron-And I came home. I cut my trip. because he knew he would have lost his seat. When I went to BrisbaneI did not see the honourable member. He was still overseas, on his way back. That is how quickly he got back.

Therefore you will find that when we have the report as to what is needed in child care, as the honourable member for Casey( Mr former Government introduced. The honourable Mathews) said, the figure will be enormous. There are 365,000 children in need. Not a thing was done. I will pay some tribute to the new members of the Opposition who are now taking an interest ih this matter. Perhaps if they had been members when the Opposition was in government they might have done something about this, but give credit where it is due. Let us make it clear that the program for child care will be an effective one. It is not going to be solely education. It has to be the care of the child throughout the day. Therefore it cannot be either virtually social welfare or education. There has to be a fair concept of what is the best way to do it. There will be experimental projects as to what is the best way to look after the child because the child is at various stages of developmentperhaps under 2 years of age and perhaps going to pre-school for part of the day. But there have to be various projects. We need the help of the community. We need the talented mother and the talented grandmother. Do not deny the fact that they have expertise. We do not necessarily need every graduate from the point of view of giving pre-school training. There are many people who are experienced in the practicality of looking after children. That is the sort of person we can encourage to take an interest in this field. That amount of $75m that we are going to spend within 6 months will, of course, be absorbed. We do not want it all absorbed in bricks, mortar and buildings. We have to get it to the people who need it. That is one of the criticisms of one of the first reports, because it had mainly as its significance the establishment of buildings, land and training and there was not a great deal in the way of results from the point of view of child care for the need that now exists. That is why there had to be a review. That is why there can be a combination of factors. Ruddock) was anxious to mention Telopea and ter has had 15 minutes. asked about the problem there. Let me answer him because I have had a chance to find out. As I understand it, an amount of $72,000 has been approved. The organisation concerned has been paid $42,600 already. It has been paid $4,000 for Order! I ask the Minister to address the Chair its architects and at the present time has a progress payment of $17,400 coming to it. So a fair amount of money is going into that project. and mortar, but the money is being paid under the scheme instituted under the Act that the member for Parramatta might be right. Perhaps we could make $70,000 go a lot further if we did the job another way, but we cannot stop that project. One of the things the honourable member must recognise about the New South Wales Liberal Government, of which he is such a strong supporter, is that it did nothing for preschool education. In Sir Robert Asian's Budget there is a minus item when it comes to pre-school education. One of the great problems of the Budget allocation for New South Wales was that the New South Wales Government could not afford the salaries of the staff at the few pre-schools it had which had been established by the Kindergarten Union of New South Wales (Inc) and the Sydney Day Nursery and Nursery Schools Association (Inc). The people could not keep the payments up. It was somewhat fortunate that the Australian Labor Party was in government because it had promised some aid. If the Opposition had been in government there would have been no aid and the pre-schools that had been established would have been closed. So the money that was given to New South Wales was absorbed immediately in keeping open those few pre-schools that existed. Those pre-schools were in the main in the most privileged areas. The areas that need them most have no pre-schools at all. This is the problem of the philosophy of the Opposition. Where did the Liberal Party have in its platform any undertaking to do anything about child care? Its policy on this subject did not exist. Any suggestion that it did is a furphy. It was never used by the Liberal Party in the State administration in New South Wales. One of the problems was that when New South Wales received money from the Commonwealth to be allocated in a certain way it could not spend it in the specified time. That is the criticism, and yet tonight the honourable member for Parramatta has the audacity to talk about pre-schools. utes trying to answer points raised in 2 hours.",103,Bills

I will not warn the honourable member for Corangamite again. If he continues to interject I will name him. The money for Telopea is the money that comes under the former Act and would have to be aUocated as that Act provides. The indictment of the Askin Government is that it did not allocate any money for pre-schools. There is no argument about that. It did not have any pre-school program and it had to use the money the Australian Government gave it to prop up the programs that had been estabUshed by the Kindergarten Union and the Sydney Day Nursery. There is no argument. That is the position. The Government is seeking with the new scheme to guarantee that an effective program is introduced that needs the co-operation of all State governments. Admittedly some State-governments in Victoria did have a pre-school program but not the Government in New South Wales.

Deputy Chairman. AU I want to say is this. The criticism has been on the basis that not sufficient attention has been given to need. We are the first Government to establish the needs in education, whether it be in tertiary, secondary, primary or pre-school education. By having surveys and inquiries and taking evidence we have estabUshed the need. This is something the previous Government never did, and that is the real problem. That is why honourable members opposite are so upset tonight. They are upset about how the previous Government faUed. If we have any claim to credit it is in the fields of child care, education and local government. In the field of local government the position is clear. The previous Government did nothing for local government authorities. It denied them. member is anxious that I should close, I am anxious to do that, because there are many other more important matters to deal with.

The result has been utterly predictable. Forced before their time and beyond their capacities to stand on their own feet and to create this viable farming commumty in east Gippsland, the Lake Tyers community has steadily gone downhill till tonight as I speak, having visited Lake Tyers less than a week ago, it is on the verge of total collapse.

I do not do this in any destructive sense because, as one who had the responsibUity as Mmister for the Interior for nearly 2 years, I am weU aware of the very serious problems that confront not just the Minister but the Department in trying to come to grips with what is one of the biggest social problems confronting this country. So anything I do say I hope is taken with a degree of understanding. The appropriation last year of $59,613,000 Operations Management Branch, the control was not in fact spent. I think an amount of branch of the Department, handicapped by $55,151,800 was expended. It could not be serious staff shortages, was the subject of a comexpended for a variety of reasons-n o doubt ment rather than a criticism. Of course, this has shortages of materials and difficulty in trying to foUowed on from serious aUegations that were fulfil certain programs. In this year's program we made by Senator Georges and others about the see nearly $70m appropriated to the Department maladministration within the Department itself. of Aboriginal Affairs and no doubt there wUl be some difficulty in expending that amount. Of course, one of the problems in looking at bald Mmister sitting at the table, who was removed statistics and at the amount of money that is from the portfolio, and I dare say that he suffered being spent on Aboriginal advancement is that some anguish as a result of it. He did approach there is a very big percentage of that money the task of trying to advance the Aboriginal going mto administration, virtually going into people with perhaps more zeal than any other the pockets of white AustraUans. When you do a Minister has ever approached the task. I think it break up of the figures they do become is probably unfair to cast too much blame on him revealing, and I have heard so many Aboriginal or on the Department for some of the problems people say this. Looking through the Approprithat have occurred, some of the mistakes that ation No. 1 accounts one finds that $6.7m has have been made. But I do beUeve that the Debeen spent on salaries and wages and adminispartment now has a responsibUity to answer all tration expenses. The administration of the the queries that have been levelled at it by the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee Auditor-General and to clean up some of these has cost a further $ 1.081 m, bringing the expendiuntidy areas that have left it open to continuing ture up to close to $8m. The AustraUan Institute criticism. of Aboriginal Studies has had appropriated $1.6m, which brings us close to $9,400,000. The balance is split up between the Aboriginal Trust Account, $33.5m, and projects many of which have been put mto operation without proper reference to the Aboriginal people. So many Aboriginal people complain that they are encouraged mto activities-commercia l undertakings and so on-withou t proper consultation. Very often they question whether this sort of investment is coming to grips with their greatest needs. In assistance to mission settlements and Government settlements $10m is being spent. Needless to say, a very considerable percentage of the funds that were appropriated last year and no doubt ofthose that will be appropriate this year in fact wUl not reach the Aborigines themselves. I make some reference to the revelations that have come out again in the Auditor-General's report, which indicates that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has not yet given good reason why some of its expenditure has been in excess of approved programs. In the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, for instance, nearly $lm was spent in excess of an approved program. With respect to control over grants, the Department has not yet completed its follow-up of grants due to staff shortages. With regard to the now well known turtle and crocodile project, most audit queries remain unresolved pending completion of departmental examination.

371,Mr Bryant (Wills,"Minister for the Capitalof Government housing accommodation was becoming rapidly depleted. It is our beliefI believe that it was the belief of our predecessorsthat the AustraUan Government must keep a stock of houses for rental in Canberra. At the present moment that runs at somewhere about 8,000 houses. Last year we received 810 houses from the National Capital Development Commission. The system is this: The National Capital Development Commission is the constructing authority for Canberra. It produces the houses in accordance with programs that have been laid down and thefinancethat has been made avaUable. It then hands them over to the Department of the Capital Territory. So we have become the administrator of one of AustraUa's largest housing projects. Buti f we started selling 1,000 houses when we have received only 800 it would not be many years before we would have depleted our stock of rental housing. At the present moment we are looking at a formula of sale which will place the stock of housing continuously in front. We have not decided yet as to exactly what thefigureought to be, whether we should sell 80 per cent of the number of houses we have or some lesser proportion. Then we come to the question of the sale price. to level out and, in fact, faU. One of the afflictions of the AustraUan social system is the difficulty in controlling the cost ofland and the seUing price of housmg. Despite the fact that we own the land in Canberra and despite the fact that we have been the major housing conabout the demand side of the equation, that we struction authority, we are in no better position had not in fact caught up with it any more than reaUy to control the actual cost or price of built anybody else had.

As I pointed out earUer, implement some system ofhousing price control, the actual house probably could be bulldozed which we are finding difiicult to implement at the and replaced for perhaps $17,000 or $18,000. present moment. So that it might be said that The position in which we find ourselves, and there are in fact 3 costs associated with a house. which bothers me a great deal, is the conflict of There is the amount it costs to butid the house. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr the Government should exploit or profiteer at the McLeay) quoted somefiguresin relation to some expense of the citizen; nor do I beUeve that the houses built 47 and 37 years ago. I think the ones citizen ought to be able to exploit or profiteer at built 47 years ago may well have cost about the expense of the community-in this sense the £1,200 or £l,300-say $2,500-and the ones Government. built a few years later not all that much different in price. That is what they cost then. At that time So far one has not been able to find a formula it probably cost $400 or $500 to develop the land which satisfactorily solves the problem of selling on which they stood. It now costs $3,000 to a house to a tenant at anything less than the develop a block. Then there is the actual cost of present market value because, if one seUs a tenputting a house there today. If the house were ant a house at anything less that the present marremoved by a buUdozer and another house were ket value, one hands him a profit on the plate. I put back on the block, I estimate that it would wtil quote an instance. The system has been to probably cost $17,000 or $18,000 for the same sell a house to a tenant with a 5-year covenant on type of house. Then there is the other price-the resale. But if, for example, there is some market price. My friends opposite are addicted desperate urgencya person is leaving the city to the market place. I am not. upon the social system in this regard. In other words, the seUer gets the price he can get no matter what the cost in social terms to the buyer. That, of course, is what is happening to housing throughout the country. We have not been any more successful in producing enough houses for Canberra than has anyone else anywhere in AustraUa. The people who come to Canberra because of the general desirabUity of Canberra are increasing the pressure on the city. It is a much more desirable and comfortable city in which to Uve than most others. The people who have standing houses to sell have managed to get a good price for them. The price has risen enormously in, I suppose, the last four orfiveyears. It should not be said that the price hasrisenonly in the last 12 or 15 months. In the last four or five years the price has practicaUy doubled. So a house that probably cost $8,000 to butid seven or eight years ago and that was sold for perhaps $17,000 or $18,000 5 years ago, would now bring in the market place perhaps $32,000 or $33,000.

375,Mr Bryant,"I thought I had made the pointwith reasonable compassion and understanding-the Government will permit him to sell it himself or will buy it back from him. One such person came to me the other day. He had paid something like, I think, $14,000 or $15,000 only 3A years before for the house and he had to l leave the city. Somebody had offered him about $40,000. We exercised our right to repurchase it and we paid him the amount of our valuation, which is a reasonable valuation-$27,000. 1 am shocked at that The person is gratified at it. He has achievedI suppose it is happening all the time in other waysa profit of $12,000 or $13,000 at the public expense. cost? come to. On the other hand, of course, the house on which we spent $8,000 on building four or five years ago and which we offered to people at $14,000 three or four years ago, is now in the vicinity of $22,000 or $23,000 and that shocks me too. My suggestion is, and this is what we are exaniining in order to find a satisfactory formula for the future, that we ought to sell it to the tenant at replacement value. That value is what it would cost to put that house there now with a covenant over it for the life of the house enabling us to purchase it back at the replacement value in the future. So people would have the advantage of the value of their equity in it which will rise in accordance with the inflationary cost of housing but will not be able to speculate or profiteer. I have no doubt that this is a difficult formula to work out. But this is the only solution that I can see to the problem. On the other hand, of course, we can reduce the deposit ratio and let people have the houses without having to find anything else. That is what we have decided to do. People will buy a house on 5 per cent deposit and we will supply the mortgage for the other 95 per cent. Last year we lent more money than ever before to finance homes. We lent all that we had available. The amount we lent, which was made up of money from the Budget and money that was ploughed back into the system came to around the $24m mark. Some criticism has been uttered about the announcement made in the last few days in regard to interest rates. Nobody is more concerned about the system of interest rates and the cost of money for housing than this Government. In this instance we have decided that the principles that will apply shall be that interest rates for people in the low income bracket shall be low. The rate will vary from about 5 per cent for people earning 85 per cent of average weekly earnings to the Commonwealth Bank rate for those earning more than 95 per cent. This Government is dedicated to the proposition that it should reduce interest rates but it is an enormously complicated system as everyone would know. At least in the last few days some citizens of Canberra have been greatly advantaged. Some honourable members might say: 'Well, who can afford to pay the deposit, who can afford to raise the money and so on?' Eight or nine people a day in this city apply for land. We do not include the wife's income when assessing applications. We try to make the system as liberal as possible. Therefore while we have not managed to close the gap in land or housing we are gaining ground. I would think that this year we will turn off more land at a better price than can be found at any other place in Australia. It will probably be in the order of some 4,000 more blocks of land. When we became the Government land in Canberra was being auctioned. The average price being obtained for a block ofland 2 years ago was rising to $10,000. Now a person can almost get a block ofland on demand. All a person has to do is to submit his name and within a few weeks he can pick a block ofland from about 30 blocks. The price ofland ranges from $2,500 and $3,000 to $12,000 and $13,000. The average price being paid for a block ofland in Canberra is about $5,500. Therefore, despite the disadvantages at present, we have managed to create for many people in this city advantages that they cannot get anywhere else. We will resume the debate on these estimates on Tuesday. At that time there may well be other matters which honourable members might wish to raise on this question as well as on the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I hope that there will be adequate time to debate them. Any member of this House is quite welcome to take advantage of all the faculties that we have at our disposal to have explained to him what is going on in this city which is remarkably well administered as everyone admits. The city is a demonstration that successive governments have been able to achieve a quaUty of life, a standard of community development and an environment that is not avaUable in many other parts of this continent. The Government is pretty satisfied with the way things are developing here, but there are many other things that we have to do. One of the great difficulties was the faUure4 or 5 years ago to put adequate funds into the development of housing and land so that we would now be able to meet demands.

376,Mr Mcleay,What about the replacement,116,Bills
377,Mr Bryant,"That is the point I am about tojust reminding people of the deficiencies of our predecessors. you, Mr Temporary Chairman, for the honour of allowing me to speak and to follow the Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Bryant) who is the Minister representing the Mimster for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Cavanagh) in this place. I , like the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt), have many Aboriginals Uving in the electorate which I represent and Uke all dunking AustraUansI would Uke to see these people Uve with dignity. No one would question the need for the aUocation of funds for Aboriginal advancement. Because there is a pressing and urgent need for such funds to be made avaUableI beUeve that we must agree with such an allocation. The aUocation of such funds must be related to a policy, but if the poUcy or the appUcation of the poUcy is wrong there can be a waste of the taxpayers' money. We have in this budgetary program the real possibUity of a massive and inexcusable waste of the taxpayers' money. Furthermore, and more importantly, we may see the disintegration and the destruction of a very fine race of people. It appears that self-determination is the basis of the philosophy for the current Aboriginal poUcy. It is essentiaUy a humane, well thought-out, theoretical doctrine, but a doctrine with very Uttle practical application. How can people of any race or at any stage of development make quahtative decisions on matters of which they have Utde or no knowledge? More importantly, the unfortunate recipient of the present poUcy-and I stated this in my maiden speech the week before lastwhich is based on too many handouts is all too human. He is finite and he is now being destroyed in a far more insidious fashion than ever before. The tragic result is inevitable. The things that attract the Aboriginal are usually some of the worse aspects avaUable from within the white society. I refer in particular to alcohoUc drink. If this is taken in excess it will lead to tragedy. I make the point that alcohol as far as the AbRiverina( Mr SulUvan). What on earth was he original is concerned now is causing a problem of talking about-waste , denigration of the policy? the same magnitude as the Aboriginal problem Every word he uttered implied that everything itself. It wUl not be too long before we wUl need that has been done was wasteful, pointless and massive funds to try to cure the problem of destructive. What nonsense. Let us take some of alcohol among Aboriginals. I refer to some the aspects of his speech. First of all, housing. papers in this respect. The Minister himself There are about 25,000 to 30,000 Aboriginal stated that alcohol was disastrous as far as AborfamiUes in this country. Over a period of a ceniginals are concerned. The Minister said again tury and a half or more a handful have been adthat the policy was a disaster. Unfortunately in equately housed. The previous Government no papers could I find an indication that the began a program. We have accelerated it. There present poUcy had any hope to offer for the are now hundreds of Aboriginal famUies in future. The policy itself must be based on the homes who were denied them in the past. People needs of the Aboriginal people. Mr Charles Perkins stated that when he said: . . . the needs of the Aboriginal people should form our policy, adrrunistrative and budgetary guidelines. The poUcy should be based on the needs of people, not the wants of people. Unfortunately the basis of this present poUcy appears to be in the area of the wants of Aboriginals. If the policy is taken as far as the needs of the people are concerned and is based on understanding and compassion, has an educational program and is given sufficient time to work the policy has some chance of success. There is a Service axiom that says: 'A commander should never reinforce faUure'. Service axioms, unlike political axioms, are born on those hardest possible arenas in the world and they have a tremendous element of truth, ln this policy we have today we have exactly that. We are reinforcing faUure. This year we are spending an additional $ 14m on a policy which has proved to be a faUure. I think it is necessary for us to look very carefully at the poUcy itself. I am not standmg here to criticise because of the mistakes that we are making based purely on expenditure. I am standing here because I believe the real mistake we are making is that we are destroying the Aboriginal people. If that is the purpose of the policy then it is a bad policy. A complete reappraisal of this policy must be made before we decide how much money we should allocate in this area. It is not too late. But if we continue with the present policy it will be too late and not much time has to pass before it will be too late. I do not titink any honourable member on either side of the chamber would like to sit in this place and be a party to a poUcy which leads to the death and destruction of a race of people. That is exactly the position we are in today with the present Aboriginal policy. Give back to the Aborigine his dignity and the rest will follow.

379,Mr Bryant (Wuls,"Minister for the Capitalneed homes. They not only need houses but also they need homes. I am talking about the thousands of people in about 400 communities in Australia in which Aboriginal people can be found. Some of them Uve on the edge of country towns. Some of them live in the heart of suburbs such as Redfern and Fitzroy. Thousands of them Uve in a community of which they are the total membership. In many cases the conditions under which they Uve are a disgrace to the nation. Every one of them offers a social chaUenge, a physical chaUenge, an administrative chaUenge and a financial one. We are the last people to say that we have achieved success in all those areas. But there is no doubt in my mind-and I have been very closely associated with this for a long whUe indeed-that thousands of Aboriginal people are grateful that the Labor Government was returned to office and also that it is pressing on regardless. Last year we published in Hansard-and we wUl do it again later this yearthe names of the areas in which programs were being developed. It took up some 17 or 18 pages. I have said to people: 'Which ones should not have been done and which ones are waste'. Of course in a program such as that which was spread across a continent such as ours, some of the money is not going to be returned as a clear dividend. General. If the honourable member reads the Auditor-General's report very carefuUy he will find that it was not so much that there was anything wrong with the program but that someone did not do the paper work properly. But, of course, the people who sit opposite are more concerned with paper than with people. From one end of this continent to the other the search goes on for a solution. There are members oppositeone is sitting in the House now; perhaps two of them-wh o I know appUed themselves with vigour and compassion to the same task. There are more Aboriginal people receiving substantial health benefits now than ever before. In the field of education there are thousands more in secondary schools and they are going to be the ones who in the future will supply leadership for the Aboriginal communities. We have estabUshed Aboriginal communities on their own land. We are going to estabUsh more of them on their own land. There are other areas. The honourable member for Riverina raised the question of alcohol. Fancy anybody in the AustraUan commumty, anybody in the nonAboriginal AustraUan commumty, anybody in the previously, led Liberal AustraUan community. attacking somebody because they had become a victim of alcohol. Tonight in this place we sit opposite people who when in government gave knighthoods to brewers, yet they talk about alcoholism. Of course it is destructive. The difference between white people and Aboriginal people is that after the Aborigine has been to a hotel he has nowhere to go so he goes out into the streets and everybody sees him. But alcoholism exists throughout our own community. It is one of the great destroyers of Australian social life, black or white. So that is one of the problems to wbich we are applying ourselves. We have not found a solution to this problem in the rest of the community. We are not going to find it any easier in the Aboriginal community. I believe that we ought to acknowledge it and we ought to do what we can about it. But for the honourable member to make that the principal burden of his speech on Aboriginal people is to make it just all the more difficult for the rest of the community to accept the fact that 1 per cent of the Australian commumty belonging to the original Aboriginal race are still with us. My principal criticism in relation to the speech by the honourable member for Riverina is the sense of gloom he put into this matter. This has been one of the very serious aspects of some of the comments that have been made over the last 12 months about the Auditor-General's report. People wrote commentaries on this subject. The leader writers of the great Australian datiy newspapers only have to get out of their seats and walk 2 nules down the street to find what sort of things were being done. The ones in Melbourne got out of then* seats in Spencer Street and looked in Fitzroy to find what the legal service and health service centres were doing. There are other centres elsewhere. Some of these things have created great difficulties. We know that when an Aboriginal hostel is opened somewhere in the city it will, unless we are very fortunate, create social tensions around the place. Some of these projects have been successful. There are several in Brisbane. Some have been very successful. We know that others are causing tension throughout the community. That is part of the chaUenge we aU face. AllI would say to honourable members opposite-and I hope that this debate can go on next week because I think there are some other people who might want to speak-is that what they have to do is look at this subject not just with compassion but with some optimism.

This is an indictment of the Government. entering the debate tonight on the adjournment Why should the producers be forced to supply motion. I take the opportunity to place before this ParUament the pUght of those associated with the beef industry. I do so because of the indifferent attitude of the Government. When it took office on 2 December it was said by many that it would be a sad day for the primary producers of AustraUa. The sad day has been with us now for nearly 2 years, and today this is a sad country. When we compare today's economic situation with that of 2 years ago the rural scene is appalling. The second Labor Budget has been deUvered, remodelled and is now being perservered with by a disgruntled Caucus, but there was not one recognition in the Budget of the present economic plight of rural Australia. Surely it must be evident to all that country people are a forgotten people. I do not want to dweU on the overall poor performance and the failure of the Government to recognise the difficulties facing the rural communities which my colleagues and I represent in this ParUament. WhatI especially want to draw the Government's attention to tonight is the precarious and almost impossible position of our beef producers. We on the Opposition side of the House cannot let the present situation continue. very carefully considered by my coUeagues and me. I want the Government to heed what I have to say and act upon it. It is abundantly clear that beef industry. One reason would be the attitude of the Government, which unashamedly stands by while the beef farmers head towards bankruptcy. Another reason would be that the Australian consumer is not a beneficiary of the producers' low prices, which incidentally are the lowest for 30 years. This is an anomaly which must be solved. Rural people are becoming tired of the present Government and sick and tired of seeing everyone except themselves being compensated for the effects of inflation. Every wage rise is based on costs. Primary producers, particularly beef raisers, are in the hands of the export market. Their incomes are never subject to review when there is a downturn in prices. They beUeve, and I",118,Bills

It needs at least $50m carry-on finance, free of interest, as an interim measure whilst the royal commission carries out its survey and produces a report. An emergency fund should be established so that primary producers with financial difficulties brought about by uprecedented and unpredictable causes which embarrass them can be assisted. The industry itself estimates its immediate need for about $50m for carry-on finance. I repeat that the cattle industry in AustraUa urgently needs credit. About one and threequarter iniUion fewer head of cattle wtil be ktiled this year because of the export downturn. If the market had not collapsed to such an extent these cattle would have brought in about another $200m to producers. For producers who are dependent entirely on cattle this situation creates very serious liquidity problems, and there are 13,000 producers whose operations are based solely on cattle. The Australian National Cattlemen's CouncU estimates that many producers wtil suffer up to a 50 per cent drop in thenper cent on some buUding materials and by 10 gross farm incomes even before meeting a 25 per cent rise in their costs.

Calculations in some specific regions show that producers are getting for their meat a price that is little more than half the cost of producing it. With aU the expertise in cattle raising, and with aU the wisdom of Government experts and the advice of long-term beef raisers who have been in the industry all their Uves, no one could have advised me last year that there would be a slump in prices this year. The great danger of all this is that producers wtil be forced to seU off their basic breeding stock to get a Uttle cash to carry them over. The industry is not asking for special treatment, merely that the Government sees that funds are available through the normal sources at ordinary commercial interest rates. Unfortunately, I beUeve it has to be recognised that any action to make large sums avaUable wtil have some inflationary effect. But this must be weighed up against the very serious long-term consequences that would flow from the sacrifices of valuable breeding stock to help producers meet what seems Ukely to be only a short-term liquidity problem. There is a very urgent need in the beef industry today for some financial assistance to be offered to producers in their time of peril. I say 'peril' because these people have a great financial investment which they must look after; they must service it. They find themselves in a most difficult position at this stage and I would request the Government to take urgent and sincere action to help them over this hurdle. for Transport) (10.41 )-On 24 September the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) directed a question to me concerning Commonwealth Railways freight rate increases in the Northern Territory and their effects on the economy of the Territory. At that time. I promised I would give him a reply but until this point it has not been possible for me to give him it in the House. It is true that the Commonwealth Railways has increased its freight charges by 40 per cent on livestock, by 15 to 35 per cent on bulk fuel as stated by the honourable member. However, it is a complete fabrication by him to suggest that these increases were imposed by the Commonwealth Railways as 'another vicious attack on the people of the outback' and it was 'a continuation of the vindictive attitude of the socialist government in an endeavour to smash private enterprise and, in so doing, to injure all classes of people living in these outback areas'. That is typical of the type of distorted questions with which Ministers in this House have to contend. Such misstatement of fact concerning the AustraUan Government's poUcies is typical of the irresponsible statements that are continually being made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory to Territorians in an attempt to direct their attention away from the many progressive initiatives taken by this Government and, in particular, by the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson). It is also typical of him that while he complains of increases in Commonwealth Railways charges he is strangely silent about increases imposed by private enterprise transport operators. He is always also very careful not to compare Commonwealth Railways charges with those of the private road operators. For example, Co-ord Ltd in its contract with the Commonwealth Railways increased its road rates by an average of 26 per cent on 1 June 1973, by 8.7 per cent on 1 September 1974 and by 7.7 per cent on 1 October",119,Adjournment

389,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle,"Minister1974. In respect of insulating material and plastic pipes the percentage increase in its charges since June 1973 has been 20 per cent. price equalisation. the honourable member for Farrer should make such an interjection. I say to him: 'When you interject, for heavens sake know what you are talking about. As a Minister you did not know'. The honourable member referred to the increase in petrol prices but the price differential did not come into operation until after the date to which I have just referred. When road and rail rates are compared the low level of Commonwealth Railways charges is particularly noticeable. Some specific examples are as follows: For the carriage of Uvestock from AUce Springs to Port Pirie the cost per semi-traUer load is $690 whereas the equivalent bogie van load by rati costs $242.65c; a semi-trailer load of Uvestock by road over 502 kilometres costs $376.50 whereas a similar load over a similar distance by Northern AustraUan RaUways costs $149.40. DoI hear any more interjections? The cartage of bulk fuel by road over 1,001 Itilometres costs $39.79 per tonne as compared with the rail charge of $20.01 per tonne. The cost of transporting cement from Port Pirie to AUce Springs is $59.89 per tonne or $31.09 per tonne in 20 tonne lots. The comparable charges by rati are $22.09 and $21.23 per tonne respectively. In the Commonwealth RaUways nnancial statements for 1973-74 which I tabled in the House on 26 September it was shown that the raUways lost $7,205,726 as compared with $3,246,571 in the previous year. In these circumstances it is ludicrous to suggest that any increase in charges was a vicious attack on the people in the outback. No industry can absorb losses of this magnitude without affecting its continued operations. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory wishes to see the Commonwealth RaUways continue to accumulate losses of this magnitude he would be doing a disservice to the Territory. To see the results of such a policy one has only to look at the State railways with their huge losses, inefficient rolling stock, poor tracks and inefficient services. We, as a government, are committed to a policy of improving transport services to the Northern Territory. For instance, although the Liberal Country Party government, of which the honourable member was a member, was in office for 23 years it did nothing of its own voUtion in respect honourable member's claim that the present of the Tarcoola-AUce Springs raUway. It was the Australian Government is working against the Commissioner for Commonwealth Railways who had to take the initiative and examine the advantages of a completely new route. After that it was then up to the Liberal-Country Party Government to reach agreement with the South AustraUan Government for the construction of this Une. Even to that extent it failed miserably. Since we became the Government we have reached agreement with South AustraUa for the construction of this Une. On2 October 1974 I introduced the Tarcoola-Alice Springs RaUway BUl 1974 into this ParUament and only this week it was passed through this House and the Senate. That Bill seeks the ratification of the agreement reached between the AustraUan and South AustraUan Governments. It is estimated that the raUway line wtil cost $145m to build. Funds have been provided in the 1974-75 Budget for the initial planning and construction of the Une. In addition, the present AustraUan Government has increased the assistance for roads from $868m for the 3-year period 1971 to 1974 to $l,126m for the 3-year period 1974 to 1977. It is interesting to note that the rural-urban distribution of funds under the previous roads arrangements of the Liberal-Country Party Government was 47 per cent for rural roads as against 53 per cent for urban roads. Under the current arrangements, the ratio of the distribution is 61 per cent for rural roads and 39 per cent for urban roads. One never stops listening to complaints, whingeing and whining from members of the Australian Country Party that expenditure on rural roads has been reduced. I ask them to examine the facts. If they do so, they will get one clear result: It is that this Government has made greater sums of money available for rural roads than the Country Party did when it was in government for 23 years. Honourable members also should take into consideration the $400m which has been aUocated for maintenance and construction of national highways. Included in this category of roads wtil be the Port Augusta-AUce Springs road which was ignored completely by the previous Liberal Country Party Government. What did honourable members opposite do about the construction of that road? For 23 years they had the opportunity to do something about the road, but they did not do one thing about it. In the 1974-75 Budget the total outlay for rural industry was $487m. This is some $150m more than the last Liberal-Country Party Government provided for rural industry.

This Government is concerned with the people of the Northern Territory. For that reason we have got on with the job of providing a rail service at freight rates which are fair and reasonable and which compare more than favourably with the freight rates that are charged by the private enterprise road operators. Do the members of the Country Party want to transfer the rail system to private enterprise? Do they want to see the exorbitant charges that are imposed upon the people in the Northern Territory by private enterprise or do they want to retain the Australian Commonwealth Railways with its fair and reasonable freight charges to which they, as members of the Parhament, have access? Honourable members have a right to question, as did the honourable member for the Northern Territory, my decision and the decision of the Government to increase freight rates which do not even reach half the rate charged by private enterprise road operators. I am certain that any fak-minded reasonable thinking person in the Northern Territory would be quite happy to have the Commonwealth Railways operating and providing a service at a reasonable freight rate. Even though we have increased the freight rate, the railways will still operate at a loss. Is that persecution of the Northern Territorians? Of course it is not.

Many young married people who come to Canberra have the advantage of regulation 97 of the Pubhc Service Act, but a sinular concession is not available to single people. I beheve that every opportunity should be taken to encourage open dialogue with the young people in Canberra to establish their needs. I believe that the Minister should appoint an advisory panel of youth workers and young people in Canberra, with representatives from hostels, to advise him regularly on the needs of single people in Canberra. I believe that the Minister should be devoting much more attention to the area of co-operative housing which can provide a very attractive and lessfinanciallyburdensome way for young people to attain some independence without committing themselves to some of the burdens of the traditional suburban home. Mr Speaker, the Government claims that the AustraUan Capital Territory is the social laboratory for its poUcies throughout AustraUa.

I am grateful for the honourable member's correction, but I aUege that for the remainder of the week the honourable member for the Northern Territory has been campaigning in the Northern Territory in connection with the election on Saturday next. His bounden duty to his constituents is to represent them in this Parliament when the ParUament is sitting, not to be campaigning in the Northern Territory. That is where his primary duties lie. That is why he receives a lucrative salary, and his duties are in this Parliament, not campaigning in connection with a local election in the Northern Territory. I hope that every fair minded member of this House would agree with me. The Labor Party has been criticised for not showing an interest in the affairs of the people of the Northern Territory, but an ultra-modern sewerage system is being installed at Tennant Creek and a super ultra-modern sewerage system is being instaUed for the people of Darwin. I have not the privUege of having sewerage system at my home in Coal Point which is much more thickly populated than some of the areas of the Northern Territory. The residents of Coal Point are deprived of a sewerage system. The Commonwealth Government is granting, rightly or wrongly, a higher priority to the people of the Northern Territory.

Wool: Sales to China (Question No. 951) Mr Bungey asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) What were the terms of sale, prices received and amounts and types of wool involved in the recent sale of wool to China by the Australian Wool Corporation. (2) Were the sales on credit. (3) If the Minister is unable to supply the information, will he give an assurance that (a) the wool was not sold at prices below those paid by the Australian Wool Corporation for the wool, (b) the wool sold came from stocks held by the Australian Wool Corporation, (c) the wool was not keenly sought by other wool users and, (d) the sales were a commercial decision of the Australian Wool Corporation and not at Government direction. has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: (1) By agreement between the two parties, the terms of sale, prices received and amounts and types involved in the Corporation's recent sale of wool to the Peoples Republic of China are confidential matters between the Corporation and the Chinese authorities. (2) The sales were not on credit. (3) The wool was sold at the same prices as were available at the time to all other users of Australian wool. It will be drawn from the stocks of the Corporation. The Corporation's decision to sell this wool followed detailed technical discussion in Peking between officials of the Australian Wool Corporation and representatives of the P.R.C. on the latest developments in Australia on the system of selling wool on the basis of objective measurement. The sale was of a trial nature and based on full objective specification. The Corporation considers that this sale was useful in that it opened the way to acceptance by China of the new selling methods based on objective measurement now being strongly promoted by the Corporation.

406,Dr Patterson,"The Minister for Agriculture(1) In what way did the Australian Wool Corporation depart from the guidelines agreed to between the Minister and the Corporation in its activities in the month to 23 July 1974 (Hansard, 23 July 1974, page 467). (2) How is the expenditure of taxpayers money on wool purchases by the Corporation to 23 July 1974 calculated as $16m (Hansard, 23 July 1974, page 471). (3) Did the Corporation finance its wool purchases from its own reserves and borrowing capacities in the period to 23 July 1974; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In accordance with the provisions of the Wool Industry Act 1972-73, the Australian Wool Corporation was operating a flexible reserve price scheme at wool auctions during the period referred to. Guidelines provided to the Corporation in respect of the conduct of reserve price activities require the Corporation to test a declining market but not to defy a genuine downward trend in the market. Prices of wool at auction had declined progressively throughout most of the 1973-74 wool selling year and towards the end of the year the Corporation had been testing the market to ascertain whether the decline represented a short term or long term trend. During this period the Corporation had not been forced to purchase more than 24.3% of offerings in a week. When sales resumed in July last the Corporation continued to test the market at the closing level of the 1973-74 season and in doing so purchased in excess of 60% of auction offerings which had been considerably enlarged because of the cancellation of earlier sales. Whether in following such action the Corporation departed from the guidelines turns on a judgement as to whether the Corporation should have continued its testing role as long as it did. The Minister for Agriculture had not been formally consulted on the Corporation's policy during the July auctions, but had been advised of the likelihood of a weak market during July. The Minister has stated that whilst in his view the actions of the Corporation could have been regarded formally as outside its guidelines, he accepts that the Corporation did not have the power to cancel or significantly reduce wool supplies at auction without the concurrence of other members of the Joint Wool Selling Organisation. The Corporation in fact had made representations to J.W.S.O. to defer all sales. Also it urgently requested the Board of Principals of the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia to reduce quantities rostered for sale in Sydney, and was refused. The Corporation was in close consultation with the Chairman of the AustraUan Council of Woolbuyers and ascertained that buyers were willing to accept postponement of sales. (2) During the July sales, the Corporation purchased some 81,000 bales of wool in its reserve price activities. The overall average cost of the Wool approximated $200 per bale. (3) To finance its purchase in July, the Corporation drew on credit from the major Trading Banks, the repayment of which is guaranteed by the Australian Government. Road Fatalities: Motor Cyclists (Question No. 983) Mr Coates asked the Minister for Transport, curity, upon notice: upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a Report of the Traffic struction of a centre for the Murray Districts Slow Learning Accident Research Unit that the very great majority of motor Children's Group submitted by the Murray Community cyclists kdled in New South Wales are travelling on roads subject to an absolute speed Umit, in most cases 60 kilometres per hour. (2) If so is this trend followed in all other States, including Tasmania. (3) Did the Report also say that any counter measure against motor cycle accidents which relies for its effect on the limitation of the speed at which motor cyclists choose to travel will have little if any effect on their death rate. (4) If so is there any need for the 70 kilometres per hour pillion limit for motor cyclists which exists in States other than New South Wales. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Repon referred to is Traffic Accident Research Unit Report 5/70: Deaths on Motor Cyclesa study of 120 fatalities. (2) Detailed statistics are not readily available for other States except Victoria where it appears that approximately three-quarters of all motor cycle accidents occur within builtup areas. (3) Yes. (4) At present the National Road Traffic Code, endorsed by the AustraUan Transport Advisory Council, provides for a 70 km/h Umit for motor cyclists carrying pillion passengers. This limit has been adopted by South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory while Victoria has a 80 km/h limit. The other States and the Northern Territory have no specific limits for motor cyclists. Following the repeal of the New South Wales limit from 30 July 1971, the Australian Transport Advisory Council asked its Advisory Committee on Road User Performance and Traffic Codes to examine the necessity of the limit. Based on examination of the available data, the Committee has been unable tojustify deletion of the Umit. Further information is however still being sought and the matter is still under consideration. Meat Imports from New Zealand (Question No. 990) Mr Street asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) What quantity of meat has been flown from New Zealand to Brisbane during the last 12 months.

Film and Television Board: Administrative Costs (Question No. 512) Mr Giles asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Will he make available a comprehensive breakdown of administradve costs and other expenses incurred by the Film and Television Board in eachfinancialyear. (2) In what profitable ventures has the Board been involved. (3) In these instances, what investment has the Board made, and what proportion is this investment to total investment from other sources. (4) Will he name these other sources. member's question is as follows: (1) With the exception of costs for meetings and consultations the administrative costs of the Film and Television Board and all other constituent Boards of the Australian Council for the Arts are borne by the Australian Council for the Arts under functional categories. There are no ready means for extracting the administrative costs of one Board. Total expenditure by the Board in 1973-74 was $1,857,765 including $ 176,782 from the allocation for 'Council program and activities'. Of this total expenditure $28,323 was allocated for the cost of Film and Television Board meetings, including sitting fees, travel and accommodation, and the balance was directed to support for the arts. (2) (3) and (4) The Film and Television Board is not concerned with considerations of financial profitability as such and does not engage in investment-type activities or in productions in commercial terms. Women: Public Service Promotions Appeal Committees (Question No. 6) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: How many (a) women and (b) men have sat as union representatives on selection panels, tribunals and other appeal boards established under the Public Service Act in the last 12 months. able member's question is as follows: Staff association nominees are included on Promotions Appeal Committees but not on selection panels or tribunals established under the Public Service Act. Information on the numbers of women and men who have sat as staff association nominees on Promotions Appeal Committees in the last twelve months is not available. A recently conducted survey of the A.C.T. Promotions Appeal Committees revealed that over an eight week period there were seven female and 102 male staff association nominees on Committees. Further surveys are being conducted of the representation of men and women on Promotions Appeal Committees in New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

Overseas Travel by Public Servants (Question No. 547) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) How many public servants travelled overseas on official business during 1973. (2) What was the total cost of such travel. able member's question is as follows: (1) 1 have been informed that during 1973 1196 persons employed in departments and associated authorities under the Public Service Act travelled overseas on official business. This number excludes persons who travelled overseas to take up long-term postings. (2) The total cost of that travel, including fares and accommodation, was $2,710,780.

Statistics on the application of the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act are not centrally collected but the Public Service Board has provided the above information on staffemployed under the Public Service Act. Although this information is not expressed in terms of employees who applied for benefits but covers only those who received benefits, the Board has pointed out that, under the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act, eligible persons have a statutory entitlement to the maternity leave provisions. The statistics provided above should therefore reflect the number of eligible public service applicants.

(20) Will the Government be able to guarantee people jobs after they have completed training. (21) How often can a particular person be retrained. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the give special attention to, for example. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has at its disposal a wide range of labour market information which is available through the work of the national employment agency, CES. This information is supplemented by a continuous short-run assessment of the economic situation. Steps are being taken to expand the Department's capacity for long-run forecasting through the establishment of a manpower forecasting unit; this unit is being provided with ADP facilities which will enable it to undertake manpower forecasting based on longrun econometric models of the Australian economy. The capacity of the CES to provide labour market information is presently the subject of extensive developmental work designed to pave the way for the introduction of ADP techniques which will enable data on job vacancies and job seekers to be circulated rapidly between offices of the CES. (2) There is a general acceptance of the need for retraining by both trade union and employer sectors of industry. (3) Existing apprenticeship schemes will continue as before and I expect they will be further supplemented by provisions of NEAT. (4) In several areas, there has already been an acceptance NEAT. and encouragement of adult training schemes, subject to safeguards for the apprenticeship system. However, some unions have not abandoned their traditional objections to adult training in skilled trades. I am hopeful that as the application of NEAT develops, suitable arrangements will be made to accommodate the attitudes of these unions. (5) NEAT is not primarily concerned with industry's responsibility to train its staff. The Government encourages that, however, under other programmes administered by my Department. NEAT will have capacity to utilise training fasatisfactory progress. cilities in private firms as part of the overall effort to provide training opportunities to the community. (6) It is not anticipated thatfinancewill limit the scope of retraining. (7) Training assistance is but one of the measures available under the Government's Structural Adjustment Assistance Scheme. Moreover, training assistance has been available under the training schemes which NEAT supersedes since before the Government cut tariffs by 25 per cent in July 1973. With the introduction of NEAT the training assistance available to workers retrenched directly as a result of Government-induced structural change will be greatly enchanced and, as a consequence, a greater proportion of these workers may be expected to benefit from training to help them secure further employment. The honourable member may rest assured that NEAT is ready to cope with these demands. (8) Findings of relevant studies conducted in other countries indicate substantial success achieved in the training of older workers. Through its administration of existing training schemes, my Department has had experience with providing training opportunities for older workers. It will be one of the functions of the new Manpower Divisions of my Department to carry out and arrange for studies of the nature referred to by the honourable member. (9) It is not true to say that there will be no eligibility criteria attached to NEAT. The principal criteria will be the complete the form of training sought, and to whether the employment. These are deliberately broad and flexible criteria. As NEAT develops, it will gain in its capacity to provide training for all persons who require it irrespective of age, sex or location. But, in the initial stages, there may be a need to (a) persons rendered redundant by Government action such as tariff cuts; (b) persons rendered redundant by technological changes or other redundancy-causing situations; (c) persons whose employment prospects are affected by residence in an area where employment opportunities are limited or declining; (d) persons who are unemployed for reasons such as health, incapacity, imprisonment, inadequate or inappropriate work skills or fbr lack of job opportunity; (e) persons who enter approved forms of training designed to alleviate specific labour shortages; (f) persons already in employment who on their own initiative wish to upgrade their skills. (10) See answer to question (9), above. (11) Country workers will be eligible to participate in retraining and will be entitled to receive appropriate fares and living-away-from-home allowances. The Government has already announced its intention to provide relocation assistance to workers affected by structural change. (12) See answer to questions 8 and 9, above, which indicate that older workers will be eligible for assistance under (13) A basic tenet of NEAT is that there is no discrimination on the grounds of sex, nor is level of income in itself one of the criteria on which an application for training is considered. (14) and (15) I suggest that the honourable member directs these questions to the Minister whose portfolio covers child care facilities. (16) Those undertaking training will be expected to make (17) Yes, they will be able to have their cases reviewed by me or by the Central Office of my Department. (18) My Department will certainly conduct appropriate investigations as the need to do so emerges, but I would add that for some years now, under existing training schemes administered by my Department, persons undertaking courses for the purposes oflabour market training have been undenaking them alongside students and without difficulties arising as to different levels of allowances. (19) The honourable member refers to a recommendauon of the Committee of Enquiry into Labor Market Training (the Cochrane Committee). The recommendauon has my full support. The Pubhc Service Board is currently conducting a full review of pan-time employment in the Australian Public Service, which includes an examination of the feasibility of permanent part-ume employment. (20) No. But, since choice of appropriate training will be assisted by counselling by CES in conjunction with its asssessment of shon and medium range labour needs, it will be unlikely that a person completing his training successfully would have serious difficulty in obtaining employment. (21) A person will be endded to beretrainedto the extent that training will be a realisuc and viable means of assisting that person to cope with the needs and problems of the labour market. With increasing technological and other changes taking place in our society it could be expected that opponunities for training and re-training will have to be made available to people throughout their working lives. Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act (Question No. 764) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act does not make adequate provision for women seeking part-time employment in the PubUc Service at the conclusion of maternity leave. (2) Was it his intention that women who seek such part-time employment and who previously held permanent positions will be required to resign or to forego their permanency and accept temporary employment. (3) If not, does he intend to take steps to correct the situation; if so, how and when. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I presume his question relates to women who have been in full-time employment, have been absent on maternity leave and at the conclusion of their entitlement to maternity, sick,recreationand other leave wish to return to pan-time, rather than full-time, employment. The Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act provides that a permanent officer returning from maternity leave must bere-employedin her former ment consultantfirmsin the last 12 months. position or in a position at a level as near as possible to that held by her at the commencement of her maternity leave. At present there are no permanent part-time positions in the PubUc Service and therefore the opponunity for transferring from a full-time to a permanent pan-time position does not exist.

I fully support this recommendation. The PubUc Service Board is currently conducting a full review of part-time employment in the Australian Public Service, which includes an examination of the feasibUity of permanent part-time employment. Any questions on the progress of this review should be directed to the Prime Minister.

Because of the diverse range of activities in which modernised but in Australia. the Department's many establishments are engaged, it would prove extremely cosdy to maintain a permanent capability in the areas of skills available as required from private consultants. Accordingly, as the proposed program of improvements progresses, negodations are entered into with private organisations possessing the expertise most appropriate to particular assignments. (2) and (3) Consultants engaged during 1973-74, a brief description of the assignments they each undertook and the cost, are as follows: 1.

(4) If so, why is it necessary for HMAS PERTH to be refitted in the United States. (5) Ifnot, why are not HMAS BRISBANE and HMAS member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. HMAS PERTH departed on 31 July 1974 for the USA for modernisation and essential associated refit work which commenced on 3 September 1974. (2) Yes. (3) HMAS BRISBANE and HMAS HOBART are programmed to be modernised to the same standards as HMAS (4) and (S) The expertise and experience to install the Naval Combat Data System and the Tartar Digital Update does not currently exist in Australia. HMAS PERTH is being modernised in the USA so that a baseline may be developed for utilisation at Garden Island Dockyard. The UN has agreed to provide and demonstrate to the RAN an operable weapon and control system when installed in a US shipyard. The UN does not have any responsibility for the operability of the systems which will be installed in Australia. Therefore, it is most important that Garden Island Dockyard be provided with an operable system which can be used as a comparison during systems installation and checkout in HMAS Furthermore, the RAN is taking the opportunity to train appropriate personnel by on-the-job training at Long Beach Naval Shipyard during HMAS PERTH'S modernisation.

442,Mr Connor,"The answer to therighthonourCrude Oil (Question No. 916) Mr Anthony asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) What is the current level of crude oil stocks held by refineries in Australia. (2) What is regarded as a minimum safe level to be held at one time by refineries. (3) Are current stocks and storage capacity regarded as acceptable in view of refinery capacity. (4) Given average monthly refinery throughput, what level and period of refinery operation would the current stock level sustain given a complete dependence upon these stocks by refineries. able member's question is as follows: (1) The level of crude oil stocks at a refinery varies from day to day due to the steady consumption at the refinery and the intermittent arrival of fresh stocks by tanker or pipeline. Crude oil stocks held by refineries in Australia average about 5,750,000 barrels, or the equivalent of 10 days consumption. Some refineries are connected to oilfieldsby pipelines. In these cases, the entire recoverable contents of the oil field can be regarded as refinery stocks, to be fed into the refinery as required. (2) For those countries completely dependent on imponed oil, the OECD is striving to ensure that 90 days storage of crude plus products is held at all dmes. However, Australia, because two-thirds of its crude suppUes are indigenous, does not need this amount. Ninety days reserve of Bass Strait crude at the fixed price of $2.08 per barrel would involve $114m tied up in stocks plus approximately $250m capital cost of tankage at present construcuon costs. (3) Yes. (4) Answer contained in (1). Fire Fighting Procedures (QuestionNo. 1132) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) With reference to the answer to quesdon No. 548 (Hansard, 19 September 1974, page 1621) in which the Prime Minister indicated that the form and frequency of exercises in Government Departments in civil defence preparedness are as determined by individual Departments, on what dates in the last 18 months have exercises of this nature been conducted in his Depanment. (2) Which officers and employees took part. (3) How many officers and employees took pan. (4) What was the purpose of each of the exercises. (5) Does he accept that this is an area where the Australian Government can give a lead to other employers. able member's question is as follows: (1) 3 August 1973. (2) Departmental officers and employees located in Hobart Place, Canberra City. (3) 126. (4) BuUding evacuation. (5) Yes. Civil Marriage Ceremony Fees (QuestionNo. 1172) the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Is there a set fee to be charged at weddings performed by a civil marriage celebrant. (2) If so, is the fee of $30 reponedly charged for each wedding by Mrs Angela Burn; wife of the State Australian Labour Party Member for Lytton, Queensland, within the set charge. vided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The fees payable for a civil marriage ceremony, including one solemnized by a State or Territory official attached to a registry office, are set out in the Marriage Reguladons. To provide fbr varying circumstances, there are several fees prescribed, rather than a single amount. A fee of $5 is payable upon lodgement of the Nouce of Intended Marriage. Upon solemnization of the marriage a funher fee of $10 is payable if the marriage is solemnized between the hours of 9.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. on a weekday that is not a public holiday (or during the normal hours of duty of a registry office celebrant). If the marriage is solemnized at any other ume this fee becomes $15. An additional amount is payable if the marriage is solemnized at a place other than the home of the celebrant (or the normal place of employment if the celebrant is a registry office official). This additional amount is $10 if the distance away from the home (or place of employment of the official) is not more than 30 kUometres. For greater distances the additional amount is one for negotiation. (2) Yes. It will be seen from (1) that $30 would be the total fee payable in respect of a ceremony conducted out of normal hours away from, but within 30 kUometres of, the celebrant's home.

(2) If so, will the Minister now make those records available to the Parliament; if not, why not. vided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 1 and 2. Translations necessary to enable an anlysis to be made of the material in the light of information already held by the Australian authories from their own sources, have been made. This anlysis necessitates the obtaining of clarification on a number of points before an overall assessment can be made of the material. Until this clarification has been obtained and proper assessments can be made, it would be detrimental to the interests of individuals concerned if premature release were made of the material.
