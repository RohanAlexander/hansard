I have noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the reason I gave for not going was that the Imperial Conference would not be held next year. That statement is in conflict with the in formation in my possession. The press, perhaps, is confusing two quite different things. It may be true that the Imperial Conference may not be held next year, but we are assured by the British Prime Minister that the PrimeM in isters of the various self-governing Dominions w ill be asked to meet in London next year, in order to consider the very many and complex problems that call for their adjustment. The urgent need for the careful consideration and settlement of the principles upon which the new constitutional relations between B r it a in and the Dominions are based is obvious. It would be dangerous to delay the attempt at settlement. Asi t would be obviously most undesirable that Australia should not be represented by the Prime Minister at such a Conference, and since there is no reason to believe that those vital interests of which the honourable member has spoken are likely to be jeopardized by my absence ister any other information than that from Geneva, I have decided not to prowhich has been published to the effect ceed there; but if I have the honour then that a certain country is going to make to represent this country in my present a determined effort at the Geneva Concapacity, I intend to take part in the ference to upset the decision arrived at deliberations of the Conference of Prime in regard to the policy of a White AusMinisters to be held in England next year. tralia, and that accommodation is being Prime Minister consider that any questo successfully contest the White Austion likely to arise at the Conference of tralia policy at the Conference?

Therefore, unless the Assembly of the League of Nations begins its work by tearing up the Treaty, it cannot disturb the status quo. The honourable gentleman need have no fear of the position.

On the contrary, the liner general cargo rates have in creased this year to all countries excepting Australia. would have been increased had not the action of the Commonwealth Government Line prevented such a step. Some timfr ment that the request of the Conference lines for an increase in the rates for refrigerated space should be refused, and a despatch has now heen received from, the Secretary of Statef o r the Colonies, intimating that the question had been exhaustively examined; but that, in view of the heavy increases in running expenses that had taken place since the rates were agreed to in A p r i l , 1919, it had not been found possible to resist a claim for some increase of charter rates. The British authorities have, therefore, agreed to the rate being increased from 132s. 6d. to 144s. per 40 cubic feet, the increase to take effect from the 1st March, 1920, at which date, the B r it is h Government state, the Conference line* were entitled to, and claimed, a revision. of a reduction in the rate for insulated space, particularly in view of the recent attempt of the shipping companies trading from Australia to increase the rate on scoured wool to the United Kingdom, which was also only prevented by the attitude of the Commonwealth Government Line. As regards the reference to scoured wool, I desire to point out that the action of the Commonwealth Government Line, in refusing to agree to an increase above l j d . per lb., is directly responsible for a saving of i d . per lb. i a freight to the shippers of scoured wool from this country. the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice1.

POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES BILL. General) [8.5] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Treasurer, in delivering his Budget speech, having announced that as part of their financial proposals the Government intended to raise revenue by increasing postage, telegraph, and telephone rates, this B ill is introduced for the purpose of making the necessary increases in postal and telegraph rates. rates are increased by regulation. unnecessary for me to say anything to justify these increases from the general revenue point of view, the Treasurer having done that; but I propose to show that they are perfectly justified from a departmental point of view. It is hardly necessary for me to point out to the House that the working costs of the Postal Department have inevitably increased during recent years, but 1 most apparent. Since 1914 the expenditure on salaries of permanent officers ofmon with other countries throughout the meet the increased cost of living resulting from war conditions, and in addition their work re-appraised by the A r During the years of tlie war the actual A fair basis of comparison would be to take the year ended 30th June, 1914, as compared with the year 1920-21.

A t the present time a large number of Public Service Associations have claims pending before the Arbitration Court, and the great bulk of the increased expenditure which may be involved will have to be met by the Postmaster General's Department. nexion it is well to bear in mind that out of a grand total of approximately 25,000 permanent officers in the Commonwealth Publio Service about 20,000 are employed by the Postmaster-General's Department. Another heading of expenditure, in which honourable members have evinced an active interest, is that of the cost of conveyance of mails on inland road services. ' Quite recently the Government approved of a special concession to mail contractors on account of drought conditions, and, apart fro m the heavy increases arising from that cause, there has been, for a series of years, a noticeable increase in the expenditure under this heading. the actual expenditure for the year 1913-14 under pre-war conditions with the estimated expenditure for the year 1920-21 shows the position: 1913-14-Actua l expenditure .. Â£413,662 1920-21-Estimated expenditure . . 526,200 Increase The policy of the Government, as already announced, is that wherever practicable postal facilities, in the for m of mail services, shall be given to outback and isolated districts, and the pursuance of this commendable ipolicy rmay lead to expenditure in excess ,of the figures I have quoted for 1920-21. In estimating the cost of new services which w ill be established under the ' liberal policyadopted by this Government it is difficult to forecast, even approximately, the lamount involved. Many of these inland postal services do not nay, and many will never pay Mr should not be expected to pay. theless, they must be maintained. Every one knows how essential these mail services are in outback districts, and what they mean to the settlers. A mail service is their one connection with civilization. Those who have read Mrs. Gunn's We of the Never Never will remember the passage in which she describes the arrival of the "" fizzer,"" that is to say, the overland mailman, once every six months. Any Government having regard for the requirements of the outback districts of Australia cannot view outlying mail services only from the point of whether they will or w ill not pay. In this conDuring the war the curtailment of oversea services between Australia and the United Kingdom, particularly the subsidized services of the Orient Company, enabled a considerable reduction to be made in our expenditure for the carriage of oversea mails. The resumption of the normal Orient service during 1920-21 will cast upon the Commonwealth an in creasing rate of expenditure u n t il the f u l l subsidy of at least Â£170,000 under the terms of the present contract is reached. Of this amount, Â£130,770 is provided for 1920-21. r The Treasurer intimated in his Budget 'speech that the necessity for raising extra ; revenue suggested a review of the charges -made for services rendered to the public, The following comparison of ; particularly by the Post Office Department, and that it was proposed to introduce new rates which would have a better relation to the increased cost of supplying those services. 'The war postage rate w ill be abolished by this B ill , but will in future be merged .. Â£112,538 in the general postal rate. Hitherto the Postal Department has merely been used as the means of collecting a tax, receiving no credit whatever for the additional half-penny charged for postage. Now that the postage rate on letters is to be in creased, the whole of the increase over the original penny stamp will be credited to the Department. tend that it is necessary to double the charges ? not greater than that imposed in other countries. The outstanding increase proposed is in the basic letter rate, which is being increase at fche rate of 33$ per oent. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand the rate has been similarly increased, and in SouthA f r i ca an increase of 50 per cent, has been-.imposed. W it h regard to the rates proposed for newspapers, the only alteration in this connection is the incorporation as postage of the amount now charged as war tax,",26,Second Reading

61,Mr Wise,"I do. Our increase isand which has been charged since. October, 1918. In this connection I might point out that in the United Kingdom the rate of postage on newspapers has been increased by 50 per cent., in New Zealand by 100 per cent., and in Canada during the past two years by 300 per oent. Other Administrations outside the British Empire have also, increased the rate of postage on newspapers. A slight alteration is, however, being made in the definition in regard to bulk postag^ of newspapers. I shall go farther into this particular phase of the matter when the B ill is receiving the consideration of honourable members i u Committee. The Treasurer intimated during his Budget speech that it was proposed to increase the charges for telegrams in the Commonwealth by adding 3d. to each of the present rates. TheB ill which is now before the House provides for an increase on these lines, and also for a proportionate increase in the telegraphic rates for press messages. W it h regard to ordinary telegrams, the objection may be raised that the increase proposed is, on a percentage basis, heavier on suburban and city telegrams than upon Intra-State and InterState messages. In reply to this, I desire to say that the main purpose of imposing the extra charge is to get additional revenue, and it wasconsidered that this end would most readily be attained by making an extra charge of 3d. on each telegram, irrespective of the length of the message or the distance over which it was to be transmitted. In comparison w i th other countries, there should be littl e ground for complaint in respect to the charges for telegrams. Kingdom the rates have recently been in creased from 9d. for twelve words and ^d. for each additional word, to Is. for twelve words and I d . for each additional word, which represents an increase of 33$ per cent, on the initial rate, and 100 per cent, on the rate for extra words. When the immense length of lines which have to be maintained and operated, in the Commonwealth is compared with the comparatively short circuits in the United Kingdom, it will be seen that even the new rates proposed are exceedingly liberal. In South Africa the rates were recently increased by approximately 33J per cent., the maximum number of words for the initial charge being twelve, as compared with sixteen words in the Commonwealth. In New Zealand the f rates have been increased from .8d. for twelve words and $d. for each additional word to Is. for twelve words and I d . for each additional word, an increase of 50 per cent, on the initia l charge, and 100 per cent, on the secondary rate. In connection with these matters it is well to remember, in addition to the great increases in salaries, the great increase that has taken place in the cost of material. This also has to be borne in mind in connection with the telephone rates. I may say that the cost of galvanized iron has increased by 600 per cent., that of cable by 100 per cent., and of telegraph equipment by from 50 to 250 per cent. The proposed increase of 3d. per telegram on ordinary telegrams is estimated to bring in annual additional revenue of Â£200,000. The total present revenue from such telegrams is approximately Â£753,000 per annum. Therefore the increase is approximately at the rate of 27 per cent. The increased rates for press telegrams are designed to bring in approximately 27 per cent, extra revenue on this class of business. Taking each' rate individually, the 27 per cent, increase is not apparent, but, in designing the new rates, the press message business had to be taken as a whole; the bulk of press messages fall within the category ""exceeding 100 words."" For instance, on a message containing 150 words, the present and proposed rates would be as under: Within thc State. lnt.cr-St.ite. Particulars. In the United ProPresent. Present. Proposed. posed. *. d. s. d. Â». d. 9. rt. For first 100 words 1 0 1 0 :! 0 S 6 For additional 50 words 0 6 0 S 1 0 1 4 Total2 0 2 5 4 0 4 10 ' Increase (Approx.) 21 per (Approx.) 21 per cent. cont. It might be added that the percentage increase would vary in each instance according to the number of words contained in the message transmitted. Further, the incidence of the previous rates has been observed, as far as practicable in framing the increased charges. Telephone rates are not dealt with in the B ill , but, as I said before, by regulation, and it is proposed to increase the charges .by 25 per cent, on all exchanges of 601 subscribers and over. changes where there are only 600 subscribers there will be no increase. The increased rate will also apply to the charge for calls, which will go up by id. each, but there is no increase in regard to calls where the subscribers number only 600 or under. Where there is a fraction of a penny m the accounts rendered the fraction will be struck off. There will be no increase in the charge for the use of public telephones, which will remain at 2d. In connection with the telephone services, we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears, but it will be a matter of time. There was the difficulty of getting material at almost any price during the war, and there was also the difficulty of raising the necessary funds; but since February last the Treasurer, as I stated, has given me authority to call for tenders, and there are at present orders out amounting in value to Â£544,052, made up as follows:Quantity.

(g) Conduits, &c. 21,895 (A) Insulators Miscellaneous 80,528 Â£554,052 The Treasurer has also given me authority to invite additional tenders amounting to a much larger sum, but those contracts cannot be carried out until the beginning of the next financial year. I mention these facts to show honourable members that we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears as quickly as possible. do you expect from the increased rates? a total Â£325,000 in a full year, and during what remains of the present year we New Zealand anticipate to receive a total revenue of I do' not think it can be said that the Â£257,000.

The whole matter is one of supply _and I demand. Eveni n the earlier period of our existence as a Parliament the available accommodation provided was in several respects inadequate, and makeshift arrangements had to be resorted to in order to overcome some of the difficulties that presented themselves.

The advent of a third party led naturally to a request for special for that party, and for an room for its Leader and his secretary. That additional room I hope to provide by allotting the one now in use by the Accounts shall have removed to new quarters in the city. The need for more rooms for the Hansards t a f f , and for Library storage and other purposes, is one of some urgency. storage and other accommodation, and cupboards of Library matter have to be dumped in the outside passages, and cellars have had to be utilized for the housing of the valuable Petherick Collections and other almost priceless lians. The only accommodation available at present for Ministers, other than the Prinie Minister, is one room-whic h should properly be Mr Speaker's roomand which is common to all Ministers, who have no place where they can interview officials or callers in privacy. Mr Speaker's room is an improvised temporary enclosure of portion of the Library corridor, and is in every way unsuited for the purpose of a room; but no better accommodation is at present available. Heads of Departments, secretaries, and other departmental officials in attendance on Ministers while the House is sitting, are obliged to stand or sit about the corridors and passages, to their own discomfort and the inconvenience of others, because no accommodation is available. Doubtless, when the House meets in its permanent Capital, all these disabilities will be overcome; but, as present indications do not seem to warrant the assumption that removal from the present domicile of Parliament is imminent, or even a realizable possibility however desirable such a change may be -in view of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Prime Minister has approved Sir Elliot Johnson. which of plans for temporary additions to the off odd north wing of the building. These were on submitted by Mr Brittingham, the The State Architect, after consultation with myself. The additions will partially insufficient, meet the more pressing requirements for additional accommodation. I may add that the additions will be reared upon the existing foundations, but that they will be practically of a temporary character; accommodation that is to say, they w ill not be completed additional in their ultimate form, but will be carried out in conformity with the general plan of the building as approved by the State Architects, so that they can later be comCommittee when that body pleted as part of the permanent additions to the building. The plans have been submitted-as I just mentioned-fro m that official to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and they have been approved; For lack of necessary Library and the estimate quoted is the estimate cases of the State Architect. Of course, it will only be a very plain type of structure; there will be no attempt at ornamentation. The additions w ill only provide a room for the Prime Minister, and Austrafor his secretary, a lavatory, and a couple of small rooms for clerks, attendants, and typist. The extensions will render available for other use one or two rooms which are at present engaged. I am not prepared to say whether the proposed work can be carried out within the amount of the estimate. I must leave that phase of the matter to the experts, who are expected to know ruling prices of labour and material, and who have estimated that the extensions can be completed for the sum mentioned. The information just furnished is quite in accord with facts concerning the inadequate accommodation in this building. When one compares the accommodation provided here with that in many of the State Houses, one must admit that this place falls considerably short of what it should be, as the home of the Federal Legislature. the Federal Legislature in this building is only a temporary arrangement.

Althoughi t lacks many of the conveniences of an up-to-date legislative building, and despite that some little expenditure has been incurred now and again, if honourable members will calmly consider the way in which the Federal Legislature has been housed and cared for by the Victorian people and authorities there should be expressions of thanks rather than querulous criticism. does not expect advocates of Canberra to take a calm view of the present position? removal to Canberra, I may say. at onoe that I am not averse to the proposition. The difficulty which confronts me, however, has to do with finance. Asf o r the item actually under discussion, I consider the proposed expenditure upon the additions indicated by the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) eminently reasonable. content themselves with this, namely, that for quite a number of years to come the Federal Parliament will continue to be housed in this building; and it is as well, since there are certain inconveniences occasioned by our being here, that those disabilities should be remedied. In this respect, Mr Speaker and the officials of Parliament are doing a little-and only a little-to endeavour to remedy the somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs. The proposal to spend Â£2,000 in making what may be regarded as a temporary improvement of this building in order to provide greater convenience for members should meet with the ready and unanimous approval of the Committee. financial clouds have rolled by, I , if still a member of this Parliament, shall do my best to expedite the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra, and will vote for the necessary expenditure. But with the present weight of debt upon the shoulders of the people, I am not favorable to the expenditure of a large sum .for that purpose at the present time. member has announced that he w ill vote for the expenditure of Â£2,000 on this building. Honourable members have been complaining that there ""is no accommodation for interviewing their constituents. Standing Committees of this Parliament have had to seek accommodation elsewhere in the city. This Parliament should give early consideration to the very big rent roll which the Commonwealth is paying. Althoughi n time to come this Parliament must be removed to its permanent home in Canberra, accommodation w ill still be required for Federal staffs in the various capital cities. In Sydney, particularly, there is an absolute necessity for a considerable expenditure in providing office accommodation for Federal Departments.

The Public Accounts Honourable members may Committee recommended that the big rent roll should be reduced by the expenditure of money in providing permanent accommodation for the various Departments. The Navy Department and the Defence Department are paying considerable amounts in rents each year in Melbourne and Sydney, and many other Departmentsare doing the same. The Public Accounts Committee calculated that an immediate expenditure in the erection of buildings on property owned by the Commonwealth would be a payable proposition. In the Victoria Barracks area, on St. Kilda-road, the Commonwealth owns acres of land where' Government offices could be built, thus saving rents When the and providing for our officers proper accommodation. This is a matter to which the Committee should give consideration. As private individuals we remain rentpayers no longer than we can avoid.

It was at least due to the Committee that something in the nature of an explanation should be given. None has been given. One of the outstanding features of that Treaty of repudiation into which we entered was the reduction of armaments. one thing which we can understand, and that is an increase of armament-a n increase of the weapons of destruction, an increase of useless waste, an increase of what a Ministeri n another place described as the money spent upon ""our policy of insurance.""

The statements made by the leaders of the Government during the years of war are still green in my memory. We were told that we were engaged in a war to end war, to make the world safe for Democracy, and to bring about a reduction of armaments. Almost every Australian who volunteered to fight in the great war honestly .believed that he was offering his services, and his life, if necessary, in order that the world might never again be deluged with blood, as it has been during the last six years. Those whom they left behind held the same belief, and the men who fell on foreign fields were comforted in the thought that they were giving their lives in order to prevent a repetition of disastrous war. We find now, what, indeed, was apparent to some on this side of the House before, that we were not fighting a war to end war, but that the great struggle would merely mean the building up of vaster armaments and navies. The statement that the great war would end war for all time was nothing but cant, hypocrisy, and humbug. In spite of the sacrifices Australia has made, in spite of the load of debt our people have shouldered, in spite of our huge pensions bill, and inspite of all the pain, suffering, and tears which have been part of the sacrifice of our people, expenditure on armaments and preparations for war is s t ill' to continue. Instead of relief This vote spells at least being afforded us as the result of the sacrifices which Australia made during the recent war, a greater burden than ever is being piled upon the taxpayers. I shall vote against this item. member say that the expenditure is unnecessary 1 hypocrisy and humbug to say that the recent wax was a war to end wars. member say that it is unnecessary to defend Australia? spend the amount that it is proposed to expend upon defence works.

132,Mr Lavelle,"Exactly. We. shouldI sliall, therefore, do everything in my power to prevent effect being given to them. confess that I am somewhat disappointed at the proposed expenditure upon new defence works. As one who justified the recent war I was under the impression whilst the struggle was in progress that it was a war to end wars. But it appears to me that Australia, and, indeed, every other country is now engaged in preparing for future wars. It is the duty of public men in every land to bend their best' energies to the task of preventing wars, and that cannot be done by making preparations for war. peculiar position if we are not ready when the other fellow strikes. have heard all my life. We are told that we must be ready because the other fellow is likely to attack us. As a result the minds of public men r u n only in the direction of making preparations for war, irrespective of their cost. I was hopeful tliat upon the termination of the recent struggle when the representatives of the various nations met in Conference, and drew up the Covenant of the League of Nations, we should be able to devise some means of preventing war, so that we could bring about disarmament to a very large extent. I anticipated that an earnest endeavour would be made to reduce our military expenditure. I am not one of those who anticipate that we shall be plunged in another war in the near future . I know that there are some honourable members who hold that belief. They are constantly telling us that a certain nation is a menace to Australia. nothing to cause me to apprehend that the Commonwealth is in danger. people said the same thing about England only a short time before the war with Germany. member forgets that the League of Nations is already doing good work in regard to the settlement of international disputes. He has also overlooked the fact that it would not be to the interests of anv nation to interfere with the Pacific Islands, seeing that the British Empire and at least one other nation which has not yet entered the League, are vitally interested in the control of those islands. But I do recognise the necessity for reducing our defence expenditure as much as possible. We are now invited to I authorize the expenditure of a larger amount for defence than we voted last year. I was positively amazed last year to find that the sum of Â£78,000,000 had been placed upon the Estimates for defence purposes. I was not present when the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech the other day, and, consequently, I do not know the amount which was actually expended under that heading. Certainly, it must have been a very large one. Still, another huge sum is to be expended this year. How long can we continue to travel along this road? We constantly hear rumblings from the other side of the world-rumbling s which are ominous. We know that in Great Britain there are thousands of unemployed, and that a T h a t is the cry 1 very severe winter is expected there. Similar conditions obtain throughout the rest of Europe, and ere long those conditions must be reproduced in Australia. What position shall we then occupy ? We cannot continue to pile up expenditure for an indefinite period. Last year we expended upon new works and buildings for defence purposes Â£86,579, and this year it is proposed to expend Â£1,302,153. item for air services which, last year, was included in the vote for defence works. an item of Â£294,200 in connection with air services. That means that this year we are practically doubling our expenditure upon new defence works. To-day our revenue is rising by leaps and bounds. But I see Why? Because we are heaping additional taxation upon the people. There ought to be as little expenditure as possible in connection w i th defence, and I believe tem should come to an end. If we are going to continue it , and to provide boots for the trainees, we ought not to pass by honourable our own Commonwealth Factory, which is quite capable of manufacturing all the boots that are required in this connection -boot s of first class quality. was wrong in saying that the Government are proposing to double the expenditure upon defence works this year. They are proposing to spend just twenty times as much this year.",36,Department Of Defence Militarv Apology For The Proposals Here Submitted

140,Mr Tudor,"The honourable membershow the great amount of additional expenditure to which we shall be committed. We talk about the necessity for increased production. production by expenditure upon defence works. These works will produce nothing. We ought, rather, to do our best through the Prime Minister to bring into actual being the League of Nations. To-day the League is merely a skeleton, and we ought to endeavour to infuse l if e into it . These are matters which require serious consideration, and I could not, therefore, permit this vote to pass unchallenged. with those honourable members who have said that we are entitled to some explanation from the Treasurer of the proposed vote for new defence works. TheM in ister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has stated that the figures w it h which I supplied the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) are misleading, and that I should have had regard to the fact that the money which we propose to expend upon these works this year will come out of revenue, whereas the amount expended last year came out of loan moneys. Three items alone of these Defence Works Estimates, namely-Genera l Arsenal, machinery and plant, Â£ 2 4 8 , 6 5 1 ; Cordite Factory, machinery and plant, Â£ 1 0 , 7 7 3, and an amount to be paid to the credit of Trust Fund Small Arms Ammunitio n Accounts for reserve of Â£287,048, involve an expediture, roughly, of Â£560,000. Y e t upon those three items last year we spent only about Â£30,000. The total amount actually expended upon new defence works last year was Â£86,579. The proposed expenditure this year upon the military side alone is set down at Â£1,302,153 , to which must be added Â£294,200 for air services, a total of Â£1,596,000 , as against an actual expenditure last year of Â£86,579. thus be seen that for every shilling we expended last year, it is proposed to exspend a pound this year. single word of explanation has been vouchsafed by the Minister representing the Minister for Defencei n this House. We were told, as has been pointed out tonight, that the last war was a war to end war; but we have also heard that we should he prepared to defend ourselves T h a t only goes to against the other fellow. D o honourable members think that a penny of this expenditure is justified? Are they satisfied? Does every honourable member But we shall not increase know that the money w ill be wisely spent ? I do not think so, at all events. For every shilling we spent last year we propose to spend Â£ 1 this year. That is the position I have gone through the figures very carefully on the various pages of the Estimates, and I challenge the Minister to deny the accuracy of my statements. Are we going to vote the whole of this money blindly? We have been told that we are to have another I agree vote before us this evening, namely, a vote in connection with the Federal Capital site. I am in favour of honouring undertakings, but I am not in favour of this huge expenditure without one word of explanation from the Minister. When we were discussing the Peace Treaty we were told there was to be a general disarmament. Where is the evidence of it in the Estimates? Instead of disarming, we are all the time building up. I have no objection to some of the small items; no objection, for instance, to the proposed expenditure of Â£38,000 for additional machinery for the Cloth Factory, as that could be used for civilian purposes. ber say that any scheme for general disarmament has yet been formulated under the Peace Treaty? small arms ammunition, if any scheme for general disarmament has yet been formulated. In reply I tell him that, under the Peace Treaty, Germany is placed in a much better position than any other country, for the Allies have said, in effect, to Germany, "" We shall disarm you. We shall free you of this load of taxation in connection w i th armaments, but we shall pile up the exI t will penditure upon every other nation.""

Sir GRANVILLEEYRIE , They say that every nation at the present time is busy arming ancl equipping itself for war. was the honourable member for Calare clared that the last war was to be a war to end all wars, spoke with their tongues in their cheeks. I have never heard such ridiculous statements. I am quite sure the honourable member folly, they really thought it would end all wars. we did. But suppose we did. Have we not found out since then that we were wrong, and that the last war has not removed the possibility of other wars? In my opinion, it has not. A great many people pin their f a it h to thc League of Nations as the instrument to prevent future wars. I do not share that belief, but I think we should give the League of Nations a t r i a l . If a tribuna l such as the League of Nations will prevent war in the future, I shall support it heart and soul, for it is most desirable that we should do everything in our power to prevent wars with all its attendant horrors. I do not believe that the League of Nations will prevent f u t u r e wars, and in support of my opinion I may repeat an argument which I have used on other occasions. For years we have been passing legislation in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments for the settlement of industrial disputes. We have laid it down that parties to a dispute must come before certain Tribunals. A t first it was fondly set would be no further strikes; so far from that being the case, I think honourable members will agree with me that tion of this class of legislation strikes in Australia have increased by 100 per cent. A similar result, I think, may be anticipated with regard lo international disputes, for the settlement of which the The . arLeague of Nations has been brought into being. The League of Nations may be likened to a huge Arbitration Court, and, just as in industrial affairs we have experienced repeated strikes in recent years, so, under the League of Nations scheme, we should be prepared for the resort to force by some of the nations included in the League.

It is evidently the intention of the Government to spend even more in extending the system and in compelling the people to live under the iron heel of military rule. member in favour of any military expenditure at all? cause there is hardly any need for it.

The nations that we were opposed to in the recent conflict -'Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey-ar e "" down and out,"" and the Allied Powers have been victorious. victors had played the game> militarism would not be receiving the attention of the world Powers at the present time.

Mr 'HECTOR LAMOND -I s this the brotherhood of man? expression of opinion on the brotherhood of man I shall not appeal to the honourable member for Illawarra. At the termination of the recent conflict America was anxious to disarm, and if the other nations had adopted a similar attitude, disarmament would have been general, and military and naval expenditure all over the world would have been, reduced to a minimum. that leading nations are adopting a policy of disarmament, and the inevitable consequence must be another clash of arms. We are being asked to pass a vote of Â£1,302,000 for defence works for this year. services. additional amount. Great Britain is increasing her military expenditure, and we must therefore expect our outlay in this direction to increase if we are to keep pace with other nations. The burden is becoming so great that the inevitable crash must come, and by deliberately voting for the expenditure of this amount we shall be assisting in perpetuating a system which must eventually lead to other wars. It has been said that the attitude adopted by other nations must control the situation in Australia, but it must be remembered that we are part of the British Empire, and our expenditure should be coupled to some extent with that of Great Britain. We were informed during the recent war that German militarism had to be destroyed beI f the cause of the atrocities perpetrated. One hundred years ago France had to be crushed to secure international peace, and it was because of the position in which France was then placed that Germany became such a formidable military Power. The result of the great war appears to be Who are we preparing to fight.? that, although we have defeated two or three nations, the other Powers are still arming, ancl an Ally of to-day may be an enemy to-morrow. honourable member to say ""we have deI f the Russian people are feated""? honourable gentleman would like me to give the credit to the Win-the-War Government. Such cheap and paltry interjections have no effect upon me, and they are such as one would expect from one with a small mind and weak intellect. I understood the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) to say, by interjection, that no scheme of disarmament had been formulated. If such is the case, who is to blame?

We have not waited until this late hour of the day to get that information. power compulsory training was part of our programme. able member said that it was merely the policy of the Prime Minister. pose the Prime Minister claimed to speak for our party then as he speaks for the honourable member's party to-day; but the simple for m of training when we were in power was very different from the drastic for m of militarism proposed to,day. My attitude has not changed on the question of war generally. I have always been opposed to war. the honourable member signed the platform which included compulsory training. make a l l the points he can out of that interjection, but the experience gained during the last war as to the manner in which our soldiers acquitted themselves has shattered the beliefs of even the most ardent supporter of compulsory training. I was never enamoured of war in any shape or form , and any belief I had in compulsory training was shattered by our experience in the late conflict. I agree that our men were equal to any others at the F r o n t ; yet they had had the The least amount of pre-war compulsory training; and the fact that our soldiers so proved themselves is the best argument why we should put an end to compulsory training. our men had been through compulsory training. very great many. sent. say there was not anything like that percentage, .because all our enlisted men over twenty-five years of age would not have come within the compulsory training provisions.

All honour to those parents who sacrificed their sons, and they deserve something better than the future now proposed for them and their families. In stead of our returned men being able to look forward to a rosy time, they are asked to live under the old conditions; and their little ones, as they come along, are to be trained to be killed later on. If that is to be their. future, the great war was fought in vain. What has become of all the grand promises that were made? menacing or threatening us to-day? The great nations of the earth who were our enemies are all "" d o w n and out."" What chance have they of an early recovery, to be a menace to this country? firmly believe there is a number of heads in the Defence Department who have had a good time for the last four or five years, with no necessity to fight in the trenches, and they wish to keep their present positions. I do not say that that is the motive of the Assistant Ministerf or Defence( Sir Granville R y r i e ) ; hut there is no doubt a move has been made by the militarists in the Department to keep their rosy billets. Treasurer, in the course of his Budget speech, saidIn considering the large expenditure which the people of Australia are being asked to hear as the result of the war, it should be borne in mind that Australia's burden is much heavier than that of some of thc other Dominions owing, principally, to the great difference in .the distances over which troops liad to bo transported to the various battle fronts. show that tlie casualties among Australian soldiers, as compared with enlistments, were higher than among those of any other .portion of the Empire.

Some of us said that Australia, as compared with 'the other Dominions, had done more than her share; and for that we were told we were disloyal, and had many uncomplimentary terms applied to us. want Australia to do any more. honourable gentleman can now address the Treasurer on that point; because the Treasurer now agrees that we were right. ferent circumstances. new Minister is coming on-h e is able to put the Ministerial interpretation on things. As I have already said, we on Where is the nation that is this -side were called disloyal when we contended that' Australia had done more than her part as compared w it h other parts of the Empire. that time? we had certain facts and figures before us. We said it when the war was o n ; and now that the war is over, the Treasurer practically admits that what we then said was true. If , as I believe, Australia played an unequalled part in the war, it is poor satisfaction to the people of this country to know that, instead' of this money being spent for the benefit of returned soldiers, maimed in the war which The was to end war, it is to be devoted to training our youth for future wars.

Since the date of the statement which the honourable member has quoted, Mr Lloyd George, at the Spa Conference, insisted that Germany had 1,200,000 rifles in the hands of German soldiers. That was in May of this year-no t in October last. He told the Germans then that they were not doing what they said they would do-that they had 400,000 men still under arms in Germany.

From the British Hansard for 1920-21 I gather that the proposed expenditure on the British Navy for this year is Â£84,372,300, as against an actual expenditure last year of Â£157,528,000. It will be remembered by the honourable member that Great Britain was at war last year. Now she No honourable member will is not at war. The proposed expenditure upon the British Navy this year is, therefore, a Peace expenditure. I have given the estimate which was made by the First Lord of the Admiralty. If we compare the amount -per capita charged in Great Britain under this heading withthat charged in Australia, what do we find? Under our Estimates for the current year we shall pay 12s. 5d. per head, per head. I come now to the British Army estimates. The Estimates for the current financial year make provision for a net expenditure of Â£125,000,000. The total establishment provided for is 525,000 officers and men, and this number is in process of reduction to 280,000. In addition, Great Britain is spending upon air services a sum of Â£15,173,430. ter will quote from the British Hansard next time. have given are taken from an official document which has been forwarded to me. am very sorry that any action taken by me this evening should have resulted in unpleasantness; but I thought that I might express an opinion upon this matter without hurting anybody's feelings.

And that is the policy of the Government. I am not blaming the Treasurer. I do not condemn him because of the state of public opinion, and the absolute incapacity of the newspapers to provide a compass for public guidance, wherever.they may be. The mere con-, demnation of somebody else is not guidance, but useless criticism. I do not condemn the Treasurer, because he realizes the situation clearly and ' definitely. He sees the Â©nonmous load of unproductive debt that weighs upon the resources of this country. Our chief means at this juncture is derived from the flowing revenue that comes to us through the customs, in consequence of the enormous price of imported goods. There is no need to increase the Tariff, as the price of commodities that come into the Commonwealth are double and treble what tbey usually are. But the slump must come, and when prices are reduced the revenue must also fall. The Treasurer has said that he has a remedy, and that we can pay off our debts by having a Sinking Fund. Isi t suggested that our enormous debt can be liquidated from a Sinking Fund? Some day it will be paid off, but not in our time, even at thÂ© rate the honourable gentleman proposes. Before that day and before that hour, other more pressing and vital problems will be upon us. They are coming rapidly. The Treasurer thinks there is a virtue in a Sinking Fund. GovernmentI defy the Treasurer to mention one-o r any State or any country that did not dip its fingers into a Sinking Fund whenever it was short of money. Progress reported.
