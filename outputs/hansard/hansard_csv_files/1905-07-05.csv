14,Motion (By Mr Reid ) Proposed,"the last opportunity I shall have for a little while to speak from this bench. I should like"" to convey to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, on behalf of the members of the direct Opposition, our reciprocation of the most generous feeling that he has evinced during the time that he has been in office. I am sure that for every one of the members of the Ministry we. on this side, have the highest personal respect. We have had to differ very materially from them, and welcome their disappearance from office; but that is quite another matter from our personal feelings in regard to them. As we might have expected from the long political experience of most ot them, there is nothing to which exception could be taken in regard to anything but their policy, to which we decidedly object. have obtruded at this time a subject foreign to the business on hand were it not that the liberty of a man is in question, and I wish to put his case as clearly as I can before the gentleman who is to be chosen Minister of Defence, because the present Minister has refused to recognise his claim for consideration. member may himself become the new Minister of Defence. in worse hands. A man named William Thomas Sheehan has been detained at Queenscliff by the military authorities, in my opinion altogether against the law, and certainly in violation of the rights which every man in the Commonwealth should enjoy as a British citizen. Sheehan enlisted a few months ago at the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, in response, to aln advertisement He assures me-and his statement is confirmed by three other men who were recruited at the same time-that he was told that if he did not like the service he could obtain his discharge upon applying to the proper authorities within three months, and paying the release fee of £ 2 . He states that this information was conveyed to him by the enlisting officer, Sergeant-major Paul. I have taken the trouble to verify the statements, and I find that a similar promise was held out to other recruits who were enlisted at about the same time. For reasons that were good or bad, Sheehan did not like the service, and within the prescribed period tendered his release fee of £ 2 and applied for his discharge. He now finds, however, after having been three months in the service, that he cannot obtain his discharge, and he is threatened with punishment if he deserts. I wrote to the Minister conveying the statements communicated to me by Sheehan, and I have received a reply which reads as follows: Melbourne, ist July, 1905. DEAR SIR, In reply to your letter of the 29th ult., I desire to inform you as follows, in regard to the statements made in the inclosure thereto :(1) It is the practice in connection with enlistments for the Royal Australian Artillery for the conditions of service to be read to the men offering to enlist. (2) Re discharges under Part X., para. 18, of the Regulations, as you know, no soldier in the Permanent Forces can claim his discharge until the expiration of his term of service; but he may, at any time within three months after enrolment, obtain his discharge free, if approved by the District Commandant. I understand that in the case under notice the Commandant did not so approve. Sheehan, it is stated, did apply to see the Commandant, who, however, did not see him, but gave a decision as before mentioned. Sheehan does not appear to have marie any request for his application to be referred beyond the Commandant. * * * * * Yours truly, J. W. McCAY. Captain the Hon. R. A. Crouch, M.P., Federal Parliament House, Melbourne. The regulations provide that a man cannot leave the service unless the District Commandant approves. I desire honourable members to recognise that Sheehan was not told at the time of enlistment that the approval of the Commandant would be required before he could obtain his discharge, nor were any regulations read over to him. for recruits. learned member's pardon. I have not the papers with me, but my information is to the effect that the man was fully informed of the whole of the conditions of service. the letter, which merely saysI t is the practice in connection with enlistments for the Royal Australian Artillery for the conditions of service to be read to the men offering to enlist. so read over to Sheehan. his statement is confirmed by several others.

When he applied to see the District Commandant, he was told he would have to wait until he could go to Melbourne, or until the District Commandant came to Queenscliff. to bring the matter before the incoming Minister of Defence? that also; but I contend that it is not fair that Sheehan should be detained, even until Friday next. If he deserts, he will be cast into gaol at Queenscliff for seven days with hard labour, 'and will be detained in barracks for a further similar period. It may be a mere trifle to the Minister that a man should be detained contrary to the terms of enlistment as explained to him by the sergeant-major this case because Sheehan is one of my constituents. He comes from that part of the State represented by the honourable member for Corangamite, and his people are farmers in prosperous circumstances. It does not matter to me, however, whether or not the man has relatives or friends; he has rights, and one of those is an honourable carrying out of the conditions under which he is engaged. learned member had given me notice of his intention to bring this matter before the House, I should have brought the papers with me. ter's letter only a few minutes ago. was written on the ist inst. he should have a clear recollection of the circumstances. Sheehan denies, that the regulations were read over to him, and his statement is confirmed by five others, three of whom were enlisted at the same time. All these men were promised, by the only non-commissioned officer whom they saw prior to enlistment, that they would have the right of discharge at the end of three months, and it seems unfair that they should be now denied an opportunity to leave the service if they so desire. tually confined to barracks, and is not permitted to see the Commandant to make his complaint. cape he will be punished as a deserter, and he is unable to see the District Commandant. ' In the communications sent to the Commandant the reasons given by Sheehan for wishing to obtain his discharge are not properly or fully stated by the Commanding Officer, and I contend that he has been most unjustly dealt with. An Honorable MEMBER -The honourable and learned member is now making a charge against the Commanding Officer. I am ready to stand by it . I have made f u l l inquiries, and I know that Sheehan's representations were not properlv conveyed to the District Commandant. The Commanding Officer, instead of allowing Sheehan to see the District Commandant, and to make his complaints, forwarded an incomplete statement of his own The Minister has a statement of what Sheehan's complaints were, and also of what was sent along by Major Hawker. It is the right of every man, whether he be a soldier or a citizen, to state his own case, and not to have some one else's words put into his mouth. He should have the right which he now has not got to put his own complaints in writing. I think that the Minister even, during the short time for which he may remain in office, should make further inquiries into this matter. of the incoming Minister to the honourable the honourable and and learned member's statement, as reported in Hansard; that is all I can do. make further inquiries this afternoon.

In formation which has been conveyed to me tends to show that a promise made to honourable members by the Treasurer is in danger of being broken. When the last Estimates were under discussion, he told us that the Public Service classification would be subject to the review of this House before any action was taken. I am informed that a number ot postmasters who have Sheehan is now virhitherto been classified as senior to certain telegraph operators have been reduced to the position of juniors.

I would, therefore, ask the Minister for Home Affairs to make inauiries with a view to insuring that no steps shall be taken to carry out the classification scheme until honourable members have had f u l l opportunities to discuss it . Sydney-Minister for Home Affairs) -The matter referred to by the honourable and learned member for Wannon now comes under my notice for the first time. I shall make the desired inquiries. Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (South Sydney). I merely wish to endorse the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and to ask the Minister to also consider the case of those officers in the mail branch, whom it is proposed to remove from the clerical to the general division. large number of officers will be placed at a great disadvantage by the proposed change^ and I hope that the Minister will give honourable members an opportunity of considering the classification scheme before they are asked to vote supplies for the current year. It is highly important that the rights of these officers should be protected and legally defined before supplies are voted. take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the remarks which my old friend and former colleague, the right honourable member for Balaclava, has made this afternoon. Sir friends. that had we been capable, in the emotional circumstances of last Thursday, of following one another's remarks as closely as would be possible under normal conditions, no misunderstanding would have arisen, because, prior to the speech of the right honourable gentleman, I had already mentioned to the House that the words I had used with reference to the communications which had passed between myself and other honourable members and persons with regard to the political situation had been enlarged very much beyond the meaning I had intended to convey. referred to were mainly by letter, and were replied to in 'my customary way, which, as honourable members know, is, even for correspondence, rather brief. The comments were almost invariably made by my correspondents, and my replies related only to the two general questions mentioned by me to Ministers, and in no way to the position of the Ministry. I felt sure that, after having called attention to these remarks, and having given him an opportunity to read them, the right honourable gentleman would see that his inference that I had in any respect treated him less considerately than others, was unjust, and that, on the contrary, I had expressed my views to him far more fully than to any one else, except his leader, the Prime Minister. With reference to the feelings which have existed between honourable members andMinisters, I may say that the pleasant relations between myself and Ministers have remained unbroken during the whole term of office of the present Government, and that in any communications they have had with me they have A in every instance observed the most strictly constitutional and proper procedure. that the case brought under notice by the honourable and learned member, f ° Corio is r deserving of more attention than, has been given to it by the Minister. If it could be shown that any man had been unjustly detained in barracks at Queenscliff, this House would willingly see that the wrong was righted. The Minister may assume that he has no further responsibility, but I would remind him that he has failed to abolish; the infamous rule that a member of the rank and file of the Royal Australian Artillery should not be permitted to submit himself for examination with a view to I am sure tion in existence. the Royal Australian Artillery rise to the position of an officer without resigning from the force? tion given to me some time ago is absolutely at variance with the facts.
