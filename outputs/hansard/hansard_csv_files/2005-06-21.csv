It being apCapital City Traffic (Question No. 652) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) Has he read The Bureau of Transport Economics (BTE) report titled ‘Urban Transport – Looking Ahead’ which reports that traffic congestion in Australia’s major cities will cost the Australian Economy around $30 billion per year by 2015; if not, why not. (2) Has he also read the recently released report commissioned by the City of Sydney titled “Integrated Transport Strategy– Mass Transit for CBD and Inner Sydney” (Report to City of Sydney, February 2005) which states that South-East Queensland achieved an immediate 10% lift in public transport patronage when it introduced the world’s largest integrated fares network, covering the region between Noosa and the NSW border; if not, why not. (3) What is the Government doing to prevent the $30 billion per year loss of productivity to the Australian economy expected by 2015 due to traffic congestion in Australia’s major cities. (4) Will he cooperate with state and local governments to fund (a) research into the transport needs of public transport users and other commuters in Sydney and all major cities, (b) feasibility and cost studies into public and private funding for mass transit or light rail networks in Sydney and all major cities, and (c) planning and the installation of mass transit or light rail networks in Sydney and all major cities; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. (1) and (2) I am aware of both reports. (3) The urban road network is primarily the responsibility of States and Territories. However, the Australian Government is assisting jurisdictions to help tackle urban congestion. Through the Government’s innovative and far-reaching AusLink National Land Transport Plan and funding programme, there is a strong focus on tackling congestion on nationally important road and rail routes. AusLink has extended the National Network through major urban areas to key ports and airports. The Government is making substantial investments, over a 5 year $12.5 billion programme, to alleviate urban congestion on these links. (4) The Australian Government is working cooperatively with States and Territories on AusLink and other initiatives. The Australian Government chairs a Standing Committee on Transport (SCOT) inter-jurisdictional group established by the Australian Transport Council which is examining urban congestion both passenger and freight. The group aims to build on initiatives undertaken by States to seek to develop a national perspective on congestion alleviation. The Australian Government also chairs the SCOT National Guidelines Assessment Methodology Working Group. One of the tasks of this group is to extend the National Assessment Guidelines to urban and public transport issues. This will help develop a consistent methodology for assessing public transport projects alongside road-based projects. However, the funding and provision of urban public transport systems is fundamentally a State responsibility.

(2) What funding has the Government provided for mass transit or light rail projects and where are the projects located. (3) What is the Government doing to assist state and local governments to promote public transport and alleviate traffic congestion in (a) Sydney and (b) Australia’s other major cities. (1) Each of the specified Governments maintained programmes relating to urban public transport (UPT). The primary purpose of the UPT programmes was to provide financial assistance for projects, in accordance with state priorities, which would reduce traffic or wear and tear on urban arterial roads. Among other things, the various UPT programmes from time to time provided funding for mass transit or light rail projects, including for trams. The Federal UPT programme was discontinued in 1993/94, following a realignment of responsibilities and funding arrangements. The then Federal Government ceased direct funding of UPT projects through transport funding mechanisms, with UPT “tagged” funds being rolled into the total provided to the States to meet their responsibilities. (2) The Australian Government has co-funded a recently completed $1.95 million prefeasibilty study for the development of a light rail system on the Gold Coast. (3) The Government’s approach is that these issues are primarily state responsibilities and that the Australian Government’s role lies in addressing national planning and national market facilitation objectives. The Government’s $12.5 billion AusLink programme provides mechanisms, such as the development of corridor strategies which will clearly benefit Sydney and other major cities. The AusLink National Network connects all capital cities and major regions across Australia. Under AusLink, funds are provided for the provision of road and rail links in urban and outer metropolitan regions of all capital cities to ensure that freight brought into the cities along the AusLink National Network can reach its destination, particularly where it is bound for ports or airports. In addition to providing funds for urban projects on the National Network, AusLink also provides funds directly to Local Councils under the Roads to Recovery (R2R) component. Under R2R, funding is available to councils for use on the local roads that support public passenger transport. The rail component of AusLink, provides the means for implementation of a $1.8 billion rail infrastructure investment programme across the AusLink National Network. The increased investment in rail infrastructure will enable rail to take more of the burden of traffic growth and help contain congestion on the road system. The Australian Government, together with State and Territory Transport Ministers, as members of the Australian Transport Council, have agreed to the establishment of an inter-jurisdictional working group of officials to drive a work programme on select strategic transport issues, including urban congestion management. The Working Group has been established under the auspices of the Standing Committee on Transport (SCOT). It includes all levels of government and is chaired by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The Working Group is aiming to identify priority issues where governments can cooperate to alleviate urban congestion. It is due to report by the end of 2005.",128,Questions In Writing
187,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Australian Government also participates in SCOT’s Australian Passenger Transport Group (formerly the Public Transport Modal Group) which, among its other responsibilities, is developing a more strategic approach to public transport as a component of the passenger transport task.

(3) Take-up of the scheme has been lower than originally forecast in the 1997-98 Budget. Notwithstanding this, it is important to note that: take-up of the scheme is substantial – almost one-fifth of people of age pension age who are working are registered in the scheme a further one third receive Age Pension and concessions while they work; and take-up has been affected by changes made to the social security system since the scheme commenced as part of the Government’s tax reform package, from July 2000 the Government reduced the social security income test taper rate from 50 per cent to 40 per cent and increased the rate of pension through a one-off adjustment over and above the usual indexation arrangements these changes have made it relatively more attractive for people of age pension age who are working to claim a part pension and pensioner concessions while they work.

203,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) Will the Government implement a key finding of its Employer Incentive Strategy to develop a public awareness campaign aimed particularly at employers to encourage the hiring of people with disabilities; if so, when. (8) What measures is the Government taking to counter negative employer attitudes that prevent economic participation for those with disabilities. (9) Is he aware that the proportion of Federal public servants with a disability has fallen from 5.8% to 3.8% during the period of the current Government and can he say what steps are being taken by the Government to reverse this decline. (10) Why has the Government delayed the training and employment measure announced in the 2002 Federal budget. (1) The unemployment rate for people with disabilities was 8.6% in 2003. (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers Summary of Findings, 4430.0, table 8, p26). This is the latest available data. (2) There are 12 specialist Job Network providers who specialise in assisting people with disabilities, or particular types of disability. There are 37 sites nationally that service people with disabilities. These 12 specialist organisations account for 11% of all Job Network organisations. (3) The percentage increase in the number of people with disabilities entering the workforce from 1993 to 2003 is 38.1 per cent (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers Summary of Findings, 4430.0, table 8, p26. 1998 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers Summary of Findings, 4430.0, table 9 p21 and 1993 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers Summary of Findings, 4430.0, table 9 p21). (4) All Job Network Members are required to provide services to people with disabilities. The Government is committed to ensuring job seekers with disabilities can access employment assistance as required. (5) The Department does not collect detailed information about the structure or staffing of Job Network Members. (6) The following table provides expenditure on employment assistance for people with disabilities in 2003-04.

In addition, in excess of $40 million was expended for job seekers with a disability in the Job Network in 2003-04. The OECD do not provide data on the OECD average for expenditure on employment programs for people with disabilities due to data limitations. Country comparisons are difficult due to programs being run at regional, municipal, or national level and respective statistics expenditure is either unavailable or hard to obtain.

204,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) In the 2005 Budget, the Government provided $50 million over four years for the employer demand strategy. The strategy has three components aimed at increasing workforce participation for targeted groups in key industries and includes improving employer awareness of the benefits of hiring people with disabilities. The strategy includes: a focus on those industries that have greatest potential to provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities such as those with a part-time or casual workforce and who are experiencing labour and skill shortages; in collaboration with industry groups, employers and employment service providers developing practical solutions to recruit people with a disability to address labour and skill shortages; showcasing to other industry groups, employers and employment service providers successful strategies to recruit and retain people with a disability In addition, the Government will provide $29 million over four years to implement a communication strategy focusing on increasing workforce participation. (8) The Government has already funded a number of pilot projects, training and employment strategies for people with a disability under the Employment Innovation Fund (EIF). As announced in the 2005 Budget, $50 million is being provided for the employer demand strategy to promote the employment of people with disabilities. The Government has also established an Employer Roundtable for people with disabilities to provide high level advice on ways to increase workforce participation for people with disabilities. The Employer Roundtable is made up of employers and peak bodies and is responsible for developing an action plan to drive employer demand for people with a disability. (9) Yes. The number of people with a disability in the Australian Public Service has been in decline since 1990. A number of measures are in place to promote the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities into the Australian Public Service. All Australian Government agencies are required, as part of the Commonwealth Disability Strategy, to remove barriers for people with a disability by ensuring access to buildings, services, information, employment, education, sport and recreational activities. The Public Service Commissioner’s Directions require that Agency heads put in place measures to prevent discrimination in their workplace and recognise the positive advantages of diversity in the workplace. The Public Service Commissioner is also a member of the recently formed Employer Roundtable for People with Disabilities. (10) The $258 million announced in the 2002 Budget for employment services and training places was part of a package of reform to help people with disabilities. When the Opposition blocked the legislation for the reforms to the Disability Support Pension it also blocked the associated funding. As part of the Welfare to Work package announced in the 2005 Budget, the Government has allocated $482.3 million over four years for employment related assistance for people with disabilities.
