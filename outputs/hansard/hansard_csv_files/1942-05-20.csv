Sometimes commanding the 6th May last, the Government Whip, the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan), visited South Australia in order to find out why conditions in that State were so different from those in other States that horse racing had to be banned in South Australia, although it could be permitted in other States?

Army has already answered several questions on this matter. When this matter was first raised some weeks ago, the Minister for the Army, quite right on the evidence in his possession, made a statement. Arising out of that evidence legal action has been taken against those to whom his remarks were directed. It cannot be inferred that he has general evidence involving people other than tho3e who have already been brought .before the court. directed attention to the charges made and said that the law would be invoked and that the people referred to would be charged before the court. all members of the Australia First Movement who had been interned would he charged. seem to be distorting the facts.

Some members of the Australia First Movement in Western Australia were prosecuted, because the Minister thought that he had evidence warranting more than internment. The House must appreciate that the action promised by the Minister has been taken. to be members of the Industrial Workers of the World were imprisoned, and were subsequently granted a public inquiry presided over by a justice of the Supreme Court to determine the validity of the charges originally laid against them, I ask the Attorney-General whether the Government will act similarly in regard to members of the Australia First Movement and give to them the earliest possible opportunity to answer before a justice of the Supreme Court the charges made against them? honourable gentleman would not hold me responsible for what happened in this country during the last war. However, I repeat that I think this matter is being distorted.

GIFT DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL 1942. Debate resumed from the 6th May (vide page 929), on motion (by Mr method of valuing shares in publitCuiFLirr) That the bill be now read a second time. There are few things in this bill to which I take exception. The measure seeks to amend the Gift Duty Act 1941, which was introduced into this Parliament in December last. It appears that in the administration of that legislation the need for certain amendments has arisen. The most important amendment relates to the effect of the existing legislation upon transactions which were completed as between the donor and the donee before the commencement of the act. When the original bill was before the Parliament, the Government admitted the principle that transactions which had been completed as between thc donor and the donee before the date on which the intention to introduce such a measure was announced, would not be subject to gift duty. The measure then introduced and amended was thought to meet that situation, but subsequent events have shown that it did not do so. The present bill has been drafted in order to overcome that defect. The Government has referred this bill to the same committee of members of all parties as considered the original measure. As to the effectiveness of this amendment, I rely upon the legal member of the Opposition party on the committee who was satisfied that the amendment would accomplish what it is designed to achieve. That being so, the a way any doubt that may have adversely .Toc-teil transactions which were not iiilv-nih-vi to be taxed by the Gift Duty Assessment Act wheu it was passed last Decomber. It would be unjust, and I do not think that the Governmcu. so intended, that transactions whicli had been completely satisfied before that date should subsequently become subject to gift duty. The bill makes another important amendment in dealing with the valuations, which are placed upon shares in private companies for purposes of gift duty. A similar amendment is contained in the Estate Duty Bill 1942. The amendment has a background that indicate the need for some alteration. Honourable menibers may be aware that the companies presents very few difficulties to thc commissioners who administer the Estate Duty Act. and it i expected that the valuation of =nch share? will present few difficulties to thc authority who is charged with the administration of the Gift Duty Act. Public companies are listed upon stock exchanges, which have been able to asses? the valuations of the shares, taking into account the various influences which go to make up a fair valuation. Stock exchanges have not been slow to recognize the earning capacity of shares in certain public companies, and have taken into account the nature of the undertaking, the assets, their realizability and other influences which affect the financial position of the company. They",20,Consultation With Parties

90,Mr Spooner (Robertson) [3.26],"have not overlooked such factors as whether the company is amply capitalized, and if it is not, whether that might result in the company (being unable to stand the strain of special emergencies and weather any storm that might overtake it. As the result of long experience, stock exchanges have evolved accurate and reliable indicators of valuation, and do not fail to arrive at a reasouable estimate of the values of shares in public companies. For that reason, the valuation of such shares does not present many serious difficulties to thc commissioners who are charged with the administration of the estate duty legislation, and other legislation such as the Gift Duty Act. When we come to the affairs of private companies, the position is altogether different, because they are not listed on .stock exchanges. In many cases, the shares are held by a comparatively few people and the articles of association contain restrictive clauses which make the transfer of shares, if not difficult, at least subject to onerous conditions. Sometimes the articles of association embody conditions which give to a governing director r-ontrol over the appropriation of the company's income, and cause fche company to disclose net eamir.^-that are sub-normal. matters because evidently administrative difficulties have been found, and will be found in future, in placing valuations upon shares in private companies which are the subject of gh'ts or, in relation to other legislation, which are assets in a deceased estate. The Government has sought a way in which to overcome the difficulty. Clause8 of this bill provides the machinery lor a commissioner to arrive at a valuation in a manner similar to ""that which would be followed by those who are responsible for arriving at the valuations of shares when they are the subject of stock exchange registrations. For that reason, I am entirely in agreement with proposed new paragraphs d and e of section 3 3 of the principal act. I regard the proposed new paragraph / as unnecessary, as the Commissioner may well rely upon proposed new paragraphs d and e. Paragraph / empowers the Commissioner to use an alternative method of computation of assets and liabiliti.es, namely, the assumption that the company was being voluntarily wound up on the date that the gift was made. In its present form, that paragraph grants to the Commissioner an unfettered discretion to adopt that method of valuation if he so chooses, and to decide the amount that the shareholder would receive from the company if it, were being wound up voluntarily. That paragraph, which was the subject of consideration by the all party committee to which the Government referred the bill, will be amended. The Treasnrer ( Mr Chifley) has already circulated proposed amendments that provide, in respect of clause 8, for an appeal against the Commissioner's discretion and decision. Paragraph /, being unnecessary and redundant, should not have been included in the bill, but the Government deems it advisable to insert the provision and has agreed to improve the position by inserting in clause 8 a condition that any valuation by, and any discretion of the Commissioner, shall be subject to appeal. be made? Land Valuation Board in respect of valuations, and to the Income Tax CourtI mention those of Appeal in respect of financial matters. appeal would be to the High Court? the bill, although I consider that the alternative method of valuation should not have been included. The Commissioner will find it difficult to apply this clause; and if he does apply it, he may find it capable of doing an injustice to the donor or the donee. In other cases where he may seek to apply it, he may find that it will ricochet against himself, and that is not advisable. It is not right that there should be any unfavorable or favorable operation of the provision. However, the right of appeal will assist to stabilize the position. This provision is contained in similar legislation in Queensland and New South Wales, and I think that I am correct in saying that it has been used seldom and with very great caution. The necessity for that will be .recognized by honourable members. As the Government has agreed to",21,Second Reading

The bill does not introduce into the act any otber new principles, and I have no objection to k . The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner), quite properly, has said that clause 5 was approved in its present d r a f t by the special committee which dealt with this matter. It will be remembered that when the G if t Duty Assessment B ill was previously before this House, I pointed out that, there are many incomplete gifts which it was not the intention of the Government to pick up, but which would be picked up by the legislation as then framed. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) ."".greed to consider that point, and the present measure i? the result. honorabi"" member for Robertson has said that he has been assured by the legal member of the committee that the difliculty has been met. Alt-hough I have very great respect for that legal member, I entirely disagree with his view. Many gifts, such as a g if t of shares, are complete in law when the assignment or transfer has been signed by the transferor. It is important to stress that it is not necessary for the transferor to divest himself of the legal titlo in respect of the g if t . It is still possiHef o r himI use the word "" possible"" because it appears in the clause-to procure registration of it . Take as a further example the transfer of land, which requires registration before the title in it passes. The donor may, if he so chooses, have the transaction registered. It is possible for him to divest himself of his interest in the property, but it is not necessary to do so in order to enable the g if t to take effect. Before drawing attention to the terms of the clause, I consider it advisable to refer to a classical decision in this matter -Awning v. Anning (1907), 4 C.L.R., at page 1057. The Chief Justice, delivering a judgment in which the court concurred, statedThe question therefore arises, and must be answered with respect to each class of property described in the deed, whether the donor did everything which, according to the nature of the property, was necessary to be done in order to transfer the property and make the gift binding upon himself. I think that the words "" necessary to be done"", as used by Turner LJ . in Milroy v. Lord (1), mean necessary to be done by the donor. Thus, in the case of shares in a company which are only transferable by an instrument of transfer lodged with the company, I think that the donor has done all that is necessary on his part as soon as he has executed the transfer. So, in thc case of a gift of land held under the acts regulating the transfer of land by registration, I think that a gift would be complete on execution of the instrument of transfer and delivery of it to the donee. Tf, however, anything remains to be done by the donor, in the absence of which the donee cannot establish his title to the property as against a third person, the gift is imperfect, and in the absence of consideration the court will not aid the donee as against the donor. I apologize for reading that statement, of law; but it is important to ascertain whether this clause, as framed, accomplishes what the Government has in mind. The clause readsThe Provided that this sub-section shall not operate to make subject to gift duty any gift of property where the Commissioner is satisfied that the donor had, prioT to the commencement of this act, done everything which it was necessary using the exact words used in all the authoritiesand possible for him to do to divest himself of the property. It seems quite clear that, in respect of a trait-!"" of land requiring registration to p.ias the title ; a transfer of shares, the rille not passing until the transfer is registered by the company; and the withdrawal of money from a savings bank, which does not pass unti l the money has been handed over, altliough the g if t is complete wlr -n f , r withdrawal slip, together with the deposit book, has been handed to tlie donee to be taken to the bank; tnerc are three lliings possible to ! e i one liv thc donor, hut not necssiry 1 to Li doin' in order to make the gift effective. matter of the cioij.? doing the rest? course, does it . It is because the donor has done all that is necessary to be done, that the law says that it is a perfectly good g if t .

I understand the point which the honourable member is putting. The point should be and would be completely met by the words "" what was necessary to be done"". I am satisfied that the addition of the words "" and possible "" will lead only to confusion, and exclude some of the cases which the Treasurer has in mind, and which should come under the provisions of this clause. possible for the donor to do anything further if he hands over the documents, as one does in a transfer of land, or a transfer of shares in a company. that has been done it is not possible for him to do anything further, apart from reclaiming, or, in respect of a transfer of shares, going to the company and ensuring that the transfer, when presented, will be accepted by the directors of the company. instances that could be debated if one had the nature of the property under consideration. I suggest to the Treasurer that the wording of the clause should he altered, so as to read "" everything which was necessary to be done to divest himself of all beneficial interest in the property, the subject of the g if t "" . That would place the matter beyond doubt. I apprehend that, if the matter be not dealt with in that or some similar way, this provision will be a fruitfu l cause of litigation. Quite apart from the substance of that argument, there is a second matter to which I desire to draw attention If the Commissioner were not satisfied, then, although he might not be able tcsupport his contention in a court of law, I think that no appeal from that conclusion would lie undr.r this measure. Althoughi t might be clearly established before a court of law that no, duty was payable, the essential condition would be that before advantage could be taken of the clause, the Commissioner must he satisfied. If the law were to provide that it shall be open to the donor to challenge before a proper tribunal the contention that a gift has not. been effected and completed before the rebate should not be dependent upi n the view of the Commissioner. I deprecate the tendency in all taxation measures to throw as great a burden as possible on the taxpayer, and to preclude him from challenging what in point of fact he should he entitled to challenge, namely, whether his obligation to pay, as alleged by the Commissioner, is properly imposed or not. I am glad that the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) is in the chamber, because I think that this is a matter of importance to which members with legal training might give consideration. The words ""where the Commissioner .is satisfied that"" rob the clause of a great deal of its value, because, if the Commissioner says that he is not satisfied, that disposes of the matter and there is no right of appeal. No reference has been made by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) to clause 7 of the bill, and I understand that none was made by the -special committee. The clause states:There are many other Clause 15 of thc principal act is amended by omitting the words "" that property is also included in the estate of a deceased person "", and inserting in their stead the words "" the donor dies and that property is also included in his estate "". That is substantially merely an alteration of verbiage. I draw the attention of the Government to a matter that is germane to this clause.

101,Mr Spender,"Obviously , whenof the act within one year before his or her decease, such property is to be included in the dutiable estate of that person. Under clause 3 of the Estate Duty Assessment Bill the period of one year has been increased to three years. Gifts are now subject to Commonwealth gift duty, and it is now proposed that a gift duty and also an estate duty shall bo imposed in respect of a single disposition of property. In other words, when the gift is made it is subject to the gift duty, and, if the donor dies within three years of making the gift, it is then subject to the estate duty. Tihe object of this clause is to provide that a rebate he made. It is obvious that the Government does not desire, and I do not think this House would desire, fche imposition of two levies upon a single transaction. Section 15 of the principal act, which is proposed to he amended, providesWhere a gift of .property is liable to gift honourable member for Robertson ( Mr duty and that property is also included in the estate of a deceased person for the purposes of the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914-1040, the Commissioner may grant a rebate of the amount of gift duty payable in respect of that gift or so much of that gift duty as is equal to the amount by which the estate duty is increased by reason of the inclusion of tnat property, whichever is the lesser amount. I do not know why the word "" may "" is used, if it be intended that the rebate should be made because of the death. other circumstance. the word "" may "" is included, the implication is that in certain circumstances the rebate will be made and, in certain other circumstances, it will not. Since, in point of fact, the amount of gift duty is substantially the same as the amount of estate duty, it seems to me that, when we are dealing with this matter in committee, the word "" may"" should be altered to "" s h a l l u n l e s s it can be shown by the Treasurer that in certain cases the rebate should not he granted. I draw the attention of the committee to section 178 of the Administration and Probate Act 1928 of VictoriaAny person paying the duty payable under this act upon property comprised in a settlement or deed of gift may deduct the amount of the ad valorem duty paid in respect of such property by virtue of the Stamps Act 1928 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section seventy-eight of the said act. The word "" m a y "" is employed in thai section, but in an entirely different context. Therefore, I suggest that there is justification for altering the word "" may "" in section 15 of the Gift Duty Assessment Act to "" shall"". Unless it be altered we shall vest in the Commissioner the right to say whether a rebate shall be made in the case of a double levy. section 15 of the principal act which seems to justify the use of the word ""may"". There may be circumstances in which a rebate should be refused, but I have yet to learn what those circumstances are. I agree with what was said by the Spooner) regarding paragraph / of clause S. I believe it to be quite wrong to have alternative methods of valuation in respect of shares. The normal, long standing practice is for the personal representative to appoint recognized valuators, and to submit their valuation to the income tax commissioner in the case of the Commonwealth or, in the case of a State, to the commissioner of stamps. Under this bill, the taxing authority is to have power to disregard be no the valuation so made, and to say that the shares shall be valued upon what the holder would receive if the company were voluntarily wound up at the date upon which the gift was made. Paragraph / was not included among thc recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation, as were paragraphs d and e. Parliament should adhere closely to the principle of a fixed method for determining what-an impost shall be, and for that reason, paragraph / should be omitted. able to know his liability. know the difficulties of the taxation branch, but we represent the people, and it is a primary rule that the taxpayer's obligations shall be . precisely defined.

Those paragraphs are as follows:(e) No regard shall, in determining thu value of any such shares or stock, bo had to any provision in thc memorandum or articles of association or rules of thu company whereby or whereunder the value of the shares or stock of a deceased or other member is to he determined; and (/) Where a. gift includes any shares or stock in any company the shares or stock of which are not or is not quoted in the official list of any Stock Exchange, the Commissioner -nay, in his discretion, notwithstanding anything contained in the last two preceding paragraphs, adopt as the value of any such shares or stock such sum as in tbe opinion of the Commissioner, the holder thereof would receive in thc event of the company being voluntarily wound up on the date when the gift was made. It appears to me that those factors, which are specifically excluded in paragraph c, must necessarily be taken into consideration when determining the value of shares. In the case of leasehold land over which the lessee holds an option of purchase, that option constitutes an essential ingredient of the value of the lease. In the same way, if a property be subject to an easement or right-of-way or rent charge, those limitations upon the complete enjoyment of the property must be taken into consideration in determining its value. In the case of shares, however, because of the difficulties inherent in arriving at a valuation, the Government is seeking to exclude relevant factors. If there be conditions which prevent the holder of shares fro m selling to more than a limited number of people or from selling them how and when he pleases, or which give an option over them to some person, then those shares cannot have the same value as other shares in respect of which no such conditions are imposed. We are inclined to go too far in seeking to overcome the difficulties of the taxing authority. The Trea surer, no doubt, w ill point out that the Government has the support of the Royal Commission on Taxation in this regard, and there the matter will probably rest, hut I felt it my duty to express my views nn the suhject. would appear that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) in regard to the wording of clause 5 contains some merit. However, we must consider whether by merely deleting the words "" and possible"" we shall not make the position worse, and throw a greater obligation upon the donor. I understand that this provision is in tended to meet cases where certain formalities were entered into before the principal act came into operation, but for certain reasons, such as stamping, & c , the transaction was not completed. If the words "" and possible "" be deleted, it might mean that the transaction must be carried through to actual registration. which was necessary to be done to divest himself of all beneficial interest in the property "". rens title, for instance, divesting does not take place until the transaction is registered. It seems to me that the clause is inaptly worded. I suggest that it be provided that the donor be obliged to do everything necessary and usual for him to do to divest himself of the property. The Commissioner w ill know whether any action taken by a donor is in accordance with the usual practice. Then the donee can go on with thc stamping and registration. Anything required in regard to registration can be done by the donor; but that is not the usual practice. All that the donor needs to do is to carry out the usual formalities, such as the completion and execution of the document. Therefore, I suggest that the clause be amended to provide that the donor shall have done everything necessary and usual for him to do to divest himself of the property. That suggestion, I think, will conform with the submission made by the honourable member for Warringah. refer to the provision dealing with the shares of companies other than companies listed on the Stock Exchange.

Debate resumed from the 6th May (vide page 931), on motion by Mr £5,000. We have come to a sorry pass That the bill be now read a second time. tbe principal purposes of this bill to amend the Estate Duty Assessment Act, is to deal with problems arising in relation to the estates of deceased service men. T raised this problem on behalf of the Opposition when the principal act was under consideration towards the end of last year. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) promised to look into the matter and, if necessary, introduce amending legislation. This bill is the fruit of that promise. We pointed out on that occasion that, as the legislation stood, there was an exemption of £5,000 in respect of the estate of a member of the fighting services who was killed in the course of duty, but that, if the value of an estate exceeded £5,000 by only £1, the whole duty applicable to the estate would be collected. The Government has met our wishes to a degree by providing that the first £5,000 of value of an estate shall be free of duty, but that does not entirely satisfy. A man does not realize his normal expectation of life when he dies on active service, and the Treasury receives duty on his estate years earlier than would normally be the case. This problem was met in the last war by Parliament providing that no duty would be payable on the estates of persons killed on active service. The British Government exempts from duty the first £5,000 of value of a deceased service man's estate and deals with the remainder in accordance with a formula which ought to be adopted by the Commonwealth Government. If a man's expectation of life is shortened by, say, twenty years, the duty is levied on the amount which on compound interest at 3 per cent, would after twenty years yield the amount of the present value of thc estate. That is a logical and fair approach to the problem. I understand that the Treasury has only two objections to the British practice, first, that it would involve some loss of revenue, and, secondly, that administrative difficulties would arise. As to the first objection, there could be little loss of revenue because very few service men would have estates to the value of if in order to finance our war effort we have to rely on imposing duty on the estates of deceased soldiers. As to the second objection, little administrative difficulty could arise because of the fewness of the cases that would occur. The Treasury has devised a similar formula for dealing with life assurance policies in favour of widows on which the premiums had been paid by the husbands. There would be many more cases involving assurance policies than cases of ordinary estates. I impress upon the Treasurer the wisdom and equity of the scheme which has worked with success in Great Britain, and should on a proper view be equally meritorious and equally applicable in this country. One defect of the bill is the omission of any provision dealing with civilians who may be killed as the result of",28,Second Reading

123,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [4.24],"On e ofwar operations. In Great Britain, legislation passed in 1941 extended the relief available in the case of men of the services to civilians generally. That problem has not yet assumed any considerable dimensions in Australia, because so far we in this country have been fortunate in that civilians generally have escaped injury from enemy action, and, consequently, no great hardship has arisen. But on the assumption that our future in this respect will not be so na PP > I submit that we should follow v the British practice and apply a similar formula in respect of civilians who may be killed by enemy action in this country. Cases of multiple deaths among civilians should be provided for. The bill makes provision for the multiple deaths of members of the services. Should one of two brothers die as the result of war service and his estate pass to the other, who also dies as a result of war service, there is no duplication of estate duty. In that respect we have adopted the British practice; but Great Britain had also before the war made special provision to meet cases of multiple deaths among civilians. The British law provides that should the succeeding death occur within twelve months of the first death, there shall be a remission of duty DO the degree of 50 per cent. Should tbe succeeding death occur in the second year following the first death, the remission is 40 per cent.; should the second death occur in the third, fourth or fifth year, the remission of duty is 30 per cent., 20 per cent., and 10 per cent, respectively. Honourable members who have had to act as trustees or executors of estates will be aware of the difficult problems of administration wbich arise when an estate of any considerable size has to be dealt with foT probate purposes. Where that problem has to be faced for a second time in a space of a few years the difficulties become much greater. That situation has been mot in Great Britain in the manner that I have indicated, but no similar approach to the problem has been made in Australia. In that respect our legislation is incomplete. I emphasize these matters at this stage because of the change which has taken place during recent years in the rates of duty applicable to deceased estates. They did not have the same importance in pre-war years, because the rate of duty on deceased estates for federal purposes remained constant for a number of years, with the result that the average revenue from this source remained at about £1,500,000 per annum. In either 1940 or 1941, when the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the rate of duty on deceased estates was raised sufficiently to increase the revenue from that source to approximately £2,350,000. Legislation introduced by the present Treasurer to give effect to his latest budget proposals will, it is expected, bring to the Treasury another £650,000 annually from that source. Thus, it will be seen that in a period of about two years the estimated annual collections from estate duty have doubled. I ask honourable members to reflect on this situation, because if they do so they will find that these increases of duty represent heavy inroads upon the values of deceased estates. Honourable members will probably he astonished to learn that if the rates of estate duty which apply in the most heavily taxed Australian State are added to the estate duty imposed by the Commonwealth, the total collection from a deceased estate in this country is much greater than in Great Britain. I admit that, that fact astonished me, as I had always thought that estate duties in Great Britain were much heavier than in Australia. An estate of £30.000 in Great Britain would be subject to duty amounting to £3,900 compared with £5,522 for a similar estate in the highest taxed Australian State. The disparity is even more striking in respect of estates of higher value. The collection hy the British Treasury from an estate of £100,000 would be £25,700, whereas in Australia it may reach £38,980. Some lionorable members may think that, even with those deductions, the beneficiaries of a big estate can still be regarded as fortunate, but if we examine the situation as a practical problem of administration, it will be seen that considerable hardship may arise when exactions are made on that scale. there are few. if any, liquid assets. estates consist of property which, moreover, may carry a substantial debt by way",29,Chiflet

An estate consisting of a city business may he worth some hundreds of thousands of pounds on paper, but that value will be represented by fixed assets, raw materials, partly manufactured stock, book debts, and so on. If such a business were suddenly called upon to find two-fifths of its value for estate duty, it might easily he crippled, not only during the lifetime of the immediate beneficiaries, but for all time. ready in manv instances. this Parliament has not given to this matter the consideration that it deserves. During the last couple of years, the collections from this source for Commonwealth purposes have been practically doubled. I repeat, that the Treasurer should regard this scale of taxation purely as a war-time imposition, which should be relieved as early as practicable when peace returns. of estates which have to be realized in the period of the war, great hardship can be caused, and I agree with the implication contained in the interjection of. the honourable' member for Eorrest( Mr time the money which is normally availProwse) that it is debatable whether even the stress of war-time finance justifies the continuance of the present heavy rates. The Treasurer should give earnest consideration to the problem of the civilian, and to the special problem of the service men. At present, no proper provision does exist in respect of succeeding deaths. . The bill contains a number of amendments, based, I am informed, on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation, which presented its report on matters relating to estate duty in 1934. Those recommendations have not previously been put in legislative form, and the Government has taken this opportunity to incorporate them in the act. ""Whilst the Opposition does not resist any amendments which come within that category, I direct attention to one important provision, namely, that assurance policies which are made payable to the wife of the deceased shall, if the deceased has actually paid the premiums, form a part of his estate for purposes of calculating the duty. Some rather important consequences can flow from that amendment. When making provision either by will or other disposition, many husbands have taken into consideration the fact that a substantial life assurance policy will operate in favour of their wives. If a policy is to form a part of the estate and to carry the duty applicable to it, the provision that they made for their wives will be substantially less than they estimated. tion. It will have serious consequences for many husbands who have made their arrangements on the assumption that in the event of their demise the total amount of the assurance policy will be available to the wives. One of the great advantages of a life assurance policy drawn in favour of the wife is that a certain amount of cash will be readily available to her upon the death of . the husband. If an estate be at all involved, it is often difficult to apportion from the estate ready money which can be available for the immediate needs of the widow and her family. The effect of this amendment will be to tie up for a considerable able under the life assurance policy. If it be practicable, the Treasurer should provide for the exemption of a specified sum of £250 or £500 for the immediate use of the widow. Otherwise, the very provision which the husband has made in order to ensure that the widow will have ready cash in the months while the estate is being settled will be defeated. panies, under this amendment, be obliged to withhold payment until probate is obtained ? Treasurer proposes to arrange for that. An estate of £100,000 might include a life assurance policy for £20,000. The total duty payable on the estate will be nearly £40,000. If the wife were paid the £20,000 under the life assurance policy, she might be able to dispose of it, or invest it unwisely.

Eor that reason, I assume that the same restriction would be placed upon dealing with that money as that which would normally apply to any other asset of the estate. If the money were withheld, the object that th» husband had in making provision for his wife to have ready cash immediately after his demise would be defeated. I ask the Treasurer to enlighten the House upon this matter. In the absence of any advice from him to date, I suggest that he should examine thc possibility of exempting a portion of the proceeds of a life assurance policy in order to provide for the immediate needs of the widow. I understand that some formula has been evolved so that premiums which were paid prior to the enactment of this legislation will not be taken into account when the Taxation Department calculates the value of the estate for taxable purposes.

It would be quite usual for the husband to insure his life for £20,000 in favour of his wife. At prevailing rates, nearly £40,000 would be payable in duty on an estate of £100,000. If the widow had the £20,000 paid to her immediately, and dissipated it before collection of tax could be made, the remaining £80,000 in the estate would have to bear the whole of the duty. That might operate very seriously against some of the other beneficiaries. I appreciate that it may not be easy to deal with these particular points as we proceed; but I ask the Treasurer to consider them and, if he can do so, enlighten the House on them when he replies at the conclusion of the debate. I again emphasize the view of the Opposition that, whilst recognizing that the Treasurer has investigated the problem placed before him during .the last budget session, and has brought down a proposal which certainly effects improvement, at the same time it is to be regretted that he has not seen fit to adopt in its entirety the British scheme, which we regard' as very much fairer. I can only repeat that the objections indicated to me as being those that have operated against the British scheme have not, in my view, sufficient weight to justify the discarding of the much fairer and more reasonable provisions in respect of those who are taking the risk of an untimely death and thus prejudicing the prospects of tlieir estates and their beneficiaries. I ask the Treasurer again to take note of the very genuine representations that have been made to him in this matter, because in our opinion they are deserving of the sympathy and consideration, not only of the Government, but also of all sections of this House.",31,Chiflet

146,Mr Holt,"I repeat to the right hon[4.53] -Lik e the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), in the main I sball devote my time to clause 4, wbich relates to the estate duty that is payable in respect of the estates of members of the services, and to the rather wide questions which, I think, arise from the present state of war. When this matter was raised by the honourable member for Fawkner last November, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) said that he had not had time to consider the representations that had been made; but he was good enough to promise to have them investigated, and, if possible, to bring down an amending bill. He now proposes in this bill to alter, the law in such a way that, instead of estates of under £5,000 being exempt, and estates of over that amount being fully hit, there is to be straight-out exemption of all estates, however large, to an amount of. £5,000. The honourable gentleman has also incorporated in sub-clause 2 of clause 4 a provision to meet the Tather lamentable position that arises when an estate, owing to two consecutive deaths within a short space of time, becomes twice dutiable. Further-and this in my view is the right and handsome thing to do-the alterations are to apply from the commencement of the present war. 1 agree with the contentions of the honorsolely to the Australian Imperial Force; able member for Fawkner. although he might have gone further. A fair test seems to be what was done in the last great war and what is being done in this war with respect to men who lose their lives, as members of the Navy, the Army, or the A ir Force. In the last war, the following exemptions were made in respect of men who were at war, during tbeir lives, and the estates of men who were killed while on war service: No duty whatever was levied by the Commonwealth against the estates of men who were killed in the field; they were completely exempt. In addition, from 1915 onwards, anybody who served in the field was completely relieved of federal income tux in respect of personal exertion income; and, from the time of its introduction in 1917-18, no war-time profits tax was levied against them. Those three exemptions one may describe as major exemptions; tbere is no half-heartedness about them. The law of the Commonwealth was, in fact, much more liberal than the then existing law in Great Britain. What is the position in this war ? Our law is much less liberal than that of Great Britain, although the British Act remains substantially as it was in relation to the fighting services. All that Australia has done to exempt, in any sense, persons who are serving in the forces in this war, has been done, first, by the act of 1940, which is now being amended. The exemption for which provision was made in that act related only to such estates as were of a value of less than £5,000. It is not generous to say that, if a man happens to have, say, £10,000 or more, he shall be taxed on the full amount at precisely the same rates as if he was not a member of any of the fighting services,, as if he had remained in Australia during the whole period of the war, and had not done a hand's turn for his country. One must congratulate the Treasurer upon having taken steps to remove that reproach at least. There is another, and, I consider, a very meagre, parsimonious provision, which the Parliament made in 1940. It was, in effect, that the pay and allowances of troops enlisted for overseas service should be exempt from income tax only from the time of their departure from Australia. That is to say, the exemption applies, as regards the Army, and, even so, does not apply to a man who has volunteered for service overseas, but is not sent out of Australia. That is the law as it now stands. There appears <to have been almost a complete lack of consideration of the property of those serving overseas, or in any branch of the fighting services, in the present war. I have dealt with the claim to eonsideration of those who are serving in one of the branches of the fighting services, and I shall return to it ; but, turning aside for the moment, what of the great number of persons who are taking risks as volunteers in connection with civil defence, and what of civilians who are killed as the result of enemy ration? Tliey are not provided for in this bill, nor are their estates to be immune from Commonwealith taxation. If a man happens to be an air .raid precautions warden, a fire-fighter or a person",32,Chiflet
147,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Wakefield)neutralizing or extracting fuses from bombs-a particularly hazardous occupation-and is killed, the Commonwealth, under the present law, will have no option but to descend on his estate for everything that it can get. What of the great number of women now serving in a semi official capacity? Nurses, members of the Voluntary Aid Detachment, and women engaged in work associated with the three fighting services are spread throughout Australia and beyond the Commonwealth. The risks they run are frequently infinitely greater than those of many regular soldiers who are retained for service in Australia. Provision is made under War Injuries Compensation and Oivil Defence Volunteers Regulations for compensation for war injuries sustained by such persons, but that is a minor payment, the general idea being that consideration shall be shown, mainly by pension, to the ckcumstances of persons who have little or n.i means, in the event of injury or death. I shall read a portion of a letter which I have received from the president of the Taxpayers Association of New South Wales. I do so, not because I think that, the views of that gentleman will strengthen my case in the eyes of the Minister, but, because I consider that what he bas written iB very fair. He statesl t is the opinion of ray association that thc concession proposed should be extended in the following directions(') by granting to members of the fight-' ing forces who die as a result of active service an unconditional and complete exemption from estate duty; ( i i) by extending some exemption to civilians whose death arises from enemy action. In regard to members of the forces it is felt that the sacrifice made by the person who gives his life in defence of his country is such that it is inappropriate to levy any duly upon his estate. The State of New South Wales allows an unconditional exemption in these cases and during thc last war an outright exemption was allowed by the Commonwealth. SoN e w South Wales has set an example to the C o m m o n w e a l t h P a r l i a m e n t in thia for Fawkner gave to the House some respect. correspondent w r it e s In regard to civilians who may lose their lives as a result of enemy action we would suggest that the same principle of "" windfall revenue"" applies. If hostilities reacli our shores it is not unlikely that there will be a heavy death-roll amongst the civilian population, with the result that the Government would stand to collect duties perhaps many years before such estates f a l l to be charged. There is also the position of civilians engaged in "" front l in e "" activities as for exable air raid wardens, ambulance drivers, Red Cross officials and the like who, while facing the hazards of war. are not covered by the amendment proposed. It is almost inevitable that this matter will be brought to the attention of the Government again before long through the pressure of events. Personally, I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) that some provision should be made for civil defence volunteers and others who have been, or may be, killed. A recent aii raid on Darwin resulted in the death of civilians. They were killed by eneim action. Millions of us who are not in Darwin have hitherto escaped, but is it to be suggested that civilians in Darwin arc to be wiped out of existence without the Commonwealth recognizing in any way the misfortune which they suffered ? If they happen to be well to do, is the Commonwealth to out in and get as much (revenue as possible because of their lamentable death, which in some cases was caused by the fact that they were doing something for their country? That would be quite unreasonable. I agree with the last speaker that the practice in Great Britain is very fair. This proposal is on similar lines, but we could properly go farther and adopt the provision in the British measure which has regard to the expectation of life. That provision was put into operation in Great Britain throughout the last war, and is still a part of fhe British law. That suggests at least that it has been found to work reasonably and equitably. In Great Britain estate duty is not imposed on estates up to the value of £5,000. Beyond that value the expectation of life is calculated, and there is a corresponding deduction from the duty that would ordinarily have been paid. The honourable member In a subsequent place m y interesting figures on this matter in November last. He pointed out that the normal duty payable in respect of an estate of £10,000 in Australia would be £300, whereas, if calculated on the British method, the duty would be only £40. On a £20,000 estate, the duty in Australia would he £1,200 and in England £239, whilst on a £50,000 estate the duty in Australia would be £6,000, and in England £1,435. I believe that a man is none the less worthy of consideration because he happens to have more money than the average citizen. Presumably, it is no easier for a wealthy man to give up his life than it is for a poor man. The deceased's family is entitled to some consideration from the fact that he has given his life for his country, and this consideration should weigh all the more in Australia where we still have, in theory, and partly in fact, the voluntary system of recruiting. For my part, I believe in conscription. I do not believe that the voluntary system can be fairly applied, tout it is our policy at the moment, and surely it is unwise to discourage men, whether rich or poor, from offering their servioes. Is this war any less important to Australia than was the last war? The conditions which, during the last war, applied to the members of our fighting services on duty overseas are beginning to apply more and more to the men now serving in Australia. Perhaps the Treasurer will be able to give reasons for treating our fighting men more meanly in this war than was done in the last war, but I can see no reason for it. It may be argued that our commitments are greater now because more men are serving, and that we cannot afford to be generous, but such an argument would not come well from a Government, which has just introduced legislation to extend great bers objected to the Government's prosocial benefits to a great many people who, posal to levy duty on the estates of no matter how deserving, cannot possibly have as strong a claim on our consideration as have the members of the fighting forces. Therefore, I intend, when the bill is in committee, to move an amendment to provide that the expectation of life, section of the English act be incorporated in this measure. protest, against the provision in this only up to £5,000. It reads as follows:bill for including in the estate of a deceased person for the purpose of assessandSection ing estate duties moneys received under stef da. life insurance policy. Governments have always encouraged co-operative insurance of the value for duty of the estate of a member companies such as the Australian Mutual Commonwealth, or of any part of the King's Provident Society, and insurance candominions, or of any ally of Great Britain vassers have induced people to take out policies on the understanding that estate duties will not be levied on the proceeds of such policies. Thousands of men in Australia have taken out whole-life policies because they could not afford to pay tbe premiums on endowment policies. I cannot conceive of a more Christian act than that of the man who continues to pay premiums all his life on a policy from which he has no hope of ever benefiting himself, but which he takes out entirely for the benefit of his family. The Government, by this provision, is striking a blow at the devotion of such men, and' detracting from the value of what they have done. Our purpose is to prevent cheating. whole-life insurance policy to make provision for his family in the event of his death. If I understand this measure correctly, the money received upon such an insurance policy is to be added to the deceased person's estate, and a big "" wad '' taken out of it in the form of estate duty. If that is not the meaning, perhaps the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) will explain what is intended. combined wisdom of the special committee on taxation. This measure was discussed in Parliament last session, and many honourable memmembers of the fighting forces who died on active service. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) promised to reconsider the position, but the measure is still harsh and inequitable, showing a lack of appreciation of the volunteers who sacrifice their lives in the defence of their country. The Government bas not shown the regard foT widows and dependants of deceased soldiers that was shown in the last war. 0 nf the principal act is repealed the following section inserted in its "" D ( I . ) For the purpose of determining the Naval.

During the last war, the estate of any memher of the forces who died in those circumstances was exempt from probate duty. The members of our fighting forces in Great Britain those circumstances, also exempt. strongly urge the Treasurer to reconsider this provision. understand why the conditions applying in the last war should now be altered in any way. The honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) has pointed out that the original Estate DutyB ill was introduced in 1914 by the then Treasurer, Mr Andrew Fisher. On that occasion, Mr Fisher saidWe might reasonably consider the point as to whether the estates of persons who are fighting the battles of this, country should be taxed. 1 think that they should be exempted. They are taking' exceptional risks on the battlefield wliile we arc stopping at home. Whereas those who remain at home should be called upon to bear the full tax, those who are at the front should, in jny opinion, be exempted. At thc committee stage of t.he bill , the following provision was inserted to meet the point:Nothing in this act shall apply to the estate of any person who, during the present war' or within one year after its termination, dies on active service or as a result of injuries received or disease contracted on active service with the military or naval forces of the Commonwealth or any part of the King's dominions. Thc Government has now very definitely departed from the principles which were then enunciated .by Mr Fisher. I again urge the Treasurer to give this matter further consideration. If he cannot see his way clear to retain in f u l l the benefits that were extended to members of our fighting forces in 1914-18, he should at least give them more favorable treatment than is proposed in this measure. I admit that GreatB r it a in also has departed from the provisions which it applied to menibers of its fighting forces during the last war. However, the present British provisions are very much more liberal than those contained in this bill. When our young men are about to enlist in the fighting services, and while they are on active service, they are very concerned as to what may become of their wives and dependants if , in defending their country, they should be called upon ro make the supreme sacrifice. 1 admit that we are now obliged to find unprecedented millions in order to meet our war commitments. But, surely, we can w in this war, and provide sufficient supplies of munitions, food were, in and clothing for our fighting forces, and I meet all of our other financial obligations, without asking the soldier who I fai l to dies fighting in the front line to contribute to the cost of -the war in this way. This measure does not treat the members of our fighting forces as sympathetically as they deserve. Unfortunately, in many cases, more .than one member of the same family makes the supreme sacrifice. I ask the Treasurer to provide that, in sueh cases, the duty payable on the second death shall, as is done under the British legislation, be reduced as follows:Per cent. Where the second death occursWithin one year of thc first death 50 Within two years of the first death 40 Within three yeaTS of the first death 30 Within four years of the first death 20 Within five years of fhe first death 10 In this matter I support the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Fawkner, and the honourable member for been stated that the objections to adopting the British proposal are: first, loss of revenue; and. secondly, difficulties of administration. We must be in a. very sorry plight to put forward the first objection. The total amount involved is not. more than a. few hundred thousand pounds. This loss, I suggest, could very easily he made good in other directions. W it h respect to the second objection, I am sure that officials of the Taxation Department are capable of overcoming any administrative difficulties that might",35,Chiflet
153,Wakefield ( Mr Duncan,"Hughes). It hasarise. I have always held our Public Service in the highest regard. I have no doubt that our taxation officials are equally as efficient, if not more so, than the public servants of Great Britain. Great Britain has overcome these alleged administrative difficulties, because this provision has operated in that country . for some time. I can see no reason, therefore, why such an objection should be allowed to stand in our way. I deplore the omission from this measure of certain personnel associated with our war effort, all classes of whom are entitled to the limited concessions granted in the bill. I refer to members of the various women's organizations such as the ""Women's Royal Australian N""aval Service, and the Women's Australian Auxiliary Air Force, and women's organizations associated with the Army. I also ask for the inclusion of members of the Australian Nursing Service, who have already done wonderful work in this war, and the Voluntary Aid Detachments, who have gone overseas to assist them. These provisions should also be applied to all sections of air raid precautions workers. Should the occasion arise, these workers will render valuable servioe in the defence of this country. I repeat that an unanswerable case has been made out for a more liberal and sympathetic consideration of estates of deceased members of our fighting forces under this measure. port the remarks made by honourable members on this side of the Hoiise. I take exception, not to what has been provided in this bill, bnt to what has been omitted. The principle of levying estate duty on men and women who have died as the result of enemy action is .not possible to extend to the estates of entirely wrong. The Government should not benefit financially as the result of deaths on active service. Money should not be taken from families that have already suffered the loss of, perhaps, the bread-winner. It is undeniable that under the terms of this legislation, the Government will derive more income from estate duty than it would in time of peace, because casualties have been and will be heavy. If the Government wants more income from estate duty the proper way in which to get it is by raisHouse to-day, when we are discussing ing the rate, not by including within the scope of the duty the families of people who have lost. their lives as the result of enemy action. The estates of members of the fighting services should be totally and unconditionally exempt from estate duty, but, if that is not possible, the Government should adopt the British method, which, I understand, is on these lines:-The estate of a man killed by enemy action should be regarded for the purpose of calculation of duty as one not to be charged estate duty until the completion of his normal expectation of life. The amount of estate duty would be levied on an amount equal to the present value of the estate calculated at compound rate at 3 per cent over the period of the expectation of life. In other words, on the assumption that a 20-year-old man killed by enemy action had an expectation of life of another 20 years, and left an estate valued at £20,000, the estate duty 'would be levied on such an amount as at 3 per cent, compound interest would amount in 20 years to £20,000, the value of the estate. That is the equitable thing to do. It would give to the Treasury a reasonable amount of money. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) does not look sympathetic, but I suggest that he should give further consideration to the proposal. I can see no reason why the estates of civilians killed by enemy action should not be treated similarly to the estates of soldiers killed by enemy action. Civilians no less than soldiers have a normal expectation of life, and, if that expectation of life is shortened by enemy action, their estates should be treated for duty purposes similarly to the estates of soldiers. I do not think that the Treasury would lose much. At any rate, if it is deceased soldiers total exemption from estate duty, the principle of expectation of life should be applied to whatever balance remains over the exemption of £5.000.

I do not expect more than one Minister to be present, but the presence of only two members of the Labour party is a clear indication of what may be expected from some of our friends opposite when the new order has steam up and gets going. only in one side of the new order. difficulty is that there is only one side to the new order. So far as estate duties are conoerned, I have always held the view, from the time. I entered politicsfirst in the State sphere-that the Government has a perfect right, within limits, to levy all sorts of taxes on a man from the time he is born until he dies; but I also consider that one of the most indefensible forms of taxation is that which steps in when a man is no longer interested and says that out of vvhat he has left, governments shall take a certain amount. I believe that is the most immoral form of taxation that one could impose. I say that not in any partisan sense, as the Treasurer ( Mr man can hold in time of war-the portChifley) will realize; my criticism relates to estate duties generally and not to any matter contained in this bill. taxation. capital levy. It cannot truthfully be called anything else. It is a levy made on capital passing from the man who owned it to those to whom he has bequeathed it. This bill has very interesting facetsfrom whichever point it is viewed. The lionorable member for Wakefield ( Mr it deserves. The Government will Duncan-Hughes) points which. might well be taken into consideration by the committee in a serious fashion, and not by a committee so indifferent as the present attendance in. the House. The first question which must be taken up is what is the attitude of this Commonwealth towards the imposition pf estate duty on the estates of men who voluntarily answer the Government's appeal to go on active service and who lose their lives on that service. I say that such estates should be dealt with in a separate category. It is entirely wrong morally and indefensible politically to tax the estate of a man who met his death on voluntary active service. The second category includes those members of thc community who, in times of war, are called up for tlie defence of their country. They should be treated differently from persons who volunteer to serve overseas and are killed. Tbe third category includes civilians who are killed interested as the result of enemy action. In the past, it has been customary to refer to of God, but now it would probably be more correct to say that they are caused by acts of the Son of Heaven in Tokyo. I admit that the Treasurer has done something to meet these different cases in fulfilment of the promise which he gave when the principal act was before this House last November. Of the Treasurer it can always be said that if he gives an undertaking to do a certain thing or to take a certain matter into consideration he will do so, generally with some result. I realize the difficulties confronting him, as does every honourable member on this side. We appreciate the energy with which he administers the most difficult and distasteful portfolio that any folio which involves the extraction' of money from the people. This Parliament is entitled to lay down certain principles is confiscation, not in connection with the raising of money by means of a duty on deceased estates, but the details are matters for the committee stage rather than for the second reading. It is my intention to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Wakefield, and I hope that it will receive from the committee the consideration that raised important probably argue that its proposals have been dictated by necessity; but whatever arguments may have been advanced last November, shortly after the present Government took office, have largely been vitiated by the Government's own acts since then. When I see millions of pounds being distributed in all sorts of ways by the Government on its own initiative, I cannot concede on the score of necessity what otherwise I might have conceded.

The first amendment gives effect to the decision of the committee to l i m it the durability of money payable on a policy of assurance on the lif e of the deceased, I am not prepared to the money so payable to the family and close relatives of the deceased. The .committee considered that the limitation is necessary because it is not uncommon to find policies of assurance payable to strangers to cover interests which those strangers have in the l i fe of the deceased. Creditors or partners, for instance, have an interest in the l if e of a person, and seek to protect that interest by taking out a policy of assurance upon his life. The second amendment is merely incidental to the previous and the subsequent one. The third amendment.gives effect to the opinion of the committee that the application of the provision in the bill to l if e assurance policies should not retrospectively apply to policies of assurance taken out before the commencement of thc act. It was considered that where such arrangements had been made under the law as it existed at that time, it now taking what might be a substantial portion of the policy moneys in duty. It was therefore decided to exempt from the application of the section the present value of such policies. This is done by allowing a deduction from the actual proceeds of the policy at the date of death of an amount I m o v e which is calculated to represent the value quite usual for a husband to pay the premiums on a policy which is to operate some otber member of his family.

203,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [5.59],"It isof his estate for purposes of estate duty. The Treasurer described this long-established practice as a process of cheating on the part of the husband, and as an evasion of estate duty. That was a totally unfair and improper way to describe transactions of a kind which have been carried out regularly throughout Australia for many years with great benefit to thousands of families. Those transactions have been a direct encouragement to thrift and an incentive to provide for the security of families. In my opinion the Government is taking a retrograde step in this matter. The Treasury may benefit by a few thousand pounds in the immediate present, but the whole community will suffer ultimately. Transactions of the kind in question have been attractive to husbands who desired to make some provision, by means of tbe payment of a regular premium, in order to secure for their widows an amount of money which would be immediately available for necessary purposes. To describe this process as cheating and evasion is extremely unjust, for, as I have indicated, it is in fact an attempt to provide wives with adequate funds immediately following the death of their breadwinners. I say without fear of contradiction that thousands of men have taken out policies for this purpose in mutual and co-operative life assurance societies who would otherwise not have done so. I regret that the Government has adopted a procedure which will discourage such action in the future. There is neither cheating nor evasion in this process. I fear that the effect of these amendments will be to cause the less responsible and less honourable members of the community to adopt methods of evasion. Possibly wives will be asked to provide for the payment of these premiums out of their own allowances, or they may be given extra housekeeping money with which to pay the premiums -was not reasonable to confine thc In either case a retrograde step will have been taken. The adoption of these amendments will undoubtedly strike a blow at institutions which have been of incalculable benefit to the people of the Commonwealth. The practice of assuring for the purpose of providing ready money for the payment of estate duty is desirable in my opinion and should be ( Mr Chifley) has encouraged. Amendments agreed to.

It considered that the period should be extended to three years. This amendment extends the period accordingly. Amendments agreed to.",41,Cameron Th E Such Deaths As Having Been Cansed By Acts
204,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Trea[6.6] I moveTliat after proposed new sub-section (1.) of new section nine tlie following new sub-section lie inserted:,: ( IA . ) From the duty payable on any estate from which a deduction is made in accordance with sub-section (1.) of this section there shall be deducted so much of the duties leviable in respect of the remainder of the estate as exceeds the sum which, if accumulated at compound interest at the rate of three per centum per annum from the date of death with halfyearly rests would, at the expiration of the period of thc normal expectation of life of a person of the age of the deceased at the time of death (calculated in accordance with the Australian Life Tallies published by the Commonwealth Statistician) amount to tlie whole of the duties so leviable."". Thc amendment is stated in highly technical language, but I submit it to honourable members in the form in which it appears in the English act, re-drafted by the Solicitor-General's staff, with only slight variations to bring it into line with our bill. The purpose of the amendment is to apply to Australia a provision which has been in force in Great Britain for the last 28 years. The effect of the amendment briefly is to provide that, in respect of the amount in excess of the first £5,000 of the value of an estate, the tax clue shall be calculated by deducting from the amount for which the estate would ordinarily be taxed by thc amount by which it would be taxed based on a calculation of the expectation of life of the deceased. I discussed this aspect in my second-reading speech, and pointed out that, in my view, it was only reasonable that if a man were killed in the prime of life his estate should not be treated for estate duty as though he had lived for the length of time which, on an actuarial basis, be might have expected to live. Tbe expectation of life in Australia is higher than it is in Great Britain. I consider that it is not reasonable that the estate of a man who dies, say, 50 years earlier than he might have been expected to die should be treated as though he had lived the full term that be might have been expected to live. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) had a few words to say about the introduction of amendments of this nature at the present stage. I point out to him remarks of the honourable members for this year to move amendments of this description. could have been foreshadowed. was foreshadowed in my second-reading speecli. Moreover, the honourable memnier for Fawkner( Mr Holt) made a -similar proposal of this description in this House on the 26th November last, when he said1 suggest that the Government might consider the propriety of including such a provision in the Commonwealth law on this subject. It is now claimed that the matter is sprung on the Government at the last minute. was considered and rejected by the special committee. surely does not prevent any honourable member from expressing his views? I know, and without disparaging any other honourable member, the honourable member for Fawkner has taken more interest in this matter than has been taken by all the other Opposition members of the committee combined. He is perfectly entitled and, if I may say so, amply competent, to express his view. I"" need not elaborate the point. The amendment, with the slightest variation, in order to bring it into line with Australian conditions, follows the provision in the British Act, which has been in existence for 28 years. It has been altered and amended by an officer of the Solicitor-General's staff. It is exceedingly complicated, I admit; it 13 rather the work of an accountant than of a lawyer or a parliamentarian. But it has served the purpose of ensuring that the age of a man who loses his life, and liis expectation of life, shall be taken into account in reducing the tax he would normally have to pay. porting the amendment, I agree with the Barker( Mr Archie Cameron).

213,Dr. Price (Boothby) [6.12],"In supproposed exemption of £5,000 is inadequate. The point that I stress is that a great deal has happened financially since this branch of the legislature considered an exemption of £5,000 last November. The Government has reduced interest to a maximum rate of 4 per cent. That will mean that the value of a large number of estates of men who die on active service will be reduced by one-third. If it be desired that the matter shall he placed on a basis equivalent to that which existed when it was discussed last November, the exemption ought to be at least £7,500. The Government has reduced interest rates at a time when costs are soaring, the basic wage is rising, and pensions are being frequently raised in order to keep pace with other increases. At an interest rate of 4 per cent., a maximum exemption of £5,000 would represent only £200 a year, which is less than the basic wage in any State. Tbe Government proposes that, if a poor devil volunteers and gives his life for his country, the exemption in respect of his estate shall be an amount which, at current rates of interest, would return less than the basic wage. The exemption is altogether inadequate. This Parliament and nation ought to show that generosity which our forefathers showed in the great war, or at least that generosity which British statesmen, and not Australian politicians, are showing at the present time. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. [8.0] I support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for gave my reasons for my attitude in speaking on the motion for the second reading of the bill. I do not accept, and I believe strange silence of members of the Oppothat otheT members of the Opposition do not accept, the suggestion that, because a proposal has been considered by a committee representative of all parties, members of this chamber should abide by the recommendations of . that committee. Some members of the Opposition have strong objection, to committees of this kind sitting at all, and do not consider that that is the proper and best way to conduct public business. One of the worse instances of parliamentary work being delegated to a committee was afforded by the appointment of a committee to consider the uniform taxation scheme. not appointed by the Parliament. vernment may take it for granted that because the Opposition was represented on a committee that discussed a certain matter, the committee's recommendations should be accepted. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wakefield is well worthy of acceptance by honourable members generally, and will find support in the country. In view of the heavy and novel disbursements of revenue by this Parliament in the last fortnight, the Government is likely to find itself up against a dead end with regard to finance. The Commonwealth is drifting, willy nilly, slowly but surely towards grave financial difficulties as the result of recent legislation. The amendment provides for an act of justice to those members of the fighting forces who, having volunteered to give their services to their country, lose their lives. [8.4] I shall refer again to the position that arose with regard to this proposal when the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) was closely associated with a previous government. the Cabinet when the budget was framed. member was associated with a party that supported the then government. The honI orable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) was a member of the Cabinet. I remind the committee of the extraordinarily sition, including the honourable member for Barker, when a previous government dealt with the exemption of members of the fighting services from estate duty. The provision made by that government was that on estates having a value for estate duty not exceeding £5,000, no estate duty should be payable; that on estates not exceeding £10,000 the duty should be £300; that on estates of £20,000 the duty should be £1,200; and that on estates of £50.000.",43,Cameron Th E Such Deaths As Having Been Cansed By Acts

I regard this as a generous proposal. members of the fighting services? memibers of the fighting services. In respect of estates of a value for estate duty not exceeding £50,000, the previous government proposed that the duty sbould be £6,000, but under the present Government's proposal the amount of duty is to be only £4,950. The present bill provides that if a member of the fighting services died within three years after the conclusion of the war, the exemption would still operate, whereas the amendment of the law proposed by the previous government was that the exemption should apply for only twelve months after the conclusion of the war. Honourable members opposite should think well over the facts that I have presented. Under a. proposed amendment circulated by the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) no estate duty is suggested on estates not exceeding £5,000, and only £40 is proposed to be collected on estates valued at £10,000, whilst on a £20,000 estate the proposed duty is £249. posals. members to know what happened with regard to the previous government's proposals for amendments of the law when it had a large majority in both branches of the legislature. Members of the Opposition were strangely silent at that time. The honourable member for Boothby has proposed that on an estate valued at £50,000, the duty payable should be £1,435. Despite what has been said by the honourable member for Barker regarding the work of committees reprethe chamber, I consider that they render valuable service, and unanimous findings by such committees have always been accepted by the present Government. It is regrettable that the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) was unable to attend the meetings of the committee which considered this matter. I resent the attempt by the honourable member for Barker to deprecate the work of committees representative of all parties in this Parliament, because they bring together men who are anxious to reach a solution, having regard to the views of all parties. regret that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), rather than face up to the issue presented by the amendment, has sought to draw a red herring across the trail by accusing the Opposition of lack of interest in the subject-matter of this bill when it held ministerial oflice. From his long parliamentary experience, he must know that, in thc preparation of budget legislation, points are frequently overlooked, and a later Parliament is called upon to rectify the mistakes. One of the useful functions performed by an Opposition, both in time of war and in time of peace, is to bring legislative anomalies to the notice of the Government. It is not sufficient for the Treasurer to say that the Opposition should have dealt more completely with this matter when it was in power. I have no doubt that when, with a twist of political destiny, the Treasurer again finds himself on the Opposition side, he will be able to point to many legislative measures brought down by his Government to which it will be possible for him to suggest amendments. I have in mind four bills in respect of uniform taxation and other bills providing new social services.

227,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.11],"I deeplylaw. When I brought this matter before tbe Parliament during the last budget session in November last, I remarkedI think it only fair to state that the relevant provision in our act was hastily drafted aud introduced, and was not given the consideration by the House that its importance deserved. In moving the second reading of the bill, the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) made passing reference to it, and the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) merely noted the observation that had been made. The subject was not debated. On reference to Hansard, it will be seen that the measure was considered at a very late hour at a period ""when r,he Government was trying to get its budget legislation passed before the parliamentary recess. It is no answer to say that we could have done it at that time and did not. The Treasurer has given no definite reply to the arguments advanced in favour of the amendment. Certainly, he said that this bill was an improvement on the bill brought down during the last budget session. We agree, but we maintain that we have made out a case for still better treatment, and have justified our argument that the system which operated with justice in Great Britain during the last war, and which is still in operation there, should be adopted here also. I said before that only two possible objections to the amendment have been suggested to me. Thc first is that a certain amount of revenue would be lost, and the second is that the system which we propose might be difficult to administer. I think that we have successfully disposed of both arguments. Certainly the Treasurer did not refer to them in his reply. I regret that he has not recognized the jtistice of our case. Two other points were raised to which the Treasurer has given no reply. From the estates of deceased civilians, whose deaths are due to war causes, the Treasurer will, in effect, reap a windfall for the year in which the deaths occur. The Opposition suggests that here, again, the system in operation in Great Britain should be adopted in Australia, and that regard should be had to the expectation of life of the person killed, when working out the rate of estate duty properly applicable. I emphasize the fact that the matter of estate duties is of tremendous importance to the parties concerned. It is not just a matter of paying out of a large estate a lump sum which is readily available. Large estates are usually in the form, of a business in being, or of a landed property that is being worked. The payment of a large sum, running into tens of thousands of pounds in cash out of such an estate, may bankrupt it. The other point has to do with multiple deaths occurring in respect of the same estate. Where two deaths occur within a very short time of each other, a business or landed property included in the estate may be bankrupted because of the sudden heavy demands made upon it for estate duty. I ask the Treasurer to consider the adoption of the British system in which there is an abatement of duty if the second death occurs within five years of the first, ranging from 50 per cent, if the death occurs in tlie first year to 10 per cent, if it occurs in the fifth year. agree with thc honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) .that, in the levying of estate duties, regard should be had to the principles of justice and equity, but I maintain that the Government has recognized those principles in framing this measure. It has for many years been recognized that, upon the death of a citizen, part of his estate should go to the public revenue. I recognize that the payment of estate duties sometimes causes embarrassment to persons administering a deceased person's estate, but that is no reason why an estate of £50,000 should pay in estate duty only £1,435. which would be thc case if the amendment of the honorHughes) were agreed to. The honourable member is always quite honest in his approach to matters of this kind, for which I give him due credit. He represents the wealthy section of the community, and wants it to be protected. If he can persuade honourable members that £1,435 is a fair contribution from a £50,000 estate whose estate it is. This Government is doing more for the dependants of deceased soldiers than the last Government did. If anything, the provision in this bill errs on the side of generosity.",45,Cameron Th E Such Deaths As Having Been Cansed By Acts

231,Mr Barnard,"It does not mattersuggest that the Government is being too generous to the soldiers? opposite are trying to make out that they are concerned in the welfare of the soldiers and their dependants. The fact is that, when they had the opportunity, they did very little for the soldiers. This Gocertain proposals were put forward by vernment is helping the soldiers and their dependants by increasing pay and allowances, and in this measure no injustice is being inflicted on any one. Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) gave three reasons for not accepting the amendment. The first was that the amount which would he levied on the estate of deceased Bokliersi f the amendment were agreed to would be ridiculously small. I do not regard that as a valid objection. The whole object of tlie amendment is that the amount should be small. I think that the estate of deceased soldiers should be exempt altogether from estate duty. The honourable member for Bass( Mr tions made in the direction we now Barnard), in discussing this measure, repropose, and also representations made ferred only to large estates, but we want to place all soldiers' estates on the same level, whether large or small. ""We believe that a soldier's estate of £6,000 should be pages of amendments. In such circumtreated in the same way as a soldier's estate of £60,000. That is tlie principle on which the amendment is based. Thc Treasurer also said that the Government which was in power when this bill was first brought in failed to give eifect to the principles which we are now advocating. I have no responsibility for what was done then; I was not here at that time, and neither were the other honourable members who have spoken in favour of the amendment. The Treasurer further stated that the proposal embodied in the amendment was considered by the special committee on taxation, and turned down. I believe that joint committees of members of both Houses have rendered very useful service from time to time. They have been instrumental in ironing out a number of difficulties, and I hope that they will continue to do good work, but that is no reason why this amendment should not be accepted. Joint committees are no more infallible than is the Government or this committee. When a mistake is made by a committee or a government, the matter should be reconsidered and judged on its merits. It is never too late to correct a wrong. The proposals which we are now discussing were before this Parliament six or seven months ago. On that occasion, honourable members on this side of the chamber, and the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) undertook to examine them and, if he were convinced of their justice, to bring in a bill in which they would be embodied. He has chicled us to-night because we have proposed a further amendment designed to give special consideration in respect of estates of members of the fighting forces. He said that we ourselves should have made such provision long ago. The Treasurer's proposal is but a pious proposition. It is six or seven months since we discussed this matter previously. After examining the proposition, and considering representaat a recent meeting of the special committee, the Treasurer now brings down not six amendments, but six stances, can he seriously say that the proposal we now make in order to benefit members of the fighting forces must be disregarded because the Government has not had time to consider it? It is very seldom that six pages of amendments are proposed by the Minister in charge of a measure such as this. The Opposition asks that the estate of a man who voluntarily enlists in the fighting services and is killed in action, or dies as a result of war service, within three years shall not be subject to estate duty. The imposition of estate duty obviously depletes the estate to the disadvantage of the soldier's widow and dependants. The Treasurer has accepted our proposal that estates up to a value of £5,000 should be exempted from duty. The Opposition has achieved that much in this debate. I again urge the Treasurer to go a step further and liberalize the provision in respect of the expectation of life of members of the forces for the purposes of assessing estate duty. It can reasonably be presumed that a member of the forces",46,Cameron Th E Such Deaths As Having Been Cansed By Acts

We ask that exemption from duty be provided in respect of an amount calculated at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, compound interest over the term of normal expectation of life. That provision is embodied in the British act. That is the effect of the amendment moved by the honourable Hughes). I contend that it is a reasonable compromise on the proposal submitted by the Treasurer. I note with pleasure that the Treasurer has accepted the Opposition's suggestion to reduce the rate of duty payable on the death of a second member of the forces in the same family. The proposals we now submit are equally, if not more important than those which the Treasurer has already agreed to. I renew .the request which I made this afternoon that the benefits of this measure be applied to members of women's war organizations, such as, the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Women's Auxiliary Air Force Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Australian Army Nursing Service and the Voluntary Aid Detachments, who are performing war service in which they may lose their life. I also urge the inclusion of members of all air raid precautions organizations who are directly concerned with civilian defence. These proposals are just as important as the six pages of amendments standing in the name of the Treasurer. Most of them were discussed when this matter was last debated in this Parliament. All of them are equitable. I am certain that the public of Australia would appreciate their adoption by the Government on behalf of the widows and dependants of members of our forces who make thc supreme sacrifice. is remarkable that honourable members opposite should propose an amendment which is patently intended to benefit persons having larsre estates. moved by the honourable member for tralians serving in this war. poses that in addition to the exemption knows what a Labour government did limit of £5,000 already granted in respect in the last war. [50] of the estate of a person who dies on war service, exemption should also be granted to an amount calculated at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, compound interest for the period of normal expectation of life according to tables compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician. It is obvious that the majority of members of the fighting services do not own estates of a value greater than £5,000. Indeed, how many of them would own estates valued at more than £1,000? It is very patent that generally the value of estates of members of the fighting services would not exceed the exemption limit of £5,000. That being so, why should an additional exemption be provided in respect of a sum computed at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, compound interest for the normal period of expectation of life? How many members of our fighting services would qualify for such exemption? On thc other hand, such a provision migbt operate unfairly to the advantage of estates up to a value of £100,000. That could he the case should the owner of a very large estate be killed on active service at a comparatively youthful age. The Treasurer's proposal definitely expresses the Government's appreciation of the services being rendered by volunteers serving in the front line. I am under no illusion that very many civilians will perform service in this war equivalent to service in the front line. be included. amendment would defeat its own purpose. The Treasurer's proposal definitely makes a distinction in favour of those persons who actuaUy bear arms, as compared with civilians. I do not think that any honourable member opposite would suggest that no distinction should be made between men who da the actual fighting in thc front, line and civilians. ber studied the British practice? with the British practice.

245,Mr Holt,"The honourable memberGovernment of which the honourable member was a member did nothing in this war. The Treasurer's proposal adequately expresses the Government's appreciation of the distinction to be made between men actually serving in the front line and civilians who may become casualties but who are actually in the rear. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield is dearly designed to advantage members of the fighting forces who have large estates. In my opinion such persons should not be so advantaged. As one who is about to enter upon training for service in an air crew, and as one who may possibly be the subject of this particular provision, I am satisfied that the bill makes adequate provision in this respect. [S.41] -It is regrettable that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has not dealt with the merits of my amendment. Instead, he concentrated on the class of people whose <.' -. talus may be assessed. He dealt almost solely with' an estate valued at £50,000. I. also 'mentioned that class of case. So -far as I am personally concerned, I agree with the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Treasurer has said quite truthfully that Ryan). I am of opinion that all estates should be free of duty, provided that the owner lose his life as the result of service in the fighting forces. That principle was applied in the .last war. Why should it not be applied on this occasion? Is this war of less importance than the iast war? Isi t further away from our shores than was the war of 1914-1S? However, my present proposal is not to exempt all such estates entirely. It reprejustice has been done through some act of sents a compromise and ensures that thc Government shall obtain considerable revenue from the larger estates. The Britisli law wliicli makes provision along these lines has been in existence for 2S years. I also point out that the law of New South Wales completely exempts from estate duty the estate of any man who loses his life on active service. The Treasurer contended that my amendment represents a benefit solely in respect of a big taxpayer. My proposal, however, must be read in eonjunction with the provision in the hill that estates up to a value of £5,000 are to be completely exempt. It is only in respect of estates exceeding that value that a qualified form of duty is to be levied. We have not incorporated in this measure all of the provisions of the British act, and I point out that the British act of 1914 has a further provision giving such estates the benefit of the most favorable of two. different methods of assessment. [8.45] -Unde r the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act this Parliament makes no distinction between soldiers in the payment of pensions in respect of injuries or disabilities suffered as a result of active service. The same pension is payable irrespective of whether a man has nothing or is worth £100,000. It should ,be difficult for any government to say that what a man killed on active service leaves to his widow and children shall be taxed. The Government is fully entitled to say to a soldier who returns from war that it will tax his income at such and such a rate, or, perhaps, even impose a capital levy on it , for some people have talked about a capital.levy and some day such a levy may be practical politics in .this country. TheI was a member of a government during this war; but I have never been Treasurer, and was not in the Government when its budget was presented. All Ministers know perfectly well that after conducting their departments they have not a great deal of time in which to tell the Treasurer how he should frame his budget and what taxes he ought to impose. If an error, oversight, or inomission on the part of the men who were Ministers in governments formed by this side, there is no logical justification in attempting to perpetuate that error, oversight, o.r injustice. The Treasurer referred to the generosity shown to people affected, by this bill.

249,Wakefield ( Mr Duncan,"Hughes) is justis quite evident that the argument of honourable gentlemen opposite is directed to the interests of the rich and that it has little or no relevance to thc common soldier. The exemption of £5,000 completely cuts out the vast army of men who, if they lose their life in this war, in the worldly sense, lose everything. A great deal has already been done in this legislation on behalf of the numcrieally insignificant officer class. The exemption of £5,000, it must be remembered, means rhe exemption of £5,000 net after deducting all of tbe imposts and obligations which may be attached to an estate. The first £5,000 of the value of an estate is exempted regardless of Avhether the estate be worth £50,000 or £100,000. I desire to indicate what Parliament's attitude has always been towards whnt E may describe as the "" officer class"", for whom honourable members of thc Opposition are manifesting extraordinary concern. Parliament has always recognized the claims of the dependants of deceased officers by granting to them pensions and allowances based on the salary which was paid to those officers when they were alive, with the result that their pensions and allowances have always been almost, infinitely greater than those payable to the widows and dependants of private soldiers. I myself have never been prepared to admit that the loss of the life of a soldier is any less a loss than the loss of the life of an officer, but Parliament has taken the attitude that it is, and based its pensions legislation accordingly. So great is the solicitude opposite for the wealthy that they would incorporate in Commonwealth legislation -something which evidently is a part of British legislation. The British Parliament traditionally has always been much more class conscious than, Providence be praised, this Parliament has ever been. in New South Wales entirely exempts from duty fhe estates of deceased soldiers. with what the Parliament of New South Wales has done in that regard, and wha tever it has done will not affect my judgment of tbe merits of the matter. We should get on with the interests of the . common people and the common soldiers of this country before we devote any further time to the class, the protection of whose interests appear to be the main business of honourable gentlemen opposite. [8.5SJ 1 give to the Treasurer (Air. Chifley) all credit for having introduced this legislation in order to earry out his promise to the Opposition that if he found that its contentions were borne out he would amend the Estate Duty Assessment Act which we passed last year. I look upon the Treasurer as a most fair-minded man. He gives consideration to every case put to him. to the honourable memher? promised and granted to me what I can never expect to receivefrom the honourable member for Batman. honourable member for Batman has always been courteous to me, but, when he was a Minister, no representation that I made to him ever bore fruit. But the Treasurer gives fair consideration to every case submitted to him. It is regrettable that political turmoil should arise out of a discussion in this National Parliament of such a matter as the death of men on active service and the treatment of their women folk. I regard it as indecent that honourable members of the Opposition should be accused of representing only one class in the community of honourable gentlemen when they propose amendments to legislation placed before them. In the last war many wealthy men refused to accept promotion from the ranks so that those less fortunate than themselves in civil life could be appointed to the higher positions. Among them were many men whom I am proud to call my friends. Unfortunately, there are in the community many people who regard the present war situation with complacency. They say, in effect, ""Let George do the job. We will wave flags when others go I am not familiar off to fight and we will be the first to welcome them when they return"". This bill provides an opportunity to do something for the dependants of men who lose their",49,Cameron Th E Such Deaths As Having Been Cansed By Acts

As the spokesman of the Opposiself, approach the tribunal and ask for tion for this purpose, I want to direct my attention to the question not of whether women should be employed and how they should be paid for that employment, but of whether this statutory rule, which set3 up a special tribunal to deal with the wages and conditions of women workers, should be approved. This statutory rule, I submit, cuts right across the general principle of arbitration for which this Parliament has stood for many years, and the principle of adherence to arbitration for which the Opposition parties have stood in season and out of season for a very long time. What is done under the regulations contained in the statutory rule is worth examination. In the first place, regulation 5 provides that the Minister may appoint a Womens Employment Board, and then it proceeds to deal with the personnel of that body. I shall return of some importance. The Minister may appoint a Women's Employment Board, and the board, by a subsequent regulation, is given certain authorities in connection with this matter. What are those authorities? Regulation 6 provides that where an employer, because of a shortage or impending shortage of male labour, desires to employ females on work for which the rate of payment for male employees has been determined by any industrial award and for which a rate of payment for female employees less than so determined, he may make applicahe shall under the conditions set out in",54,Paibb

274,Motion (By Mr Chiflet ) Agreed To,,55,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations
275,Mr Menzies (Kooyong) [9.18],"I the rate for male employees has not beenrepresentation; but the employer, unless he chooses by some private arrangement to tell somebody else, has no means of notifying associations OT organizations of employers. That is a small matter, but I mention it in passing. Provision is also made for the manner iu which the board shall deal with the matter. It is to determine the character of the work to be done, whether females may be employed, and the wages and conditions that shall be applicable to that particular prospective female employee. Sub-regulation 5 of regulation 6 provides that in deciding the percentage of the rate of payment for males to be paid to females the board shall take into account the efficiency of females in the performance of the work and any other special factors which may be likely to affect the productivity of their work in relation to that of males. I pause here to point out that the board is not told that it work. shall take into account the family obligations of the female employee. It is merely told that it must take into account her volume of production and her efficiency. There may be very many cases in which that is a very proper test; but I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that for very many years, the basic wage has been determined on a family or social principle. When the Harvester standard was established in this country by the late Mr centages which have already been preJustice Higgins, he did so on the basis of a man, his wife, and three children. It is quite true that since then, there has been a slight increase of real wages, then a marked reduction during the economic depression, to be followed by two or three stages in which wages were restored on a. new basis. The result was that, in effect, the basic wage earner is getting to-day what the Harvester standard sought to give to him. Whether it is statistically correct to say that the average workman has a wife and three children is not the point. I suppose that on the average, the basic-wage earner has a wife and a fraction of a child, or a child and a fraction. But the truth remains that we have fixed basic wages in Australia on the principle of the social or family responsibility of the basic-wage earner. That, I would have thought, was a matter which should be considered by tribunals dealing with the wages of a worker. It is not for me tc say what answer they should give. It is not for anybody in this House to say what answer they should give. But that that is a material factor to be taken into account is not only my opinion; it is also the settled practice of the Arbitration Court for a great number of years. The regulation then proceeds, because the draftsman has recognized that one cannot in all circumstances prescribe the same wages for a woman as for a man, that the percentage to be paid to a female shall not be less than 60 per cent, nor more than 100 per cent, of the rate of payment determined for adult males employed on similar work. The comment which need be made at this stage is this same rate as males if they do the same great number of current awards of the Arbitration Court dealing with the wages paid to women provide that females shall be paid 54 per cent, of the male wage. I do not know whether that is right or wrong, or whether it is too high or too low. I am not in a position to say. But I know that as the result of the prescription of 60 per cent., these regulations definitely operate so as to alter the perscribed by industrial tribunals. reasoning of the right honourable gentleman, it would be impossible for females to give equal work for equal pay. a woman were doing the job of a basic wage earner and received the basic wage, the honourable member would have some difficulty in justifying the payment to her of the same basic wage as that received by the male, because the male worker's wage is determined upon family responsibilities. Some payments have the basic wage as an ingredient. Others are payments for skill, or production, or what-you-will. In those cases, if the test is skill or production, that test ought to be applied equally irrespective of tbe sex of the worker. A great deal of work in this country is done 'by people on the basic wage. For many years, the basic",55,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

The basic wage has been paid to bachelors because of that fact. The only other point of detail I shall mention is that this special tribunal will make decisions in relation to various industries, and those decisions will operate irrespective of the fact that they may be utterly inconsistent with decision made by the Arbitration Court. Within the limits of its jurisdiction, this special trition to female workers. For the future, bunal has been given an over-riding authority in relation to the employment of women. So far, I have referred to matters of detail, which might provoke considerable argument, but they have been matters which this Parliament is not called upon to determine. This Parliament is, however, called upon to determine two large questions of principle which lie right at the root of the structure of this special tribunal. The first of these is that the Government has set up a special tribunal to deal, not with a special industry, as, for example, the coal-mining industry, for which a special tribunal has been established, or for some subdivision of an industry, but with a class of worker to be found in any one of a hundred different industries. If it be sound to setup a special tribunal to deal with and regulate the employment of women, would it not be equally sound to set up a similar tribunal to deal with juvenile workers, or certain other classes of workers? Yet, if that procedure were followed, the whole basis of the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court would be undermined. I say with gravity, and deep consideration, that the setting up of this special tribunal is thoroughly unsound. The Arbitration Court has exercised important functions over a long period of years, and it has discharged them sometimes to the satisfaction of one party, and sometimes to the satisfaction of another. But who will say that, on the whole, the arbitration system of this But in practice, country has not been beneficial to the wage-earners? I am quite sure that it has been beneficial to them. The Arbitration Court has been able to deal with thu vast and comprehensive problems that have come before it because it has been able to deal with industry as a whole. When it has had to deal with the apprenticeship system, for example, it has been able to regard the subject in its relation to all industries. Similarly, whenit has been required to deal with the problem of the employment of women, it has been able to apply broad principles to many industries -So we have had some uniformity in practice. But now the Government is saying: "" The Arbitration Court is to have no jurisdiction in relait is to deal only with male workers.'"" For, obviously, this is the first step to that end. Government is to simplify procedure. simplified by splitting it up under two or three headings, and allowing one tribunal to deal with one aspect and another with another. That is the way to complexity, not to simplicity. this authority has been set np because of the increased employment of women under the abnormal conditions of war? tion of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) to regulation 6 which refers to "" a shortage or impending shortage of male labour "" and provides that an employer who desires to emplov females must make an application to the board, setting out the nature of the work he desires to have done. Quite obviously, this new authority will have to deal with a wide variety of callings. I criticize the regulations on the ground that they deal with a situation which is not limited in any way, and because they remove from the Arbitration Court a large part of its authority. the decisions of the Women's Employment Board will be the findings of th"" Arbitration Court.",56,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

288,Mr Roseveab,"No doubt the basis of that. In fact, the contrary is provided for, because, whereas the court has prescribed that the base rates of pay for women shall be 54 per cent, of those applicable to men, these regulations provide that the special tribunal may fix the base rates, but they shall not be less than 60 per cent, nor more than 100 per cent, of tbe rates applicable to men. The establishment of this board undoubtedly implies a subtraction from the functions of the Arbitration Court. The second major principle that T criticize has relation to the constitution of the board. I invite the earnest attention of honourable gentlemen opposite to this point. In particular, I call the attention of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to it. Sub-regulation 2 of regulation 5 providesThe board shall consist of a chairman, one fact that a union official has been calmly special representative of employers and one special representative of employees, and, in addition, two other members to be appointed from time to time (according to the subject-matter to be dealt with by the board), one of whom shall represent an employers' organization, and the other an employees' organization. Let us deal first with the core of the board. At first sight, it may seem to be quite fair to provide that a direct representative of the employers and of employees shall be appointed to act with an impartial chairman, because an impartial chairman should be able to make up his mind as between the interested parties. The chairman of the board is Judge Foster, of the County Court of Victoria. too! do his best to be impartial. The representative of the employees is, I understand, mv friend Mr Wallis, of tbe Clothing Trades TJnion, for whom I have the warmest regard. I have known him for many years. His views on the subject of the employment of women in industry are as well known as the views of any individual could be known. I do not imagine that Mr Wallis will be expected to maintain a judicial attitude on the problems that will come before the done in this case in line with the appointhoard, because for many years he has ment of Judce Drake-Brockman to the heen a foremost advocate of the very ideas Arbitration Court Bench? underlying these regulations. But what about the representative of the employers? The Grovernment has appointed to represent the employers a woman named Cashman whose acquaintance I have not the honour to possess. I understand that for a number of years she served' zealously and, I have no doubt, efficiently, as an official of the Printing Industry Employees TJnion, and that in a short intervening period until her appointment as a member of this board, she served as an industrial officer in the Munitions Department. If we were engaged just for the good of our health in fun and games, I could admire what the Minister has done, and say: "" Well, it is a piece of impudence that rises so high that it becomes magnificent and, in fact, almost admirable "". But these are not days when we are engaged in fun and games, and we have to face the appointed to represent the employers. Of course, I know that we shall be told that there was some to and fro between the Minister and certain bodies of employers. No doubt it was said that the employers intended to challenge these regulations. Possibly, representative employers said: ""'We shall get in touch with the Prime Minister, for we do not intend to make a nomination"". If the employers had declined to make a nomination and the Minister had said: "" All right, if you do not enre to exercise the right I have conferred upon you to make a nomination, I shall make a nomination myself "", there may bave been some force in what has been done. Some other honoraible member will deal with that aspect of the suba good man, ject. On such facts, I should not be inclined to become heated over the matter'. But for the Minister to come along and say: ""Because the Chamber of Manufactures, or some other authority, has not made a nomination, I shall appoint a union official as the representative of the employers"" may be put on a par with, let us say, the appointment of my friendly constituent, Archbishop Mannix, to represent the Protestant Federation at some theological gathering.",57,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

This is a serious matter. If we are to have industrial satisfaction in this country, not only the employees, but also the employers, must believe that, they are being given a fair deal. I liave listened in this House week after week to impassioned appeals by the honourable member for Hunter on behalf of the coal-miners whom he represents. I always listen to tbe honourable member's utterances with respect. I ask the honourable member what the coalminers would say if, on the Central Coal Reference Board, a person from among the directors ef J. and A.

In fact, it would be more than a monstrosity. It would be exactly what the honourable member for Hunter would call it if he were asked to describe it. Here are regulations which go out to tbe people of Australia as representing what the Government would have us believe is its notion of fair play in the exercise of very far-reaching executive powers. Not, only must a regulation, of itself, be fairly of .any law is to determine what may be conceived, composed and expressed, but. it. must also be fairly exercised.

297,Mr Menzies,I point out to the,59,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations
298,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe rstudded with, so many glorious failures. The right honorahle gentleman is completely unrealistic. When this Government assumed office last October, it discovered that many things which might have been done had not been done. Australia is in a critical situation; but, us the result of the activities of the present Government, the situation is less critical to-day than it was when the Government assumed office, simply because the country is in a much better position to meet a crisis. The Government found itself faced with the problem that was caused by greater demands being made in respect of man-power for the services and for industry. Consequently, there was greater need for the introduction of larger numbers of women into all branches of industry. This gave rise to difficulties for the present Administration, as it would have done for any other administration; because, in having women introduced into sections of industry in which they had not previously been employed, it found itself fa.ced with the necessity to confer with the respective trade unions, which naturally would not have co-operated unless they had been given certain guarantees, and in consequence the best results could not have been achieved. One of the matters that quite rightly troubled the trade unions was, that many captains of industry were anxious to secure the engagement of larger numbers of women for the simple reason that they regarded female labour as a reservoir from which they might draw cheap labour; they wanted the women, if they could secure their services at what are termed women's rates. Thus, a special problem was created for the Government. I am not here to examine the various reasons for the interminable delays that have occurred in the determination of matters that have been submitted to the Arbitration Court from time to time. It was necessary to dispose of these problems as rapidly as possible, because obviously the unions would have become very suspicious in regard to what was intended if decisions were delayed for twelve months or longer, as had happened in connection with certain matters that had been submitted to existing tribunals. Therefore, the Government decided to set up a special tribunal to deal with a special problem. The tribunal established was no more than what may be termed a wages board. Tliere are wages boards in Victoria, but the right honourable member for Kooyong does not argue that on that account the rights or the functions of the Arbitration Court are infringed. with important matters of principle. tion of wages and the determination of industrial problems, which are matters that would ordinarily be submitted to the Arbitration Court for decision. That is all that this particular tribunal is to do. Anticipating one of the arguments that may be advanced in reply to my contention that delay will thus be obviated, namely, because of the regulations pegging wages the Arbitration Court will not be so busy as it has been previously, may I say to honourable members opposite that, despite the fact that wages were pegged as at the 10th February last, except under certain special conditions, the time in which the Arbitration Court may deal with the matters it then had before it has already bad to be extended. The regulations first provided that those matters should be disposed of by the l3t May. An extension to the 1st June has already been made and, judging by the reports that have been received, it will be necessary to grant a further extension by many more months. Some of the Arbitration Court judges are busily engaged in other activities. Chief Judge Piper has been given the very important appointment of chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Judge Drake-Brockman is chairman of the Centra] Coal Reference Board. Already there has been considerable complaint in regard to the delays occasioned on that board. It can therefore be realized that the argument that the Arbitration Court is quite competent and able to deal with these matters expeditiously will not bear examination. The Government therefore determined to establish a special tribunal to deal with tbi3 special problem. Let us examine the remarks of the right honourable member for Kooyong. Carrying his argument to its logical conclusion, it would not be possible for women, no matter what their efficiency or productive capacity might be compared with men, to obtain the same rate of pay in any",59,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations
299,Mr Holt,Wages boards do not deal,60,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations
300,Mr Wakd,"They deal with the fixaindustry in which they had displaced men. merely proposes to give to the employers the right to introduce cheap labour into their difierent industries. The aim of the Government is to obtain greater production, but not by allowing the employers to exploit the situation by displacing males with female labour simply because it can be obtained at a cheaper rate. The argument that women should not receive the same pay as men, will not bear examination. The right bonorable member for Kooyong spoke of the family responsibilities of a man compared with those of a woman. In his own profession, a woman charges fees equal to those charged by a man. That is the position also in the medical profession, and in many branches of industry, such as the boot trade, and the transport services. Women have been introduced into the transport services of Melbourne at the male rate of pay. Nobody in this Parliament has suggested that it is wrong to give to those once that I was unaware that any such women the full male rate. Because it was discovered that women were quite competent to do the work involved, no objection was raised by the employers or by any honourable member of this House to their being placed on an equal basis, in regard to wages and conditions, with the men whom they had displaced. the honourable gentleman be that in all circumstances, whatever the nature of the work, women shall receive the same pay as men, why do the regulations provide that they shall get not less than 60 per cent, of the male rate?. and I have not argued, that in all circumstances the pay shall be equal. There are many factors which, the Government recognizes shall be taken into account when determining what wages shall be paid. But it says that, where it can be shown that the efficiency and productive capacity of the woman is equal to that of the man, she shall receive the same rate of pay as the man whom she displaces. The right honourable member argues that that should not be done; that, in determining the basic waare, heed must be taken of the responsibility of the man and that therefore, no matter what may be the efficiency or the productive capacity of The right honourable member the woman, she must not receive the same rate of pay as the man. The Government does not accept that view. It lays down that this tribunal may fix a rate between 60 per cent, and 100 per cent, of the prevailing male rate. Let us examine the composition of the tribunal, against which a great deal of criticism has been levelled. The regulations provide, first, that there shall be a judge as chairman. The Government selected Judge Foster, a County Court Judge in the State of Victoria. The right honourable member for Kooyong evidently is displeased because of that selection. The words that he used were, that Judge Foster will do his best to be impartial. Doubtless he had in mind the questions that were directed to a Minister in the Senate in regard to the past activities of Judge Foster. questions had been put. orable member would be aware that Judge Foster was an unsuccessful Labour candidate at general elections held in the year 1917. No doubt, because he had been in some way associated with the Labour pairty he then became "" unsuitable "" for selection as a chairman of any tribunal, although as the right honourable gentleman said, he would "" do his best"" to be impartial. Judge Foster has occupied a position on the Bench for many years, and, as far as I can ascertain, has filled that position with distinction. NowI turn to the other two special representatives mentioned. Emphasis was laid on the word "" special"". The right honourable gentleman said that the selection of the employers' representative was the greatest piece of impudence that he had ever known. I suggest that lawyers could far outdo me in impudence. When it was decided that a tribunal should be established, I , as Minister, was obliged to confer with the representative organizations covering employers and employees. In the case of the employers, communications were directed to the chambers of manufactures and the chambers of commerce. Every body was aware of the urgency of the matter and",60,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

304,Mr Ward,"Doubtless the right honthe need for speedy action. chambers of manufactures communicated with the Government, and, after offering various reasons why they did uot wish this tribunal to be established, asked the Government to reconsider the matter and declined to make any nomination at all. That indicated that they did not wish to sec the tribunal established. The chambers of commerce, after criticizing the whole scheme, eventually nominated Mr Johnstone. That nomination was very grudgingly forwarded to the Government. I had also communicated with the Department of Munitions. There is nothing unusual in that fact, because that department is the largest single employer of female labour in this country. Therefore, the Government will be affected to a greater degree by the decisions of this tribunal than will any other employer. I understood that, when the Government set out with a plan for an all-in war effort, it was concerned only with getting results, and was not concerned with protecting the rights and privileges of individuals or sections of individuals. When I received the nomination of Miss CashmanI inquired regarding her qualifications, and, on finding that they were satisfactory, I selected her as the representative of the employers. nated her? tions. Why is objection raised to the appointment of Miss Cashman? It is said that she bas been prominently associated with the trade union movement, and has beeu an employee of the Government. Mr Hoi/r -Has she ever been an employer ? the Department of Munitions, which is the largest employer of women in the Commonwealth. What honourable members opposite arc troubled about is, not that Miss Cashman has had vast experience in the trade union movement, but that she might be prepared to deal fairly and impartially with the matters to be referred to the tribunal, and might favour a decision which would give to women in industry fair and just treatThe ment. Now let us consider the qualifications of Mr Johnstone for the position of representative of the employers. He became a member of tbe management committee of the Boot Trade TJnion in 1900. He was a delegate to the Labour Council in 1904. He became secretary of the union in 1905, and remained in that position until the 12th July, 1921. He was an official of the union for a longer period than that for which Miss Cashman was connected with the printing trade. We now find out why objection was raised to the appointment of Miss Cashman. cared to ally herself to some exploiting manufacturer, as did the honourable member for Wentworth before he became a member of this Parliament, she would have been regarded by honourable gentlemen opposite as an acceptable representative. After leaving the union, Mr Johnstone opened a retail boot shop, and then became manager of a factory. Shortly afterwards, he became secretary of the Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Association, and is still secretary of that body. He has prepared three awards, one for the Boot Manufacturers Association, the second for the Wood Last and Heel Manufacturers Association, and the third for the Bespoke Bootmaking and Retailing Association. He is required to adhere to an agreement that any female labourers taken on to perform any work done by a male must receive the full male award rates, irrespective of age and experience. That is provided in the boot trade award. about appointing this board? fact is that I was not scared of the criticism of the Opposition, and therefore I selected as the employer's representative a person whom I consider to be best qualified for the position.' In this ca?c I chose Miss Cashman. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) made a great deal of capital of what he termed political appointments.

Is it such a document as the have an advantage as compared with the Arbitration Court. A judge of the Arbitration Court may have special knowledge with regard to particular phases of industry, but this tribunal can have the additional advantage of the advice of special representatives of the employers and employees to assist it when dealing with special cases. honourable member for Kooyong owes his position in this Parliament to a political appointment. Latham, whom he succeeded as member for Kooyong, was elevated to the High 'Court Bench as the result of a political appointment. If I were the right honourable member for Kooyong, I should hesitate to argue about political appointments. I am not at all disturbed because of the poor case that has been submitted in support of this motion, but I point out to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) that he himself had something to say with regard to the employment of women in industry when he was Minister for Labour and National Service. He held very pronounced views on the subject. He was of opinion that, no matter how much they did, nor how efficiently they did it, women should never receive the same pay as men. He said as much in his submission to the Cabinet of which he was a member-and I ask honourable members opposite not to question me too closely as to how I obtained this information, but the fact is that I have here a submission to Cabinet by the honourable member for Fawkner himself. I shall not weary the House by reading the whole of it, because, like the speeches of honourable members opposite, it is interesting only in parts. It is as follows order in divulging publicly in the House the contents of a confidential document presented to a Cabinet, the members of which are sworn to secrecy?

I once had the honour to belong to a government, and confidential communications between the then Prime Minister and Ministers of his Cabinet, having been by somebody purloined, became a matter for public discussion.

It is entirely for the Minister, himself, knowing the history of the document which he proposes to quote, to decide whether or not he should divulge its contents. In this case, since I presume that the Minishonesty been impugned? If any such ter considers that the contents of the document are germane to the matter under discussion, there is, I submit, no standing order against his disclosing them. when the Minister for Labour and National Servioe( Mr Ward) indicated that he proposed to disclose the contents of a confidential document submitted to Cabinet by a member of a previous administration. I was prepared to uphold the objection, but the Minister anticipated me by saying that he did not propose to quote from the document. If it be improper to read the document itself in the Blouse, then it is no less improper to divulge its contents. The Minister is debarred from making the document itself public, and also from revealing its contents. As for the case cited by the honourable member for Batman, when certain documents were quoted in the course of a debate in this House, I point out that the contents of those documents had previously been published in the press. to the document again, but I take exception to tbe suggestion that there was anything dishonest in the manner in which the document came into my possession.

But I have recently been doing some research, and I have discovered that when some honourable members made .pleas in this Parliament for an impartial decision, they were talking with their tongues in their cheeks.

Glancing through tlie list of shareholders of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company LimitedI found, the following entries:A. VV. Fadden and A. E. Hannaford, investors, e/o A. W.

Australian Consolidated Industries.lean Maud Spender. 0 Fairfax-road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales-40 0 shares. That is as f a r as my examination has gone up to date; but if honourable gentlemen are interested, I shall continue it later. The right honourable member for Kooyong said-and this appears to be tbe only point of any consequence he made-tba t there would be greater uniformity between the decisions of the Arbitration Court as compared with the decisions of the board. He seemed to think that was such a virtue that we should stick solely to the Arbitration Court, and refrai n from appointing this I do not propose to argue whether equal tribunal. Court has given many conflicting decisions. No one oan argue that it has displayed a very great degree of uniformity in its decisions. Some of the difficulties which have arisen in industry have been caused by anomalies created hy decisions of the Arbitration Court; and it is very likely that this tribunal whicli will deal with this special problem will be able to achieve a greater degree ->f uniformit y in its decisions. I emphasize that point, because, as I have indicated, the members of this tribunal posses'special knowledge of the particular industries with which tbey w i ll deal. Why are these regulations challenged before the tribunal has really begun to function? It has just been established. No one is yet able to judge its worth. Other shareholders However, we know that if the Opposition renders the tribunal ineffective, it will immediately create difficulties for the Government and the country, because the large trade unions interested in the work of the major industries would immediately withdraw, to some degree, their approval of the introduction of larger numbers of women in industry. This would create delay, and hinder the Government's programme of munitions production. If honourable members opposite really mean what they say, and sinOther shareholders cerely desire that we make a maximum war effort, they should not use as an argument for the abolition of the board some objection which they have to persons appointed to the board before the board has actually been tested. A t the same time, they will compel the Government to commence its negotiations all over again. Isi t not more important to the coimtry in its present crisis to speed up munitions production, and achieve maximum production in industry generally? This can be done only by introducing women in industry. This system, if it be given a chance, w i ll prove most effective. It w ill give to the Government the production which it is most anxious to obtain. Consequently, honourable members would be well advised to reject the argument submitted by the right honourable rrember for Kooyong, and vote against his motion for the disallowance of these regulations. Actually, the Arbitration pay for equal work should be paid to",64,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

It is as well that the House sbould know the facts concerning the appointment of this board. They are very interesting, and are set out in correspondence between the secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Mr Wilkins, the Secretary of the Department of Labour and National Service, Dr. Roland Wilson, and the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin).

The letter was ground. It was obvious, however, that received on the 27th March. Since employers' organizations cover the whole Commonwealth it was impossible to give an immediate reply. Consequently, the federal secretary of the Central Council of Employers telephoned to the Secretary of the Department of Labour and National Service informing him of the probable delay and asking for a short postponement of the appointment; but, if the Minister felt that the need was eo urgent, a hurried nomination would be made. No such indication was given by the Department of Labour and National Service. If this matter was so urgent, the employers should have been informed and they would then have hurried to make a nomination. On the contrary, they were given to understand that there was no urgency. On the l l t h April, Mr Wilkins wrote to Dr. Wilson as follows:In reply to thc invitation from the Minister for Labour and National Service dated 25th March, relative to the nomination of an employers' special representative for appointment to the Women's Employment Board, I am now directed to advise that the Associated Chamber of Commerce of Australia, the Central Council of Employers of Australia, and facturers and Allied Trades Association, 12 The objection of the above organizations to of women's employment.

340,Mr Harrison,"S o prompt as to the right honourable .memher for Kooyong got under the skin of tlie Minister for Labour and National Service. At any rate the nomination of Mr Johnstone was refused because he knew his job. On the 13th April, Mr Wilkins wrote to the Prime Minister objecting to the newly constituted Women's Employment Board. The letter also directed attention to the fact. . . that thc established arbitration system is f u l l y able to determine any aspect of women's employment, and the judicial capacity and wide experience of its judges covering all industries, is more competent to resolve these matters than any such additional authority as the proposed board. For these reasons, my organizations respectnot interfere with the normal jurisdiction of fully request that further consideration of this the court or of the commissioners. It may matter be made by thc Government before any irrevocable departure from the existing industrial arbitration system is implemented. That letter was not answered. Honourable members will agree that, in view of the fact that the employers not only accepted the invitation to nominate a representative, but also made a nomination before the personnel of the board was announced, the Minister was grossly unfair. the Government displayed its intention to carry out Labour's industrial policy by means of war-time regulations by appointing a board which is obviously biased in favour of the Labour party's policy because it consists of people picked directly from the ranks of Labour supporters. Quite obviously, the board is usurping the powers of the Arbitration Court. It is intimidating the employers in such a way that notwithstanding awards prescrihed by the Arbitration Court they will have to subscribe to whatever decisions it makes. All this had its genesis in the Industrial Relations Council, which was appointed at the end of last year. The newspapers featured the fact that the employers' representatives walked out of that council. Honourable members will recollect that questions about the Industrial Relations Council were asked in this House, but to this moment the facts bave not been disclosed to the Parliament. Industrial Relations Council was constituted as the result of a conference held in Canberra on the 27th and 28th December, 1941. That conference was attended by Arbitration Court judges and Jfr. Earrison. industrial commissioners. According to statements made at the conference, it was not the intention of the Government, when appointing the council, to interfere in any way with the functions of the Arbitration Court. Judge Piper, who was present, put that matter beyond all reasonable doubt. Addressing the conference, he said, "" I am not clear at the moment as to the relations between the proposed new council ancl the court. Will the proposed council be an advisory board?"" The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) repliedI t is proposed that the council should advise the Government on all labour matters, but will recommend to the Government what should be done to improve the existing machinery. It may ask that more commissioners be appointed. It w i ll be an adjunct to the executive power, but it will not settle disputes. The Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley) elaborated that point when he saidI t is fundamental that we approve thc policy of arbitration and that the representatives of thc court should understand that Moreover, there is no desire on thc part of the Government to usurp the function of thc court or to interfere with thc arbitration machinery. Gather is it a desire to give to the court a closer knowledge of what war-time production means to both employers and employees. It would be a mistake to attempt to adjust these things arbitrarily. It will be agreed that that statement, was one of government policy, and should have been accepted as such. I shall nottraverse the sorry attempt on the part of the chairman of the council, Sir William Webb, to commit that body to biased judgments, hut I shall mention some actions which should convince the House that the chairman of the council was biased in his judgments. The council consisted of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees, but the vote of the chairman would decide any issue in respect of which the voting was equal. The chairman was a man appointed by tbe Government, a man, moreover, who, in the course of his observations, proved that he was The biased in favour of the Labour party's industrial policy. He gave to representatives of employers the impression that the council was merely a shamsomething brought into existence to implement the Government's industrial policy under the guise of an independent .Labour party when the award is in contribunal. I draw attention to a stateformity with its idea; otherwise it immement made by the Minister for War diately seeks for means to circumvent the Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), decision of the court.

The council had been summoned to advise the Government on industrial matters, but its members found that the board was to supersede the Arbitration 'Court and take action that would violate established industrial principles. bas a habit of shelving sticky subjects. As When the representatives of the employers realized that the vote of the chairman would be cast one way and one way only, they walked out of the meeting, which was then adjourned sine die. The House should be told about another the proper course of appointing a board item on the agenda, which related to preconsisting of a representative of the ference to unionists. It did not.appear on the original agenda, but was introduced subsequently in a surreptitious manner. Mr Clarey stated that he wanted to make it clear that his intention formerly sought election to Parliament was to secure, not preference for unionists, but compulsory unionism, and he asked that the agenda should be altered accordingly. The representatives of the employers protested, and asked who was responsible for the appearance of the item on the agenda, as it had not. been placed on the agenda in December. The Mmister for Labour and National Service, who was present, stated that the Government had given that instruction. After some discussion this unbiased chairman stated in open council that further discussion would be useless, because he intended to vote for compulsory unionism. that? compulsory unionism was in force in Queensland. He did not wish to hear the view3 of the representatives of tbe employers, because his mind was made up. The chairman would not have been appointed if he had not seen the light, and recognized the alleged excellence of compulsory unionism. The Industrial Relations Council was rigged in much the same way as the Women's Employment Board, which the Government appointed under Statutory Rule No. 146. The representatives of the employers asked for an adjournment to enable them to submit the matter to their true to form, refused to grant it. Consequently, the council was divided. bow to your rulOn the agenda of the council was an item relating to the fixation of remuneration for females. That is now covered by this statutory rule. It was thought at the time that the Industrial Relations Council would shoulder the responsibility of the Government which, incidentally, we know, the meeting of the council broke up before a decision was reached, and the Government was obliged to resort to other means in order to put its scheme into operation. The Government did not take employers and a representative of the employees, with an impartial judge as chairman. Eirst, it appointed a judge of the Victorian County Court, who had as a supporter of the Labour party and who was appointed to the County Court Bench by a Labour government. The representative of the employees is Mr Wallis, of the Clothing Trades Union, who knows everything that is to be known about the Labour movement. Not satisfied with ensuring that the Labour party would have a majority on the board, the Government then appointed as the representative of the employers a women named Cashman, who is known to be biased in favour of the Labour party. That she does not know the problems of the employers did not disturb the Government. The Industrial Relations Council did, in fact, consist of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees, and trouble arose when the representatives of the employers discovered that the chairman was prepared to vote one way only. The Government determined to avoid any difficulty regarding the functioning of the Womens Employment Board by ensuring that",68,Employment Of Women Motion To Disallow Regulations

That the House do now adjourn. bring to the notice of the Government a matter which is at present engaging the attention of the Department of War Organization of Industry. I refer to the closing down of 61 non-essential industries in New South Wales and Queensland. I should not object to the most stringent rationalization of non-essential industries, but I object strongly to the total prohibition of such industries. agree, I believe, that, owing to age, or infirmity, or other disabilities, some persons engaged in some industries are incapable of working in other industries or of being taught to work in them. This undoubtedly applies to a residue of the employees in the 61 non-essential industries that have been prohibited in New South Wales and Queensland. Of necessity, therefore, such persons must be thrown on the industrial scrap heap. I do not believe that this is the policy of the Government. If it be so, the policy has been adopted quite recently. I say to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) that the great majority of supporters of the Australian Labour party outside this Parliament, who are vitally concerned in securing the return to Parliament of Labour members, do not approve of such a policy. They favour reasonable treatment of people employed in all industries. I invite the attention of the Prime Minister to the particular difficulties of persons engaged in the jewellery industry. I agree that the business of a jeweller at this time is non-essential. But this particular firm, in order to show its bona fides, endeavoured to obtain from the Department of Munitions and the Department of A i r c r a ft Production work for its plant and its skilled operatives; that is to say, those of its men who could be usefully employed. Such work was not forthcoming. The following letter. dated the 17th A p r i l , was written by the Ministerf o r A i r c r a ft Production (Senator Cameron), to whom my representaOF AMEKICA-REPATRIATIO N tions in respect of this firm were passed by the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin) :As a result of your letters the attention of the Aircraft Spares Section of this department has been specially drawn to the possibility of using the .works of Messrs.

Subsequently, this same gentleman advised me that the firm should get in touch with Ernest Kuenzli and Company, which had contracts for the manufacture of certain small parts. When I Every honourable member w ill passed that letter on to Philip Brady and Sons, that firm repliedYesterday afternoon, we interviewed Mr Ernest Kuenzli of Ernest Kuenzli& Co. and he informed us that he was quite capable of handling all the department's requirements on these instrument projects and there was nothing we could do to assist him. That was after all other channels for the utilization of this plant had been exhausted.

I have exhausted these two possibilities: There might have been work in connection with the war effort,' in which the plant of this firm could have been utilized, but it is evident from the letter of the Minister for A i r c r a ft Production that such is not the case.

It may be necessary for Cabinet to decide whether individual Australians travelling abroad should be allowed to express their views on various matters without regard to the effect that they might have on the relations between Australia and other countries, and tipon the general status that may be acquired by Australia among the nations of the wor'd. be financed? know. I am not concerned about that. I now submit the matter to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr of the personnel of that body, I trust Ward) for consideration from another aspect. I believe that the journalist in question is in a reserved occupation, and holds a certain exemption on that account. Every honourable member of this chamber must have persons in his electorate who are in reserved occupations, and thousands of electors have been called up for various forms of service. Once it is proved that a person is no longer required to carry out the duties that entitle him to reserved occupation status, there is only one thing for the Government to do, and that is to tell him to go on the unreserved list and carry out his duty as an ordinary citizen of this country. That principle should be applied to all citizens, irrespective of their social position, wealth or rank. In this war, we have none too much to play with, and the point that I have raised might well be taken into consideration by the Minister for Labour and National Service, since he has already made certain remarks in this chamber regarding the newspaper with which the Sydney journalist referred to is connected. It is grossly unfair that persons highly placed in the journalistic world should be allowed to go abroad, while others are required to remain in Australia and comply with the obligations cast upon them to serve their country. I ask that the law be administered without fear or favour. week, I referred to the case of a returned soldier in my electorate named Percy Holmes. To-day, I received a letter from the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost), in which he statesI desire to refer to the ease of Mr Percy Holmes, formerly N.99013, Corporal, School ol Engineers, and now of Price-street, Merrylnnds. Yon will recollect having made representations to me regarding Mr Holmes, and also referred to the matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the 7th May last. I am pleased to be able to say that, consequent upon regulations promulgated recently, the injuries sustained by the member whilst serving at the School of Military Engineering, Liverpool, have been accepted as a departmental responsibility. I appreciate the promptness with which the Minister has attended to the matter, and I congratulate him on the fact that he has recently reconstituted the War Pensions Entitlement Tribunal. In view that appeals by returned soldiers will receive a much more favorable hearing than in the past. Nevertheless, many other matters relating to the administration of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act require attention. I received a letter to-day from Mr Percy Holmes, which shows that the regulations already promulgated are not sufficient to meet all the needs of returned soldiers. My correspondent statesPrice-street, Merrylands, 18th May, 1942. Dear Mr Morgan, Many thanks for your letters and what yon have tried to do for me, but I don't appear to be getting anywhere.

361,. Mr Morgan (Reid) [11.35],"Lastlast letter, I received a letter from Lieutenant Cutler, V.C, saying that my pension claim was still being considered in Melbourne, so that I have made no further claim. Myself, wife and two young children are receiving food relief, which is pretty rotten for a man who has given nearly six years of his life soldiering for Australia. In desperation last Saturday, 1 went to try and join the Army again, but they sent for my Medical Board papers and I was declared medically unfit. I am paying off a war services home, but how I ara going to keep np the payments, I do not know; also, ray furniture. When I helped to return the present Government to office, I expected better things, but please do not think that I am complaining about what you personally have tried to do. I do not appear to have much chance of obtaining suitable employment, as 1 cannot do hard work and standing is out of tlie question on account of my foot. I went to Lithgow and got a definite promise of a good job at the Orange munitions factory at £9 10s. a week for 60 hours, but I could not do it on account of my foot, they said. I first made my claim on the 23rd January, 1942, and it is now the ISth May, 1942, and I have made no progress at all. I would thank you if you can push tha claim to a successful result.

369,Mr Moegan,"No. It is a matterthe 1914-18 legislation as binding, even where it affects men discharged since the proclamation was made. An Army spokesman explained to Smith's"" that it was not the military's job to interpret what a government meant, but merely to carry out what it ordered. Proclamation, therefore, gets returned, discharged fighting men exactly nowhere. Lads who fought the battle for Babaul, who trekked into the New Britain jungle to escape nnd serve again, for instance, cannot claim consideration as returned soldiers, because they liave not served abroad. Nor can the men who give the Japs hell from Darwin. "" Smith's"" has abundant proof that their treatment has been the cause of considerabledistress both among the men and their dependants. They consider they have been insulted. Here are three typical instances of what is happening under archaic regulations which the Oovernment insists must be enforced. The article goes on to cite instances similar to the one which I have just mentioned. This matter should not he left to departmental officials, but should be inquired into by a select committee. Che Minister said that he was considering the matter in conjunction with officials of the department, but that ib not satisfactory because the administrative acts of those officials might also need to be inquired into. This man was offered work in a munitions factory, but though the wages were good, he could not take the job because of his disability. He should be given light duties until his health is restored. As a returned soldier from the last war, he was in possession of a war service home, on which he was obliged to make payments. He has not been given a sustenance allowance, and has had to accept relief for himself and his family from the State. He should not be forced into the position of accepting charitable relief from the State authorities. He has also been paying off the cost of his furniture, and I submit that the moratorium should apply, not only to men on active service, hut also to men who have been discharged from the Army. This man necessarily got behind in his payments, and when that happens it is apt to undermine a man's health. On a previous occasion I referred to the matter of the production of munitions. I asked the Prime Minister why tbe Board of Area Management in Sydney lacked authority to make payments. The Prime Minister's reply was Mr Morgan. satisfactory as far as it went, but I understand that all items of capital expenditure must still be referred to Mr Nixon, the Director of Finance, of Melbourne, who has been very ill for the last five or six weeks. that information on reliable authority. Prowse) -The honourable member's time has expired. -About five or six weeks ago I and Mr Paul Jones, M.L.C, of Melbourne, made representations to thc Minister for Labour and Na tional Service( Mr Ward) with regard to tbe gold mines at Wood's Point and Gaffney's Creek. The position in that area is different from that in many other gold-mining areas in Australia. Those mines are situated in veritable bush country, and around them have sprung up fair-sized townships. That at Wood's Point consists of stores, butchers' shops and bakers' shops, an hotel and a hospital. Gaffney's Creek township is much smaller. In view of the complete cessation of the rather small tourist traffic resulting from petrol rationing, the whole investment in these towns, should the mines be closed down, will vanish completely. This matter is of importance to the residents of those districts, and in all the area from Mansfield to Wood's Point. I received an acknowledgment of the representations I made from the Minister, but I ask now whether he has given further consideration to the matter, and whether he can make an announcement to-night? Minister) [11.42] -in reply-With regard to the views which have been expressed by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein), I can only say that I shall take up with the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) the matter that he has mentioned. That is also my answer to the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson). The problem as to what use shall be made of the gold-mines at Wood's Point and Gaffney's Creek is related to the treatment of the goldmining industry as a whole. It is true",74,Penton Lecture To Ur Intheunited States Legislation Munitions Production

374,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Primethat a small town such as Gaffney's Creek would be dependent upon the local gold-mine; but that is also true of a number of small gold-mining towns in Australia. I shall look at the matter raised by the honourable member for Barker( Mr from the viewpoint of the relationship Archie Cameron) in the light in which he has put it to me. I do not know very much about the circumstances of the case; but I know that the gentleman referred to has been publishing a number of articles in American newspapers and magazines. I am told that they have had an excellent reception in the United States of America, and, as a consequence, some persons in that country expressed their willingness to finance a lecture tour by the author of the articles. I understand that the proprietors of the newspaper of which he is editor, agreed to release him for the purpose of making the tour. I am not in a position to say whether the lecturer would be supporting all the views that would be held by the Commonwealth Government. The newspaper of which he is editor does not support all the views held hy this Government. Indeed, it has singled out certain of my colleagues foT very severe criticism, and a great deal of unfair treatment. That has to be considered. But the Government has never expected that newspaper editors in Australia should support it willy-nilly, before it would extend to them the ordinary rights of an Australian citizen. Some time ago Sir Keith Murdoch paid a visit to the United States of America and the United Kingdom. He is the editor of an evening newspaper in Melbourne. This gentleman is the editor of a morning newspaper in Sydney. It is not for me to judge whether the proprietors of those newspapers have made the best appointments. That is for them to say. I shall not identify the Commonwealth Government in any way with a political decision which would take away from any Australian his rights as a citizen. I understand that this gentleman would not be called up in the Army even if he ceased to be the editor of the paper on which he is now employed, and thereby lost the protection which he now enjoys because of the importanee of his position. conjugal condition. That is the information which has been given to me. Witb regard to the other aspects of the case, I say to the honourable member for Barker that nothing could be worse between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United 'States of America than for this Government to take the responsibility of authorizing a lecture tour, or a campaign through certain newspapers. gest that the Government should authorize such a campaign. do so. In that case I should have to take the responsibility of approving everything a person said, or wrote. The only judgment the Government allows to be exercised on its behalf in matters of opinion is the judgment exercised by the censor. That relates exclusively to matters of national security. I have said that on many occasions, and I repeat it now. I do not know whether this proposed lecture tour will be a success, or a failure. I am quite certain that it cannot alter American opinion of the Commonwealth, because I know that at this moment, thanks to the work already done by the official representative of' the Government, the reputation of Australia in the United States of America and the United Kingdom has never been higher than it is at present. able gentleman think it is wise to incur unnecessary risks? I am incurring risks. Australian citizens have gone to the United States of America within the last year. Many of them have delivered lectures in that country. I do not think that the question which the honourable member for Barker has raised involves the problem for the Government which he seems to visualize. However, I shall study the matter. I am quite conscious of the importance of preserving a proper relationship between Australia and the United States of America. I am happy",75,Penton Lecture To Ur Intheunited States Legislation Munitions Production

It was the answer which the commission gave, having regard to the law and the facts. been admitted. cumstances have changed. It is perfectly correct, as the honourable gentleman has said, that the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act was framed to deal with returned soldiers who served in the last war, and in theatres of war distant from Australia. The circumstances to-day are not identical with those which then, existed. The Government is concerned with the present situation; and I shall bring the matter before Oabinet. However, I feel that our repatriation legislation ought to be above party disputation. It ought to be agreed upon by the Parliament for the benefit of those who serve this country. A parliamentary committee ' would be a very appropriate body to review the present position and to make recommendations to the Government. I shall place the appointment of a committee for that purpose before my colleagues and the decision will be announced very shortly.
