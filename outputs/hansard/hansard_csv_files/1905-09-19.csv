20,Mr Glynn (Angas),"There are severalany doubt as to what a particular description may mean; as to whether by using it, he may not be likely to mislead purchasers, and so bring himself within the penal sections of the Act, he need not place any description on his goods. In other words, he may abstain from trying to puff them, or from claiming special advantages for them, by allegations as to their nature or origin. But, under the Bill, an importer or exporter must, in every case, describe his goods according to the method prescribed by the Minister. This is so vital a difference in principle that we must be careful to see that we do not amplify our definition of trade description beyond that contained in the English Act, and, as I think I shall show, in the States Acts. member for Kooyong desire to withdraw his amendment? Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. ful to narrow, within its clear necessities, was, when coupled with the penal clausesthe meaning of trade description. The Minister, so far from having done that, has than that contained in the English Act. most unreasonably and stupidly amplified it. It is a pity that, when the Bill was introduced, we were not given a definition of its provisions, which, while being, as it should have been, succinct, would also have been adequate and clear. and learned member show that clause 3 compels the making of a statement as to what the goods are? do that. It defines a trade description, and is followed by other specific provisions If the honourable and learned member re fers to clause 7, he will understand the object which I have in view. I wish to show that the Bill differs vitally from the local and the English Acts, and that we should be careful not to amplify its definitions to increase the responsibility of those coming under it. The difference in principle to which I allude imposes a great responsibility on importers and exporters in Australia which is not imposed by the English Act, or the legislation of the States. I ister has not explained the provisions of the Bill with the clearness necessary for the proper understanding of it. It was not correct lo say that this Bill was founded upon the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887. The Minister ought to havetold us that while there was no departure-, in principle from English legislation that there was no departure in principlefrom English legislation. I stated that the Bill was based partly upon English legislation. ferred to was the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887. the Trade Marks Act. upon that point conveyed nothing. In the first place he should have explained the difference in principle, and should have informed us that instead of adhering to theuniform provision relating to ""trade description "" running through the several State Acts, which follow the English Act, a varying definition had been adopted. Heshould have explained, further, that apart from the difference in principle, the provision with regard to trade descriptions of the Bill, much more drastic in its effect Whilst the English statute merely declares that a trade description, in relation togoods, should include particulars as to the number, quantity, measure, gauge, or weight of the goods, paragraph a of clause 3 requires that particulars should be given as; to the nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight. It is remarkable that the addetT terms are words the definition of which is exceedingly loose, and the connotation of which is particularly indefinite. Instead of using the clear and accuratewords which appear in the English and States Acts, almost metaphysical terms of"" vague and nebulous meaning are employed. The words ""nature"" and ""quality"" are very wide and indefinite. Very much the same could be said with regard to""purity,"" and, in a minor degree, with regard to the words ""class"" and ""grade."" The only added word with any definitemeaning is ""size,"" and that happens to be superfluous, because all the information necessary may be called for under thehave complained that the Minterms ""number,"" ""quantity,"" and ""measure.""

I do not see why we should change the principles of English legislation, when there is no apparent necessity for so doing. If the Bill were passed a manufacturer would have to apply to all goods intended for export, the description prescribed in this measure, whereas, in order to comply with' requirements in regard to goods intended for home consumption, he would have to refer to an entirely different set of laws. Besides, it would require all the ingenuity of a lawyer to discover beforehand whether a particular trade description was or was not misleading in some material particular. learned member's objection to clause 7 ? Bill. My object is to point out that in our definition of "" trade description "" we ought not to increase the risk of manufacturers incurring penalties by amplifying-wher e it really is unnecessary-the meaning of the words beyond the limit suggested by the Imperial Act of 1887 and the various States Acts dealing with this subject. Where the Minister has departed from the definition in the English Act he has very seriously increased the risks to persons engaged in external commerce. The use of the word "" nature,"" the very first one in paragraph a, must have that effect. ""Nature"" is an abstract word which is exceedingly wide and indefinite. The Minister will make a man describe the nature of the goods that he is going, to proclaim as coming within the meaning of this measure, and a merchant will have no option, in cases of doubt, but to apply a description and risk a prosecution'. If it were not that I desire not to weary the Committee I could quote English decisions, reported in Kerly on Trade Marks, which show the difficulty that men experience in accurately describing their goocjs in relation to matters of quality their province. If they have no desire to or purity, which suggests the wisdom of the British Parliament in not making the definitions as wide-eve n where it is optional, as it is, under the English Act, to adopt them-as the Minister wishes to make them in this instance. fact that the paragraph refers to the numaccomplish anything that reasonably ought ber, quality, and purity of the goods, is to be done under a Bill of this kind. not the use of the word ""nature"" mere redundancy ? orable member's impression would be strengthened by a perusal of the English decisions on the shorter meaning of "" trade description "" as used in tlie Imperial Act. There are words introduced into this clause that will make '' confusion worse confounded."" They are at best duplications of meaning, and have a certain redundancy that is always dangerous. move to omit the word "" nature?"" order to test the principle of this definition.. The more words that are added to one that is already clear and accurate, the more indefinite its meaning becomes. The Court assumes that the Legislature does not use many words to express in any particular provision that which is already expressed, by one. Redundancy in debating often leads to nothing, but it is a particular vice in an Act of Parliament. I shall move to strike out the word '' nature '' in order that the definition may be limited to that given in the English Act of 1887 and in various States Acts. The Trade Marks Act of 1892 of South Australia gives definitions of "" trade description "" and ""false trade description,"" which are identical with those in the English Act, and differ materially in substance from the one' which we have how under consideration. In support of my assertion I shall not do more than refer honourable members to Part II . of that Act. If we did not pass this definition the Biir would be emasculated and rendered unnecessary, but everything that ought to be done would still be possible under the Customs Act, the Trade Marks Bill, and the local Acts of some of the States. the States have adopted the English legislation on trade marks. do so. We do not wish to impinge on adopt such legislation for local purposes, it is a matter that concerns only themselves.

I shall test the question by moving the omission of the word "" quality."" It refers to part of what is covered by the word ""nature,"" and the proposal to strike it out will not be open to the objection suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland in regard to the omission of that word. I cannot say at present that the object sought to be accomplished by the use of the word "" nature"" is not attained by another part of the Bill, but in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I move That the word ""quality,"" line 9, be left outtrust that the Committee will reject the amendment. If the .honourable and learned member had suggested another word more forcible than "" quality,"" I should not have objected to its omission, but.he has wholly failed to indicate what we should insert in its place. My desire is to add the word "" colour"" to the definition.

Nearly every advance that has been made in the world has been opposed by those who have benefited from the system sought to be improved. That had been the case in science, in literature, and in every department. The lineal ancestors of those who are opposing this Bill were the upholders of slavery, polygamy, and other things that are now regarded with horror. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). for Darwin with reference to the United States Act is not at variance with what honourable members on this side of the chamber have been trying to get in this Bill. So far as I can make out from his reference to American legislation, it calls upon people who put in their goods ingredients which are not ordinarily used in such commodities to affix a label stating what is contained in them. That is precisely what the honourable and learned memThe regulations have been endorsed by ber for Angas contended should be done in this Bill. Ministers have never explained what the clause under consideration and clause 7, which is the crux of the Bill, are intended to do. It seems to me that they are taking powers which, if exercised to the full limit,would control the whole of our commerce, and would be in conflict with several of our States Acts referring to internal trade. I am a supporter of this Bill. I voted for its second reading. Its main provisions are such as any one who desires to see commerce conducted honestly must wish to see ""adopted. But power is given to do such a wide diversity of things that we do not know where the Executive will stop in compelling people to submit to regulations and to the whole paraphernalia of inspection. I have had some experience of what inspection means, and I say* that this is one of the most' dangerous powers that can be given to any Government.' It enables inspectors to issue their fiat as to whether goods are to be exported as first, second, or third grade; in fact, as to whether they are to be shipped abroad with a chance of their bringing so much more or less money to the exporter. It is this dangerous power that I contend against. I wanted to pin the honourable member for Darwin to what I",17,Commerce Bill No 2

I wish to say that Australian jams were. never sent to South Africa short weight. The packages were sold at the weight they contained. That fact has been brought out in the House of Commons, and Australian exporters have been completely exonerated from any attempt to ""get at"" the War Office or the general public. Coming from an honourable member who complains so much about the "" stinking fish"" cry, his reference to this subject was remarkable. exported. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -I cannot speak with regard to butter, but certainly the exmarked. porters of jam were paid for net weight, no matter what was contained in the tins. The packages were used by the Army in whatever way they thought fit, but there was no misrepresentation in regard to the weight of goods purchased. As to leather, I cannot speak so positively, but from what I have heard, I am quite prepared to believe that Australian leather is as good as any leather made in the world. It may be true that some leather is adulterated here as it is in other parts of the world, and it in this State:is for us to determine whether we shall call upon the manufacturers or exporters to say whether their leather contains any foreign ingredients. I am quite prepared to give the Government power to do that. But I am not prepared to pass this clause as it stands, though I cannot see exactly how to move in the direction of amending it. The clause would subject exporters and manufacturers to the prospect of being blackalways contained in the Victorian Act. mailed at the instance of a staff of officials, whose word would have to be obtained as to'the quality of the goods be.fore they could be shipped. It is a fair thing to say that if a man exports leather which contains foreign ingredients, he shall declare what those ingredients are.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I hope theCommittee will not pass the amendment. The word ""quality,"" to my mind, is of great and grave importance. Even in regard to leather, which has been mentioned: by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I know that the quality for certain purposes has been materially reduced* by the application of certain chemical substances. Not only leather, but a variety, of other products may be rendered inferior in quality by the use of adulterants.. Mr G. B.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -If it is known to be inferior leather, it should be soMr G. B. EDWARDS -But under thisBill goods will be graded. member appears to be afraid of the word' ""grade."" Honourable members opposite have been using it in a ridiculous manner. They know perfectly well what is intended.

This is the way in which goods are graded*, Compulsory inspection under this Act takesplace with regard to butter and cheese intended' for export, and in regard to live stock and produce liable to carry any disease, such, for instance, as meat.

Some gentlemen connected with the trade came to see me. They had seen a copy of the Bill, and took fright because the words ""quality"" and ""weight"" were used in certain clauses. They thought that in future apples would have to be sold by weight instead of by the bushel. I pointed out that there was no intention to do anything of the kind, but that the object was, amongst other things, to fix the size of the case-to impose a standard for selling purposes. power in this Bill to do that.

It is absolutely necessary to retain the word ""quality."" the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Angas with a great deal of pleasure, as I always do, because they are always closely reasoned from his standpoint. I think, however, that the honourable and learned member is absolutely wrong in his view that we ought to adhere altogether to the wording of the English Merchandise Marks Act and the Acts of the various States. In Victoria, and I believe also in South Australia, there are Acts dealing with questions of this kind, but I am not sure that such legislation has been passed in any of the other States. Whatever we do must be applicable to the whole of Australia; and one of the obiects of this Bill is to secure uniformity. It is always better to have matters of this kind made certain and, although, as one honourable member has said, the object may be achieved by the definition of another word, it may, on the other hand, not be covered. We ought to let the public and the commercial people know exactly what we mean. The word "" quality "" was in the Bill as originally drafted or prepared by my friend the honourable member for Gippsland. for Gippsland has stated distinctly that the Bill was not prepared by him-that he had never seen it. that the honourable member for Gippsland had seen the Bill, and had given directions to have it prepared. for Gippsland said that he had never revised the Bill. but the honourable member for Gippsland gave directions to have the Bill prepared, I understand, under certain conditions; he may not have revised it in detail. member for Gippsland said he had never altered the Bill. for Gippsland certainly said that he had never revised the Bill. so. present Minister of Trade and Customs take shelter under a statement of the kind ? drafted according to the ideas of those to whom the honourable member for Gippsland I have listened to gave instructions. officers who are now advising the Minister of Trade and Customs. the same officers. The word ."" purity "" is not in the Merchandise Marks Acts, or any of the Acts of the States; and it has been deliberately inserted in the present measure, after discussion between the officers of the Department and myself, because it is felt that without it there will be a great weakness in regard to wine and other liquid commodities. There are other words which have been inserted for a similar reason. The honourable and learned member for Angas has the candour to admit that he would prefer to see the Bill rejected altogether; and, therefore, while his criticism may be directed, to framing the Bill as nearly as possible in the shape in which he",19,Commerce Bill No 2

When we make further progress with the measure, I think it may be possible for some consideration to be given, to that aspect of the case. pears to be some misapprehension as to the practice in Victoria. The Victorian Act, dealing with exports, was passed in the year 1898, and there was much discussion in the State Parliament on the principle of grading. all butter, for instance, of a reasonably good qualitv should be marked "" approved for export,"" butter of inferior quality being marked "" pastry "" j the only prohibition on export from Victoria was that of commodities not fit for human consumption. A suggested provision for dividing produce into various grades was persistently brought forward by the departmental officers, but was not inserted in the B ill . In 1901, an amending Bill was introdured The great into the State Parliament, and the departmental officers once more sought to have Victorian exports graded, but again Parliament refused to pass such a provision into law. of the Legislative Council. strong opposition from a number of producers. W ill the Minister apply by a large majority in the Legislative Assembly. Victorian Legislative Assembly the Opposition was led by one of the best dairymen in Victoria, who is at the present time a member of the State Parliament. In the I indicated Legislative Council the grading principle was objected to by a member who was at that time, and is now, I believe, one'of the largest dairy farmers in the State. These facts show that the principle of grading was not accepted in Victoria, and that the only prohibition assented to was in relation to produce unfit for human consumption. Regarding the question from its lowest stand-point, what is the good of a man exporting produce and branding, it as of inferior quality? We have heard a good I did not deal lately of ""the stinking fish"" policy, which would seem to be that adopted by were then the present Ministry. Buyers in London do not buy on the Government brand, but on the quality of the goods. quite differently. brand goods as inferior, that only provides an excuse for the buyer to beat down the price, whereas goods, when not branded, have to stand on their merits. there are Government brands. get uniform grading from one end of Finally, Parliament decided that Australia to the other?

At present there is no Department to deal with matters of the sort under discussion; and we are entitled to know to what extent it is proposed to have Government inspection. I am in entire agreement with any proposal for classifying, if necessary, goods imported for human consumption, and for the accurate description of other commodities, so that the public may not purchase them in ignorance of their contents or quality. Of course, when we have to deal with exports, it must be made clear that we do not put into the hands of Customs officials a power practically to retard production in Australia. That might follow if those employed in this duty were not thoroughly qualified for the work. Under the Bill, an "" officer"" means an "" officer .of Customs."" I suppose that if an expert were of Customs, but certainly every Customs officer could not be intrusted with a very great deal of this work. Strong representathe Customs Department. no difficulty in making him an officer of the Customs Department. WhatI mean to say is that it is essential that any man appointed to grade the quality and test the purity of goods, should be an expert. Butter, meat, wine, and fruit are, I suppose, the leading lines of exports to which the should eliminate the word provisions of such a Bill as this would apply. No ordinary Customs .official, unless he has had very large practical experience and possesses some amount of scientific knowledge, is qualified to grade these commodities.

I think that he deals with only two classes, but honourable members will see that that requires quite as much expert knowledge as grading, because there is so much wine on the border line. Whether an officer has to grade into two or four classes, there is a border line in each case, and it is that which constitutes the difficulty. I gather from the remarks of the Minister that the question of uniform packing cases can be provided for under this B ill . power under this Bill to provide for that. that there is. I shall not discuss the question, but honourable members who are better qualified than I am to interpret its provisions express the opinion that that power is undoubtedly contained in the measure. It seems to me that this clause, taken in conjunction with clause 10, gives that power. I should like to point out that while, in the opinion of fruit-growers, cerwould have to pass a Government inspector tain packing cases are best for the export was an incentive to those supplying the of frui t to Europe, the frui t trade with the goods to see that they were f u l l weight.

But a very serious consideration, because what it is really important that we should knowwill be insisted upon under Government to what goods this measure will apply.. inspection will be the capacity of the cases The Government should, as far as possible, and not their outside measurement. The honourable member for South Sydney, when, speaking about the War Office contracts for goods sent to South Africa, contended that Australia had come very well out of the discussion which took place in connection, I think he reached with those contracts, inasmuch as it was proved that the bulk quantity of the goods sent was in every case as specified. From my own observation,. I am able to inform the honourable member that, in one case, at all events, a"" shortage would have been exported but for Government inspection. I shall not be any more definite, but honourable members may take my word for it that it was only because inspection by a Government officer was a. condition laid down by the War Office that a shortage was discovered in the case of certain goods sent from one of the States.

A little knowledge is better than none. I am sincerely anxious to assist the Government to pass a measure which will serve the purpose for which this Bill has been introduced. At the same time, I entirely agree with those who say that we should have very full information as to what the Government really propose to do before we are asked to give them such powers as are provided for in this measure. I can quite conceive the possibility of the export trade of some of the States being hampered by over officialism. We should know really what the Government propose under the measure before we consent to give them these very large powers. ing to honourable members on this side to listen to so thoughtful a speech from the other side as that delivered by the honourable member for Boothby. All those who have made certain representations from this side agree entirely with what the honourable member has said. The consideration of the Bill is surrounded with difficulties, largely due to a want of knowledge as to how it will be practically applied. Men who from day to day are, throughout this Commonwealth, in constant contact with the exportation and importation of goods of all kinds hold the view that this measure is calculated to hamper trade. able member for Boothby desires that no measure passed by this House shall have such an effect. The Minister is aware, from representations made to him by the Chambers of Commerce that the exporters and importers of the Commonwealth are entirely in favour of every clause and line in this Bill which will have the effect of preventing fraudulent representation in commerce and trade. It is because it is felt that this measure will not accomplish that object, but will have the effect of unnecessarily hampering trade, and will involve enormous expenditure if its provisions are to be satisfactorily applied, that so much resistence is offered to it. I would suggest that at this stage the Minister should sideration. I believe that the honourable and take the Committee into his confidence, and let honourable members know his decision in the matter so far as it was communicated to the Chambers of Commerce. The honourable gentleman explained that clause 7 was not to apply to goods other than articles intended for human consumption, and medicines and medicinal preparations recommended as beneficial for any portion of the human or animal body.

I feel that the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas re-opens the whole discussion on the principle underlying the Bill. The opposition to the measure arises from the belief that it will hamper trade The honorand commerce to the detriment of the Commonwealth. So far as it will prevent fraud and misrepresentation in trade and commerce it will receive general support, and the Minister may be perfectly sure that every honourable member on this side will support any clause calculated to have that effect. But we have made representations which are based on practical experience, and they have not been made! for the purpose merely of obstruction. We have every desire to make the Bill a workable measure* and it has therefore been very gratifying to us to hear the speech made by the honourable member for Boothby.

I do not-believe for a moment that where business is conducted on fair lines, and the goods which are imported or exported are what they are represented to be, there will be any interference on the part of the Customs Department; but I hope that whenever dishonest practices occur in regard to either importation or exportation, to the detriment of the honest trader, the Minister will require the affixing of true descriptions to the goods concerned. By way of illustration I ask, should not the Customs Department be able to require an importer, after reasonable notice has been given to him, not to import as woollen goods what is really shoddy, or to import as linen what is cotton ?a fraud the existence of which was proved in our Courts a short time ago. were connected with it , too. to those in the trade; but the public must be protected, and importers should be asked to clearly and distinctly describe the nature of their goods, and should be made responsible for their descriptions. regard to what has been said about gradThe honourable and ing, I do not believe that there is any danger of any hampering restriction being placed upon either the importer or the exporter.

The result of this action was that the shipment-for which the' Department paid the growersarrived in London rotten, and was a huge failure: No shipment of oranges from New South Wales has since been tried. In that case a Government expert selected an inferior kind of orange for shipment to London, rather than take the opinion of those who had been in the business all their lives, and could have assisted him had they been permitted.

The Bill will be absolutely useless for the purposes for which it is intended, namely, to protect the honest trader and the consumer It has been shown that it is impossible to protect the consumer. We cannot give him any guarantee of quality; because goods are open to manipulation after they leave the hands of the Customs officer, and it is not proposed to follow them into consumption. Therefore, in that respect, the Bill will f a i l. What we are asked to do-to protect honest people honest value will be set aside by people who are already disposed to act dishonestly by the general public. The men who now impose dishonest values will still be able to do so by manipulating the goods after they leave the hands of the Customs officials. As to the real intention and motive of the Minister-as to the real gist of the measure-it has been abundantly shown again and again during this discussion that the objects sought will not be achieved. We had better leave this matter to the States, the authorities of which, with all their experience behind them, will be best able to safeguard the interests of the consumer and of the honest trader. honourable member for Parramatta has told us that there is as much_ desire on the part of himself and his followers as there is amongst honourable members on the Ministerial side to put down dishonest trade, and yet the only attempt that so far has been made to deal with the matter is sought to be destroyed by the Opposition. way. member has suggested nothing practical so far as I have heard. conference of State Premiers. member has suggested a good many trade matters which ought to be left entirely with? out regulation. The chief objection raised This reform to the B ill , and to this clause in particular, by honourable members of the Opposition is that the measure is too drastic-that it is an interference which will hamper trade. But we have heard very little indeed about protection to the consumer, who ought to be our first consideration. not protect the consumer. B ill will mot entirely protect the consumer. For instance, many of the matters mentioned during the discussion are purely matters for the States.

It is said that the Bil l proposes to give too much power to the Minister. My experience, however, is that powers of administration, such as these, are exercised in a very lax manner. Under the Customs Act, for instance, I am satisfied that, in the opinion of a good many of the electors, the members of the Government are not exceeding their duty in the way of administration; and it is repeatedly said that it is a pity we did not have the honourable and learned member for Adelaide",32,Thomson Wha T Is The

The honourable member for Parramatta tells us that this Bill will be a duplication of the systems of inspection and grading which obtain in the .States. But the Bill goes a great deal further in regard to imports and exports than could any measure in an individual State. for the worse. think. In .South Australia, at the present time, fruit, poultry, rabbits, butter, lambs and other produce are graded; and I do not think that it will be contended for a moment that if this Bill becomes law the South Australian Government should no longer continue their work of inspection. My own opinion is that when the work is found to be well done the officers employed now will continue ,to be employed, and the standard set by the States experts will be accepted by the Customs officers. In South Australia. I have heard none of the objections to grading, which have been put forward .during the discussion on this Bill. serious character, nor indeed of a trivial character, though it has been complained two or three times that the inspector cannot be in a dozen places at once.' In regard to manures, for instance, which the Minister proposes to bring under this Bill, it is necessary that there should be some protection. In South Australia not only is the protection proposed by this Bill afforded, but all manures are subject to analysis. the assistance of the Commonwealth.

If this Bill, as it stands, becomes law, the lives of many infants will be saved, and that is an important consideration when we want population so badly. Recently there was a medical congress in Adelaide, and Dr.. Armstrong, of Sydney, there stated that ""the total infant mortality of England is greater by 44 per cent, than that of New South Wales, and 25 per cent. 1 greater than* the infant mortality of Sydney.

The honourable member for Parramatta has urged that the Minister does not know how this provision about the true description is to be carried out; but the Minister very rightly retorts that he will have the help of the experts in the Department. When a similar law was proposed in South Australia, precisely the same arnot guments that we have heard to-day were used. But no injury whatever has been done in that State;'on the contrary, its trade has improved greatly, and the consumer, the honest merchant, and the bungler are alike protected.

That company would: be willing to have the Government brand placed on its produce if it would thereby gain an advantage, and only recently sent a man home to England to see if it is an advantage in the disposal of produce for butter to-bear a Government brand. He has reported, however, that English buyers are not influenced by the Government brand. for is the factory brand, and they buy on the reputation of the factory. member see that there is good reason for that, because of the misuse of the Government brand in Victoria? one of the largest, Scotch butter importing firms gave sworn evidence in Sydney that a Government brand is of no value as establishing the quality of the produce on which it is placed. The brand is placed on butter when it is new, but that butter may afterwards, because of the market being unfavorable, be kept in a cool store for three or four months, during which time it may deteriorate, so that when it is exposed for sale, although branded by the Government expert as of first grade, itparents did as I do, and let their children may be of inferior quality. The honourable: member for Hindmarsh said that, in all probability, the Commonwealth would accept the grading of the States; but, indoing that, we should be no better off thanwe are now. The provision that goodsmust be properly described is no protectionto English consumers.

I have no objection to the prohibition of the importation of not the honourable goods injurious to the public health, but I think that the evils which have been spoken of can be dealt with under the Health and"" Adulteration Acts of the States."" The honourable member for Hindmarsh told us that milk is imported here from which nine-tenths of the cream has been extracted, butfurther importation will not be stopped by the Bill, because the article can be described as skimmed milk, and brought inunder that description, being sold afterwards under any description the vendorlikes to place on it. that way to comply with the provisions of the English Act.",37,Thomson Wha T Is The

If the High Cpurt holds that we have not 1 the necessary powers, we shall be in no worse position than at present. There is urgent need for legislation of this description, and we should endeavour to fully meet the requirements of the case. Whilst it is, desirable that in the interest of our growing export business, we should send to other parts of the world the best articles we can produce, it is also necessary that we should protect our consumers against being imposed upon in regard to imported goods. Many imported articles of food and of wearing apparel are the subjects of adulteration, and not only are the public grossly; imposed upon, but great injury is inflicted upon the health of the community by the trade deceptions now practised. I am informed that in Germany and other Continental countries the most stringent provisions are enforced against the adulteration of foodstuffs intended for home consumption, but that manufacturers are allowed an absolutely free hand with regard to similar goods intended for export. having foisted upon us a number of poisonous preparations andjjhoddy articles which should be prevented from eni/ejring into consumption. does not deal with that question. we can exercise any control. German manufacturers are now exporting to Australia goods which improperly bear some of the best of English trade marks. In the case of cutlery, for instance, the. names of some of the best Sheffield makers are attached to worthless goods, and in this way not only are our consumers being imposed upon, but grave injury is being done to British manufacturers, with whom it should be our desire to do business. The Bill should provide machinery that would put a stop to such importations in future. I am also informed that jewellery manufactured in foreign' countries is stamped as being of a higher grade than it really is. Jewellery of local manufacture has to be stamped according to the quality of the metal used, whereas foreign jewellery is subject to no such regulation. Something should be done to put an end to such unfair competition with local industry. I am not wedded to the Bill in its present form. I hope that it will be greatly improved, and that members of the Opposition will lend their aid with that end in view. I am strongly impressed with the. necessity for legislation of this kind, and I think that if we lead the way the States will afterwards be able to supplement our work. The Minister will act wisely if he consultsthe States which have already passed legislation of a similar character, with a view to bringing the Commonwealth administration into harmony with that of the States. No doubt considerable! diversity in legislation and practice now obtains, and if we can bring about some degree of uniformity we shall secure a higher degree of efficiency) than has been yet attained. Instead of being a petty piece of legislation unworthy of the Federal Parliament, as one honourable member has' suggested, this is a measure of far-reaching importance. For many yea*s we have been urged to take ajetion in this direction, and I hold that the Bill is worthy of a Legislature which professes a desire to promote the best interests: of the people of Australia. If the Opposition can suggest any amendments that will improve the Bill, I trust that they will bring; The consequence is that we are them forward, and that the result of our efforts will be the passing of a measure that will be worthy of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. clear whether we are acting wisely in proposing to pass this provision. It is unnecessary to say anything as to the necessity for excluding importations of food unfit for human consumption. I am sure that honorable members on all sides are agreed as to the wisdom of that being done; but I fail to see that the Bill will assist us to that end. It will require traders to give proper descriptions of certain classes of goods, but it certainly will not protect the people from the consumption of unwholesome food. Whilst it is highly important that we should shut out deleterious foodstuffs or shoddy articles, it is equally important that the public should be protected from such goods when made within the States themselves.

If the operation of the Bill were extended to InterState trade, I am afraid that we should return to something like the condition of affairs that prevailed prior to the abolition of the border duties. formation as to the extent to which the Government propose to go. So far as I can gather, the Minister has given us no indication of the way in which it is proposed to administer the B ill . The limited list of goods to which it is said that the Bil l will apply, includes butter, fruits, wines, meats, food generally, apparel and manures. If the desire of the honourable member for Hindmarsh is to be complied with, it will also extend to patent medicines. Under the term "" food generally,"" a variety of imports will be affected. I should like to know whether ordinary Customs officers are to determine their quality, and to decide whether they conform to proper trade descriptions. For instance, is an ordinary Customs officer to determine whether apparel, consisting of an admixture of wool and cotton, is correctly described, or whether patent medicines are in accordance with the descriptionwhich they bear? In order to supervise the importation of a few of these lines, at least fift y experts will have to be employed. although if the B ill is to apply to goods of every description, it is difficult to say how many experts will be necessary. deal with, these matters experience no difficulty. for instance, in the different States. dealing with meats, has nothing to do with fruits, and a Government frui t expert has nothing to do with the supervision of butter.

I certainly am not afraid to accept the responsibility for any action I may take as a member of this Parliament, but it is doubtful whether any benefit will be derived from the passing of the B ill in the absence of the co-operation of the States.

Objection has been raised that, if the Bill were amended as I propose, the cost of its administration would be materially increased. The Bill declares that certain things shall be done with regard to imports and exports, but in giving effect to these provisions we shall not need an army of inspectors on the State borders. If goods made in Victoria are soldi in Riverina, and it is discovered that they are not as described, the purchaser would have his remedy, and I certainly do not tlie remainder of the stock would be iiable to forfeiture. goods into New South Wales would certainly have a remedy against the fraudulent manufacturer.

I have not sufficient legal knowledge to enable me to say whether, in this It might prevent Bill, we can go further than to deal with goods passing through the Customs House. But it appears to me that"", even after that stage, they could be made liable to forfeiture if they were found to be inferior to what they were described as being.

I take it that, in the opinion of honourable members, and of the people generally, one of the most important objects we can have in our legislation is to preserve the good name of Australia in the markets where Australian goods are sold. Whether this Bill will achieve that end seems to be a matter of opinion, regulated according to the side of the House on which honourable members sit. ,The Bill is, perhaps, not all that we should like it to be, or all that by-and-by we may be able to make it ; but I am strongly of opinion that it represents a step in the right direction. Eveni f the fear of the honourable member for Grey be in part realized, namely, that the administration of the Bill will add to the public expenditure, I suggest that the improved standing of Australian products will more than repay 11s. The honourable member for Cowper, speaking this afternoon, informed us that, in the opinion of a number of butter producers in New South Wales, a Government brand is of no advantage to those concerned in the sale of that com. moditv. That opinion is, I know, shared by some of the butter producers in Queensland; but I have here an extract! from the Brisbane Courier of Saturday last, which throws a rather different light on the case. It is only in the steamer Marathon, according to the firms within the last few months that the Queensland Government have begun to grade butter for the London market; and any one who takes an interest in the subject cannot but ha%e noticed the improved standing of the r Queensland .product in the markets of Europe. Before the Government began to brand the exports, Queensland butter occupied the very lowest position amongst Australian butter in the quotations, but now, under the new Dairy Act, the commodity from the northern State is rapidly rising to a position of equality. 'Herald of last Saturday had an article on the, success of the grading of butter in Queensland. with the systems of grading now carried out in the States? Mr Wilkinson. quotation for the purpose of showing the importance which is attached to the Government brand by those who handle our goods Indeed, in Australia on the other side of the world. The brand is accepted as indicative of quality, and the paragraph shows that the grading facilitates trade in exports of this kind, inasmuch as, relying on the brand, importers in the old country are enabled to make forward sales. The paragraph is from the London correspondent of the Brisbane Courier, under date nth August, and is as follows :The Tooley-street agents who received the first of the Queensland butter shipped under the new Dairy Act speak approvingly of the results of the Government grading. So far, they say, it is quite satisfactory. They do not expect that it will make any appreciable difference to prices in the present state of the market, but they express the opinion that it cannot fai l to add to the reputation of Queensland butter if it be carried out with uniform care. For a f u l l test of the system they will wait until the next summer shipments arrive. But on one point they agree at once-namely , that proper grading will facilitate "" for w a r d "" buying, and add to the growing confidence among country buyers' in the imports from Queensland. The butter has been gaining steadily in repute on its merits during the last twelve months, and grading will assist this progress. When the adoption of a definite system of grading in Victoria was under discussion a few months ago, it was suggested that grading at the port of shipment might in some cases prevent the London agents from getting the f u l l value of the butter, as, for instance, if parcels passed as second grade in Melbourne became equal to first grade on the homeward voyage. No change of this kind was noticed in the shipment of Queensland butter which came which sold the bulk of it. They think that any improvement which may take place in second grade butter included in later shipments will as a rule be noted and allowed for, especially when the selling market is in a good condition. The Victorian Government inspector gives the same opinion. He says that any disadvantages attached to grading for the London market are far outweighed by the advantages gained. The same remarks would, in my opinion, apply to fruit and other perishable or semiperishable goods exported from Australia. If our fruit were branded, it would be a guarantee to the agents and dealers that it had been inspected and ascertained to be of good quality and condition when shipped, and this would inspire confidence, which, unfortunately, has been too much shaken by the condition in which produce has been sent to England in the past. to hear from the honourable member for Moreton that the Government grading of",43,Thomson Wha T Is The

374,Mr Fuller (Illawarra),"I am gladbutter in Queensland has had such good effects. It is contended by persons largely interested in this industry in New Zealand that Government grading has proved a distinct advantage in that Colony. I desire, however, to speak more particularly of New South Wales, where opinion appears to be divided 'on the subject. The honourable member for Cowper told us this af ternoon, that at a meeting held human consumption; but my opinion under the auspices of the large co-operative dairying company in New South Wales two or three months ago, about three-fourths of the farmers of the State were represented, and a resolution was carried in opposition to Government interference in the industry. I know that in my own district opinion is divided; but I am not called upon to indicate which feeling predominates. In a great industry of this sort, every one engaged in it should have an opportunity of being heard. Farmers' Co-operative Company were represented at the"" meeting to which I have referred, and I have already informed honourable members the nature of the resolution passed. grading ? they examine the various brands, and probably notify their agents abroad as to their character. factories and central creameries of New South Wales cream is graded in order to insure the uniform quality of the butter, and this system has been found of great advantage. feeling, however, at the present time that the less the Government interfere with the industry the better. Without any aid from the State, this large industry has been successfully built up, and many of those concerned are adverse to any legislation of the ' quence of the different opinions held, the proper way to have dealt with the matter would have been to give all parties concerned an opportunity of stating their case, which could have been done if the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong, for which I voted, had been adopted. It appears to me that if this proposal be adopted it will be necessary to have many experts grading butter and other commodities for the various markets of the world. A butter expert will not be a piano expert, and so on; so that it would appear necessary to have a large army of inspectors at each port of shipment. If that be so, it will afford another opportunity to those people who, without, so far as I can see, any just grounds, are . always harping on alleged extravagance in connection with the Federal expenditure. Much has been said as to the effect this Bill will have in preventing the importation of deleterious articles for is that in this respect the Bill will fail. If , for example, . whisky of an inferior character is imported in casks branded with a proper description of the article they contain, this Bill will not prevent its introduction into the Commonwealth'. It may afterwards be taken out of bulk and sold in Lotties or in tumblers to consumers. The same thing will apply to all cognate articles. This Bill cannot prevent that being done. I am The Coastal at one with honourable members who have dealt with the matter from the consumer's point of view. We know well that consumers in all parts of the Commonwealth have from time to time loudly complained of the deleterious nature of many of the articles passed on to them for consumption, more particularly in the country districts. In Sydney we have under an Act a number of inspectors, whose duty it is to inquire into these things, and, as the result of their inspection, articles of a deleterious character In some of the are, to a large extent, prevented from going into consumption in that city. But the representatives of big firms make no secret of the fact that inferior stuff is transferred to the country districts and sold there, to There is a strong the detriment of the inhabitants of those places. How will this Bill prevent that state of things? There is no provision to deal with it any more than there is provision to deal with the other difficulty to which I have referred. It has been said that the Bill will be effective in keeping out shoddy kind proposed in this clause. In consearticles. I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to, in this way, keep out articles which now come into competition with goods produced in the Commonwealth? If it is the object of the Minister to use the power conferred under this Bill for that purpose and I believe it would be possible to so use it-honorabl e members should hesitate before they give any Minister of Trade and Customs such a power. It appears to me that, if any attempt is to be made to apply the measure to InterState trade, it will involve the restoration",44,Thomson Wha T Is The

I have already said that I believe that legislation of this kind could be better dealt with by the States Parliamen.cs, but it isa public duty to protect consumers in the way I have suggested, andalsotoprotect fair traders from the injury done them by those who are guiltv of commercial immorality. There can be no doubt that local manufacturers distribute deleterious eomr pounds. That is a scandal, but it only shows that the States Legislatures should have taken act-ion in the matter. It is no' reason why, when we have reached the -Committee'stage of this B ill , we should, not give the Minister an opportunity to carry out the object for which he says he introduced it. The word "" duality "" is, in my opinion, essential in tliis clause if honest importers and exporters to be protected. It has been said time after time that the producers of Australia have suffered because designing exporters have put on the British or other markets goods which were not up to standard. TheB i ll has been introduced to make an end to such practices, and,, therefore, although I am 1 not a supporter of the Ministry, I feel bound to vote for it . I * intend that the Government shall be armed as effectively W ill they Be able to as possible to carry out its provisions. If that is done, the responsibility for defectsi n administration will lieat their door. If , however, the B ill proves effective, and is properly administered, the health, of the community will be protected, and honest traders will be assisted by others being required to observe a standard of commercial morality which at present seems to be at a sad discount. These remarks are not an imputation upon either the importers or the manufacturers as a whole. The members of neither clajs are philanthropists; they are business men who wish to make as much money as they can each j ear. Butr some of them have a lower standard of dealing than others would stoop to, and put on the market inferior articles which impose on the public. I know of a case in I desire to which a particular friend of the Minister, who is a 'boot manufacturer in New South Wales, and an ardent and well-known protectionist, used to pass off his wares as American-made, because he knew that American brands werefashionable, and I fought that question out thought he would thereby secure larger sales. But whatever may be the need of the public for protection against imposition in the matter of wearing apparel and articles of luxury, such as pianos, ourgreat concern should be the purity of our food supplies, and of the drugs which we use. As I think that the omission of the word "" q u a l it y "" would destroy the Bill, I shall vote against the amendment. this is a. measure which should not have been brought before the Federal Parliament, because it deals with matters which should engage the attention of the Parliaments of the States, and in regard to which some of the States have already Actsi n operation. One of mv main objections to the Bill is that it is toocorn-prehensive. But, although it seeks to do so much, it would, if passed intolaw. probablyeffect very little-.

To demonstrate his ability to do so, a man would have to undergo an examination in regard to the manufacture of every conceivable article of merchandise. But no man could acquire even a rudimentary knowledge of the processes of manufacture or production of more than a dozen or two articles. The alternative is to emplov an army of experts, acquainted with the details of every branch of manufacture and production of goods of every conceivable kind for importation and exportation. That, however, would mean an immenselv increased expenditure. I do not suppose that it is the intention of the framers of the Bill to bring into existence a new Department; but to ask the Customs officials to do the work is manifestly imposing on them an impossible task. hands of the Minister a power which I object to place in the hands of any Minister. It allows him, in the event of the contravention of its provisions, to order the confiscation of imports. In the hands of an unscrupulous Minister under discussion, neither is clause 3/ The honourable member must confine his remarks to the proposed amission of the word "" quality."" amendment, because I should like to see the clause omitted, and because I see no need for the Bill itself. In expressing that view, I am fortified by the opinion of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, as expressed in an interview. Sir William Lyne defended the Commerce Bill on the ground -that it was based upon the I m Mr Wade said, in this interview, that there was a marked difference between the two"" The primary object of the English law,"" prevent the fraudulent use of trade marks, and as a complement to that provision there is. a provision against the use of fraudulent trade descriptions. In the Federal CommerceB i ll themaker of goods may or, may not, as he thinks, fit, apply a trade mark to a trade descriptionof his goods. The English Act not only provides that the producer who attaches the' falsetrade description shall be liable to a penalty, but also any person selling those goods who has; It the knowledge that the description is false. "" Sir William Lyne is mistaken when he says the definition of a false trade description iscopied from the English law. The presenceof the words 'omitted therefrom' is a danger in the CommerceB ill , and do not occur in the English Act. My objection to the Commerce Bill is to the power given to a Minister of theCrown to determine what shall be the description attachable to the goods. The Minister may, in a proclamation, declare that, unless certaingoods have applied to them a description of suchcharacter as is prescribed by the proclamation, these goods may be excluded from entering, or prevented from leaving the country. The conditions of trade will* be governed, not by thehonesty of the individual trader necessarily, or by the purity of the goods, or their commercial value, but by mere chance as to whether they comply with conditions laid down by somebody outside the trade altogether. "" There is the further danger that if the Act is capable of wide interpretation given to it by the regulations, those regulations cannot be annulled, but there is no doubt that if it wereproposed to embody all the powers of the regulations in the Act itself the House would reject it. The nearest approach to this clause that. I can find in legislation in England is in secTheB ill places in the tion 16 of the Merchandise Marks Act 1887. That certainly provides that the importation of articles may be prohibited under certain exceptional conditions. That is to say, if a foreign manufacturer sends goods to England bearingthe trade mark of some English manufactureror trader, he is committing a fraud on the English people. It is well known that foreign manufacturers are in the habit of turning out goodswhich resemble articles of English make, but are of inferior quality. These goodsare very often put on the market, and I shall support the labelled or marked in such a way as to* deceive the purchaser into the belief that they are of English production, and of high quality. For instance, I recently sent a messenger to one of the shops in Melbourne to purchase some English-cut tacks, but I was supplied with German goods of inferior quality, made of pewter, which could' not be driven into even soft wood. packet to indicate that the tacks were madein Germany. ginal packet.

Mr Wade is of opinion that I f such a clause as that were passed by the Commonwealth Government all honest traders would welcome it. I say that tooBut this is very different from the elastic Executive power which enables a Minister to lay down such conditions as he thinks fit, which may have the effect of absolutely paralyzing trade. Then, again, in carrying out the provisions of the English Act, special conditions arc laid down as to the issue of warrants to search for goods in Tespect of which the offence has been committed. None, of these safeguards is to be found in the CommerceB ill . The English Act does not deal with the quality, purity, or class or grade of goods. I see no reason why the Minister, perhaps in all good faith, may not lay down a standard of purity for any article. That standard may be of such a character that the trade cannot comply with it, or it may be that the local manufacturer can comply with the standard, yet it would be impossible for the importer to do so. In this way I see it is possible under this B ill , when the duty under the Customs has failed to exclude manufactures, to lay down a standard which the importer cannot comply with, and so -drive that particular kind of trade away from the Commonwealth. In the United StatesI find nothing in the remotest degree approaching the drastic powers of this measure, and the detailed interference with the trade of each State. The useful provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 have been adopted in ' South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia, and the law is much the same with regard to the fraudulent use of' trade marks and trade, descriptions in New South Wales. We have all we want in this State to protect ourselves against commercial frauds of this character; but if a provision like section r6 of the English Act were passed by the Commonwealth we would have similar protection against fraudulent * traders in other countries. That is the opinion of the Attorney-General of New South Wales with regard to the Bill. PerhapsI may be permitted to quote a case bearing upon this question of quality which recentlv came under my notice. A friend of mine, who is engaged in a soft goods business in Melbourne, recently gave me some information with regard to the effect-of the Tariff upon certain lines of goods. He represented that in some cases importers have to sell their goods at the same prices that they were able to obtain prior to the introduction of the Federal 453 Tariff, and that, in order to overcome the difficulty arising from the increase in the duty, they had to make special arrangements with the manufacturers at home to supply them with an article of lower quality. He stated that the working men could not afford to pay more than is. per pair for socks. Prior to the introduction of the Tariff, importers were able to sell for is. per pair socks of excellent quality, but afterwards they had to ask the manufacturers to supply them with socks of a lower quaility, which they could still sell at is. Therefore, the consumer is now obtaining an article of lower quality than that which was previously sold to him at the same price. The same remarks apply to other imports, and if it is desired to prevent deception of that kind, it appearsto me that the remedy is to be applied, not by means of a measure of this kind, but by repealing the iniquitous Tariff, which invites traders to perpetrate frauds of the character referred to. v anxious as is any honourable member that a measure should be passed to prevent adulteration, and to insure that goods shall be supplied to consumers under their proper description as to qualityMost of the honourable members who have preceded me have failed to appreciate the object of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Angas. He showed clearly that his object was to improve the Bill by bringing it into line with existing legislation in Great Britain and South Australia, and thereby rendering it more valuable. The South Australian Act distinctly provides in Part 2"" Trade description"" means any description, statement, or other indication, direct or indirect, as to the particular quantity, measure, gauge, or weight of any goods. In that provision there is no mention of ""quality"" or "" nature""; whereas in the Bill before us, the terms ""nature, quality, purity, class, grade, and size"" are employed. The South Australian Act is based upon Imperial legislation, from which the terms included in the Bill now before us were, after careful consideration, expressly excluded. Since the Imperial Act wasbrought into force, a number of judgmentshave been given by the English Court bearing upon the terms to which I have lastreferred, and the honourable and learned' member for Angas desires to exclude from the Bill all word's which would be difficult to-",48,Thomson Wha T Is The

Under its provisions a. man will still be at liberty' to import adulterated goods, provided that he correctly describes them.. He may introduce cardboard or imitation, leather, as long as he describes it by its. true name, and that material may still be used in the manufacture of Loots and shoes, so that the.

The Bill will not: be effective-. will leave it alone they will find that it will be effective enough. be effective. It is the duty of a Government to submit effective measures to the Parliament, and it is the business of an Oppositiontoshow in. what respect any measure is defective. I share the feeling of the honorable member for Boothby that the Bill does not provide for reasonabledefinitions in regard to imports andexports. While it gives the Minister wide powers that may be seriously abused, it -does not afford himsufficient power to deal with many matters that ought to Be dealt with under such a measure. The honourable -member for' Hindmarsh referred to the desirableness of prohibiting the importation of oleomargarine, butterine; andlike products. I would remind Him, however, that, under section 52 of the Customs Act 1901, the Minister has. power-, not only to prohibit exhausted and adulterated teas, butOleomargarine, butterine, or any similar substitute for butter', unless coloured and branded as prescribed. Underthe same sectionA l l goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation as well asA l l goods, having thereon or therewith any false suggestion of any warranty guarantee or concern in the production or quality thereof by any persons, public officials, Government, or country, are prohibited. In moving the second reading of the Bill, the Minister, read a list of various imports that might be brought under, its. provisions. Beer and apparel are the first two items on the list. It is probable that a man who is an authority on. apparel may be also a good judge of beer, but he might not be able to say whether or not it contained deleterious compounds. We all know that beer is largely adulterated with, drugs that are really dangerous to the consumer, and I should like to know how the. Minister is goimg to deal with such importations without the assistance of an expert. Experts will have to be in attendance at every port to deal with, these goods. Then,, again,. I should like to know how furniture, which is also included in the list, 1 is likely to come unlder the Bill. If it is the. intention of the Minister to carry out his promise to the deputation from the Chamber' of Commerce which recently waited on him, and to confine the applicaI f the Opposition tion of the Bill entirely to foodstuffs, honourable members will certainly assist him to"" that end. to-night what assistance they are prepared to give. honourable gentlenian has any reason to com# plain. I do not wish to delay the Committee in arriving at a decision, but I should certainly like to know whether it is the intention to apply the Bill to the full, list of imports which he read. When the honor0 able member for Hindmarsh spoke of the necessity of preventing the importation of poisonous drugs, I presume that he meant that proprietary medicines should be examined, and that if they were found to contain poisons which were deleterious to the consumer,, their importation should' be prohibited.

407,Mr Wilson,"I do not think that theunder the Bill, it will be impossible to deal with such goods. The Bill needs to be very carefully considered, and to receive more attention at the hands of honourable members than it is getting at present. I would remind the Committee that paragraph a of clause 3 will apply to exports as well as imports. In all the States, Government"" experts are employed to examine and grade various exports, but, although that is done, the exportation of inferior articles is not prohibited. I presume that the Minister would not interfere with that practice. For instance, under the system, at present adopted in Victoria, butter is divided into three classes-creamery , dairy, and mixed, and all below the last-named quality is classed as pastry butter. Would the Minister avail himself of the provisions of the Bill to prevent the exportation, say, of pastry butter which is unfit for human consumption, except when used in the manufacture of pastry ? it were correctlv marked. then that the Government is to take over the work of grading these products? that the Commonwealth Government will make an arrangement with the States. for the Government of the Commonwealth to consult with the States Governments before we pass this Bill, so as to see how far they could come into line with them ? Sir before. matter to the producers. The States Governments do a considerable amount of grading already, but how far does the Commonwealth Government intend to go ? Honourable members on both sides of the Chamber would like to know. We do not want to have any clashing of interests. There is, I admit, a great deal to be said for grading, though' some producers object to it. The Government certainly will either, have to provide their own experts, or to enter into an arrangement with the States; and are the States agreeable that the Commonwealth should take over the work of grading. their officers? to me, from what I have heard lately, that the States are. agreeable to anything that the Commonwealth does. stances, it would surely be unwise for the Government to proceed with the Bill, as they do not know how far the States are willing to act with them. tempt to reply to all the criticisms, on my amendment, because some honourable members wbo are supporting the Government are giving admirable support to the effort which I am making to improve the. Bill. I had two objects in view in moving; the amendment. One was ta secure: uniformity; because we should', as; far as possible, keep our legislation in thesematters in line with English legislation, soas to get the benefit of English decisions.. Apart from that, also, people engaged intrade throughout the British Empire should' be able to know, without having to look at a>. multitude of statute-books, what the laws; are. They should be able to infer from the laws in operation in England what the laws are likely to be in a British dependency.. As a matter of fact, at the Colonial Conference of 1902, uniformity in respect of patents, copyrights, and other commercial* matters was expressly referred to as being; I have no doubt desirable, as will be seen from the report,, which can be read in the Library. So thatr I am really acting from an Imperial point of view, as well as from the point of view of common sense, in urging that we shouldl as far as possible-unless , of course, necessity is shown for a divergence-adher e to the lines initiated by the Imperial Government in legislation placed on the English statutebeing inserted, because in no case in England is the word ""quality"" used; in fact"" the word was deliberately left out of the 1 English legislation. Kerly on Trade Marks,. after a reference to the Act of 1862, whichwas amended by the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, says, on page 569 :That Act did not, and the present Act does: not, extend to descriptions of quality as apartfrom kind. The author goes on to describe the Act, and"" remarks that it was extended to deal in general with-marks which filled the office of trade marks, to reach all false merchandise marks other than marks of quality. These marks of quality were therefore deliberately left out because, as I have endeavoured to impress upon the Committee, the word Â«"" quality"" is one which is very comprehensive in its significance.

416,Mr Glynn (Angas),"I shall not atabstract term, which does not suggest anything concrete. Hence it is capable of many shades of meaning, and can be used in such a variety of connotations that it would be almost impossible to secure convictions. P'orthat reason the English Legislature, having had the advantage of the inquiries of Commissions, deliberately left out the word as being a dangerous one to employ. use the word in England, where a man need not put the description on his goods, it must be doubly dangerous here, where a man has to put such a description on them as may be prescribed by the Minister. If he is in doubt in England lie does not put a description on his goods. If he is in doubt here, he nevertheless has to put a description on them, because he cannot export or import unless he does so. It is not, as the English Act says, a description that is not "" false in a material particular."" beyond that, and say, "" If it is likely to mislead ,"" terms which are deliberately left 1 out in England as being somewhat dangerous. "" False in a material particular "" is a term much less likely to cause difficulty than the term '"" likely to mislead 'in a material particular."" "" likely to mislead"" are placed in the latter part of the clause, emphasizing my contention that the addition of these words has made the definitioncoupled with the penal clauses of the Bill -far more dangerous to honest importers and manufacturers; because they must describe and must not make a mistake. think that honourable members will see that I have some reason for asking that the word ""quality"" should be left out, even if the Minister will not agree to limit its aptwilight does into dark.

I am sure that the Committee sees the ^inexpediency of allowing such a power as this to be wielded by men who in all the circumstances of politics are not always infallible, or are not always possessed of a perfect sense of obligation to the Commonwealth. I would again point out to honourable members what may occur. Goods are not to be imported unless upon And if it is dangerous to 'a description as regards their quality. Now, if the Minister desires to stop the importation of any goods, he can, under the Customs Act, simply proclaim them as not to be imported. As has been decided in America, the trade and commerce section allows that to be done. The Minister can, in that way, put an embargo upon commerce. He is empowered to issue a proclamation against the importation of particular goods Avithout offering any reason. That such a wide power as this has hardly We go ever been inforced does not remove the fact that for cause shown he is authorized by the Act to proclaim against certain importations. That is an honest way of dealing with things-to proclaim only for specific cause, to say that they shall not be imported because they contain certain And those words materials injurious to the public health. Suppose that under this Bill the Minister declares that a description of quality must be attached to certain goods, and those goods are imported. What has he to do? If he is brought by the importer into a court of justice, the difficulty of proof lies with the Government. The Minister will I not want to face that difficulty. Why? Because, as I said before, the term ""quality"" is so very wide. It involves distinctions grading almost imperceptibly, as a prosecution where the onus 6f proof is .thrown upon him in that manner. The importer will say that the description is If he not false, and the Minister will not prosecute. The Bill will therefore prove to be a delusion to those who are supporting it. Becausei f it fails in a case of that kind, it must be a perfect delusion. Further, it. But if he will work a positive injury to our commerce, and tb 'the operation of existing State laws. The State laws at present are fairly effective to cope with such cases, and to It substitute Commonwealth administration, which is often far less effective, will work injury to all classes. For an administration which is fairly effective we shall be substituting an administration which' is doubtful. What the Minister will do is this: He will lay an information under clause 8 of the Bill, will attempt to shift the burden from the holder of the goods-eithe r the importer or the exporter of having attached a false trade description; in other words, having put a description upon the goods which gives a false indication of their quality. Then see what position the Minister, will be in. This measure, in conjunction with the Customs Act, will place him in this position-that alleging in an information that the description is false, is prima facie evidence that it is false unless the importer or the person who gets the goods-and who may not be the man who attaches the description to them-prove s the contrary. Section 255 of the Customs Act contains this provisionIn every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the indifficulty the Minister will be in as regards formation, declaration, or claim shall be deemed instituting a prosecution, and being aware to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. I say that, as a matter of administration, the Minister will not meet the challenge thrown out to him on the ground that he cannot prove the information that the goods are falsely described, and he will lay the burden of proof upon the importer of showing that they are not falsely described. That opens up a very serious prospect, and it shows the wisdom of the English legislation that penalizes a man for a false description of goods, but does not penalize him for a false description of quality. On page 570, Kerly oil Trade Marks mentions adulteration under the heading of qualityAdulteration or the sale of goods not of the Chapman, A. nature or quality demanded or pretended is Crouch, R. A. made a criminal offence by other statutes in Culpin, M . many special instances. Then he goes on to refer to the fact that Fisher, the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the adGroom, L .

M . likely to be by the Commonwealth, make Hutchison, J. it an offence to mix injurious ingredients with articles of food. The administration of this Bill cannot be so perfect, and will make the measure a delusion to those who support it, as instanced by the fact that the Government have never attempted to put an embargo on the importation of goods under the Customs Act. on the ground that they were not as described ; the Minister knowing that the proposition is hardly capable of proof. challenged, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he could not sustain his allegaBill (No. 2) 2457 tion of a false description of quality. It and he would be impossible to do so. Under the circumstances, therefore, it would be far more expedient to leave the States to deal with these particular matters, which can be dealt with under the -Food and Drugs Acts far more effectively than is likely to be the case under this measure. I repeat that I believe that honourable members will find that this Bill is an absolute delusion, and that so far from protecting the public it will injure them, because the administration will be a failure. AndI ask the Committee whether importers are likely to describe bad goods as bad goods? Is a man likely to say that his butter is of a dubious quality, and that it will become rank in a short time? Not at all. If he has any doubt about the quality he will give himself the benefit of. it. knowing the that the intentions of the Act will be defeated. .

In the earlier stages the administration of the Customs Act caused considerable consternation amongst merchants throughout the Commonwealth in consequence of prosecutions being instituted, -and explanations demanded, for any error or negligence on the part, it might be, of some junior clerk; and it is felt that if the clause be allowed to remain as it stands at present there may be a repetition of that trouble and inconvenience. -sent Minister of Trade and Customs then -recognised how harshly the administration of the Customs Act pressed on merchants, and he altered the practice. I appeal to the honourable gentleman now, in view of the fact that full particulars are provided for in the other sub-clauses, to accept the -amendment which I have moved. It is unnecessary, in the ordinary day by day conduct of a merchant's business, to exercise a power which might be the means of possible misfortune to a firm. The amendment I have submitted may safely be supported by any honourable member who is in favour of the .whole of the other provisions of the measure: In my opinion, this sub-clause,' if not amended, will prove to be -unworkable, and will create a sort of reign of terror amongst merchants; and that, I am sure, is not the object or intention of the Minister or the Government in introducing the Bill. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I desire to point out, as I did the other night, that the English Merchandise Marks Act contains a provision similar in effect to that now under discussion. quite different in their working. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I shall refer to the reasons for the provision in the English Act later on. Section r of the imported goods "" shall, for the purposes of the Act, ""be deemed to be a trade description applied to the goods."" That is practically the same as the provision which we have inserted in this Bill. It has been pointed out to me very strongly by the officers of the (Department that the words The which it is proposed to omit are absolutely necessary for the proper administration of the Act."" by which these particulars can be obtained. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE -That is so. A good deal of what has been said about the Bill not being as stringent as it might be would be effective if it were not for this < Aery provision. The section was inserted in the English Act in consequence of a report by a Royal Commission which investigated the subject. After referring to the inclusion in the English Act of the provision I have read, the report I have on the subject saysThe preThis fact is very important, and in itself alone it is sufficient reason for the inclusion in the CommerceB ill , which is based so largely upon the British Act, and the objection brought forward to the CommerceB ill does not extend to controverting the wisdom of the British law which prevails so largely in the various parts of the British Empire. The reason for its inclusion becomes still stronger when we consider how it came to be adopted in the British Act. Its adoption in England was the result of a recommendation by the Committee of the British Parliament in rSgo, which reported as follows :"" The evidence given before your Committee was, in their opinion, conclusive proof that goods (notably",51,William Lyne Afterwards Not Book I Also Object To The Word Quality

WhatI want is to have .the trade description brought in here in the way in which this Committee reported that it should be dealt with in the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act.

The adoption of this amendment would, in the opinion of your Committee, give the Customs power to detain goods, the "" trade description"" of which is false as to the materials of which they are composed. It was on that report that the provision I have read was inserted in tlie English Act, and on that report I desire that these words should be left in this Bill. not to impair the effectiveness of the measure, as it would be impaired by the omission of these words. stand that those who desire to oppose the Bill should wish to make it as weak as possible. A great deal that has been said to-night as to the impotency of the Customs officers to deal with persons importing anything impure, or anything fraudulently marked, is of no effect whatever. I ask the Committee not to consent to the amendment. Sydney)-The Minister of Trade and Customs objects to the amendment on the ground that certain honourable members desire to destroy this measure. Sir WILLIAM: LYNE be interpreted in that way. WhatI said was that the amendment would weaken the measure. accept the honourable gentleman's denial. I can assure the Committee that any provision that is necessary to detect fraud w,ill find support on this side. So far from desiring to see goods introduced under a false trade description, during the whole of my mercantile career I have had attached to invoices, under a system inaugurated by the honourable member for Mernda, a supporter of the Government, a clause guaranteeing that goods sold under those invoices are of the exact character of the invoiced and labelled description, and that the firm would be responsible for the purity of the goods sold .under that guarantee. That is a self-imposed Adulteration Act, and personally I should like to see other merchants adopt the same course. make all merchants like the honourable gentleman. quite true, as stated in the report read by the Minister, that the English Act does not provide for a trade description, and in that lies the difference between it and this Bill. clause 7 or clause 10. ister, under this clause, can insist on a trade description being placed on goods. carried. The reason for the inclusion of I ask honourable members the Customs entry in the English Act was that there w.as no other trade description compulsory under that Act. Consequently, I can well underthey had to enact that this, the only description provided for, must be accurate. I do not object to insisting on general accuracy in an entry form; but the Minister might insist on a number of the items of information set out in clause 3 with reference to number, quality, place of origin, manufacturer or producer of goods, person by whom they are selected, and so on, being placed in a trade desciption, which might be a label or an invoice or a Customs entry; but if he is going to insist that they shall all be placed in a Customs entry, it will become a very difficult and almost impossible' task to pass entries for any large quantity of goods. One would I have no wish to have to enter into a long description, altogether irrelevant to any Customs: entry, giving all details as to ingredients, source of origin, and so on, of each line of goods. That would make a Customs entry a tremendous document. Without pressing the matter too much at the present time, the Minister might consider whether he cannot propose something which would meet that difficulty. He has every security in being able to insist on a trade description apart from a Customs entry. If the Customs entry is to be made a trade description, and*",54,Pairs

That may be necessary under the English Act, which does not provide for any other description. But in this measure, where we do provide for a full and complete description in another way, I do not see why we should provide for it also in the Customs entry. MightI remind the Minister that under paragraph d of section 234 of the Customs Act it is provided that "" No person shall make any entry which is false in any particular,"" so that there is security under the Customs Act as regards falsity. The giving of detailed information in the Customs entry would afford no protection to the consumer, nor is there any necessity for it when there is power to see that the full and complete description is given on the label or invoice. That is the difficulty to which I direct the attention of the Minister in supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kooyong.

I do not think it is intended to make Customs entries any more formidable and detailed documents than they are at present. The honourable member for North Sydney never speaks beside the point, but always in a manner which commands the attention of honourable members, and I respectfully suggest that he might allow this clause to pass. The honourable gentleman will admit that Customs entries are not trade descriptions ordinarily, and if there is a false statement in a Customs entry the person responsible for it should be liable to prosecution. against that, so long as a, detailed description is not required in a Customs entry. clause 7 might be suggested, and I should be inclined to support it, to give effect to what the honourable gentleman desires, but I hope that we shall a.!! be prepared to assist any Administration to prosecute in cases of clear guilt It is very difficult to prove that a trade description is false, and we must give the Customs officers full power to deal with such matters.

If he allows his clerk or office boy to give a frauof suspicion, they are likely to be tyrandulent description, he should be liable to the penalty attaching to the making of a false description. learned member for Northejn Melbourne, however, has put forward the valuable suggestion that the object which I had in view in moving the amendment might be better met by an amendment in clause 7, and I therefore beg leave to withdraw my amendment, adding that I do not desire that there shall be room for the introduction of fraudulent methods. seems to me that if the Customs entry is to contain all. the particulars set out in paragraphs a to / , it will take a considerable time, and entail considerable trouble, to make. I think that the end in view will be met by requiring a trade description containing all these particulars to be placed on the tins or other packages containing imports. To duplicate this information on the Customs entry is only to entail additional and useless labour on our merchants. I do not think that the merchants of the Commonwealth are so void of principle and of honour as the measure would indicate. I know that a large number of them are honourable men, and I am ready to protect all honourable men from the unfair competition of dishonourable men. I am also willing to protect the consumer, by insisting that all goods brought into the country shall have affixed to them proper trade descriptions. The Merchandise Marks Act of Great Britain differs from the Bill in that it deals only with imports, whereas the Bill deals with both imports and exports. If it dealt merely with imports, the task of the Legislature would be easier. AlthoughI think that it would be simpler to amend I feel that we this clause than to amend clause 7, I do not object to the withdrawal of the amendment, because I do not wish to set my opinion against that of the honourable and learned member for North Sydney, who has had such a long experience in mercantile matters. We should, however, not overload the Bill. In passing legislation of this kind, we are often putting into motion forces of which we do not know what the effect will be, and just as some honourable members believe that there is ground for distrusting our merchants, I have a strong feeling that the officers of the Customs Department are not to be trusted with too much power, because, being brought up in an atmosphere nical, and their conduct in many cases has indicated that disposition. The honourable and Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. That the words "" or omitted therefrom,"" line 38, be left out. I could understand the Customs officials wishing to penalize anything in the nature of a false trade description, and I think that it is reasonable that a man should be punished for putting on his goods any description liable to mislead. But it is going much further than that to say that persons shall be punished for omitting something from a description. ting. tunately, is to be the only judge as to what constitutes faudulent omission. A trade description is defined to mean any description as to the nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight of the goods, and the other particulars set out in paragraphs b to /, and a false trade description means any false statement in regard to any of these particulars, or any omission therefrom.

What is done in England, and might be done here, is to 1 prevent false statements being made in the usual form of the Customs entry. If the Minister will accept an amendment in that direction, I think that we might do what is necessary, by inserting after .the word "" entry,"" line 28, the words "" limited to the particulars prescribed by the Customs Act 1901, or the regulations thereunder."" for the honourable and learned member to move that amendment, since there is already an amendment before the Chair. draw my amendment. difficult to deal with the matter here as to deal with it in clause 7. with it in clause 7, so that I may discuss the question with my experts. mit this clause if it be found that the matThere would not be so much objection toter cannot be dealt with so conveniently in clause 7 ?

Before we reach clause 7, I shall have obtained further technical information from the Comptroller-General of Customs as to whether it would be possible to meet the desire of the honourable member for Kooyong without weakening the intention of the Bill.. If I can agree to the amendment with safety, and the honourable member's object cannot be achieved by amending clause 7 or 8, I shalltoequite willing to recommit the clause now under discussion.

I -cannot see any justification for the alteration proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth. The words which he proposes to omit are necessary for the proper definition of a false trade description. My only objection is that they are not quite strong enough, and I prefer that the word ""liable"" should be substituted for the word "" likely."" I can conceive that some difference of opinion might exist as to what was ""likely to mislead""; but the same di> vergence of view would not be possible in regard to the word ""liable;"" the Minister has mistaken my object. The omission of the words which I have suggested should be excised would do no harm, but, on the other hand,.would improve the clause. I would point out that ""trade description"" relates, among other things, to the quality of an article, and any omission in that regard might be construed by the Minister as a false trade description. For instance, suppose that a quantity of salt butter were imported, and the word ""salt"" was not included in the trade description porter did not apply any description to it. pelled to apply a trade description. butter, but not bad butter. to apply a trade description, and if that description were false he might be prosecuted, apart altogether from any provision containing the words which I propose to omit. It appears to me that it would be absurd to empower the Minister to punish a man for applying a false description merely because of some omission on his part. Surely the only person who could say that he had been deceived by such an omission in the description woufd be the consumer of the article. I do not think the Minister should be intrusted with any such power as that proposed to be conferred. He would be placed in a most serious position, and, indeed, it is largely on his account that I am suggesting the amendment. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I should like to point out to the honourable member, in the first place, that it is not the Minister, but the officers of his Department, who will be called upon to deal with this matter.

There should be no such terms I s the Minister so satisas those to which exception is taken by the honourable member for Wentworth. Only last week we were engaged in discussing a section of the Immigration Restriction Act, in which Parliament had not definitely stated what was intended. Here is a clause which is equally ambiguous. It leaves it open for the Minister to say that a thing is wrong, aaid to place a man in disadvantageous circumstances, simply because he may have a different view as to the meaning of language from that of the Minister. That ought not to be. The clause is quite drastic enough without this language. It is quite clear without it . It is LYNE I am not going to more definite without it . The traders of the country ought. not to be tied up by vague and meaningless language. But, meaningless as it is, as it stands it becomes meaningful by the action of the Minister. It is a drag-net expression, which means nothing, except an expression of opinion on the part of the Minister at any time. I hold that our Bills ought to be framed so that he who runs may read-especiall y people whose business will be controlled by them, and the consequences to whom may be very serious. I beg the Minister to consider whether the words would not be better out of the Bill? is not useless to make requests to the Minister, with a view of improving this B ill ,",60,Pairs

The clause uses the words, "" false or likeh; to mislead in a material respect."" We all approve of legislation against language being applied to goods that is calculated to mislead "" in a material respect."" lead "" is a drag-net expression, which ought not to be retained. The Minister admits that in practice the administration of the B ill would be left to the officers of his Department. It has been urged that the officers, who are to be the accusers, are also to be the judges. Surely we should make the language clear and definite, in order that those who administer the B ill may have no doubt as to-what Parliament intended. Customs is an extremely able and conscientious officer, but I believe that it is quite possible that even he may f a i l in carrying out the varying provisions of this Bill as applied to all the ramifications of commerce. The representations that have been made to the Minister on the point are not idle, but are those of people who wish for. what is fair and workable. They ought not to be subject to continuous pinpricking legislation, such as is sought to be imposed here. the Minister will feel that, without any loss of dignity, or without infringing the real purposes of the B ill , he can accede to the deletion, of the words. months on this B ill if we proceed as we have done to-night. member for Angas, who, it is admitted, has given a great deal of attention to the B ill , and/ has compared it with existing legislation in other parts of the world, says that such language is not to be found in the English Act. Surely, therefore, there is reason in the request that the words should be omitted. heard the Minister interject a few moments ago that we shall be six months dealing with this Billi f we proceed as we are : doing. Are we to cease asking for what we think to be fair because the Minister is not prepared to consider what we propose? granting some of our reasonable requirements. We ask that the words ""likely to mislead "" shall be left out. which fraud is likely to arise. the individual who reads the description. What might mislead one person would not mislead another. If a description upon certain goods is not "" false in a material respect,"" we ought not to punish the person responsible. If it is false in a material But ""likely to. misrespect, punishment should follow. But there should be no punishment merely because a description is, in somebody's opinion, "" likely to mislead."" I shall not cast any reflection upon the officers who will have to administer this B ill , but I must say that they are brought up in an atmosphere of suspicion. If the slightest mistake occurs on the part of a merchant in passing entries through the Customs, they suspect him of being guilty of fraud. They The Comptroller-General of are constantly on the look-out for frauds against the Customs. Any mistake that occurred under this clause would be considered by such suspicious people to be intentional and worthy of prosecution. I am strongly opposed to the words remaining in the clause. I am perfectly well aware, of course, that the Minister, with his large majority behind him, can resist us like an autocrat. If our numbers were nearer to his, he would be as pliable as a rope of sand. I trust, therefore, that Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I wish to say two or three words, after what has been alleged, in respect of these unfortunate words; and I'intend to read the terms of , six the English Merchandise Marks Act. The definition section contains the following words:The honourable and learned Every person who sells, or exposes for, or has in his possession for, safe, or any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or things to which any forged trade mark or false trade description is applied, or to which any trade mark or mark so nearly resembling a trade mark as to be calculated to deceive. That is practically an endorsement of the words of this clause.

I know that at page 585 of Kerly on Trade Marks, it is expressly pointed out that Judges have declined to say that, simply because a trade mark is likely to mislead, it is a false description. On that ground men have been acquitted, because a trade mark, which is merely likely to mislead, may be a perfectly innocent description. the South Australian Act. words are not in the English Act. same effect. the Judges have declined to convict, on the ground that a trade mark is likely to mislead, because a trade mark may mislead, and still be innocently used. effect of the clause as it stands is that a man. who innocently misleads may have his goods forfeited. able and learned member for Angas seems to argue that we should make no departure from English .legislation. I think, however, that we ought to be capable of doing our own drafting. Honourable members of the Opposition seem to. mistake the object of this B ill , which is, I take it, to prevent f r a u d ; and when we try to prevent fraud, we have to deal with very smart and unscrupulous people. these circumstances, the law ought to be so worded that there shall be no loophole for escape. The Opposition seem to be under the impression that the Minister of Trade and Customs and his officers will endeavour to trap innocent people-that the Minister will exercise his tremendous powers with that result. so already in one case. yet. We know that in Victoria, in the ten Â£ 1 9 , 0 0 0 was paid in fines for this very offence. [84]2 tions. It is straining a dous lot of deliberate fraud.

It requires a vast number of small fines for mistakes and errors to make up fhe sum of ,Â£19,000, and I know from the records that the bulk of the big fines were for deliberate fraud. As I understand the B ill , the false description must be intended to mislead for the purposes of fraud. the Opposition do not seem to object to the presence of the word "" false."" Who will decide as to the falsity of a description? All these matters have to be decided on evidence, and even then it is only a matter of opinion; and my point is that the misleading must be deliberate and on some material point. The Opposition, would The appear to think that the present Minister will always be in office; but we may take it for granted that, whoever is at the heard of the Department, will not undertake foolish or unnecessary prosecutions. Indeed, honourable members are so watchful that there is very little chance of any serious mistake in administration.

507,Mr Spence,"It does not matter todraftsmanship, but I cannot see that anything would be gained by striking out the clause. Minister quoted from the English Act to show that I was riot correct in my statement that that Act contained no such words as "" likely to mislead;"" but the honourable member quoted so far and no further. First of all, the words in the English Act are nothing like the words in the Bill. The words quoted by the Minister were"" to which any trade mark or marks so nearly resembling a trade mark as to be calculated to deceive,"" whereas the words in the Bill are "" likely to mislead in a material respect."" The English Act, as I say, refers to a trade mark "" so nearly resembling a trade mark as to be calculated to deceive,"" and then follow words which the Minister did not quote"" is falsely applied."" It is simply absurd to attempt to draw a parallel between the two provisions. All we desire is that some protection shall be given to men whom certain honourable members seem to regard as criminals. The honourable member for Darling is evidently under' the impression that this Parliament protects everybody and everything ; but I. have come to a different conclusion. When a Government have a majority who blindly follow them, they are prepared to do things of a most tyrannical nature. Our laws ought to be so drafted as to allow no tyranny over any section, or any. persons in the community, but to protect the equal rights of all men.. We on this side of the House are trying to do our duty to the country, and should not be charged with seeking to protect any particular body of men. Any one who commits fraud and deceives the public ought to be punished; and I am prepared to assist in passing laws to that end, but I am not prepared to make criminals of men for committing imaginary offences. The Minister of Trade and Customs is. unintentionally no doubt, misleading the Committee in the quotations he has made. The Minister informed us that the sections in the English Act and the South Australian Act are much more stringent than the clause 1 he proposes, but, strange to say, he quoted from the enacting clause, and ignored altogether the definition section in each Act. It will be found that the definitions in both Acts are much' more definite than that to which he seeksto give effect in this Bill. On their very face, the sections which have been quoted, show an intention to prevent straight out fraud. No one quarrels with that. We are as anxious as is the Minister to prevent fraud. I would point out that this Bill covers very much more ground than that. As has been pointed out by the honourable member 1 for Kooyong, the word "" quality "" is not to be found in the Acts to which the Minister has referred. There is all the difference in the world between fraud as applied to the description of the place where goods are madej or as to their contents, and the matter of an opinion-for it may come to that-as to the quality of an article supplied. According to the drag-net clause submitted by the Minister, if there happens to be a difference of opinion between the maker of an article, say butter, and the Minister, the latter may say that the definition of the maker is likely to mislead as to the quality of the goods. There is no such drag-net clause in the Acts which the honourable gentleman has referred to. They are clearly limited in their scope, and if the honourable gentleman will follow those Acts there will be no trouble. It is because he seeks infinitely wider powers than are given under those Acts that we should be very careful of the words we put into this definition clause. It is a very serious matter to say that a mere mistake as to the quality of goods may render a man liable to a penalty of Â£100. The Minister, in quoting from the British and South Australian Acts, entirely misled the Committee as to the powers they confer when compared with those which he seeks to acquire. We shall be very glad if the honourable gentleman will say that he is content to accept the definition contained in those Acts, because that would be an immense concession. I ask again, what reason the honourable gentleman can have for seeking to go further, unless, as has already been hinted before to night, he desires to get this Bill passed in a certain form for the purpose of making it prohibitive to do business with outside places ? I ask the honourable gentleman again to be content with the powers conferred under the British and South Australian Acts. The South Australian Legislature was content to follow the British precedent, but the honourable gentleman is going one better in insisting on a drag-net provision, which will make it im-",63,William Lyne T H A T Statement Is

They haive set up certain standards and prescribed certain conditions which are applied to trade between them and Australia, and we should reciprocate by as nearly as possible approximating our legislation to theirs. merits of the question, if there is nothing specially against the adoption of that course, we should strain every nerve to bring our legislation.into line with that which experience has shown, has worked well in Great Britain. port the amendment, for the obvious reason that the retention of the words ""or likely to mislead"" are quite unnecessary, unless the measure is designed for some purpose which has not yet been made clear to the Committee. If the Minister continues to adopt an arrogant tone towards honourable members of the Opposition, who venture to suggest that the Bill might be improved in certain respects, and refuses to meet reasonable suggestions for its improvement in a reasonable way, he will have only himself to blame if the discussion of the measure is prolonged. There must be some means of entering gentleman's from this side. shown by the honourable member for Kooyong, and other honourable members, that the retention of these words can serve 1 no useful purpose. We are entitled to know why the Minister desires to retain them, but, so far, we have had no information on that point. The honourable gentleman has referred us to the British and South Australian Acts, and, as has been pointed out, he has quoted the provisions of those Acts in such a way as to lead to a misapprehension as to their effect. When he made his first explanation, the honourable gentleman said that these words were taken from the British Act. or based on it. man did not say anything of the sort. What he said was that somewhat similar words were in the British and South Australian Acts. the exact words which the honourable gentleman used, but the meaning he intended to convey was that the words ""contained in this clause were the same in effect as the words contained in the British provision. It has been shown that there is no resemblance whatever between the two provisions. We should have no objection if the Minister is willing to adopt the words of the British or South Australian Acts. that the honourable gentleman would strain Apart from the every nerve to bring our legislation into line with the British legislation on the same subject. view of the fact that he has pointed out that this B ill is modelled on the British Act, and he proposed to quote from that Act to show how nearly alike the provisions were. If the honourable gentleman believes that this clause should have the same meaning as the British provision he can have no reasonable objection to substituting the words, of the British Act, which we think are better, and more clearly define what is intended. If he is not willing to do tliat, we are justified in assuming that these words "" or likely to mislead "" are to be retained for some purpose, which, so far, has not been made plain. I wish to know if they are to be retained for the purpose of enabling a Minister who may be so disposed to continue the system of persecution of importers which has been a protest against the honourable carried on in the past. I can discover no treatment of suggestions otherreason why they should be left in the It has been clearly clause. If that is the intention' in retaining them, I shall do what I can to see that the amendment is forced to a division. If the Minister is unwilling to receive reasonable suggestions for the improvement of the Bill, we are perfectly justified in using all the means at our disposal to resist his action, and I shall certainly exercise my right in that direction. amendment by omitting from the words I propose shall be left out the words "" in a material respect.""
