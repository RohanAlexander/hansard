One of these toning machines has been set up in Bombay and is, I believe, working satisfactorily. So the answer to the honourable member's question is that, in the short term, it is not likely while import restrictions and exchange difficulties exist that there will be a big inUnited Nations General Assembly, at its crease in the demand for Australian milk powder, but, in the long term, I think that sales of Australian powdered milk will increase greatly.

I may say, in passing, that this attitude has strikingly contrasted with that which he adopted in this House in April of this year when he said that what went on inside the trade unions was entirely a matter for the trade unions themselves. However, even if this was a change of attitude of more recent times, it was welcomed by the House and the country, I believe. Since then, of course, his attitude has been disavowed by, I think, the honourable member for Darebin, and we have had from the new senator from New South Wales another viewpoint altogether. What, at least, does seem to emerge clearly from the various statements and attitudes is that Labour members are realizing, quite realistically, that they are so placed in relation to the Communist party that they cannot afford to have the Communists with them and that, on the other hand, they cannot afford to be without them. I leave them on the horns of that unhappy dilemma. will recall that for the better part of a year officers? I have been asking him whether the Commonwealth would be prepared to accept the same responsibility for injuries caused by Commonwealth motor car drivers as the State governments accept for injuries caused by their drivers and compel private motorists to accept in regard to injuries caused by their vehicles. The right honourable gentleman will recollect having written to me over three months ago stating that a submission on this matter would be made to Cabinet and would be considered at an early date. I therefore ask him whether the matter has yet been submitted to Cabinet and whether any decision has been made upon it. some consideration. There are some aspects of it, as the honourable member will realize, that are not without their complications and which have been investigated since. I do the following paper:not undertake to give the honourable member an answer to-morrow, but I will give him the complete answer to his question on the next day of sitting. whether the Government has given consideration to providing credit to countries other than New Zealand to assist them to buy our products. Does he not think that such a grant of credit would have an important influence on the price of our primary exports and upon our export income? no application for, or consideration of, the extension of credit to countries other than New Zealand. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government did not make the credit available to New Zealand. It was made available as between the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the central bank of Australia. ter for the Navy state whether it is .a fact that a naval survey is being carried out in the Timor Sea by navy ships working out of Darwin? Could the Minister advise me of the type of ship carrying out this survey? Is it a fact that on board these vessels are a number of Japanese scientists and naval a survey of the Sahul Bank in the waters of northern Australia has been carried out by four ships of the Royal Australian Navy. This very large-scale survey has been a remarkable undertaking and was completed within the short space of ten weeks. For the reason that it has been a remarkable undertaking and achievement, I am about to issue a statement on the subject. I have no knowledge whatever of the presence of any Japanese, naval officers or otherwise, in any of the ships. This seems to me to be so unlikely that such a suggestion is probably another of the products of the fanciful imagination of the honourable member who asked the question.

Air) [3.18] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this short bill is to authorize the person from time to time holding the office of Deputy Commissioner of Patents to be appointed also to the office of Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks. The Trade Marks Act 1955 provides, inter alia, that there shall be a Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks. In ordinary public service practice an office designated as Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks would be created under the provisions of the Public Service Act and an officer would be appointed to that office. In this case, however, it is proposed to appoint the Deputy Commissioner of Patents to be also the Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks. The Public Service Act does not authorize one officer to be appointed to two positions. Consequently, it is necessary to amend the Trade Marks Act 1955 to enable the Deputy Commissioner of Patents to be appointed also to the office of Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks. There are sound administrative reasons bill. for the Government's decision to appoint one officer to both positions. Firstly, the normal line of promotion in the Patent and Trade Marks offices is from Deputy Comfrom committee without amendment or missioner of Patents to Commissioner of debate; report adopted. Patents. At present, the Deputy Commissioner of Patents does not deal with any trade mark matters, as he has no authority to do so. The proposed amendment will give him the opportunity to gain experience resumed from 26th August (vide page 768). in the trade marks field and qualify himself for appointment as Commissioner of Patents and Registrar of Trade Marks.

The measure provides for the completion of the change of government in relation to Christmas Island and for vesting in the Commonwealth authority over the island. It is an interesting illustration of the processes and practices which have now become turned into statute law, and the Statute of Westminster authorizes the Commonwealth's action in this matter. Christmas Island was originally noted for the fact that Australia and New Zealand purchased an important phosphate deposit there. They have an interest in the territory, and this island will now come under the control of the Australian Government.

62,Mr Makin (Bonython) [3.23],"Th econsideration is being given to affairs associated with the administration of this department. However, I fully appreciate the importance of his presence at the United Nations at this time, and also his 1 work in dealing with the missions from this country to other countries. In those circumstances I do not complain that thc Minister is not present, but I feel that some better provision should be made to meet the situation created by his absence. I do not say this in any unkind or ungenerous way to the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride), but I think he will agree with the soundness of my argument that in view of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs must necessarily be absent from this country a great deal during the sittings of Parliament, we should have some more permanent arrangement for a Minister to act for the Minister for External Affairs. Perhaps we could have something in the nature of an assistant Minister. Then, instead of several Ministers acting at different times for the Minister for External Affairs, honourable members could look to one particular man for explanations with regard to this department. I think that the appointment of an assistant Minister may perhaps be the best arrangement. When Labour was in office it was my pleasure very often to deputize for the Minister for External Affairs, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). That arrangement seemed to be very satisfactory. It meant that the administration always had a responsible person at the helm, who was able to answer readily questions submitted to him by honourable members. In those days, if the Minister had to leave the country, honourable members knew who would be acting in his stead. But that is not the case to-day. At present the Minister for Defence is acting for the Minister for External Affairs, but to-morrow his place may be taken by the Minister for Civil Aviation, the Minister for the Navy, or any other Minister. In looking at the Estimates for the Department of External Affairs, I notice that the amounts allowed for our representation abroad vary as between one country and another. I should like to know the reason for those variations. Are our embassies or legations classified according to their importance, or are our representatives classified according to their position in the Commonwealth Public Service? I know that many of the men who occupy those positions are what are known as career men and possibly they are classified in different categories. But I want to know the reason for the variation in the amounts allowed in the Estimates. In some cases, the amounts allowed are very low and do not, I think, truly reflect the importance to Australia of the country concerned. At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the splendid work that was done by the Leader of the Opposition when he held the portfolio of Minister for External Affairs. He brought to the department a significance and an importance that it never enjoyed previously. Australia's name became well known throughout the world. His work at the United Nations was acclaimed and Australia was looked to for leadership, particularly among the middle-class Powers and the smaller nations. Australia's advice was constantly sought, and accepted. Our policy in matters affecting international affairs was a progressive one. The right honourable gentleman's capabilities were acknowledged in the United Nations and he was elected to the position of President of the United Nations General Assembly. Australia then held a high place in the esteem of other countries, but I am afraid that in more recent times we have lost some of that esteem. With the growing importance of external relationships we should have a greater say in the work of the United Nations and other bodies that control the affairs of nations. I should like to see greater efforts towards Australia again showing leadership in the council of nations and helping to maintain the peace of the world. I bring to the notice of the Government an anomaly that is long overdue for correction. From my experience in these matters, I should say that the heads of missions are not allowed the discretionary powers that their office should enjoy. Far too often the head of a mission has to refer a matter, commonplace in its character but administrative in its nature, to the central administration at Canberra before he can give even a minor decision. The heads of missions should be given greater discretionary powers. The next matter I should like to bring to vious Government. However, much good the notice of the Minister concerns noncareer men, who are brought in from the general community to represent Australia at diplomatic missions. No provision is made for the payment of a retiring allowance to these men at the expiration of their period of office. In Canada, at the terminagood work is being done under the Colombo tion of their service, men who are brought from professional or business life in the general community to occupy positions in the diplomatic service are given as a retiring allowance an amount equal to one-third of the salary amount that they have received during their service. Tlie CHAIRMAN ( Mr Adermann) Order! The honourable member's time has expired. somewhat hard to understand how the honourable member for Bonython( Mr ever, one would not expect the honourable Makin) can reconcile some of the statements he has just made with the fact that he has had a long career in politics and was at one time a Minister of the Crown. He has now advocated the appointment of an assistant Minister. Surely, as a former Minister, he would know that constitutionally that is not member for Bonython were leading lights possible. The honourable member also said that he cannot understand why there is a difference in the allowances paid to heads of missions in the various countries. Surely he knows that the cost of living varies considerably in different countries and that in some centres it is necessary to pay a much higher rate of salary and allowance so that the diplomat concerned can maintain a standard equivalent to that maintained in areas where the cost of living is lower. The Public Service Board appoints inspectors who visit the missions from time to time. They determine the amount of salary and allowance that will be paid. The honourable member should also know that some positions are filled by men of a rank senior to those appointed to other embassies. Australia is very fortunate in the work that is being done at the moment by our embassies, consulates and missions overseas. It is well to bear in mind that, when this Government came to office in 1949, Australia was singularly lacking in friends in Asia. The great majority of Asian people had been grossly offended by the policies, the statements and the attitude of the prework has been done to overcome Asian prejudice to Australia. To-day, we are very fortunate in that we can claim that throughout Asia we have many allies and friends. This is, of course, evidenced by Seato, ANZUS and Anzam. In addition, much Plan to win friends in Asia. We believe the fate of Australia is intimately linked with the fate of Asian nations. To suggest, as the honourable member for Bonython did, that the work being done in the United Nations Organization does not measure up to the standard that he requires, ignores completely the tremendous job that has been done and the great respect that has been earned for Australia by our representative there, Dr. Walker. It also completely brushes aside the report of Keith Shann on the Hungarian situation. Howmember to have any sympathy with the views expressed in the report on the situation in Hungary, furnished by the committee of which Keith Shann was chairman. If a government in which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable was ever elected to the treasury bench of this Parliament, we could be sure that those who are now behind the Iron Curtain and who operate the Iron Curtain would well and truly become our friends and those who are now our friends would be lost. My main purpose in speaking now is to pay tribute to the work being done by our embassies in Asia. It is true that Australia bears the highest reputation in Asiatic countries, particularly in the countries of South-East Asia. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) is held in the highest esteem by all sections of the community. That can be clearly illustrated by the fact that a business man in Singapore told me that if headlines appeared in the newspapers of any country in Asia reading, "" Casey says"", everyone from the coolie to the business man and the politician would know that reference was being made to the Australian Minister for External Affairs. I feel that the amount of salary and allowances paid to the staff of our embassies is insufficient. I spent some time in Bangkok, and I was able to observe there the struggle that members of our embassy",19,Estimates 1958 59
63,Mr Wight (Lilley) [3.38],"I find itstaff had to try to work on a parity with the representatives of some other nations there. I had a long talk to the New Zealand charge d'affaires, and 1 was able to learn how much better off he is than are the people in our embassy. 1 am quite certain that inadequate transport is provided for the Australian embassies and consulates that I visited in Asia. I suggest that the Public Service Board give special consideration to the situation of our embassy at Bangkok. Up to the present, the staff there has been able to obtain some concession in the purchase of commodities for the maintenance of their homes through the British commissary. However, that has now closed down and our representatives can no longer purchase their goods at the same discount rate. Consequently, they have been prejudiced to that extent. It may be twelve months before the Public Service Board would normally examine this situation and make the necessary adjustment to the allowances. Therefore, I urge that special consideration be given to the matter as urgently as possible. Many Asian countries can be regarded as our very good friends; others must be regarded definitely as our enemies, because they are even now waging a cold war upon us and upon our allies. However, we seem to have failed to recognize the fact that, although we have given de jure recognition to the Nationalist Government of China, we have not established a diplomatic post in Taiwan. The United Kingdom Government does not give de jure recognition to the Nationalist Government, but gives de jure recognition to the Communist Government in Peking. The United Kingdom gives de facto recognition to the nationalist Government. Despite this the United Kingdom Government believes that it should have a diplomatic post in Taipei, and has appointed a consul there. Yet the Australian Government, which gives de jure recognition to the Nationalist Government, has no diplomatic post or trade mission in Taipei! Except for the fact that we support the Chiang Kai-shek Nationalist Government at the United Nations and have a Chinese Nationalist mission here in Canberra, there is no otheT evidence that we give the Chinese Nationalists de jure recognition. I consider that this is an offensive attitude destruction of Korea and the beginning of for the Government to adopt towards people who are our staunch and loyal friends. We must bear in mind that this attitude has a considerable effect on the minds of the 12,000,000 Chinese outside China who are spread throughout Asia and who want to see the prestige of the Nationalist Government lifted. They feel that some countries are abandoning the Nationalists. We know that although U Nu and U Ba Swe, in Burma, have given de jure recognition to red China, a great many people in Burma resent this action of the Burmese Government. Those people are very conscious of the fact that the Australian Government has failed to establish a diplomatic post in Taipei. I was asked by Mr Thiep, the Secretary-General of the Nationalist Assembly in Viet Nam, why Australia had neglected to do so. I was asked the same question by General Thanom, in Thailand. People throughout Asia fail to understand why we give de jure recognition to a country and fail to establish, a diplomatic post in it. We have a post in Cambodia and one in Viet Nam. We have two officers of the Australian Government in Korea appointed to the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We have an embassy in Japan and one in the Philippines. Yet we have nothing in Taipei! I suggest that this is a matter that must be given urgent and very high priority. We understand how important it is when we realize the tremendous build-up of enemy forces that has occurred on the Fukien coast of China, and think of the attempts by the Communist Chinese to seize the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu, and the possibility that this will lead to a conflagration in the Pacific area. We must realize not only that the Nationalist Chinese are our friends but also that their capital, Taipei, is the best listening post apart from Hong Kong through which we can learn what is going on behind the iron curtain in mainland China. All these things are important, but it is important above all that we should show the Chinese who are spread throughout the Asian countries that we stand firmly behind the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and that we recognize that the Nationalists are our friends and that our fate is intimately linked with theirs. The destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek regime would mean the a conflagration that would in fact destroy Australia. We have to recognize, Sir, that all the anti-Communist countries in Asia and on the western side of the Pacific must stand firmly together and present a united front if Australia is to survive. The need to ensure our survival should be uppermost in the minds of all members of this Parliament. So long as we consider that Australia's survival can be taken for granted, we shall be neglecting the situation that is developing to our immediate north. I know that the United States of America has intimated to the Australian Government that that country would welcome any action by Australia to establish a diplomatic mission in Taipei. We know that the United Kingdom has such a mission there. We know that we should have one, and there must be some reason for our not establishing one that is not being made public and is not being made known to the members of the Government parties. It is being made known to neither members of the Parliament nor the people. This is a question that the Government must answer in the immediate future. By appointing either a diplomatic mission or a trade mission to Taipei, Sir, we should in fact be giving de jure recognition to the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and we should be meeting our responsibilities as one of the free countries in Asia. Chairman, I should like to pursue the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) a good way along the path on which they lead, but I had decided, before I rose in my place, as they say in the classical language of this chamber, to make a moderate and uncontroversial contribution concerning the Republic of Indonesia and the very difficult situation that is developing there, with particular reference to the misunderstandings that have arisen, in order to see whether we, as members of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, cannot do something to bring about better relations between the peoples of the two countries, who live so close together. East of Malaya, west of New Guinea and north of Australia are the islands of Indonesia-3,00 0 of them, including the larger islands that we all know of. The political situation in the islands of Indonesia to-day is almost as confused as they are geographically. We are inclined to get emotionally involved in the situation without having a full knowledge of it, and we are inclined to make statements of firm decisions to do either this or that or to resist one move or another -statement s which might involve us in conflict entirely unnecessarily. Two important observations about the Indonesian situation have been made in this chamber to-day. One was made from this side of the chamber by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), who suggested that, in tbese troublous times, we should resort to negotiation, which is the basis of thc United Nations and of our peacemaking machinery. He suggested that President Soekarno of Indonesia should be invited to Australia at an appropriate time to discuss his country's problems-no t only trade problems, but also the problems of rehabilitation and development that face a native race emerging from colonialism after so many centuries-and the question of what the Indonesians think to be their legitimate aspirations in regard to territory and the extension of the new republic. I think that is a splendid idea. We have had visits from Mr Kishi, the Japanese Prime Minister, from other people from the Archipelago of Indo-China and elsewhere who are to my mind rather suspect, and from many people who are true friends. They have come to these shores to discuss and promote the cause of peace. The original good that came out of the United Nations, if not its best opportunity and, indeed, its only work, could best be exemplified by a committee on Indonesia. I think that perhaps we ought to get together at some level and discuss these problems which divide us in regard to Indonesia, or the questions which could resolve themselves into highly dangerous and contentious ones. Before the governments of these countries become terse with each other, or before the people become emotionally involved from reading newspaper and magazine articles and much comment that is more or less ill-informed, we ought to know what were the facts on both sides. I think that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Lang is indeed a good one. If we do not have President Soekarno himself visit us, we should have some of his ministerial officers come here and give us the Indonesian point of view. We, in turn, could explain the Australian point of view.",21,Estimates 1958 59
64,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.50],"MrThe second important remark about Indonesia made in this chamber to-day was made by the Minister fqr Defence( Sir Philip McBride), in his capacity as acting Minister for External Affairs. He said that, on Thursday last, the Indonesian Minister in Australia had called on him personally in relation to the troubled situation over the eventual allocation of West New Guinea. The Indonesian Minister said that he had been asked by the Indonesian Prime Minister to inform the Australian Government that there was no thought of violence or of active aggression in relation to this probthink I can say that none of us wants war lem. This puts the matter in an entirely different light. Last week, there was a dramatic change in attitudes towards Indonesia. The Americans are now selling arms to the Indonesians. Formerly, the allegation was that red China was selling them arms, but it is now an established fact that the Americans are doing that very thing. As a result of this, the whole situation in Indonesia has appeared in a different light, and we should pause for a moment and get the facts straight. It would be better for all concerned if we did this before having in view the effects of the different -we start arguing violently or belligerently about who is going to possess West New Guinea. The Indonesian people require aid at this -moment. Among the cries for Merdekathe cries for freedom-w e hear also an insistent cry for some help from outside. Indonesians need aid more than any race in Asia at the present time, and I believe most firmly that we should extend the operations of the Colombo plan to the Indonesians, in a friendly gesture, in order to put their country upon its feet in a financial development of a close neighbour. We can sense. Those who in the past have said, "" Indonesia was Dutch territory; it has been wrested from the Dutch; the Indonesians .are now in charge and they sink or swim according to their own activities "", are not learning the lessons of history. You cannot turn back the page. There is now a republic of native-born Indonesians. The people themselves have thrown off their colonial bosses, the colonial yoke as it is popularly called, and are now endeavouring to march with the rest of the world. It would be not only useful, but Christian and humane, if Australia, one of Indonesia's -neighbours, adopted a comprehensive and ^sympathetic attitude towards that country. I suggest that as an alternative to angry cries of "" Hands off New Guinea "". The West New Guinea issue has been brought into the ambit of controversial issues, and eventually, like all such issues-for instance, that of Korea-it will have to go to the conference table of the United Nations. We ought to make some preparation for that now. I do not know what is running through the minds of members of the Australian Government, and I am not sure what is in the mind of the Australian community with regard to this matter, but I over any issue relating to a country to the north of us. Therefore, we have to start to establish goodwill between ourselves and our neighbours. We should remember the Christian community in Indonesia. We should remember the Moslems there. We should remember the tribal chieftains, the rajahs and maharajahs, and the complex composition of the population of this great blanket of islands. Remembering those things, and grades of culture of these people, this is a clear case in which we can move in, as a nation with a great secondary industry and as a nation with great influence in this South-West Pacific area. As the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) says, we have plenty of friends. We know we have plenty of friends, but what is wrong with our having more friends? In Indonesia we have a classical opportunity to do something useful for the preservation of peace in the Pacific and for the economic divert that country from the aggression which will result in the long run unless there is a proper understanding. For these reasons, the invitation to President Soekarno suggested by the honourable member for Lang is a sensible one. The suggestion emanates from a young "" digger "". I am pleased that it was made by him, and I congratulate him on it. The statement by the Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs is also reassuring. The situation with regard to Indonesia is a challenge to us to do something in the way of negotiation, and the best and most practical way to approach negotiations is to show some concern for the sufferings of the people. Indonesia is practically broke. Its monetary -system has been subjected to grave assaults. Its trade has been the victim of various unhappy circumstances. To-day it stands at the crossroads. It can be assisted in its .rehabilitation by experts, by understanding and by the proper use of the Colombo plan. In devising a plan like the Colombo plan to cover Indonesia-and this could be organized through the United Nations-w e can get down to the conference table, and eventually, by a series of moves of this nature, bring the whole Indonesian situation before the United Nations for consideration. After all, Indonesia is trouble spot No. 1 be scuttled for want of a ha'porth of tar. in the world to-day. Consideration by the United Nations is a slow process. This is at once the United Nations' greatest advantage and its greatest disability. Peace comes very slowly. It is a tenuous and a tender thing and has to be nurtured.

It is why the United Nations has persisted, despite many setbacks. stands for, and to be ambassadors, in many This suggestion seems to me to be a logical answer to the Indonesian problem. I refer now to West New Guinea, and the ourselves ambassadors-at-large of goodwill question whether the Dutch should have by adopting a calmer approach to this evacuated the whole of their territory in this problem. area. They have retained this arid piece of New Guinea which does not mean much, except as a point of prestige and, probably, few weeks, one would have thought that a point of return.

We can sense and our judgment. We must use the build in Asia not only a strong goodwill, United Nations. Unswerving loyalty to the but also a goodwill which is of an enduring nature. I suggest, as I have said briefly in the few minutes at my disposal, that there is a practical way to do this. The first step is to take the heat out of the argument by exchanging visits. Let us have the Indonesians here to tell us what they think of the problem, without inhibitions. Let us also have a look at them in return and discuss with them our problems-and pull no punches in the association. Out of that, something important and useful will, I am sure, emerge. One does not allow a ship to sink or to We can, to our own benefit-becaus e we build goodwill and bridges for future trade -d o something about the position in Indonesia. Let us have their trade authorities here, their economists and their scholars and teachers. We have an opportunity to teach many of their young men here and to communities, to explain what Australia cases, for our way of life. I believe that we can extend this scheme. We can make If one read the newspapers during the last the United Nations. We must, in the troubled Pacific, which is now the ocean United Nations is the keystone of the policy of the Labour party, and I think it is advocated by most Australians. I hope that we will approach the problem of Indonesia in a common sense way, without any jingoism or chauvinism, and without any emotional appeals through newspapers or other channels. The stake is friendship with the Spice Islands, historical Indonesia. The stake is prevention of a third world war, and the rewards are to be found through the United Nations, through negotiations and the friendly understanding of the problems of our neighbours to the north, who are not like the great imperial Chinese race, which has had a well-known and documented history. Indonesia has a history, of course, but it is one in which the whether it would be possible to increase the worker and the ordinary Indonesian do not share. To-day the Indonesian nation emerges as one of the new nations of the world, and we should treat it with all the concern and consideration that we can bring to bear, so that it may become a peaceful member of the community of nations. Indonesia's aspirations should not be laughed at and its desires should not be conceded reluctantly only where there is force to support them. I think that the continual stories about the huge air force that the Indonesians have and the number of men that they are raising should, perhaps, be discounted freely. They should be discounted in the light of the experience of any man on either side of the chamber with any knowledge of the Pacific war. How many ships did it take to make even a small landing on a very small island? Two or three thousand were required to go to the Philippines, and 250 for the least foray under General MacArthur. There is talk of movement towards New Guinea. Perhaps there is some infiltration or action of that sort, but undoubtedly the reports are much exaggerated. able member's time has expired. this afternoon, the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) made a plea for an increase in allowances to the personnel of our diplomatic posts abroad.

Therefore, it is very ing a great number of these posts in recent years, I have had the opportunity of seeing some in South-East Asia, and I think that the high level of our representation by the personnel in those posts reflects a great deal of credit not only on the officers themselves but also on Australia. I agree with the statement of the honourable member for Lilley that some of our officials suffer a disadvantage in comparison with those of other countries in regard to the allowances paid to them for their representation. I think it is unnecessary now to go into detail. The honourable member did give some itemized examples. AllI wish to say is that what he said exactly coincides with the opinion I formed from my own observations. I support his plea for the Government to have a look at this matter and see allowances made to our personnel in these areas. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has said quite a deal about Indonesia. I should like to refer to one or two matters that he brought up. I quite agree with some of what he said. He suggested at one stage that we should give Colombo plan aid to Indonesia. I think that for quite a number of years we have been extending that aid. it any longer. a fleet of new Australian buses running in the streets of Djakarta. ruption to the aid. been no interruption. Certainly the flow of students from Indonesia to Australia has been maintained. I do agree with the honourable member's statement that where ever possible we should increase the interchange of visitors. Whether Indonesia is more important that other countries in South-East Asia, I should not like to say. I do not think that it is possible to establish a priority in these matters. 1 remind the committee that quite a number of members, including myself, have in past years asked the Government to send parliamentary delegations to various countries abroad, and especially to countries of pleasing that the number of visits has increased in the last few years.

70,Mr Dean,"As far as I know, there haswe send a delegation to a selected country under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. 1 believe that the delegations from Australia have done a lot of good, not only by their own representation in making the Australian viewpoint known, but also by personally making contacts and assisting people who have not had an opportunity of visiting this country to know something of it. The only comment I make in regard to our representation at conferences of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is that so far we have been sending a delegation of only six. My understanding of the situation is that, pro rata to our population, we are entitled to send ten delegates, and I think it is a great pity that we cut short the number in our delegations and do not take full advantage of the opportunity for members to travel and so enlarge their personal experience and extend their contacts. One other reason why our delegations should be at full strength is that other counSouth-East Asia a few months ago, which tries set great store on the importance of proceedings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and when the Australian delegation arrives four delegates short, those countries immediately think that this country does not set the same importance upon its representation on that body as they themselves do. Therefore, I bring that aspect (o the notice of the Government. While being thankful to the Government for initiating our representation during the last three years, I say that we should take a full delegation to the countries where conferences are being held. I should like to make one more comment on the remarks addressed to us by the honourable member for Parkes. expressed regret at some rattling of the sabre that he claimed had taken place in regard to relations between this country and Indonesia. As far as I know, there has been no rattling of the sabre from this side of the chamber at all. The honourable member referred to statements by a section of the pressI am glad to say a very smal! section-whic h has tried to promote in thc public mind belief in the existence of a situation between Australia and Indonesia, which we in this place know not to exist. I agree with the honourable member's statement that it was very good that the Minister .acting for the Minister for External Affairs was able to-day to give the answer he did give in reply to a question. I want to return to this matter of extending our visits to other countries, especially to those of South-East Asia. 1 think it is necessary for parliamentary visits to be increased. After all, when one looks at the successful commercial and manufacturing enterprises in Australia, one sees that they realize the great benefits that flow from sending their personnel abroad. 1 can think of a number of such organizations which always have a group of their staff abroad. No sooner does one group arrive back in Australia than the next group sets out. As can be seen, great expenditure by the Government is not involved in sending these delegations abroad. I do not think that these visits should necessarily remain the prerogative of members of Parliament. Therefore, I was very glad that we initiated a trade delegation to was led by the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz), and comprised representatives from a number of commercial and manufacturing organizations. The reports on that visit, both from the delegates and from the countries they visited, are most encouraging. I think that we could well promote and take an interest in visits by another group. I refer particularly to the service clubs of Australia. By service clubs, I mean the Rotary Club, the Apex Club, chambers of commerce, and junior chambers of commerce-organization s which work towards community service. Some of them originated outside Australia, but, owing to Hc their spread in Australia, they have indeed become Australian institutions. Others, such as the Apex Club, are entirely Australian institutions, having originated here. It is good to know that branches of those organizations are being formed by our neighbours in South-East Asia. I believe that this free assembling of people with a common objective to give service to their community is one of the greatest weapons that could be used against the infiltration of those countries by Communists. Therefore, it would be to their advantage, as well as to ours, to assist in the promotion and formation of these clubs. There is an item in the Budget which refers to the money to be spent on Asian visits, and I should like to ask the acting Minister for External Affairs whether it would be possible for us to assist such organizations as I have referred to under that heading. As we know, in many cases the members of the organizations are comparatively young men with young families, and the greatest expense in these visits abroad is involved in the fares. Once we can make arrangements for them to arrive in the country abroad, their expenses are not high because their hosts are most hospitable and take care of them. They also arrange their itineraries, but the great item of expense is the return fare from Australia to any one of those countries. Although we refer to them as our near neighbours, they are far away compared with the distance between countries within the European boundaries, for example. I direct the attention of the Minister to these suggestions and hope that he will give consideration to them because I believe the future of Australia is being closely linked very quickly with the future of the countries of South-East Asia. Anything we can do to promote greater personal contact and the expansion of trade between ourselves and those countries will be to our mutual advantage. refer to Division No. 217K -Internationa l Development and Relief-unde r Miscellaneous Services. I regret that this year there has been a decrease in the proposed vote for the Colombo plan. The appropriation last year was £5,345,000, which was provided for economic development and technical assistance. Of that appropriation, actual expenditure was £4,997,259, or about £300,000 under the allocation. This year the appropriation for the two sections of the Colombo plan I have mentioned is £4,300,000. That is about £1,000,000 under the allocation for last year and £700,000 under what was actually spent. That is regrettable, because we have reached the stage in our relations with South and South-East Asia where an increase, and not a decrease, in the allocation would have been more appropriate. countries would have informed the GoAs a matter of fact, ever since the spent on economic assistance, because Colombo plan was initiated in 1950, the everybody knows that the economic reexpenditure has been below what was sources of the recipient countries are in envisaged at first. The plan was supposed to extend from 1950 to 1957 and, over that period, Australia contracted to spend £32,500,000, but I vouchsafe the opinion that, by the end of 1961, at the present rate of expenditure, we will not have spent £32,500,000 over eleven years. This matter was discussed last year, and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) informed the committee that we had spent between £17,000,000 and £18,000,000, and an expenditure of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 more was in prospect over the next year or so. I cannot understand why there is a continual lag in expenditure on the Colombo plan. It could be justified in the early stages of the scheme when the Government did not know what was required in the way of economic or technical assistance, but, as the plan has been under way for eight years, one would think that the Government would have had sufficient experience to make sure that the money that had been allocated by the Parliament was spent. After all, the money that we allocate is only a drop in the ocean, and it is deplorable that we do not spend even the meagre amount that is placed on the Estimates for this purpose. I do not know whether the Government has wilted under public pressure in deciding to reduce the allocation by £1,000,000, because some newspapers have been opposed to the Colombo plan. Statements have been made from time to time by various public authorities that this money should not be spent in South-East Asia but in the environs of Australia. I cannot subscribe to that point of view because I think that money spent on the Colombo plan is a practical contribution towards the maintenance of the sovereignty of Australia. Whatever money is spent on the Colombo plan will pay dividends a hundred-fold in the years ahead. I regret, therefore, that, for reasons that the Government has not seen fit to divulge, it has decided to spend £1,000,000 less than it provided last year. I cannot imagine that the recipient vernment that they do not want money",26,Estimates 1958 59
71,Mr Bird (Batman) [4.17],"I wish tosuch a state that they are practically totally nal Affairs did not do justice to the plan in bereft of machinery, hydro-electric power, irrigation and similar utilities. That is the reason for the plan. It was designed in the first place to provide such essential facilities and to lift the standard of living in the countries concerned. I cannot imagine that those countries would suggest that they do not want the full allocation this year. If the Government cannot spend the money on economic assistance under the Colombo plan, why not spend it on the technical co-operation scheme which is definitely paying dividends? I am pleased that this year, although there has been a decrease in the allocation for economic development, an increase of £300,000 is contemplated in the appropriation for technical assistance under the Colombo plan. I congratulate the Government on that provision, but we all know that Australia could take more students from overseas if provision were made in the technical schools and universities for them. If the Government could not spend the appropriation for the Colombo plan on economic development, why was it not spent on extensions to universities and technical schools to make additional provision for students from the Colombo plan countries? It cannot be said that there is nothing on which to spend the money. At this juncture, the technical assistance section of the Colombo plan is more important than economic development. I cannot understand why the Government adopted such a miserable outlook and said, in effect, ""We are not going to spend the money on economic development; therefore, we will not spend it on technical assistance"". If more had been spent on technical assistance, we would have had more ambassadors for Australia returning to their native lands at the end of their training. If there is anything we want from the countries of South East Asia it is goodwill towards us. There is no more practical way of bringing that about than the technical assistance scheme under the Colombo plan. AlthoughI have been a supporter of the Colombo plan since it was inaugurated in 1950, I am prepared to concede that it has not been perfect in every respect. Over the past twelve months, serious allegations have been made about waste in connection with the Colombo plan. When those allegations were made, the Minister for Exterreplying to them. He outlined, in a sketchy sort of way, the details of achievements under the Colombo plan. I thought that he would have made a categorical denial of the allegations because there are too many persons in Australia who want to snipe at the plan. The Minister should have justified the expenditure on it by saying what had been done in relation to specific activities about which the allegations were made. In the past six or eight months, Mr R. E. G. Cunningham, a sheep and cattle station manager who had worked for four years in Pakistan on behalf of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, returned to Australia from Pakistan alleging that Australia had wasted millions of pounds on impractical Colombo plan aid to Pakistan. He said that 50 water pumps of the wrong type and two complete artificial insemination units had never been used. He also said that 215 tractors too big to be used on Pakistan farms were going rusty in the fields. And so on! All the Minister for External Affairs had to say in reply to that was that the true story was very different from that given by Mr Cunningham. He made no further comment. I looked in vain for a report in the press of a refutation by the Minister of Mr Cunningham's allegations, claiming that Mr Cunningham's allegations were either incorrect or exaggerated, but nothing appeared. I think it is most unpalatable for people who support the Colombo plan to find that either such allegations are not shown to be incorrect or that, if they are not denied, no apparent action is taken to correct the situation which produced them. The allegations made should not have been answered in any general fashion. They should have been answered categorically. So far as I know, that was not done. I regret that the allegations were not answered in detail, because I support the Colombo plan, and I say that if there has been waste we should attempt to correct the position. I had a conversation with some members of this Parliament who attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in New Delhi some months ago. They told me that during their travels in India and Pakistan they saw tangible evidence of serious waste in connection with the Colombo plan. They said that they saw, rusting away in many fields, tractors such as those mentioned by Mr Cunningham. They told me that in many instances blades had been taken from tractors and threshing machines, the remainder of the machines being left completely unused to rust away for possibly the next fifteen or twenty years. undeveloped countries of Asia may be, it These facts are to be deplored. The Government should recognize that the plan has not proved to be 100 per cent, efficient, and should act accordingly. Admittedly, the human element has to be contended in some of the South and South-East Asian with in connection with plans such as the countries. Modern discoveries in health and Colombo plan. The plain fact is that many surgery, particularly those which have preof the people in the undeveloped countries vented the epidemics that used to sweep of Asia have no proper appreciation of the like wildfire through Eastern countries, have worth of and the use and maintenance of let to a record increase in the populations machinery.

We are told by those hope the Government will make an effort who ought to know that the population of to see that action will be taken to prevent Asian countries will double itself by the end waste under the Colombo plan and to make of this century, so it is obvious that the the plan efficient so that it will provide the governments of those countries have a greatest possible tangible benefits to all herculean task ahead of them. concerned with it. I am sorry that the allocation for the between us and the massive populations of plan is to be reduced instead of being inSouth and South-East Asia we have to do creased, as I think it should be. I make no all we can to assist them. I say that taking apologies for that statement. I think that £1,000,000 off the grant this year will not in the present conditions in Asia the have this effect. The problem of all the Colombo plan and international relief efforts Western countries is that every one of us generally must be expanded by the Western must make the greatest possible effort to world. Every effort must be made by help the Eastern countries, whatever the Western countries, including Australia, to physical cost of doing so may be to ouradjust the economic standards of Asian selves. Professor Copland said recently countries to modern techniques. This that for the next five years the Western would not only elevate the prestige of the countries should devote one-half of one Western world in those countries but would per cent, of their national incomes to also improve the standards of the countries assistance for South and South-East Asian concerned. Raising our prestige in Asia is countries. That suggestion should be conof incalculable benefit to us, and will sidered very seriously. possibly be of even greater benefit to us in the years that lie ahead. If we were to increase our economic aid there will not be the smug complacency to Asian countries we would provide an that we have seen emanating from Colombo enduring basis for the expansion of the plan conferences of the past. Every twelve world economy at a rate which must benefit months a conference of the Colombo plan both the contributors and the recipients of countries is held in the Pacific area. I think aid. In other words, for every million that the next conference will be held in the pounds we put into schemes for aid to Asia we will receive in return cash dividends quite apart from receiving the benefit of the goodwill for ourselves that we engender in the countries we assist. The Government should take cognizance of this fact. I say that whatever the cost of aid directed towards the economic development of the will be far outweighed by the political and economic advantages we shall derive as a result of giving it. We are reaching a very dangerous state If we wish to develop mutual respect The Colombo plan is to be reviewed in 1959. I hope that when it is reviewed United States of America. After each conference we are issued with a very comprehensive report which states, in effect, that in the main everything is going well with the plan. I would say that in the present circumstances that is not the case because, as I said before, we have had examples of machinery allowed to lie rusting in the fields. We have not spent in eight years the £32,500,000 that we were supposed to spend on the plan in seven years. In fact, we have not yet spent £27,500,000 on the plan. I cannot see that the Colombo plan has been successful so far as Australia is concerned. honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) seems to harbour a number of illusions about our capacity to assist South and South-East Asian countries under the Colombo plan. Broadly, at a time when our overseas funds arc falling fast and are likely to fall very much further in the next year, it is quite an illusion to imagine that we looked. I am sure that we, on this side can, by throwing in economic aid to South and South-East Asia, either win very many friends or influence people. The United States has already been to some extent disillusioned on that score. That, Sir, is of course no reason for failing to proceed with Colombo plan aid. The basic point is that the aid that Australia can give to Colombo plan countries generally amounts, in broad economic terms, to a negligible amount in comparison with the magnitude of the problems of those countries. But do not let us imagine that the West is doing nothing about this. In fact, the amount of foreign aid, in one form or another, going into the area has shown a tendency to increase. The United States has given very large sums to various countries in the area, and in recent months lending by the International Bank to eastern countries has also been stepped up. In regard to our own contribution the honourable member for Batman criticized underspending. Any one who has had anything to do with programming foreign aid knows that it is extremely difncult to forecast what expenditure will be required. The Colombo plan itself operates on the basis of requests from the recipient countries, and the rate at which they will be received cannot be predicted. Neither can we predict the extent to which particular demands can be met. So it is reasonable to expect that any forecast of Colombo plan spending may fall quite wide of the mark. However, the change provided for in the Estimates is surely a very sensible one. There is to be a not very appreciable reduction of the amount of economic aid, but there is to be an increase in the provision of technical assistance. It is in technical assistance that our biggest contribution can be made. Of course, the honourable member for Batman wishes to increase it, but it is a fact that our own universities and technical training facilities of the kind required for this purpose are already taxed to capacity. We, ourselves, are up against lack of facilities and finance for the training of our own people. When I last inquired, I found that 4,000 Asian students were being trained in this country which is a very big effort on the part of Australia in view of our somewhat limited facilities. The big contribution that we are already making should not be overof the chamber, will support any further reasonable increase in the technical assistance programme because we can make a much more effective contribution to these countries both in goodwill and, eventually, in effective economic development by training rather than by direct aid. It has been stated that there has been a certain waste of capital equipment supplied to some of the recipient countries. This is only natural. These countries have not highly developed administrations as we have, and our own public spending is by no means wholly devoid of waste. But we should not be misled by reports which are bound to come in from time to time that particular items of equipment that have been supplied have been wasted. The honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin), who is entitled, by virtue of his experience, to a very respectful hearing on these matters, referred to the constant absence from this chamber of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey). He should know that under modern conditions that is quite inevitable. member for Bonython forgets that when he was playing Box and Cox with the right",28,Estimates 1958 59

73,Mr Makin,I said that.,31,Estimates 1958 59
74,Mr Bury,"Yes. But the honorablehonorable member for Barton, then Minister for External Affairs, he was at the time a senior member of the Cabinet. Any one who, even for a short time, is responsible for the conduct of our external affairs, whether at home or overseas, must be a senior Cabinet Minister because only a man in that position can properly speak for Australia and give the necessary day-to-day instructions to the department. This problem is largely overcome by the present acting Minister for External Affairs( Sir Philip McBride), who is well versed in these matters. He has acted as Minister for External Affairs on many occasions, and is well able to keep abreast of events. Unfortunately, the solution which the United Kingdom has reached of having a separate minister to go to the United Nations is not practicable here because, within our external affairs framework, constitutionally we can only have one Minister. The honourable member for Bonython also raised the question of allowances. It is curious that there is quite a variation in the basic salaries of our overseas representatives. I realize that salaries are only occasions, has to act for the ambassador part of the remuneration and that the allowances which vary from post to post, have no bearing on salaries. But, it is curious, for instance, that the salary listed for the High Commissioner in Pakistan is £300 more than the salary listed for the High Commissioner in India; and that the salary for our representative at the United Nations is apparently £100 per annum more than the salary for the Ambassador to the US. The Ambassador to Japan wins out in this round. He receives a salary which is about £500 higher than the salary of the ambassador in Washington. I suggest that this is rather a curious feature of the salaries of these gentlemen. No doubt, in some places, it could be taken as a measure of their relative importance. As I have said, allowances vary enormously. The Australian ambassador to Washington, in the aggregate, would undoubtedly draw much more than any of our other ambassadors. That is largely because of expenses. There is also the tax factor. It is curious, however, that there should be such apparent anomalies in the salaries of ambassadors. The Public Service mind is much concerned with these odd hundreds of pounds differences, because they do in some curious way denote prestige. I should like to say a word or two about accommodation of overseas personnel, i believe that this may be a more important question than their allowances, because we already have machinery within the Public Service Board for fixing allowances. The Public Service Board has experienced officers who travel around, assess the situation and, insofar as they can assess proper allowances, this is already done. It is true that many countries pay their representatives more than we do but others pay less. If there is some scope for reform in this field it would be through a getting together of various authorities in like-minded countries who fix these allowances to compare notes and experience because in practice there is considerable competition between one embassy and another. With regard to the accommodation of personnel, we do, in most important posts, at least, provide a house for the ambassador. But there are a number of places where members of the ambassador's staff do find life extremely difficult. For instance, the counsellor in Washington, on many who is frequently an itinerant, visiting other parts of the country, say New York or the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Therefore, in many cases the counsellor has to bear a very considerable burden of representation and entertainment. In mentioning the Mardi GrasI did not have in mind particularly the honourable member for Bonython, but certainly some other ambassadors, in the course of their duties, have found their way to that delectable spot. The counsellor in Washington has had, at times, a very difncult role to fulfil in adequately representing us. In any case, throughout many of our posts we pay considerable allowances for housing purchases and the position of many of our officers is made extraordinarily awkward because of the lack of housing and the inadequacy of the rent allowances in some cases, although they are excessive in other cases. But we need to adopt a long-term policy of providing adequate accommodation befitting the status of the officers in the various overseas posts. We have made some progress in the Asian countries in this respect because circumstances have compelled us to do so. But we should look around a number of other posts. Our ambassador to the United Nations, for instance, who is one of our most important functionaries these days, still has no permanent accommodation. When a new ambassador is appointed he has to spend his first few weeks in New York searching for accommodation. While a man and his family are not properly accommodated, or are in temporary premises, it is extremely difficult for him to function effectively and keep his mind on the job and do the measure of entertainresentative or ambassador from this ment that should be done. I suggest, therecountry should bear letters of credence fore, that an early priority should be given addressed to ""The President of the to the provision of a residence for our ambassador to the United Nations. In the long run, this would be very much cheaper for the Commonwealth than paying heavy rent subsidies. There is also a very curious position in the Estimates with which we are conSouth Africa, where the Government is cerned, that the department intends that it administered from Pretoria but the Parliapersist throughout the present financial ment meets in Capetown.

This is all the more remarkable when we consider that Australia, at least until recent years, was developed by the joint labours of people who had come, or whose ancestors had come, from all parts of the British Isles, not only from England, Wales, or Scotland, but also from Ireland. Yet we persist in this grossly disproportionate and, I should think, insulting representation in Ireland! The reason for it is that the Government insists that any repRepublic of Ireland"" whereas the government of that country insists that any ambassador from this country should bear letters addressed to ""The President of Ireland"".

77,Mr Whitlam,"I inform the honoranswer which the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) gave to me as far back as llt h October, 1956. When our Queen succeeded her late father, the then Irish Ambassador presented letters of credence to the Governor General which were signed by the President of Ireland and the Governor General accepted them. We, however, persisted in sending a new ambassador to Ireland with letters addressed to the President of the Republic of Ireland. I suppose if anybody were going to be sensitive on this point, it should be the United Kingdom. Our Government takes its stand on the ground that if one refers to "" Ireland"" it is to the whole island of Ireland and that this would give comfort to the claim of the republic that the north-eastern provinces should be included within the republic, instead of within the United Kingdom. But the United Kingdom shows no sensitiveness on this point because, as emerges from another portion of the Minister's reply to me, the United Kingdom addresses letters of credence to President O'Kelly, that is, to the President of Ireland by name. It appears, further, from the Minister's reply that our sister kingdom of Canada sends letters of credence addressed to "" The President of Ireland "". We are being more sensitive and stubborn than the United Kingdom, which is directly concerned. We appear to be more solicitous for the feelings of the United Kingdom in the matter than is the kingdom of Canada, which, of course, owes as much, proportionately, to Irish settlers as does Australia. It seems that as long as the present Australian Government is in office it will persist in this unilateral Diece of stubbornness-thi s spontaneous affront to the Irish Government and this deterrent to Irish re-entry to our Commonwealth of Nations. In answer to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) on 27th September. 1956, the Prime Minister( Mr of association with international problems, Menzies) saidWe have taken a view to which we adhere very strongly, and we are not prepared to abandon it in order to satisfy the honourable member for West Sydney-wit h very great respect to him. So long as the difference remains, there will be no appointment. When the difference disappears, an appointment will be made. That is apparently where the matter is to remain throughout this financial year unless there is a change of government on 22nd November. Let me summarize. The United Kingdom does not insist jpon its representative to Ireland present) ig letters of credence addressed in the way we insist. Canada does not insist upon it. We ourselves accepted letters of credence from an Irish ambassador whose President signed himself in the way which we now reject. It is an unnecessary affront to one of the countries whose history we so largely inherit that we continue to make no provision in the Estimates for proper representation in Ireland. Although it is well known that Ireland is anxious to re-establish full mutual representation with Australia, our embassy in Ireland is the one for which we make by far the smallest provision. Department of External Affairs is involved in discharging in the world to-day the most important and vital work of any government department. The Department of External Affairs makes Australia's contribution towards the settlement of disputes and disorder that might lead to war in various parts of the world. With regard to the discharge of those responsibilities, I take it that two fairly distinct groups of people are involved. First of all there is the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the right honourable the Minister for External Affairs, and the supporters of the Government, who, one would expect, might generally have less knowledge, and a less systematic and less complete opportunity to study the questions upon which policy depend. On the other hand are the members of the Department of External Affairs, here and abroad, whose full-time profession it is to provide the Government with an array of facts and information upon which its decisions might be based. With regard to the first group of people, we have a Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) who has had a long background and whose name and repute are well known in many parts of the world. We have a Prime Minister who, in the Australian constitutional situation, and in practice, has from time to time been the de facto Minister for External Affairs, and very particularly so in important matters like the Suez crisis, where, it seems to me on the evidence, the decisions made by Australia were made by the Prime Minister without much reference even to the Minister for",33,Estimates 1958 59
78,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [4.55],"Th eExternal Affairs, and considerably less reference to departmental officers. Then we have, it would seem to me, in the positions of greatest influence among the Government supporters, people, without naming them, whose views are most reactionary and whose statements are most unobjective. In view of those circumstances what kind of relationship exists between the Government, or its influential spokesmen, many of whom take a most narrow and reactionary view of external affairs, and the departmental officials concerned? It would be strange indeed if those departmental ofncials were to oppose those reactionary and unobjective views of the persons to whom I have referred, bearing in mind the fact that many people are of the opinion that the present Government will remain in office for a long time to come. In view of the need for a more objective and rounded examination of the problems confronting us. it seems to me that Australia may well be under-supplied with objective material and objective analyses of the interat any time during 1957. In view of those national problems with which we have to deal. officers of the Department of External Affairs. member for Barker that one must be a little realistic. We are living in a hard world and I know from long experience, although the honourable member may not, that officers of departments do sense the direction and nature of the wind and are influenced by it. I do not want to live in a fairy-like world, and I advise the honourable member to consider the possibilities of my suggestion. A perusal of the facts might prove enlightening. I invite the committee to study several circumstances that have arisen in recent times. The question before us is: Are we getting, departmentally and otherwise, a sufficiently objective, sufficiently careful, analysis of the vital facts upon which the future of the world may well depend? In order to illustrate the question and enable us to answer it, let me first refer One assumption was that President Nasser the committee to the subject of nuclear weapons and the testing of them. For some time last year in questions in Parliament, in correspondence with the Minister, and in private conversations with the MinisterI discussed the state of scientific opinion with certain course of action-that is, the landing regard to the policing of nuclear tests. I pointed out in those questions, and in the correspondence, that there was a strong suggestion that the decisions being made with regard to those tests were influenced more by the political implications of the decisions than by the nature of the tests. In the last sessional period in particular I dealt with the decision that had been made by the United States Atomic Energy Commission that it was not possible to detect certain tests over any more than a very narrow range. The Minister repeated to me the kind of scientific opinion that I knew from my own inquiries amongst scientists in Australia to be outmoded. Indeed, there was a strong suggestion that it was known to be outmoded. So, when the matter was discussed at the conference at Geneva, I was not surprised when the scientists of all sides assembled there reported that it was possible to set up a system to detect tests adequately, a situation which, according to the opinion that I had been able to obtain, was possible facts, what sort of information did the Minister for External Affairs and the department have, because as far as I am aware there are no nuclear scientists in the department? Just what sort of information did the Minister have, and were the Minister and the department accurately informed that a scientific opinion was held by people of first-class repute that the situation was different from that which was represented to the Government by perhaps its accepted scientific advisers, whoever they might have been? Now, apparently, there is no great difficulty in this field. I cite this example to show the extreme difficulties associated with scientific advice. I realize those difficulties, but I want to move on to other topics. I should like to direct the attention of the committee to the Suez Canal crisis. It would appear that the decisions arrived at by the Australian authorities were made on several assumptions-and I am not sure whether the Minister for External Affairs had much to do with the matter at all. of Egypt was extremely insecurely placed in Egypt and that very little in the way of intervention would be required to dislodge him from office. The British Foreign Office had strong evidence to the contrary, but a",34,Estimates 1958 59
79,Mr Forbes,This is a reflection on the,35,Estimates 1958 59
80,Mr Cairns,"I remind the honorableof troops in Egypt-wa s adopted. That action was consistent only with the assumption that all that would have to be done would be to take action of this sort and Nasser would be swept from power. The second assumption that seemed to be underlying the intervention was that the Egyptians would not be able to operate the Suez Canal if they were left with the responsibilities themselves and that either the canal would cease to function and world trade flowing through it would be cut off or the Egyptians would deliberately block and destroy the canal. It seemed to quite a number of observers at the time that neither of these assumptions was justified. A letter in the London"" Times"" from a former naval commander reported how he and many others who had no experience of navigation in the canal had from time to time been able to take vessels through under all circumstances. The assumption that the Egyptians could not do this was coloured more by a feeling of the superiority of whites and the inferiority of Egyptians than by an examination of the actual circumstances. I want to know whether it is possible to find outI do not think it is, because the Government never worries about answering any of these questions-ho w much our own decisions are influenced by such ideas. Of course, we know that the action taken in Suez was completely unsuccessful and that the decision to take such action was based upon wrong information. So much for Suez. I turn now to the question of the more recent'policy in regard to Lebanon and Iraq. Here, evidence is now accumulating that the Western Powers accepted two assumptions. I am suggesting that in the case of Suez they under-estimated Nasser. I am suggesting in the present situation that the Western Powers greatly over-estimated Nasser, and that they greatly over-estimated the strength and influence of communism in the Middle East. As a result, the Western Powers concluded that the problems in Lebanon and in Iraq were predominantly caused by influences from outside. They believed that, if they could land troops, the internal situation would not provide any obstruction or any difficulty with regard to those troops, and that by the use of the troops, the external influences would be neutralized. I am suggesting that, first, the external influences were greatly over-estimated, and, secondly, the internal situation was not one in which a strongly pro-Nasser or even Pan-Arab influence was at work. Certainly, a strong Communist influence was not at work. I believe that these ideas fall upon ready ears in certain places in this Parliament, because people here have a motive to play up and overemphasize the significance of communism and of threats to peace that are represented by such things as Arab nationalism. After having gone to the trouble of landing troops in Lebanon and in Iraq, it is found that the internal situation in both countries is not one with which it is impossible for us to deal. The Iraqi revolt which overthrew Nuri el Said, whom the Minister for External Affairs claims as a friend, installed a government which we were ready to recognize. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lawrence) -M3rder! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) came to this Parliament commanding something in the nature of a reputation as a lecturer. I am bound to say, Sir, that he will leave this Parliament with his reputation as a lecturer enhanced in one sense but shattered in another. For the last fifteen minutes, he has lectured the Parliament on external affairs and intimated to those of us who sit on this side of the chamber that we are, first, reactionary if we do not completely agree with his views. Secondly, he suggested strongly that we are not objective if we do not display the same affection for doctrinaire leftism as he has amply portrayed since he has been in the Parliament. He told the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes); who interjected with characteristic courtesy, that he was unrealistic and that he, the honourable member for Yarra, was the only realistic person in this place. Then, in a slighting fashion, he turned upon the officers of the Department of External Affairs and questioned whether they were keeping themselves abreast of what was happening. He then turned to the members of the Parliament and wondered whether they were being completely objective. Sir, what an inglorious display of humbug! We know precisely where the sympathies of the honourable member for Yarra lie. His",35,Estimates 1958 59
81,Mr Killen (Moreton) [5.10],"Th eattempts to disguise them are of no avail. He sneered at members of this Parliament and said, "" I need not bother to mention any names "". IfI had asked whether he referred to the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and to me, he would have said, with the snappy wit that he commands, "" Of course, if the cap fits, wear it "" . That is the trait that he has displayed since he has been in this Parliament. This afternoon he gave a miserable exhibition. He did not have the courage of his convictions to indicate to the Parliaby the honourable member for Yarra. That ment whom he had in mind. That is typical of the honourable member for Yarra. An interpretation that one is entitled to place upon the honourable member's remarks is that he questioned whether members of the Parliament-undoubtedl y those on this side of the House-ha d any right to consider international affairs. Apparently, he is the repository of all that is right and all member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent that is proper and accurate in determining international affairs and in deciding what constitutes good sense and what constitutes arrant humbug. I must say that those of us who make some effort to examine these issues objectively come to conclusions slightly different from those of the honourable member for Yarra. For instance, he alleged on one occasion that I improperly understood the doctrines of Marxism and Leninism. Why did I misunderstand them, according to the honourable member for Yarra? The answer is to be found in the simple fact that I do not have the same affection for the doctrines of Marxism and Leninism as the honourable member for Yarra has, and so I have misunderstood them. The honourable member turned to the matter of nuclear tests and the Geneva conference. To the best of my knowledge, no report has been released by the convocation of scientists on the matter of the detecKillen). It would not be necessary for me tion of nuclear tests. There certainly have been some press reports, but where, may I ask the honourable gentleman, has he secured this information that there exists a report which discloses quite clearly and completely that the detection of nuclear tests is pracordered thinking that makes me apprehenticable? Some of us on this side of the chamber have, in the course of the last eighteen months or so, made a genuine and sincere endeavour to find out some facts concerning nuclear weapons and the nuclear age. We have been advised, Sir, by quite F.4939/58 -R. -[29] respectable authority, that the detection of nuclear tests is extremely difficult and complex. But not according to the honourable member for Yarra! It is a matter that can be settled, he has been informed. By whom has he been informed? Is it an unbecoming display of modesty that prevents him from disclosing who has informed him? What is the source of his information? I rose this afternoon, Sir, to make a few fleeting references to the nonsensical arguments that were put forward this afternoon was my prime purpose, but I can assure Opposition members that I do not propose to sit down without making a constructive contribution of my own by supporting the attitude towards the establishment of a diplomatic post in Formosa that has been voiced by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) and the honourable and gallant Hughes). I believe, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it is of the essence of urgency that Australia should command a listening post in Formosa to enable us to find out what is going on there, and also to indicate to the Chinese Nationalists that we are not unsympathetic to their cause. There are many people, including all Opposition members, who consider that red China should be recognized. That is a matter about which there can be legitimate differences of opinion, but I for one see nothing to be gained by recognizing red China at the present time. I believe that there would be immense and intense disadvantages in such a course, and I lend my voice in support of the attitude adopted by the two honourable gentlemen whom I have mentioned. pleased to have an opportunity to follow the honourable member for Moreton( Mr to deal with his remarks if the views that he has expressed were not influential among Government supporters.

We now have before us the estimates of expenditure for the operations of the Department of External Affairs for the current financial year, and the way in which the department is functioning is closely relevant to the consideration of those estimates. I am asking: To what extent is the department acquainted with the social and economic facts of the situation in the Middle Eastern countries? To what extent is it aware of the relationship of the external trade of the countries of the Middle East to their social and economic problems? At this juncture, I should like to refer the committee to an extract from a recent publication, "" Red Mirage"", written by John O'Kearney, who, at page 60, referring to Syria, which he has taken as an example, statesThis politico-economic evolution going on within Syria was better understood by James Madison when America was still revolutionary, than it is by Dulles. . . . AndI suggest that it was better understood by William Charles Wentworth the First than by William Charles Wentworth the Third or Fourth, for example. The author adds"" A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,"" said Madison, ""grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentitheir presence can create outside this ments and views."" 1 think that William Charles Wentworth was perfectly well aware of that situation. The author then goes on to sayBut let there be a movement in Syria against feudalism and the figure of a George III., for land and tax reforms, for equal rights and federal union, and the Tory-minded Secretary of State reacts by throwing arms and millions in aid to kings of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi-Arabia. At the same time he frankly expressed the hope that pro-Western elements in Syria, who stand for everything to the contrary, might rise in force and take over. WhatI am suggesting is that as far as one can judge from the ""evidence submitted to this Parliament, in statements made by the Minister and by lesser lights on the Government side, the Australian Government is completely uninformed on those matters mentioned by the author of this book. It does not appreciate the significance of these transitions taking place in Middle Eastern countries with which the Western powers not often do I appeal to the Chair on the could constructively co-operate, and it does not face up to the more difficult and complex problem of working out a way of co-operating with these movements. It is not we on this side who over-simplify these problems; it is the Government and its supporters who do so. They oversimplify them according to the issue of communism and anti-communism, Nasserism and anti-Nasserism, instead of tackling the much more difficult job of discovering what the facts are, and of attempting to work out a solution which is not in any way a simple one. I do not admit the charge of attempting to over-simplify these problems. I do not admit to doing anything more than attempting to put a few constructive suggestions for the consideration of this committee. I do not pretend that anything I say will solve these problems. I do not pretend to know a solution in total. But I have been elected to this Parliament, as I understand it, with a responsibility to submit to the Parliament, as best I can, some practical suggestions for the solution of important and vital problems, and when my remarks are met with nothing but the cynical and distorted interpretation that has been given them by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), then I feel that such honourable members are here for nothing but the political effect that House, and not to assist in any way in the solution of these vital problems. I believe that those more serious members of the Parliament who have done me the honour of listening to what I have had to say will adopt an attitude vastly different from that of the honourable member for Moreton. Sir WILFRI D KEN T HUGHES (Chisholm) [5.29] I am rather surprised to hear the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) accuse honourable members on this side of the House of lack of knowledge, of failure to put forward the facts on which their case is based, and of personal criticism, because the honourable member won his last election by plastering all over his electorate a picture of his opponent in the form of a rat.",38,Estimates 1958 59

When I was in Singapore, I could not decide whether I was crazy or an undercover Communist, upon finding that the red banks of China are allowed by us to operate freely without let or hindrance. I do not know why we spend millions of pounds on the emergency operations in driving Communists out through the front door, when, through the red banks of China, the head-quarters for blackmail, infiltration, subversion, and the financing of phoney peace fronts, we leave the back door and the side door wide open. There are many ways in which, I believe, Australia can do a lot more than she is doing at present to help the democratic peoples in South-East Asia. Malaya has just gained its independence, at a time when the prices of her main products on which she depends, mainly tin and rubber, have fallen to rock bottom. Forty-six per cent, of its civil servants, the old Malay civil servants, are moving out within the next twelve months. I do not blame them for going. They cannot afford not to go, in view of the pensions and the financial provisions which are made for them. But on the other hand, I think we might do a lot more to assist that country which has, in the next three or five years, to recruit pracmuch about, he or she should be flown out, tically 50 per cent, of its civil service. One can go to South Viet Nam and have a look at the courageous struggle for existence that is going on there. We pride ourselves on our soldier settlements, and rightly so, but in South Viet Nam, in the high plateau areas, you will find, in what was virgin jungle a year ago, a complete community of 2,500 people with one hectare of vegetable land for each family, and another four hectares cleared, so that each household will have five hectares of land to till. That was only one resettlement area which I myself saw. I want also to join with the honourable member for Lilley in his criticism of the attitude of the Treasury towards our representatives in those countries. It is not easy for seven Australians to work, in the tropics, in a room 10 feet by 15 feet, or very little larger, inside a residency. I know that that position has been altered, but it never should have existed. I was told when I came back and complained about it that this legation was one of the worse examples of the accommodation we had overseas. Saigon. I understand that they now have decent quarters in an air-conditioned building. With the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Lilley, I feel that not only officers of the Department of the Treasury but also members of this Parliament should take a bit more interest in our own Australian representatives who are working in the outposts of this nation. It is sometimes said, "" Oh, well, they go out to this, that or the other party or entertainment"". A certain amount of social activities are associated with these posts. I know that that is so, but on the other hand long service in the tropics is not easy from a health point of view, and I feel that a great deal more could be done by having a sort of peregrinating medical officer who would see that our officers and their families are submitted to a proper and thorough examination every six months, and that if any one is suffering from amoebic dysentery, malaria, or anything of that nature which those of us who have been there for some time know all too as the Americans fly out their civil servants, until he is completely cured. He should then have a holiday before going back. In that direction a lot of things can be done. I am afraid that those members of the Australian Labour party who do not believe that, as the Communists have told us, co-existence is the Communist method of conquest without war, and who think that by holding out the hand of appeasement they are going to help either the democratic peoples of South-East Asia, or the future of Australia, are in for a very big surprise in a very short space of time. I have said before in this chamber, and I say again, that I believe that at the present time this country is in the greatest danger that it has ever faced in the whole of its history. We have to make up our minds that this method of dealing with crises on an hour-to-hour, a day-to-day, or a monthto-month basis, is not of much use.

The destiny of Australia is bound up very largely with the destiny of South-East Asia. I think it will be found that the history of the world for the next 50 years will be determined by what happens in South-East Asia, Southern Asia, and the Western Pacific. It is an exciting and challenging era and region in which to live. It is no good thinking that we can go on as we did before World War II . , leaving it to other people to take responsibilities which now rightly rest on our own shoulders. If the honourable member for Yarra and those who think as he does are apprehensive about the future of this country, they had better very rapidly change their policy of appeasement towards the Communists. failing. May I remind the honourable member of what Khrushchev told the United States senators on 15th September, 1955. He said, "" We are much more interested in the political aspect of trade than in the economic "". Aid and trade is the Communist weapon of annihilation, not the nuclear bomb. It is a much more dangerous weapon, because it is not so easily seen and understood. I know that the honourable member for Yarra does not agree with this, but I am telling him my point of view, and he should listen without interrupting, as I listened to him. Looking at the world to-day, I think that most critics will agree that the Communists went through, first, a period of force and fraud, which won them the European satellite*;, North Korea, mainland China, and North Viet Nam. They then thought that it was getting a bit dangerous, and they switched to the ideological phase, and they were winning people like the honourable member for Yarra and others, until the revolution happened in Hungary. Since then they have turned to the third phase of world conquest, the most difficult and dangerous one of them all, in which, as I said, aid and trade is the weapon of annihilation. It is not easy. It has a lot of ramifications, and I have not the time to go into it here. I want merely to point out those three salient points and to tell the honourable member for Yarra that if he likes to hand it out the way he has done in the past, he has to learn to take it.

In opening the debate for the Opposition pn the proposed vote for the Department of the TreasuryI should like to ask the Government a few questions about a matter that is of great importance to the people of Australia-the public debt of this country and the closely allied subject of loan raisings either from members of the public direct, as individuals, or indirectly through companies or financial institutions.

That problem is Holt, R. W. what he calls the "" problem of debt conJohnson, L. R. version in Australia"". The fact that he pointed to it in the Budget speech in each Makin, N . J.

In other words, there is a distinction in the document between three kinds of public debt-short-ter m securities, medium-term securities and long-term securities. And, of course, there is a type of security which might be embraced under the heading "" short-term security"", but is not specifically mentioned as such. I refer to treasury-bills. But at least most of the conversions this year-and this was also the case in the two previous years-hav e been for terms of either one year or two years. Therefore, what is a conversion problem in 1958 becomes, insofar as it is dealt with in a short-term form, also a problem of conversion in 1959 and 1960.",42,Estimates 1958 59
105,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [8.0],"It is rather difficult to find out whether consciously and deliberately, or otherwise, the Government is endeavouring to convert the public debt in Australia to a short-term basis rather than a long-term basis. In some other countries, of which the United States of America is a good example, the tendency is to have the public debt held in short-term form rather than long-term form. There are many advantages in this kind of finance; but there are not many advantages in it if the short-term rate becomes very close to the long-term rate of interest. If honourable members will examine the follow because there is not a frank enough financing of the recent short-term loan exposure of where this Government is going market in Australia they will find that in relation to the public debt. there is very little difference, so far as interest yield is concerned, between buying Government securities with a currency of debated, but I read the Budget Speech of two years and those with a currency of ten the Treasurer.

Because of the penditure which is being undertaken by existence of such circumstances it is not treasury-bills, the reason for deficit finance surprising that the majority of subscriptions in Australia to-day is the failure of the loan to public loans to-day are flowing to the market at the level of individual investment. short-term end of the market rather than the long-term end. There are several aspects to this question financial result of the operations of the of the public debt which are, I think, worthy Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited of serious examination by the committee. in Australia during the last twelve months. One concerns how much of the interest One of the significant things about the pubtransactions connected with the public debt lished statement of that company was that are merely a transfer, as it were, from the whereas at the end of June, 1957, this conright-hand pocket of government activity cern had about £1,000,000 invested in go to the left-hand pocket of government vernment securities of the Commonwealth activity; because if an examination is made of Australia, at the end of June, 1958, it of the vast amount of public debt in AustraliaI think it is approaching the astronomical figure of £4,000,000,000 in total -it is surprising how much of this is not held directly or individually, but is held by government agencies of one kind or another, such as trust funds, the reserve for the note issue, and so on. In fact, if you calculate the total interest component of the debt you find that a large proportion of this is collected as interest and then simply paid over to those various trust funds which hold it. The result is that annually the financial picture of government in Australia is getting more and more difficult to I was not here when the Budget was being expects that about I read, when coming here the other day on a plane from San Francisco, the fantastic had £12,000,000 invested in such securities. IfI may hazard a guess, I would suggest that most of that increment of £11,000-000 in the period of twelve months went into short-term government securities issued by the Government in that twelve months. That is part of the great conversion problem that the Treasurer faces during the current financial year. For a short-term investment in gilt-edged securities, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited can get almost 5 per cent, interest, or nearly £600,000, at the expense of the rest of the Australian community. In my view, there is no reason why shortterm government loans ought to bear interest at much more than 2 per cent. But, because of the failure of this Government to pursue a sound financial policy, the interest rate has been pushed up almost to 5 per cent. Another question which I think is worthy of examination and of a much more adequate explanation by the Treasurer is why, on 18th February, 1958, a conversion at 6 per cent, took place in London of a loan of £16,000,000 sterling or £20,000,000 Australian, which was formerly vernment use the Commonwealth Bank? held at 3 per cent. Details are contained at page 118 of the Budget Papers for 1958-59.

First of all, I should like to suggest that the impression which the Opposition has given to the community is that the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility in relation to hire purchase, and that it has power to deal with the problems which arise in relation to it. I feel, therefore, that one should endeavour to put the record straight. It may be that, in war-time, this Parliament does have authority to deal with hire purchase, whether in relation to rates of interest paid on money which the companies borrow or, perhaps, in relation to the interest which the companies charge. But, by and large, we must consider our situation in peace-time. At the moment, I believe that the legal opinion in relation to hire purchase is that the only power which the Commonwealth has to control interest is the banking power and that hire-purchase business, as it is conducted at the present time, cannot be regarded as coming within the terms of banking business. Bank's responsibility relates to the rates of interest banks can charge on overdraft and Therefore, obviously, if the Commonlation dealing with minimum deposits, with States, with the period for which goods repossessed must be held before they can In New South Wales, the Labour govern-",43,Pairs

SoI think that we should accept for all sufficient free competition among thefinancecomtime that, at the present moment, the Companies monwealth Government has no responcharges. sibility and no power to deal with the questions either of interest paid by the companies or the interest charged by the companies. Of course, the Commonwealth has realized the position and has asked for a conference of the States, but that request has been rejected. The Queensland Government, which is now a Country-Liberal party government, has realized the problem that exists in this connection. The Labour government which held office in that State for over twenty years did nothing about it. but the present Government has decided to That is, this situation of the per annum appoint a special investigator to inquire into interest rate as against flat ratematters relating to hire purchase and particularly the interest which is paid by the it could be laid down that the added charges companies on moneys which they borrow. on the unpaid balance shall not exceed rates as When that information is available, the may be specified. Suggested rates for this purQueensland Government intends to call or pose would beask for a conference of all State governments, and I believe that already there has been a clear indication that other State governments are prepared to come and discuss the matter. The first of the two principal points, apart objection to interest rates which varied, on from whether we have power or not. which a per annum basis, between 15 per cent, and the Labour party raises in relation to this, 20 per cent. If we look at the situation is the high interest rate earned by the comto-day we find that the legislation introduced panies and the high interest rate which they by the New South Wales Government pay in relation to the money which they follows very closely these interest perborrow. The second one is the criticism centages which were being charged in 1941. that the trading banks have entered the hireI feel that under these circumstances there purchase field. I should like to say one or is little or no justification for the criticisms two things about these aspects. In the first place, in relation to the high earning capacity, there are two factors. The first is the rate of interest which was this high earning capacity, that is, the basis referred to by a special board of inquiry of operation of these particular companies. appointed by the Treasurer of the day, SirI want to give the committee as simple an The finance charges as set out in paragraph 77 are not unreasonable and there appears TO be to act as a brake on excessive charges. There was some evidence of occasional higher If we turn to paragraph 77, we discover that the interest charges at this particular time varied between 5.6 per cent, and 10 per cent. Those were the rates which Mr. Chifley agreed were reasonable in relation to hire purchase. Of course, some people will say that they are flat rates. I appreciate that; and the board of inquiry dealt with that aspect, l n paragraph 135 of the report we readTo meet this expressed as a true rate of interest per annum Furniture and wireless sets-2 0 per cent. Motor vehicles, used-1 6 per cent. Other goods, wares and merchandise-1 5 per cent. This shows that Mr Chifley and his fellow members of that board of inquiry had no which emanate from the Labour party in relation to this particular matter. I should like to examine another aspect of illustration as possible, dealing with approxirepresented by deposits in the banks made mations because that is the easiest way in which it can be made useful to honourable members. If we accept that, before paying income tax on the funds which it uses for hire purchase, a company makes 12 per cent., we expect that company income tax takes approximately one-third, which leaves 8 per cent, in the shareholders' hands, where the amount is only the actual paid-up capital. But if, in addition to the paid-up capital there is an equal amount of borrowed money on which there is a payment of 6 per cent, interest, the 12 per cent, is reduced to 6 per cent, after thc actual deduction of the interest paid. The income tax on the balance of 6 per cent, represents one-third, which is 2 per cent., leaving an additional 4 per cent, in the hands of the shareholders. Of course, if the amount of borrowed money is double the paid-up capital, obviously the additional amount for shareholders is another 4 per cent., and so it continues, and in respect of the doubleborrowed money in relation to paid-up capital, on this illustration, the amount available to shareholders is 16 per cent. A few days ago, honourable members received a memorandum from a prominent underwriting firm in Melbourne giving particulars in relation to many of these companies. The amount of borrowed money which some of them had was as much as five, six, and even up to eight times the paid-up capital. Even on the basis of six or eight times, it can be easily seen that a company can make a profit of something in the vicinity of 40 per cent, in relation to the actual paid-up capital. I suggest that this form offinanceis used not only by hire-purchase companies, but also by many companies in Australia at the present time because of tbe income tax charge in relation to profits on companies. This avoids the necessity of providing income tax before the payment of dividends as would be necessary on share capital. I now want to say something about the entry of banks into the hire-purchase field .1 Hire purchase is an established element in our present-day community life. Contrary to the impression which has been given by many members of the Opposition over a fairly long period, the funds which banks invest in hire purchase are shareholders' funds. They are not the funds which are by various people in the community. Ia most cases, I suggest, every time an Austrahan trading bank has entered into hire purchase business, it has made a new issue of shares sufficient to provide the capital to invest in a hire-purchase company. I believe that the conservatism of banks is a guarantee to the community, whether it is in relation to a person who is a hirer of goods or the investor of money in share funds, or in relation to money at call or on deposit. I believe that the type of activity which banks normally undertake provides a guarantee to the people that the business will be conducted on a very sound basis. We all know that hire-purchase money is dear money. We know also that goods purchased under hire purchase are dear goods. But we must not overlook the fact, in relation to this question of hire purchase, that there is provided through it the opportunity for so many people in the community to obtain semi-durable goods to build up for themselves assets which, under other circumstances, if they had to depend upon a * overdraft, they would not be able to d»*. The people want hire purchase, and even though it involves paying the rates of interest which apply at the present time, I believe that there would be a terrific reaction from the community at large if anything was done to take away the opportunity of having money available to them for the purchase of these goods which they so desire and which are so essential as amenities. able member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) seems to be the chief apologist for the Government's failure to do the right thing by the people of Australia. In 1955, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) was very, concerned about hire purchase. I should like to know why he is not so concerned about it now. I refer the honourable member for Petrie to what the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech in 1955, when he was very concerned about this matter. On that occasion the right honourable gentleman saidI have spoken of the prevailing tendency to try to achieve living standards beyond our current resources. This tendency has found expression in the rapid building up of a structure of time-payment or hire-purchase credit. The Government has been greatly concerned at this development and its effects upon the economy. The matter was discussed with the State Premiers at the last",45,Pairs
110,Mr Costa (Banks) [8.30],"The honorLoan Council meeting and a joint statement was issued calling attention to the adverse effects which the high rates of interest Fancy this Government being concerned about that!being paid by hire-purchase compames were having on the raising of funds for vital developmental works. The banking system has subsequently been asked to curtail finance for hire purchase business and the Government has been considering ways of dealing with the position within the limits of its own constitutional powers. In part, no doubt, the problem is one for the community itself to determine and I earnestly suggest that members of the pubhc should ask themselves how far they should support a system which not only involves them in mortgaging their own future but carries a threat to the economic stability in which they have so great a stake. in 1955. That was a remarkable statement for him to make, because since then he has not opened his mouth on this topic. Since he made that statement almost all the private banks in the country have become large shareholders in hire-purchase businesses. I challenge the Government to take action to fulfil its pledge about hire purchase, about which it was so gravely concerned in 1955. It is apparent that when the Treasurer made the statement to which I have just referred the banks and the investment companies must have said, "" Lay off that matter. It is a good cop for us. Do not enter into it "" . Petrie also says, "" Lay off "". activities of hire-purchase companies are being condoned by this Government. I have here a clipping from a newspaper. Every week one can see advertisements in the newspapers in which semi-government bodies ask people to invest in their loans at 5 i per cent, in order that they might carry on urgent developmental works. people to invest in that type of security when they can get a return of 10 per cent, from hire-purchase companies? This newspaper advertisement readsSydney Guarantee Corporation pays you ten per cent. . . . By making a compound interest deposit, able to obtain the latest figures from the your interest is added to your original deposit to earn further interest. This Government allows that to go on. If (A), the money lender, puts money into (B), the investment company or the banks, to pass on to (C), the purchaser, to buy goods, how much interest must the purchaser pay? There is no escaping the truth of what honourable members on this side of the committee have been pointing out to the Government for some time. The minimum interest rate paid for money borrowed under the flat rate system is 19i per cent. As I have stated on other occasions, as the instalment payments come back to the hire purchase company the money is immediately let out again, and the rate of interest that these hire-purchase companies and the banks are earning is indeterminable. It could be 50 per cent, or 60 per cent. compared with these people. compared with the people whose activities this Government is doing nothing to curb. I wish to speak about something else that is very bigI like talking about big things. One of the biggest things in this country at the moment is the national debt, and this Government is doing nothing about it. There is no comment in the Budget Speech about this very important matter, and any information about it in the Budget is very flimsy. Sufficient information is never given in second-reading speeches, and, after all, as the examiners of this annual stocktaking that takes place we are entitled to the fullest information. If all the relevant documents are not put before us it is difficult to do the job we are expected to do. The national debt has grown very considerably since this Government came to power. In 1950, it stood at £2,909,400,000, and in 1957, according to the latest figures available to me, it was £3,991,400,000. That means that the Government has allowed the national debt to increase by about one-third since it has been in office. Consider the huge interest bill we have to pay on our national debt. The staggering amount is not surprising, because this Government supports a policy of high interest for people who have plenty of money. The interest charge on our national debt in 1950 was £75,400,000. In 1957 it was £136,600,000. I have been Treasury, which show that in 1958 the interest bill amounted to £147,700,000.

The Government does not mention this important matter in the Budget, just as it does not mention the very important matter of hire purchase. To meet the national debt we have a National Debt Sinking Fund, which has been operating since 1923. The National Debt Sinking Fund Act was passed for the purpose of liquidating and preventing national debt. There must be something wrong with the act, because the national debt is increasing very swiftly. I have made some investigations into this matter, and find that the average amount going into the fund each year is about £40,000,000. Money is being paid in at that rate, but despite that the debt is increasing at an alarming rate. I should like to know what ceiling the Government thinks can be placed on this debt, and who will eventually pay it. There is something wrong somewhere. More than £906,000,000 has been paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund since its inception in 1923. A little more than £402,000,000 has been used for redemption of federal debt, and about £259,000,000 has been paid off the State debt, leaving a balance of about £243,000,000. Honourable members will see that notwithstanding the fact that the fund is over 30 years old, it is not making any impact on our colossal national debt. That is a very serious matter, sufficiently serious, I think, for the Government to make some provision for it in the Budget. Another matter relating to the national debt is its effect on railway systems in Australia, Again, this is something about which the Government is doing nothing. I do not think that, within the framework of the national debt, any item is increasing as rapidly as is the railway debt. In 1956, the total indebtedness of the railway systems throughout Australia was £596,000,000, and to-day it is about £656,000,000. In that period of two years, the debt increased by £60,000,000. The debt for the various States is as follows:New South Wales. . Victoria .. .. 138,211,000 Queensland South Australia .. . . 57.329,000 Western Australia .. Tasmania .. The total for all the States is £656,709,000. I know that Government supporters from time to time blame the New South Wales Government for the indebtedness of the railways of that State because it happens to be a Labour government. But an examination of the facts will show that some States are in a worse position than New South Wales. The railways must pay interest on the indebtedness, and the interest is paid out of the working expenses. In New South Wales, the revenue of the railways for 1956-57 was £78,000,000. Out of this amount, the Commissioner paid interest of £9,500,000 on the indebtedness. In Victoria, revenue was £37,000,000. just been increased because of this indebtedness and because the Commonwealth Government allows the indebtedness to continue. Victoria paid interest of £3,000,000 out of revenue of £37,000,000. In Queensland, the revenue was £36,000,000, out of which £2,900,000 was paid in interest. South Australia paid £1,600,000 in interest out of revenue of £13,000,000. is in that State? same brand of Government as we have here. New South Wales devoted 12.1 per cent, of the revenue to the payment of interest on the original indebtedness of the railways. In South Australia, the percentage was 11.8, which was almost as bad as the New South Wales figure. The position was worse in Western Australia. There, 14.8 per cent, of revenue was used to pay interest on the debt. In Tasmania, it was 13.9 per cent. Each year the States must find £19,600,000 to pay interest on the indebtedness of the railways, and the revenue position is worsening. The people of Australia are paying £19,600,000 to these systems that are losing money andwill continue to lose money. 1 believe that the Commonwealth Govern£ ment, which is responsible for national .. 273.602,000 finance, should take some action in rela.. 111,661,000 tion to this very serious matter. 61,173,000 T asked the Treasurer to-day whether he 14,733,000 could tell me how much of the railway debt",48,Pairs

We should have that information so that the matter can be discussed properly at this time when we are considering the annual stocktaking. 1 wanted to know, also, whether any of the money was funded at any time. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth can fund some of the debt, and I believe that it should, because that is the there would be no constitutional question. only way to prevent it increasing. The States, whether they have Liberal governments or Labour governments, would then be relieved of this tremendous burden which is wrecking our railway systems. It is typical of this Government that it should ignore the problem and not even mention it in the Budget Speech. In 1955, the Government professed to be alarmed about hire purchase, and was going to do all sorts of things, but it has failed to do anything. able member's time has expired. knew that the question of hire purchase would be introduced into this debate, because it is one of the points that the Austhe New South Wales Government has tralian Labour party intends to use during the election campaign. In the recent Victorian elections, the Labour party accused the Bolte Government of failing to take action on hire purchase and said that if Labour was returned to office it would deal with hire purchase. In that way, the Labour party recognized that this is a State matter. The people in this chamber most vocal about hire-purchase interest rates are Labour members from New South Wales. Their own Government in New South Wales has legislated on this question. Yet they come into the National Parliament and use this humbug every time they open their mouths! They do so because hire purchase is their election point. Why is it their election point? Because they know that large numbers of citizens are using hire purchase and would like a lower rate of interest. Hire purchase, therefore, becomes a good talking point. Only three years ago, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) at a meeting of the Australian Loan Council asked the Premiers to act on hire purchase. The honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) mentioned that. He said that the Treasurer was disturbed about the high interest rates and the movement of money towards the hire purchase system. As he said, the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to deal with this matter. At a meeting of the Australian Loan Council, the Premiers were asked to refer the necessary power to the Commonwealth, if they would not take action. If the States agreed to do that, But did the Premiers do it? No. Not one Premier offered to refer the power to the Commonwealth, although at that time four of the States had Labour governments. So we have this humbug, and the time of the National Parliament is taken up with an argument that the Commonwealth can act on hire-purchase interest rates. A plank of the Labour party's platform for the next election is a reduction of these charges. It appeals to the amoral instincts of man. The Labour party cannot find anything but hire purchase to talk about during the election campaign. The honourable member for Banks said that the Commonwealth was responsible for the indebtedness of the railways. However, spent countless millions of pounds on the electrification of the western line. That money could have been spent in the rural areas on development such as water conservation. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth is held responsible for everything done by the State governments. What sort of people are the honourable members who constitute Her Majesty's Opposition? They always talk humbug! I wish to deal with estate duties. This is a matter of considerable importance. The Commonwealth assesses duty on many kinds of estates. I should like the present Treasurer and the gentleman from the Government side of the chamber who will succeed him in the new Parliament to consider a change in the method of assessing estate duty on certain classes of property, with particular reference to the value of certain kinds of businesses and machinery. In the United Kingdom, there is a special rate of estate duty on agricultural property. In the assessment of duties there, in general, a principal value of assets is assessed at the date of death. The principal value is the equivalent of the market value. But there are exceptions to this rule in the assessment of duty on agricultural property, business",49,Pairs
125,The Chairman,Order! The honor,50,Pairs
126,Mr Anderson (Hume) [8.45],"Ipremises, and plant and machinery. It appears that two values are ascertained for duty purposes in respect of agricultural properties. One is the principal value, which, as I have said, is the equivalent of the market value, and the other is the agricultural value which it seems is the value that the land would have if it were subject to a perpetual covenant prohibiting its use for other than agricultural purposes. In the United Kingdom, a principal value is established; and then the agricultural value is assessed, and that is subject to a small rebate. It does not make a great deal of difference in the final result, but it does make a difference in materially relieving agricultural property and certain classes of businesses of the burden of estate duty. This matter has cropped up recently in New South Wales, where unimproved land values have been increased. The increase has caused considerable concern in agricultural communities, because it is not easy to realize on land in order to pay estate duties. long time. So far during the consideration I know of quite a number of cases in which grave hardship has been caused as a result of value increases by the current method of assessing estate duty. I should like the Treasury to examine the matter in order to ascertain whether methods of assessing estate duty similar to those employed in the United Kingdom could be adopted in Australia. This is an important question in a country in which much of the national production and a great deal of the national wealth come from the land. Any improvement in the method of assessing estate duty on land will promote increased investment in land, and that in itself will add to our national assets and increase our primary production. [8.52] -The opening remarks of the honourable member for Hume( Mr government loans, the taxpayers can go on Anderson) were in keeping with his role as one of the most tory of the tory members in this chamber. The one thing that he seems to lose sight of most readily is the simple fact that so long as the National Parliament allows hire purchase to go on as it has done for so long, we can expect Treasurers to budget for deficits of £110,000,000 or perhaps £200,000,000 because the people have not sufficient money available to fill government loans at a respectable and decent rate of interest. Nobody should know that better than the honourable member for Hume. The peOple who will suffer most from this situation in the long run are the farmers. The honourable member will find that he has something to answer to his constituents for on 22nd November, because the Bank of New South Wales and the other private trading banks are now telling farmers who seek financial accommodation for the purchase of new machinery that if they walk down to the hire-purchase counter they can have as much money as they like-a t hire-purchase interest rates. On 22nd November, the honourable member will pay for the toll that is now being taken of the farmers in the Hume electorate by this resort to hire-purchase financing. Perhaps we are at a disadvantage in a debate of this kind in facing a Government that is about to lose the services of a Treasurer who has served in that office for a of the Estimates, we have been favoured with the attendance in the chamber of the Ministers responsible for the departments for which proposed votes were before the committee, and even the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) attended when the proposed vote for the Prime Minister's Department was under consideration. I assume that the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron), who is now at the table, represents to-night the gentleman who will be the next Treasurer. I certainly cannot imagine that the Minister will be the new Treasurer. I hope that the Treasurer-to-be will take notice of what is said in this debate, because, next year, he will face exactly the same situation as the present one. He will have to tell the people of Australia, next year, that, because of the lack of public support for paying high taxation from year to year and that the Government will still have to meet its commitments by resorting to treasury bills. But there is a limit to any nation's capacity to live under such conditions. We have heard the position in New South Wales compared with the position in Victoria.

An examination of the figures, with which I will deal when we are debating business undertakings, shows that what was done last year is being repeated this year. The amount due for reimbursement to the Commonwealth Railways is not being provided by the Treasury this year. As a result, the favoured treatment accorded to Sir Thomas Playford and his Government in South Australia will continue, so that the members of that government can boast that a Liberal government is providing cheaper electricity than the other governments of Australia-althoug h it is being done at the expense of this Government and of the taxpayers, and we are showing a loss in our own operations. able member's time has expired. this side of the House accept with great pleasure the prediction impliedly made by the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr that the rates for freight and passengers are E. James Harrison), who said that the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) is representing the next Treasurer. This was a forecast of the election results with which we on this side entirely agree. There was a certain amount of confusion of thought as between the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) and the honourable member for Blaxland. The honourable member for Banks deplored the increase in the national debt of about £100,000,000 per annum. The honourable member for Blaxland, on the other hand, attacked the Government because the national debt was not increasing still more steeply. He complained that because of the policy pursued by this Government less and less money was becoming available for Government loans, and we could not build up a still larger debt, and increase it even further year by year. The honourable member for Banks seems to overlook what is the counterpart of the increase, year by year, of the national debt. This £100,000,000, which is invested wholly in the works of the States, Proprietary group, which invested in gohas as its counterpart greatly increased national assets. Housing, transport, power and the other facilities that are necessary to expand this economy are in fact the counterpart of the national debt. These assets are increasing a great deal faster, in converting a loan of £16,000,000 sterling, fact, than is the national debt, for the or £20,000,000 Australian, which became simple reason pointed out by the honourable due in London a short time ago. He member for Blaxland, that we cannot at the moment meet all our commitments from the bond market. The result is that our assets in the public sphere, in one way or another, are increasing at about twice the rate of increase of the national debt. The honourable member for Blaxland seemed to assume that the railways, once having been given the capital, should not be expected to service that capital. This, in fact, would be quite contrary to the principle in every other type of investment, both in private and public industry, that every amount of capital invested should earn its proper return, and that if any business undertaken seems unlikely to earn its proper return, the investment should not be made. He referred to railway deficits, but if in fact one looks behind those railway deficits to the behaviour of certain State governments-som e more than others-on e finds struck on political grounds, and that every economy, such as those suggested by the Ebasco report in New South Wales, is resisted on political grounds. If, in fact, we could remove politics from the railways of this country and treat them on a wholly economic basis, they would not only be very much more efficient but also would yield a good return on the capital invested. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also referred to the national debt and the way in which it was handled. There seems to be some confusion in his mind between long-term rates and short-term rates. He seems to think that there is something holy about the relationship which has prevailed in this country and most other countries in the immediate post-war period. But I should like to point out to him that in many countries, over many years, the short-term rate of interest has been higher than the long-term rate. If he thinks we could have raised large sums of money and continued to enjoy loans at 2 per cent, from companies such as the Broken Hill vernment securities, in the face of the other investment opportunities offering in every capital city, he is an extreme optimist.

134,Mr Bury (Wentworth) [9.7],"We onattacked us for refinancing that at 6 per cent. On that, as he is, perhaps, a potential good, sound, public service tradition. Until Labour treasurer in the dim, distant future, all I can say is that his predecessor would, in these circumstances, never have been so silly. At the moment, the prospect is of a continued, sharp and serious decline in our overseas London funds and any refinancing of debt which we can finance now at prevailing rates of interest is obviously a very trained professionals. The American pubprudent move. The only sad thing about it is that it would probably be extremely difncult for us to continue to borrow at the rate which our current pace of development justifies. My real purpose in rising, however, is to say one or two things about the Treasury and its part in overall administration. It has been suggested on a number of sides that the way to solve our problem of overexpanding administration would be to appoint something akin to the Hoover Commission. It is important that the committee should realize the very fundamental differences which exist between Australia and the United States of America. The Hoover Commission was brought into the American scheme at a time of quite unparalleled growth in American government operations. It was a legacy of the Roosevelt administration, which lasted for twelve years-firs t of the New Deal and then of the war-time agencies which were created hastily by President Roosevelt to serve a number of ad hoc purposes. It is well known that Government finance, and therefore the Treasury is agencies are much easier to establish than brought into almost every activity. In to get rid of afterwards. In the United order that the Treasury may perform its States, President Roosevelt, great politician function effectively, it must be properly though he may have been, was probably manned, and its manning, salaries and the most untidy and sloppy administrator status must be kept in proper line with who ever held the reins of supreme power those of other departments. It should be in that great country. On many occasions remembered that a senior official of the when he quarrelled with a particularly Treasury may be called upon to pronounce powerful section of his administration, seriously on whether or not particular prowhich for political purposes he did not like jects should proceed in other departments. to get rid of, his tendency was to create Therefore, he should be not just a finanalongside it a new, parallel department, and cial man but also a man who is able to then deal with the man who was placed in bring sound, balanced judgment to bear on charge of that. A consequent legacy of all the problems which are referred to the deadwood littered the American scene. Of Treasury, not only by other departments, course, it was followed in the immediate but by the Government itself. At the aftermath of war by all kinds of other present time we have in the Treasury all agencies established ad hoc to deal with too few men of first-class talents. Those foreign aid and many other emergency postwho are there are in fact at times very war problems. There is also in America a dearth of the New Deal days, the American public service was extremely weak. All the higher appointments were handed out on the spoils system, and only slowly, over the years, have the Americans been managing to eradicate that system and to get away from political appointees to long-term, soundly lic service still has a long way to go before it catches up with our own or the British system. Therefore, I suggest that if we continue to look to devices like the Hoover Commission to solve our administrative problems, we shall in fact be looking in the wrong direction. One of the chief ways in which we can tackle the problem-wbic h is. as the Prime Minister pointed out, a continuing one requiring political responsibility to be exercised day by day-is by careful co-ordination of inter-departmental activity and, above all, the prevention of wasteful overlapping both between the Commonwealth and the States and between individual departments. There is a natural tendency amongst all government departments to quarrel with each other on the jurisdictional boundaries which lie between them. The Treasury is the one obvious authority to co-ordinate the activities of such departments. Almost every problem of government involves the provision of seriously overworked because there are so few of them and the activities of government are so many. Government administration does suffer from the fact that because it is so overloaded, many decisions are given too quickly and perhaps at times without sufficient imagination. I suggest that df we are to seek greater economy in government we should have a very close look at the functions of the Treasury vis-a-vis other departments. three points that I desire to raise. One bears upon the question raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme), and indirectly by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr member for Petrie, came about. PerhapsI Bury). The second concerns the apparent disappearance of the Economic Advisory Committee. Dr. Evatt -Has it disappeared, as well as the National Security Resources Board? concerns the selling of wool futures overseas. With regard to the first matter, the view taken by honourable members opposite is that the existing financial situation is such that they accept not only the level of expenditure that prevails in the economy, but also the categories or sections of that expenditure established by the bank1950-51, the level of balances in the special ing and financial institutions and by the Government. Accepting this status quo, as it were, they answer that it is impossible to provide any more funds for such things as education, roads or social services or similar purposes. I want to point out to the committee just how this present level of expenditure has come into existence. It is not something that is sacred. It has not come to us as a result of Divine purpose or natural event. This present structure of expenditure has come about as a result of deliberate decisions taken by this Government in association with the financial institutions it serves. able member cannot discuss the whole economy or entire economic policy now. Chairman, that the line of discussion had been laid down by the honourable member for Petrie. member referred to a particular subject, and I allowed it to be debated. hire purchase. My remarks were directed to show how the funds for hire purchase have been, in fact, obtained. I think it is taking rather a narrow view to say that you can describe the existing situation without explaining how that situation came into existence. member seeks to discuss education, payments to the States and other such matters, he is broadening the line of discussion. how the present structure of hire purchase, which was dealt with by the honourable can proceed to open up the subject, Mr Chairman, and you can then judge whether it is relevant or not. The position is that through the Treasury, the Government has put into effect a particular kind of financial policy which has resulted, among other things, in the proportion represented by holdings in the special accounts of the private trading banks following a certain course. Up to 1950-51, it was the policy of the Government to use the special accounts procedure to keep in check the ability of the trading banks to create funds. In accounts was £500,000,000, or an amount equal to 43 per cent, of the total deposits of the trading banks. Under the administration of this Government and through the Treasury, gradually but definitely the amount that the trading banks were required to hold in special accounts was permitted to fall. Other things being equal, this was the key method of controlling the level of expenditure through the banking system. Slowly and definitely, that percentage fell until, in 1951-52, it was 31 per cent. The percentage in each of the years that followed was 18 per cent., 22 per cent., 20 per cent., 18 per cent, and at present it is 19 per cent. In other words, there is considerably less than half the proportion of by the trading banks than there was when this Government came into office. That meant that the trading banks had a far greater base on which to create their credit structure; a far greater base on which to create money to lend and direct to certain",54,Pairs

142,Mr Cairns,"I was going to discusspurposes. One of these was their advances. The advances rose from £479,000,000 in 1950-51 to £792,000,000, which is the latest figure I have available, an increase of £313,000,000. The honourable member for Petrie took the point that if the trading banks themselves do not lend directly for hire purchase, but only put their own funds into the capital of hire-purchase companies, then that is a situation in which they are not contributing to the hire-purchase boom. But I should like to point out that this £313,000,000 in advances goes into the economy in various directions, and sometimes it is invested directly in the hire purchase field by those persons who receive the overdraft from the trading banks. But, in any case, whether it is invested directly into that field or not does not matter. The fact is that the monetary circulation is inflated and thus greater volume of expenditure takes place in the community in general. It is obvious that this volume of created credit has been far too great in recent years; Coombs, Mr L. G. Melville and Sir otherwise we would not have suffered from the inflationary effects which indicated by the very rapid increase in prices-ove r 20 per cent-that took place in a couple of years. Surely no supporter of the Government can say that the level of expenditure which was allowed to be created in the economy was not far too great. Of course it was! That is proved by the fact that we had inflation during those years. This meant that the created money, which is no more the property of the trading banks than it is of anybody else in the community, goes back to the banks in the form of deposits. Moreover, they think that they have some form of legal claim to it. This process of money creation has raised the level of expenditure and the returns so that, as the honourable member for Wentworth pointed out, you have to compete with those returns. You cannot hope to get money at 2 per cent, or even 5 per cent. You have to go into the field of highly competitive interest rates. It is only in that kind of investment which can return these astronomical rates of interest, that the According to the Prime Minister, the Ecomoney flow will move; and so, fundamentally, that is the reason for the kind of dismost important work through that time. tortion we have in the economy at present. The first of the other two points to which I wish to refer is the position with regard to the Economic Advisory Committee. Reference to the Estimates shows that, in 1956-57, £176 was spent on this committee. Nothing was spent in 1957-58 and there is nothing for the committee in the Estimates for 1958-59. What has happened to the Economic Advisory Committee? I ask that question because I want to direct attention to what was said a little while ago. On 22nd February, 1956, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Petrie, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) saidThe Government some two or three weeks ago decided that it would have great benefit if it could secure the advice of a panel of people on economic problems broadly, the whole idea being to get a series of views derived from various skills and experiences outside the normal sources of expert advice available to the Government. We therefore appointed a committee. The Prime Minister went on to say that those appointed to the committee were some of the most distinguished economists and economic advisers in the community. They included Sir Roland Wilson, Dr. H. C. Daniel McVey. It was a most distinguished are committee. The Prime Minister spent considerable time pointing out to the House how important it was that this committee should be appointed and he said that he had, in fact, appointed it. A little later, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters), the Prime Minister said that the whole question of credit policy, behind the thing I have just been discussing, had been under constant discussion between the central bank and this Economic Advisory Committee. Here was this committee at the very centre of the most important economic discussions in February, 1956. Then, as far back as 14th March, 1956, in making his statement on the Australian economy at that time, the Prime Minister said that the Economic Advisory Committee had been intimately concerned with the discussions on the state of the Australian economy in that year. March, 1956, was the occasion of the introduction of the supplementary budget of that year about which nothing had been said before the general election. nomic Advisory Committee was doing Then the Prime Minister referred again to the important work that this Economic Advisory Committee had done in relation to advising on investment from overseas. So, throughout that time, this Economic Advisory Committee had performed a most important function. But suddenly it has disappeared. What has happened to the Economic Advisory Committee which in 1956 and 1957 was said by the Prime Minister and this Government to be of such great importance? This is about the only reduction in the number of advisers of the Government that I recall to have taken place recently. I think we are entitled to have some explanation of that. This Economic Advisory Committee, which had on it some of the most distinguished people in Australia, was essential to the Government in 1956 and 1957, but it has now disappeared, and not one word has been said as to the reason for its disappearance. I want to raise now an important matter which I raised this morning in the form of a question to the Treasurer, who completely brushed it aside in a manner which, unfortunately, is associated with some of those the Treasury would be exceedingly inMinisters who are, unlike the retiring Treaterested in the matter. However, I have surer, likely to be members of this chamber for some considerable time. The Treasurer showed no knowledge of this particular problem and no concern with it. I pointed out in the question that it had been stated that the operation of the wool futures system-the selling of wool futures in London-by a ring in this particular field had resulted in a decline of £100,000,000 in Australia's proceeds from wool sales since 1957. I pointed out that the process of bearing the market, or selling futures, was a well-known practice of monopoly rings, which operate with the deliberate purpose of reducing the prices of commodities being sold. That is to say, when the sales take place a price is fixed for the future, and this small monopoly group sells the wool by agreement at that price in the future. If they can force down the price of wool in the meantime so that they can buy later at a lower price than that at which they have agreed to sell the wool, then sell it at the formerly agreed price to manufacturers with whom they have made agreements, they make a profit. It is their functated in the face of the fiercest press and tion to buy wool at the lowest possible price, and this kind of operation is a wellhe felt was right to bring about stability known device for reducing prices. I suggested in my question that thissystem was being operated on the wool market, and I asked what the Treasurer was going to do about it. The right honourable member brushed the matter aside, soI raise the question again now: What is the Treasurer going to do about this situation? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable gentleman might raise that in connection with the appropriate proposed vote, that for the Department of Primary Industry. certainly enters into the Treasury field. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN -It does not come within the purview of the proposed vote with which we are dealing. connection with which the Treasury will have to decide the action to be taken. The commodity concerned happens to be wool, but the selling of futures also vitally affects Australia's overseas funds, so I should think discussed it, and I think what I have said should achieve my purpose, so I do not intend to say any more about it. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the magnificent service rendered to this country by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). The Treasurer has guided the finances of this country during the period of its greatest prosperity, during the period of its greatest development, during a period when its population has increased by 2,000,000, during a period when 1,000,000 people have come to this country of their own free will because they realize its great potentialities. The Treasurer has guided the destiny of this country in the face of the greatest difficulties. There have been times when inflationary pressures have been exceedingly great. The Treasurer has not hesipublic opposition to take such action as in prices. On each occasion the Treasurer has taken this strong action he has",56,Pairs

145,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [9.34],"I desiresucceeded, and the very people who criticize him have come to see that he was right. While the Treasurer has guided its finances, Australia has progressed from year to year to such an extent that people overseas have had such confidence in this country £500,000,000 here. What greater compliment could there be to the work of the Treasurer than the preference shown by people overseas to invest their money here rather than in their own countries? I feel that all Australians will say to the Treasurer, on his retirement, "" Thank you for the magnificent job you have done"". The only matter with which I wish to deal during the debate on this proposed vote is Commonwealth superannuation. I have pointed out on previous occasions that the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, which has everything to commend it and which provides magnificent security for the civil servants of this country, simply to exist. These circumstances do not arise goes on building up. Every year the amount paid into this fund by members of the civil service, when added to the interest on the accumulated fund, is more than the amount drawn from it by retired civil servants. As a result of that fact, since its operation tbe amount of £50,700,000 has accumulated in the fund. During this year the receipts from contributions by members of the Commonwealth civil service amounted to £6,100,000. The interest on the accumulated fund amounted to £2,200,000, making the total receipts other than Government contribution £8,300,000. Out of the fund was paid in pensions and repayments to dependants of civil servants a total of £6,300,000, leaving a surplus of contributions by civil sermethod the fund makes sure that its convants over payments to retired civil servants and their dependants of £2,000,000. When we add to that the Government contribution £4,300,000 we find that this fund has increased during the year by a further £6,000,000, bringing its total accumulated assets as at 30th June, 1958, to £56,000,000. I think any honourable member will agree that that is a very healthy reserve; but I believe that the time has arrived when the trustees of this fund should do something about this accumulation. I do not for one moment suggest that the Government on its own initiative should take any action, because, after all, this is money contributed by civil servants. It is their money and it is for them to decide about the administration of the fund. I suggest that the time has arrived at which the rethat they have invested serve fund is sufficient and at which the civil servants themselves could and should make a recommendation to the Government for an increase in payments, particularly to dependents of deceased civil servants. I feel that this fund has been looked at through the eyes of an insurance man. With private superannuation funds or insurance schemes, obviously provision has to be made for the possibility that the insurance company will not be able to carry on any longer or that the private manufacturing or commercial firm will go out of business. Therefore, in all insurance funds provision is made whereby funds are accumulated to enable payments to be made to the contributors at a time when the fund may cease in relation to the Commonwealth civil service. Whether we like it or not, the Commonwealth civil service goes on for ever and there will always be civil servants so long as there is a democratic Australia. Therefore, I believe that the approach to this fund has been based upon an entirely erroneous method. The current approach to funds of this nature which are permanent in character, such as national insurance schemes, large security schemes and superannuation schemes of governments, as opposed to superannuation schemes of private individuals, is to use what is known as the assessment method instead of the insurance method. Under the assessment tributions in each year will be sufficient to pay its commitments in each year. As long as that situation is provided for, no this year amounting to purpose whatsoever is served by building up a bigger and bigger fund. However pessimistically one may view the future, one must say that there is now an adequate reserve in the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. Consequently, from now onwards, we need only ensure that the contributions to that fund together with the Government's supplement is, this year, next year, and at all times, adequate to meet the calls that will be made upon the fund. Therefore, if those who are responsible make representations in this connection, I ask the Treasurer to give favorable consideration to introducing the legislation necessary to bring this proposal into effect. The time has arrived when substantial improvements could be made in superannuation payments, particularly to the wives and children of superannuated officers. Several speakers opposite have referred to hire-purchase interest rates. Members on this side of the chamber have repeatedly stated that it is not within the constitutional primary tax at the present time is 4s. 6d. in competence of this Parliament to fix such interest rates. The powers of this Parliament are set out in section 51 of the Constitution. not want the power. not, if the honourable member for East Sydney knows anything, he knows that if we have not the power we would have to go to the people by way of referendum to get it. He knows, too, that almost every time a Labour government has put a question to the people at a referendum, the people have knocked back the proposal. Therefore, in this democratic country, in which the people properly decide what powers this Parliament should have, surely it is our function to work within the limits of those powers. The States have power to fix interest rates. They have all the powers that are not expressly given to this Parliament. The State governments have, in many instances, passed legislation to deal with interest rates. If the Labour governments of New South Wales and Western Australia think that there is anything wrong with hire-purchase interest rates, let them pass the necessary legislation. Why sool their members on in this chamber to talk about something that this Parliament has no constitutional power to deal with? It is becoming extremely boring to have arrive at a distributable income of £7,387. to sit and listen for hour after hour to We subtract from that distributable income Labour members who have nothing to talk the amount of the retention allowance, about over which this Parliament has power, which, in this case, would work out at but waste the whole of their time saying £2,028, leaving a sufficient distribution of that we should do something which, con£5,359.

I shall outline briefly, the provision in the act for the taxing of the profits of private companies. The the £1 on the first £5,000 of profit, and 6s. 6d. in the £1 on the whole of the remainder. The primary tax, after being assessed, is deducted from the taxable income to give a distributable income. Out of this distributable income, provision can be made for a retention fund and it is calculated as follows: From the dividends from other private companies, no percentage is taken. From property income, 10 per cent, is taken. From other income, between 25 per cent, and 50 per cent, is taken, on a sliding scale. After the retention allowance has been decided, it is deducted from the distributable income to give what is known as the sufficient distribution. The sufficient distribution has to be distributed to shareholders within a prescribed period and that period is a whole year commencing two months before and finishing ten months after the close of the year of income. If the distribution to the shareholders is not made within the prescribed period, the undistributed amount bears additional tax of 10s. in the £1. For example, let us consider the tax payable by a company for the year ended 30th June, 1957. The taxable income as per assessment, including £500 in dividends from private companies, was £10,000. After allowing for a rebate on the £500 in dividends from the private companies, the net tax was £2,613. Taking that net tax away from the taxable income, we",58,Pairs

It must be noted that the foregoing to refrain from paying their just tax, would applies to taxable income, that is, the income refuse to declare a dividend for some years. on which tax is payable in terms of a notice However, some exceptions should be made of assessment or amended assessment. Such in the act to provide for cases such as I taxable income may often differ from the have mentioned.

This would remove a tribution. This can arise in three ways: harsh and unjust provision in the taxation First, if a notice of assessment has law.

After making his accusations he disappeared from the chamber as quickly It is not good enough for them to say supporters admit that hire purchase is such an evil? I am sure that members on this The honourable member for Sturt said",60,Pairs
149,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [9.56],"I risein that State very smartly registered their organizations in South Australia. It is quite easy for them now to sign agreements through the South Australian set-up and avoid any legislation which the New South Wales Labour Government seeks to implement. That is how they dodge the State laws. The Commonwealth Government cannot sit idly by and try to get out of this issue by saying that it has no control over the matter. Let me make it clear that members of the Labour party are not opposed to hire purchase. We realize that it is most essential to the people of this nation, not only to workers but to those in all walks of life because of the state which the economy of this nation has reached. The people are dependent upon hire purchase to buy goods. By using this method of finance they keep the manufacturers producing more articles and, in turn, maintain employment at a fairly high level. But it is unnecessary that such high interest rates should be charged. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) said that members of the Opposition were appealing to the immoral instincts of man. That is not so at all. What we are doing is to attack the exploitation of the people of this community just as we have always done. A t the present time the bankers and the financiers of this country have pushed their way into what the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has described as blackmarket banking to exploit the unfortunate economic position of the people. The honourable member for Hume should know that it is impossible to-day for farmers to obtain money on overdraft with which to buy machinery or those goods that are so essential to them. But the very same banks that say that you cannot have an overdraft will direct you to the hire-purchase companies, in which they have interests, and from which you can borrow money at a very high rate of interest. Tbe problem can be dealt with in one of two ways: This Government could conpurchase, properly conducted, is a boon to the vene a conference with the States to see working man. whether uniform legislation can be agreed measure It enables him and his family to enjoy a upon. Honourable members should not forbe denied them. It imposes upon him a form get that this Government has a responsibility of compulsory saving. to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and facturing that it cannot pass the buck to the States in and to expand. relation to those territories. If the Government cannot get agreement that way, it has a simple remedy. It should reverse the instructions that it gave to the Commonwealth Bank some time ago and allow that bank to enter into virile competition with hire-purchase companies. The Government says that the hire-purchase companies are in keen competition with one another, but an examination of their interest rates shows that there is very little competition and that the purchaser of goods has very little choice in the matter. But if the Commonwealth Bank were allowed to enter the field these other organizations would soon be forced out of business. Hirepurchase companies are only in the business for the big rake-off that they are getting at present. Let me give honourable members a few figures about hire purchase. If you borrow £100 for twelve months you repay £125 10s. If you borrow £120 you repay £148 10s. If you borrow £140 you repay £170, and if you borrow £180 you repay £214, in each case taking a period of twelve months. Just to show that we on this side are not the only people concerned about high interest rates, let me quote from the "" Sunday Telegraph "" of 30th March, 1958. The article readsAustralians in the mass are now familiar with hire-purchase charges that are two to three times as great as the overdraft rates that banks are permitted to charge. . . . More than two-thirds of current capital expenditure by Commonwealth and States is now having to be met from taxation instead of loans. The heading to this article statesCall a halt to this usury! The article explains how hire-purchase companies are exploiting the community. In an editorial last week the Sydney"" Truth "", under a heading "" Reaping the fruits of greed "" saidThe State Government intends to follow the example of some other States and introduce legislation to tighten control over hire-purchase companies. This newspaper has always believed that hire of gracious living that would otherwise It enables large Australian industries, manudurable consumer goods and employing tens of thousands of hands, to keep going Unfortunately, while some of the hire purchase -companies have been content to make reasonable profits, others have been too grasping, charging exorbitantly high interest rates to their National Bank of Australasia Limited has -customers.

I throw back to the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) the challenge that the Government can do nothing whatever in this field. I shall give a very personal example to show how this evil is growing in the community. As most honourable members know, I recently had the honour to represent Australia at a conference of the Interattention of the Chairman of CommitParliamentary Union. Like most members of the Labour party, I have no source of income other than my parliamentary salary, but I think that a member of Parliament is entitled to think of his wife and his family occasionally. Therefore, I took my wife with me on this trip. When I came to add up the total cost of the air fares, I found that I was, in round terms, £350 short of the total sum. So, I availed myself of a service offered through a Government undertaking-Qantas Limited. This service is offered by most airlines and shipping companies here and in other countries. It is euphemistically described as "" Pay as you fly "". I found that the company would permit me to pay back the £350 over a period of twelve months. For that service I was charged nearly £50. In other words, instead of paying back £350, I will pay back £400. I do not pay it directly to Qantas Empire Airways Limited; it is taken quite easily out of my bank account each month. I do not think that any one who knows the seat of Melbourne Ports will regard it as a very uncertain risk for the next few years. The amount is taken out of my bank account each month and paid, not to Qantas Empire Airways Limited, but to Australian Guarantee Corporation. Hire purchase has almost reached the level of immorality in the community, and this Government, which says it can do nothing, is condoning the immorality. Tn the instance I have given, the Government can do something because if Qantas Empire Airways Limited is to finance its passengers, the Government could set aside a sum to be lent at 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, for this purpose. In my case, the flat rate of interest is in the region of 14 per cent., but if it is taken as it should be taken on a compound basis, it is probably in the region of 20 per cent.

If Qantas Empire Airways Limited borrows its money at 4 i per cent., it should be a little more generous in the way it treats its patrons who cannot pay Empire Airways cash for the flight they wish to undertake. This agency is a direct responsibility of the Government and it is one point at which the Government could intervene to reduce the interest charges and to offer a little competition. The Government talks about private enterprise and competition, but private enterprise and competition should at least have decent standards attached to them. It is time that the Government found a different answer to our challenge than to suggest that nothing can be done. A great deal can be done if the Government really wants to do it. Very soon, the people will judge the Government and they will want something more than blank denials and assertions that hire purchase does not concern the Commonwealth.

The officers of the union presented to the Industrial Registrar a second statutory declaration which proved conclusively that the first one, which had been supplied in support of the petition, was false. The officers asked the Registrar to check the two statutory declarations and take appropriate action if he was able to the second statutory declaration was not a member, much less a financial member, of the union concerned, and had been induced by misrepresentation to sign the petition. But the Registrar did not act in the matter. He said that action could be taken, and he left it to the union to accept the responsibility of doing something. If the union representawas to be involved in further expense. The present situation is most unsatisfactory, and the allegations made by various responsible unions ought to be completely and thoroughly examined. If the Government persists in keeping on the statute-book this law, which in my opinion, is designed to injure and limit the effectiveness of the trade unions, it should at least ensure that when petitions are presented to the Industrial Registrar the bona fide officials of the union concerned shall be able to examine such petitions and test them in order to ascertain whether they have been signed exclusively That is all that the unions are asking for to-day. Therefore, we do not want the Minister and other Government supporters to start talking about malpractices in trade union ballots. No Labour member suggests for one moment that malpractices should bc allowed in the conduct of trade union Why has the Government selected the Minister for Labour and National Service redressed. I would support the suggestion will properly explain the matters that I have made in this regard by the honourable memraised, and I trust that the complaints made ber for East Sydney. by the various trade unions will be heeded.

Such a double is a very unlikely one, but it comes off every now and again. The honourable member for East Sydney, Sir, elicited an approving interjection from the honourable member for Scullin when he said that he did not see why a union should be responsible for the additional cost of a court-conresult of the Chifley Government's legislatrolled ballot. That, I think, is a not unreasonable contention, and it is something which the Government should perhaps consider. It seems to me reasonable that when a with regard to Communist leadership than union, or a number of members of a union, there is in the present circumstances. requires the services of the electoral machinery for the conduct of an election of officers in that union, the services of the factions that have developed in the indusCommonwealth's electoral machinery should trial movement have increased the probbe made available to the union without lems of trade unions with regard to courtadditional cost to it.

What unions are people whom the members worries me most of all is the development genuinely desire to hold office. We know of a belief, shared by a great body of trade -and honourable members on both sides of unionists, that there is something wrong the chamber will admit-that , in the past, with the Industrial Registrar's approach to there have been malpractices in certain union elections. We do not want them, the problems that are brought to him by and the honourable member for East Sydney the trade unions. The honourable member does not want them.

It was a Labour government that first provided that if it can be shown, reasonably satisfactorily, that some malpractice has occurred in connection with a union ballot, that ballot may be set aside. Of course, the classical case was the removal of Thornton from the leadership of the trade union movement, which occurred as a tion. It is tragic to think that that legislation was ever interfered with. I am prepared to suggest that had it been allowed to remain intact, there would have been less trouble in the trade union movement to-day It might well be said that the political Through the years the Industrial Registrar has been looked upon by the trade",65,Pairs

166,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"union movement and its leaders as a guiding factor in the settlement of union problems. When a union has a set of rules to be amended or re-registered, the man to whom it looks for guidance is the Industrial Registrar. One such gentleman, now retired, who was held in the highest esteem by the whole of the trade union movement was Mr Murray Stewart, who for so long acted as guide and philosopher for the unions. The man who followed Mr Murray Stewart in the position originally enjoyed the confidence of the trade unions. This Government's legislation, however, placed a tremendous responsibility upon him. He is called upon to determine matters that should never come before him for decision. We discussed these aspects of the situation when the legislation was being debated some time ago by this Parliament, and we on this side contended that the proposed system would tend to wreck the very things that the trade union movement had created. After all, as has been said by the honourable member for Mackellar, the leadership of the trade unions should reflect the majority view of the members of those organizations. The first thing that the Registrar has to do is to analyse the legislation of this Parliament. Then he has to follow the interpretations of the court in matters arisshould bear the whole cost in cases in ing out of the legislation. During the last five years we have seen the situation developing in which the trade union movement has lost confidence in the Industrial Registrar. The Registrar is a man who stands high in the community. But I ask honourable members to consider the decisions that he has to make, under, for instance, section 160 of the act. It is there provided that he may exercise his powers under the last preceding sub-section, which sub-section lays down that he has to determine what are reasonable grounds upon which to take particular action, or to decide whether the circumstances justify an inquiry by the court. These are the kinds of decision that a registrar should not be required to make. If these inquiries have to be undertaken, it should be only after the production of prima facie evidence of some malpractice within an organization, and the inquiries should be undertaken by the court. The Registrar has to accept the responsibility of seeing that the rules of a trade union comply with all the requirements of the legislation and of the decision of the court in relation to those rules, and his responsibility should end there. He should not have to interpret his own decisions and make the various determinations that are now provided under this Government's legislation. As I said when the Parliament originally debated this industrial legislation, these provisions place upon the Industrial Registrar a burden that he should not be called upon to accept. Consider section 107 of the legislation, and what happens when a request is made to the Registrar by a body of persons who, in many instances, are more concerned with their own miserable political ends than with the welfare of the organization of which they are members. They come to the Registrar, as was pointed out by the honourable member for East Sydney, in many instances with faked lists, showing the names of Bill Jones, Tom Henry, Bill Smith and so on. At that point the responsibility rests on the Registrar to make a decision as to what he will do in relation to the matter. I put it to the Minister that it is time that a decision was made that the Government which court-controlled ballots are ordered. I put it also that it is time we reverted to the earlier kind of legislation. We agree that if it can be shown to the court that malpractice has occurred in relation to a union election, it should be corrected. No one in this committee disagrees with that proposition. If we are to restore the situation in which the trade union movement carries its rightful share of responsibility for the progress of the nation-and there is a responsibility on it to arrive, by conciliation, at peaceful settlements of disputes as they arise-the first thing to be done is to weld together the members of the unions behind their leaders; the second thing is to restore confidence in the Registrar. This cannot be done while the present kind of legislation is on the statute-book. Week by week and month by month the situation is deteriorating. The leadership of the trade unions is being continually undermined because of the dissention that is fomented by certain groups within the unions, not for the purpose of building up the organizations or of assisting the country, but merely of wrecking the trade union movement as such. I join with the honourable member for East Sydney in putting the strongest possible case for a return to the principles adopted by the Chifley Government in dealing with this problem of malpractices within the trade union movement and urging that the Government carry the financial responsibility for giving effect to the type of correction considered by the instrument of the court, after a proper investigation, to be warranted. Above all, I ask the Minister to ensure that his department looks closely, and not merely superficially, at the breaking down of the spirit of understanding and guidance that normally is found in the Industrial Registrar. This relationship will deteriorate if he is to be charged with the responsibility for testing every attempt by a disgruntled group of people to take control of an organization that is lawfully registered. After all, registration carries responsibility under various acts. The step that we have suggested will have to be taken in the near future. In difficult times, particularly, whatallow their conduct of union affairs, or the ever the political flavour of the Government in office, the leadership of the trade union movement is required to assist in national affairs. Small groups, for miserable political purposes, are taking advantage of situations that arise, and of this Government's legislation, to weaken and destroy the type of trade union leadership that is so essential for stability in this country. the welfare of the community at large.

The policy issue involved in that has been thrashed out in this Parliament on more than one occasion. The legislation has been in operation now for several years. The Government has on at least two occasions since that time faced the electors, and can fairly claim, I believe, that this legislation has been endorsed by the Australian electorate. Honourable gentlemen opposite have made a general criticism of court-controlled ballots as such. I have no doubt in my own mind that this provision, far from strengthening the influence of communism inside the trade unions, has been a most valuable weapon in checking the influence of Communists in the trade unions. That applies not only to those unions where, as a result of an election conducted in this manner, there has been a replacement of Communist officials by officials more faithfully representing the choice of the rank a::d file of the union; perhaps even more potent is the knowledge in the minds of Communist trade union officials that, if they policies to which they are giving effect, to get too far out of line with what the rank and file would wish to see, this course is available to the rank and file to replace the officials.

On the face of it, that would represent only a small percentage of the total union membership and it is reasonable to assume that an election in which ballot-papers go to all members of the union might be a very much more costly Other methods are adopted by other what has been said by honourable gentlemen in the course of this debate that we",69,Pairs

As a result, legislation was introto carry out to the letter the rules as regisduced in 1948 which contained two provitered in the court when it is conducting sions. The first was this: Where a bona controlled fide case could be made out to indicate that rules to any extent he likes, and can make irregularities had taken place in connection new rules and regulations concerning the with any trade union election, it was open control of the ballot.

I want to say finally that I believe it is trade union, we were having some difficulty between two divisions of the union in Tasmania. I happened to be federal president of this trade union. The federal council of the union decided that there would be an election of officers. The northern division of the union in Tasmania desired to have the election court-controlled. The federal council felt that it would be a good idea, because we expected that the southern division of the union would endeavour to upset an ordinary ballot. The northern division circulated a petition which went before the Industrial Registrar, but it did not comply with the provisions of the act, so a courtcontrolled ballot was refused. We then had a ballot controlled by the general secretary of our organization, and, as we expected, the southern branch saw to it that irregularities took place, and went to the court, after which a court-controlled ballot was held. You have difficulties of that description when you have disputing groups in a union, and it becomes extremely difficult for the federal council of the union to exercise the control it desires. I believe that what is necessary is an amendment of the act to give the fullest possible power to the federal council of an organization in order that it may, without meeting such difficulties as are caused by frivolous petitions, administer the rules of the union. the course of this debate on the Estimates the founding fathers and which can be for the Attorney-General's Department I closed by the action of this Parliament. I wish to suggest some judicial reforms for believe the intention of the founding fathers the consideration of the Attorney-General would be re-asserted if the Parliament were (Senator O'Sullivan), whom I have found over the last year and a half to be receptive to say that at least in constitutional matters to the idea of constitutional reform in many the High Court should remain the final respects. I submit these suggestions also arbiter. for the consideration of whoever may be the Attorney-General in a few months time. My suggestions involve the application by court, somewhat on the lines of the United this Parliament of some of its powers under States Circuit Courts of Appeal. You will sections 74, 75, 76 and 77 of the Constituremember, Sir, that section 75 (iii) and (iv) tion.

The first suggestion would involve the passage by this Parliament of a law limiting the matters in which the Privy Council may give leave to appeal from a decision of the High Court, at least to matters which concern the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament and State parliaments, if not to matters which concern the interpretation of laws or the rights of citizens between themselves. At the time of federation it was thought that the determination of constitutional matters was effectively reserved to the High Court by requiring a certificate from that court before an appeal could go to the Privy Council on any question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of any two or more States. The Privy Council, however, has ruled that section 92 does not concern the limits of the powers inter se of the Commonwealth and the States, and will hear appeals in connection with section 92 matters without a certificate having been granted by the High Court. We know that most constitutional questions which have arisen in Australia in recent years have concerned the operation of section 92. Such matters are now being decided by the Privy Council and not by the High Court. That The next suggestion that I make is for the establishment of a federal supreme (iii.)

I am merely suggesting that we should set up a federal supreme court in which litigants could bring many matters which at present must go to the High Court. My first objective in suggesting such a court is to free the High Court from hearing lesser matters. appeals from the judges who exercise jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act 19241950, or from the judges who would exercise jurisdiction under the provisions of the Matrimonial Bill introduced last year by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr preclude them from coming before State Joske), or from the judges of the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and, I believe, of Papua and New Guinea, lie to the High Court, and the High Court alone. On the other hand, appeals from judges exercising a comparable jurisdiction in each State lie to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the State. I think the High Court would be glad to be rid of these lesser matters, if 1 may so describe them with respect, which ordinarily would be heard by the full court of a court of supreme court status. Such a federal supreme court would also give a lead in nation-wide law reform. On 18th July, 1957, Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice of Australia, a man who is formidable in every juristic and academic sense, made this statement to the Tenth Legal Convention of the Australian Law CouncilIs it not possible to place law reform on an Federal Committee for Law Reform? In spite of the absence of constitutional power to enact the reforms as law, it is open to the federal legislature to authorize the formation of a body for inquiry into law reform. Such a body might prepare and promulgate draft reforms which would merely await adoption. In all or nearly all matters of private law there is no geographical reason why the law should be different in any part of Australia. Local conditions have nothing to do with it. Is it not unworthy of Australia as a nation to have varying laws affecting the relations between man and man? Is it beyond us to make some attempt to obtain a uniform system of private law in Australia? The Law Council can, of course, do much. But it is a voluntary association and, without a governmental status ing body will accomplish no great reforms. This Parliament has the power to give a lead in law reform under sections 75, 76 and 77 of the Constitution, to which I have referred. This Parliament could implement a uniform code throughout Australia in matters in which the Commonwealth was one litigant and a private citizen or a State the other; or in matters in which two States were litigants; or in matters in which residents of different States were litigants; or in matters in which a State and a resident of another State were litigants; or in To illustrate my point, matters which arose under any laws made by this Parliament; or in matters in which claims are made under the laws of different States. This Parliament could provide the machinery for those cases to come before the federal court and, if it saw fit, could courts. The Parliament could in this way eliminate a great number of the irritating differences between the laws of the States which at present make litigation between governments and citizens unnecessarily protracted and expensive. We have the means at hand-w e should adopt them. The court could be a commercial court for the whole of Australia. It would be desirable to provide a better legal code under section 51 (xvi.) and (xvii.) of the Constitution in respect of bills of exchange, copyrights, patents and trade marks. I would suggest simple constitutional reforms, which would have no political objections, to give the Commonwealth jurisdiction over companies and matters of succession. It is foolish that companies should have to be registered in each of the States and territories in which they carry on business, and that an executor should have to reseal a probate in every State or territory where a company resides in which the testator held shares. That system causes delay ancl expense to citizens, and the only people who profit from it are in the lower branch of the legal profession. The court might also deal with matters of status and domestic law. The jurisdiction of the present bankruptcy court could be merged with the proposed new court, together with the jurisdiction envisaged in the matrimonial legislation introduced by the honourable member for Balaclava. By simple constitutional reforms the Commonwealth Parliament might be given power to determine matters of lunacy and custody of infants born out of wedlock which involve uncertainty, expense and delay. I have in mind the Mace case in New South Wales. In these distressing cases three justices of the High Court have given three conflicting decisions on which State law applies. Any future occurrence of that kind could be prevented if this Parliament obtained the power to invest jurisdiction in such matters in an appropriate court. I come, finally, to the suggestion that this court which I envisage would be an appropriate body to co-ordinate Commonwealth administrative law. I only have to refer to an answer which the Prime Minister( Mr had not mentioned. One act which occurs Menzies) gave to me on Hth May to show how complicated and variegated are appeals on Commonwealth administrative matters. I asked the right honourable gentlemanUnder what statutes have (a) boards, tribunals a federal Supreme Court since they arise and committees been established and (b) courts been empowered to hear appeals from the decisions of Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities? The Prime Minister listed 45 acts. He listed 94 boards, tribunals, committees and courts, which determine appeals under different sections of those 45 acts. There were, in fact, 50 different boards, tribunals, committees and courts hearing appeals from administrative decisions under Commonwealth acts of Parliament. I do not wish to go into the considerable literature and jurisprudence on the subject of appeals from administrative bodies. I do suggest, however, that the Commonwealth should give the lead to governments in Australia by providing some form of judicial procedure whereby, if appeals are to be heard from administrative decisions, they can be heard in an appropriate fashion. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. the committee I shall take my second period now. May1 illustrate the different appeal boards which are cited in the Prime Minister's reply to me? There are separate appeal boards under the Public Service, Commonwealth Railways, Overseas Telecommunications, Broadcasting and Television, and Commonwealth Bank Acts, although each of those boards has to decide matters which are of the same character. The court which I envisage would hear all such appeals by analogy with the New South Wales Crown Employees' Appeals Board, whose chairman is a judge of supreme court status. Specific bodies are mentioned in the Prime Minister's reply such as the Taxation Boards of Review, the War Pensions Entitlement and Assessment Appeal Tribunals and the Courts Martial Appeal Tribunals, all of which carry out judicial functions and all of whose functions might well be merged in such a court as I have envisaged. There are several acts under which there are appeals from Commonwealth administrative decisions which the Prime Minister to me is the National Health Act, under which appeals go to the Supreme Court of the relevant State. I suggest that these would be appropriate matters to go before under a federal act. Two further judicial functions might be fulfilled by the court. They are, valuation matters, on the analogy of the New South Wales Land and Valuation Court, which is constituted by a judge of supreme court status, and disputed returns, which at present are the province of the High Court, or, on reference from the High Court, the Supreme Court of the relevant State. I shall mention three other matters on which, at present, there is no satisfactory form of appeal.

173,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.26],"I Haymarket Post Office in Sydney was disWe have often had the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions quoted to us in this Parliament. The A.C.T.U. has declared its policy to be the repeal of the Menzies-Fadden legislation and a return to the conditions which applied under thc Chifley legislation of 1948. I do not propose to say any more about the ballots. I merely wished to show that the idea that all ballots conducted by the court under this Government's legislation are completely honest and conducted in an impartial way will not bear examination. The trade unions of this country are fully aware of the situation. The Minister for Labour anci National Service( Mr Harold Holt) said that the great majority of trade unionists support this legislation. That is utter rubbish. Possibly the majority of trade unionists would accept the principle that some action should be taken when there is evidence of malpractice in a trade union ballot, but I am perfectly certain that if the trade unionists had an opportunity of voting specifically on the Menzies-Fadden legislation they would reject it overwhelmingly. They do not want it. There are a couple of matters that I think require some mention and some answer by the Government. I notice that und'er the proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department we can deal with the Commonwealth Reporting Staff. Recently in Tasmania a case was commenced-the proceedings are still under way-know n as the Hursey case. I do not propose to say anything about that case, because it is still before the court, but I do propose to ask a question about the Commonwealth Reporting Staff. Mr Harold Holt -That question has already been asked and answered. court. I want to know why Commonwealth court reporters are in Tasmania reporting the proceedings. It appears to me that the Government is taking an undue interest in this case and is watching it very carefully. What is the Government's interest in it? The Government is being partisan in this matter. It is doing its best to assist one side in the argument that is now being determined in the court. There is one other matter to which I want to direct the Minister's attention. In this country it has been the practice that if a person has a penalty imposed upon him, and it is eventually proved that the court which imposed the penalty had no jurisdiction in that particular field, he shall have refunded to him the amount of the penalty which was illegally imposed. If it is a taxation case, the person has a claim for a refund. Under the penal provisions in the Government's legislation, savage penalties can be imposed on trade unions, involving considerable sums of money. The boilermakers union appealed against such a penalty and took the case to the Privy Council. The Privy Council declared that the court in this country which imposed the penalty-wha t was known as the Commonwealth Arbitration Court-ha d no authority to impose such a penalty. The Privy Council reversed the court's decision. What happened about the fines? If wheat-growers or road hauliers had been involved, we would have had honourable member after honourable member on the Government side getting up, asking questions and demanding that the penalties be refunded. This union had a savage penalty imposed upon it, but every endeavour that has been made to get the Government to grant a refund of the money has so far proved to be unsuccessful. Every time we ask the Minister a question he tells us that the matter is under consideration. It has now been under consideration for a very long time. It is about time that the Minister made up his mind and decided to refund these moneys to the trade union. This is a Minister who says, "" We are not opposed to trade unionism. Trade unions have flourished under this Government during its term of office"". The attitude of the Government in this matter does not indicate that it is favourably disposed towards trade unions. It should have been a matter only of days-certainl y not of weeks-befor e the union had refunded to it every penny of the savage penalty that was imposed. Why should not its money be refunded? The Privy Council, which is accepted at the moment as the highest authority in these matters, has declared that the court which imposed the penalty had no power to do so and, therefore, that the penalty was imposed illegally upon the union. Let the Minister say without equivocation what the Government intends to do in respect of this matter, without backing and filling or saying that the matter is under consideration.",76,Pairs

Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. Repatriation-Import Licensing. Motion (by Mr Harold Holt) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. have a couple of matters which I regard as being of great importance that I wish to bring to the notice of the House. One of them concerns a repatriation case. I have repeatedly raised matters in this Parliament concerning the Repatriation Department, and I think it will be agreed that on every occasion there has been some substance in the case that I presented. I believe that the Government is now setting out on an economy drive in the Repatriation Department, and, in fact, in other departments as well. officials, because they probably are acting under instructions from the Government. The Government's method of economizing in the Repatriation Department is to cut down on benefits to ex-servicemen. I have a case here which seems to illustrate that. I shall not mention the ex-serviceman's name at this moment, because I have already given it to the Minister and I am still waiting for some advice on the case. It is two months since I raised the matter with the Minister for Repatriation, and I think that when honourable members hear the circumstances of the case they will agree letter readsthat two months has given the Minister adequate time in which to make a decision. I refrained from raising the matter previously, because I was giving the Minister time to deal with it. The man concerned is an ex-serviceman of the first world war. He was discharged in 1918 and shortly after his discharge he obtained a war pension for war-caused disabilities. As the years went on his disabilities became worse, and in 1950, his pension was increased to the amount paid to a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman. Every member of this This man received his total and permanent incapacity pension until this year-1958 . He has now received this communicationFollowing a recent review of your case, the matter of assessment of your pension has been carefully considered and, in view of the medical evidence that your condition has improved to such an extent as to permit you to engage in remunerative employment, a reduction in the rate of your pension is indicated. This man has now reached the age of 65 years. He has been on a pension for almost the whole of the period since he was discharged after the first world war and he has been receiving the total and permanent incapacity pension for just on eight years. Now, although he is 65 years of age, the Repatriation Department doctors declare that he is in a condition to undertake remunerative employment. At 65 years of age, the Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service will not register him for employment. If he goes to the department I do not blame the Repatriation he will be told to apply for the age pension. I have seen this man personally, and I would be prepared to bring him to Canberra if honourable members wanted to see the unfortunate chap. I guarantee that not one honourable member on either side of the House would say that he was fit to undertake remunerative employment. He is a very sick ex-serviceman, but as a result of this decision his pension has been reduced from £22 a fortnight to £15 15s. He is now on what is termed the 100 per cent, general war pension, but it means a reduction of his income. The final paragraph of this Before any reduction is effected, you will be medically examined and if the improvement in your condition is maintained, your pension will be reduced to the rate applicable to your condition. He was given a few months in which to obtain employment. How could he get employment at 65 years of age, having been eight years on a pension for total and permanent incapacity and not even allowed to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service?

175,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.38],"Imatter to the Minister in the belief that it would be corrected very quickly. But two months have gone by, and all that I have been able to ascertain from the Repatriation Department is that an ex-serviceman has the right of appeal to the assessment tribunal. All that I can get from the Minister is the statement that inquiries are still proceeding in this case. The unfortunate ex-serviceman is very worried and distressed over the decision of the Repatriation Department. The Minister himself should take action to correct an obvious and grave anomaly in this case. I want to mention one other matter. I do not suggest that import restrictions are not necessary at different times in the economic history of the country and I do not propose to deal with that phase of the matter. I do think, however, that it is about time that some examination was made of the whole field of import licensing to find out whether it is practicable to eliminate many of the vexatious forms which applicants for an import licence have to fill in. I understand that an army of officers in the department is employed to churn out these forms, which are incomprehensible to the ordinary member of the community, or to write voluminous correspondence. The unfortunate people who go to the department and apply for import licences are, in many cases, driven almost to distraction. I want to read to the House portion of some correspondence which was sent to an applicant for an import licence. The gentleman concerned does not want his name mentioned because, he says, as an importer he would be exposed to victimization. If any honourable member could find some sense in this document, he would have no difficulty in obtaining an honours pass at any examination in mathematics conducted in this country. This is what it saysL.I. I do not know what that means. Probably is is a departmental reference L.I. 58/20 Adjustment for above average expansion of sales. I refer to the application form submitted by you to the Collector of Customs in accordance with the above instruction. It is regretted that there has been a delay in finalising the adjustment but a careful examination of all the forms submitted has been necessary. ment. This examination indicated that to confine the total cost of the adjustment to the available exchange it would be necessary to make major modifications to thc plan followed last year or to use a basis which gave hcences to only a few firms. The system outlined below which contains modifications to that followed last year, was adopted. The effect of this system is to give licences to as many importers as is consistent with the fundamental idea of an adjustment based on better than average sales. Formula to be applied: Step 1. Calculate the theoretical percentage of sales as followsTake 42 p.c. of 1950/51 CategoryB imports (i.e. the effective level under L.I. 57/54 for B. Category imports) as a percentage of 125 p.c. of 1952 sales, (i.e. 1952 sales plus 25 p.c. of the average increase in sales). Step 2. Apply this percentage to actual 1957 sales. Step 3. Deduct current quotas in CategoryB and bank C.16 from this figure. The remainder is the annual result which the importer receives subject to the modifications below. Modification 1. No importer may receive licences to more than 20 p.c. per annum of his CategoryB imports in 1950/51. (CategoryB as now defined.) Modification 2. Importers whose sales in 1952 were less than 100 p.c. of their CategoryB imports in 1950/51 may not receive licences worth more than 20 p.c. of their current quota (B and Bank C.16). [Extension of time granted.] Modification 3. Traders who held B (2) manufacturing quotas at 31.12.56 which were less than 50 p.c. of their total CategoryB quotas, i.e. firms eligible under paras. 4 and 5 L.I. 1957/104 may be dealt with by modifying Step 3. Instead of deducting current quotas in these cases they should sustain a deduction of current quotas, reduced by the current value of B (2) manufacturing quota as at 31.12.56. In your case this formula may be expressed. Steps1 and 242 4 1957 sales 100 5 1952 sales 50/51 B Imports£ Step 3. SubtractB and Bank C. 16 quotas £ As this result is negative I must advise thai no licence may be issued under L.I. 1958/20. There is no need for me to make any further comment.

Has the Minister for Agriculture in the South African Government given permission for sale of the progeny of imported Austrahan stud rams? 2. Did the Minister for Primary Industry state previously that a condition of the export of four the company's vessels.

If so, has the agreement been broken? 4. Has the South African Minister denied that bis Government entered into such an agreement? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. It was reported in September, 1957, that fourteen rams produced from the crossing of imported Australian merino rams with South African ewes had been included in an auction sale tion of a Commonweallh administrative building of surplus stock at the Grootfontein Research Station in South Africa. This station is controlled by the department administered by the Soutb African Minister for Agriculture. 2. Yes. 3. As I have previously explained to the House, the 1957 sale of progeny resulted from a difference of interpretation of the conditions under which approval was given for the export of the Australian rams to South Africa. This has since been clarified, and the South African Government has given definite assurances that no progeny sired by the Australian rams will be made available to commercial breeders. 4. It has been stated in answer No. 3 that the difference in opinion as to the interpretation of the conditions has now been clarified. The South African Minister for Agriculture is reported to have said prior to the assurances previously referred to that no formal agreement had been entered into with Australia about the importation of the rams, but that an undertaking had been given by South Africa when the rams were imported. New Guinea Shipping Subsidy. Mr Galvin asked the Minister for Territories, upon notice1. Is any subsidy paid to Burns Philp and Company Limited in respect of vessels trading between Australia and Papua and New Guinea; if so, how much is this subsidy? 2.

These recommendations may be considered as falling into two categories(a) Proposals designed to achieve interstate uniformity and involving mainly amendments to regulations or enabling amendments to acts permitting adoption of the recommended regulations. These include the notification of disease, the control of food additives, the setting of food standards, and the adoption of uniform requirements for the labelling and packaging of poisonous substances.",81,Answers To Questions
188,Mr Fairhall,"The answer to the honor(b) New legislation relating to matters not hitherto subject to acts or regulations and amendments to acts to bring them up to date or to achieve uniformity throughout the Commonwealth. Such include the Radioactive Substances Act, the Therapeutic Substances Act, a model act for the control of Narcotic drugs and new legislation for the registration of births and foetal deaths. 2. In the first category States have complied by amending their regulations to meet a number of the council's earlier recommendations. Other recommendations are in process of adoption or under consideration. The council has set up two committees to advise upon food additives and food standards and new recommendations from these committees are received at every session oi the council. Recommendations for uniformity of poisons schedules in most States require amendment of the Poisons Act, and the poisons authorities of all but one have agreed to these. In the second category the Radioactive Substances Act and Regulations were drafted as models, and these have been adopted in all States except Victoria. The regulations have not yet been promulgated. To supplement Commonwealth powers under the Therapeutic Substances Act, amendment of the Food and Drug Acts in some States may be necessary to provide certain powers for the licensing of manufacture of therapeutic substances. The Commonwealth has been informed that the governments of the States concerned agree in principle to providing these amendments where necessary. A new method for the registration of births and foetal deaths advocated by the National Health and Medical Research Council involves amendment of certain acts which are not in fact administered by the State health authority, but are administered by State registrars-general, e.g., Registration of Births Act. The desired amendments have already been effected in Tasmania and are understood to be under consideration in the other States. The council submitted its recommendations for the control of narcotic drugs in the form of a model act and regulations. In Tasmania the necessary legislation is in course of preparation, and in other States suitable amendments have been made, or are understood to be in preparation, to conform to the recommendations. Repatriation. Mr Ward asked the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice1. Are many totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioners who are without any other source of income frequently involved in substantial hospital and medical expenses which are not met by the repatriation authorities? 2.

Have these pensioners on occasions been compelled to obtain treatment at private or public hospitals, or as in-patients of convalescent homes, and been obUged to make payments which absorb all, or a substanual proportion, of their pension? 4.
