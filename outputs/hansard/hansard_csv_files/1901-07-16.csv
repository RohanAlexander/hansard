Sir EDWARDBRADD ON (Tasmania). I should like to know whether it is likely that duties will be levied by measurement 1 The practice proposed under, this clause seems to he an undesirable one, that is, if duty is to be charged by measurement, in contradistinction to specific duties on quantities, or ad valorem duties. a duty of the character referred to is contenrplated, that can only be revealed by time. This clause does not bind us to any policy one way or the other, but simply declares when duty is levied by measurement the mode in which the measurement shall be taken. It is not an unusual provision. Clause agreed to. Clauses 136 to 138 agreed to.

But I am content by a new or increased duty the seller after payment of the new or increased to leave the wording of the amendment to duty may add the difference caused by the Minister if he will fake a note of it and the alteration to the agreed price. (b) In the event of the Tariff being altered by the abolition or reduction of duty the purchaser may deduct the difference caused by the alteration from the agreed price. to draw the attention of the Minister to the phrase in this clause ""any alteration takes place in the Tariff."" As he is already aware, from the discussion that has taken place on another clause, the exact meaning of the words ""Tariff alteration"" is somewhat in doubt, but it seems to me that according to the Government view of clause 257 the use of these words would preclude the object of the clause being attained in the case of goods as to which an agreement is made before a Tariff alteration is proposed, and which are delivered for home comsumption before the altered Tariff is actually agreed to. If the goods were delivered in tlie interval between the period of the proposition being submitted to Parliament and the adoption by Parliament of the Tariff, the use of tlie words mentioned would absolutely preclude the clause being taken advantage of. If an agreement for the sale or delivery of goods duty paid, were made prior to any proposal to alter the Tariff, and if then a proposal to alter the Tariff were made and the goods were delivered after that proposal had been submitted to Parliament, but prior to the adoption of the altered Tariff by Parliament; in other words if the goods were delivered in the interregnum-abou t which there has been so much discussion in connection with tbe Tariff which is to come into force at an early dateI do not think that under this clause either seller or bi^'er would be able to make any alteration in price. As a matter of fact, however, the altered duty would be collected by some means or other, either under a resolution of the House under the old constitutional practice, or under clause 257 if it becomes law.

Clause 159Drawbacks of import duty may be allowed on exportation in respect of such goods (other than spirits, wine, beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes; and opium) to such amount and in such a manner as may be prescribed. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -On this subject of drawbacks I should like to hear the views of the Minister on the question of the Western Australian Tariff. Section 95 of the Constitution Act provides that tbe State of Western Australia may during the first five years, after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and that such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth. Under the existing circumstances of the State laws manufacturers in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and the rest of the States are enabled to send their manufactures into Western Australia, and to recover drawbacks on duties Ijaid upon the articles used in their manufactures. If , however, Western Australia levies duties on Inter-State"" manufactures which come from the States after having already been subject to the payment of duty there-tak e such things as sugar, jam, preserved fruit, and biscuits-the States will be placed in a very unfair position in competing with tlie old country or America. For instance, American fruits would be manufactured with practically duty-free sugar, and the English jams would be made in the same way, whereas if the Commonwealth Government puts a duty of £ 6 or £ 7 per gentleman mean that he will insert a clause ton on sugar, or levies an excise duty, we in this Bill? should have to enter Western Australian ports and compete with English and American goods at a corresponding disadvantage W ill the clause the Minister speaks about Of course we cannot say what duty will be include some measure of justice to the levied on English jams and confectionery ; Tasmanian manufacturers, such as I brought but, at any rate, it seems to me that under his attention the other evening ? the manufacturers of the other States will be placed at a manifest disadvantage if some clause all round, but I cannot promise at drawback is not allowed to them during the this particular moment that it ' will deal five years for which Western Australia is to precisety with the matter that the right be allowed to collect duties on imports from honourable member refers to. It will, howthe other States. not levy duties on all imports, but only on those not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Butitis quitoclear that whatever duties the Tariff of Western Australia provides for now will continue to be levied on Inter-State products on a sliding scale, and there ought to be some provision made for continuing to the other States drawback on sugar duty paid. sugar in Western Australia. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -No, but there is a duty on jam. We ought to have some system of tapering drawbacks to coincide with the system of tapering duties that will be charged on the Inter-State products, imported into Western Australia. I think the committee has a right to some expression of opinion from the Minister as to how the Government intend to deal with this question, which is a very serious one for the manufacturers in the other States. which has not been overlooked, but my attention is now being directed to the preparation of a special clause to meet the case. Of course we do not know what Western Australia is going to do, but we know that she will have power to levy duties on Inter-State goods according to a certain graduated scale. Therefore, it may be that, in respect to these goods, if these rates are levied, Western Australia will in some respects stand in the same relation to tbe Commonwealth as a foreign country. I think tlie matter will be best dealt with by preparing a special clause, and I will frame one and put it on the file, or I will give the honourable member the opportunity of doing so himself.

Clause 170Any owner of goods may comply with the provisions of this Act and by agent lawfully authorized. to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he has considered tlie question of adopting the system, which works so satisfactorily in Victoria, of having. licensed Customs agents? contemplates any person being employed or appointed an agent. An agent is of no use in reference to Customs unless he knows the procedure, and it is desirable for the sake of those who employ them that these agents should be men who understand the business. A large importer ""employs his own clerks, who understand the business, because their employers are continually importing; but there is a large number of people who, in dealing with tbe Customs department, feel very much at sea. If they know they can go to a licensed agent who has some knowledge of his work, they can trust their affairs to him with confidence. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) I think there is some confusion in this clause between Customs-house agents and ordinary business agents. If 1 may allude to clause 172 at this stage, it will be observed that provision is there made for making the agent responsible as though he were theprincipal. A Customs-house agent is in a very different position from that of an ordinary business agent. He knows only what his principal chooses to inform him of, and gets no other information ; but an ordinary business agent would have to take much greater responsibilities than that. We' should therefore make some clear distinction between business agents and Customs-house agents. his principal the information upon which heacts, but a business agent takes all responsibility for the work. desire to obtain some information with respect to clause .170. The custom in Victoria and in South Australia has been to license certain persons as Customs agents. Apparently the clause contemplates the abolition of that provision and the autho--. rization of any person to act as a Customs agent. The Victorian agents have waited upon me and requested me to put theircase before the Minister for Customs. The right honourable and learned gentleman will recollect that I have spoken to him upon this subject on one or two occasions, but we have not had sufficient time to go -into details. Under the system in force in VictoriaI am not quite so familiar with the position i u South Australia-certai n persons have been authorized to act as Customs agents. They are required to enter into a fidelity bond of £500 each, and having entered into that bond they are permittedThe clause apparently to carry on business. It has been found in: Victoria that the semen are of greatassista-nce in facilitating Customs-house work. They are expert men, with years of experience which helps them very materially in carrying out their duties. They have proved of assistance to the Customs-house authorities themselves. It was a Customs agent in Victoria, who upon one very celebrated occasion, showed the Commissioner of the day where a very serious leakage had takenplace, with the result that a large sum of money was recovered by the State. These agents are of opinion that their rights and privileges, if they have any, are being taken away frorii them by this clause, The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has circulated an amendment which it appears to me might meet the difficulty. He proposes to add the fob lowing new clause-after clause 170 :All persons at the time of the commencement of this Act licensed as agents for the purposes of the Customs Act of any State may continue to enjoy and exercise within sueh State the rights powers and privileges conferred by their licences. Reference-has been made by the honourable, member for South Sydney to clause 172, which makes agents personally liable for any penalties recoverable under the. measure.

MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia) Speaking as who one has had a quarter of a century's business experience, and esjiecial]}of Customshouse work, I think the Government are adopting a wrong course in not adhering to the custom which has been in vogue in South Australia and in Victoria for many years past, the custom of having licensed Customs agents under proper bonds. It is a protection, not only to the importer, but a protection and a help to the Government also. There can be no greater annoyance aud worry to the officers of the Customs department than that which is caused by amateurs attempting to pass general Customs entries. It is always very much better, both for the owner of the goods and for the Government, that the man who has the duty of passing entries should understand the various entries under which goods require to be passed, the rates of duty collectagents does not prevent the establishment of able, and the general routine of the Customs department. It would be of benefit to the Government and to the owner, especially, ill respect of a drastic Bill such as this, and of the probable equally drastic regulations that will be made under the Bill, because in many cases, owing to innocent errors of agents, who are not educated in Customs work, owners of goods may be involved in litigation and trouble with the Customs department. The system of having licensed Customs agents has been in vogue in South Australia for many years past, and I believe I am right in saying that it has also been the custom in Victoria, and I have no doubt that, for the merchants, the agents, and the Government department, it would be very much better COOK But the Customs that that system should be adhered to. I shall therefore have very much pleasure in supporting any amendments proposed in the direction suggested by my honourable friends on the other side of tbe House. That the following words be added to the clause :"" Being either a person exclusively in the employment of the owner or being duly licensed in manner prescribed."" The clause will then readAny owner of goods may comply with the provisions of this Act by an agent lawfully authorized being either a person exclusively in the employment of the owner or being duly licensed in manner prescribed. If the amendment is accepted, it is possible that the verbiage of the clause may require some alteration, but that can be done afterwards, and the amendment I suggest expresses the idea which has been submitted to the committee. tion may be required in the earlier part of the clause,' where a couple of words have been transposed. There seems to be a disposition on the part of the committee to have an amendment of this description made. There is a good deal to be said as regards the practice of the States, and as the practice of the States seems to me in a good many cases to be in effect what is proposed by the amendment, the Government are not disposed to divide the committee against the amendment. admit there is a good deal to be said on both sides of this Customs agent question, but the absence of the provision for licensed Customs agents who are not licensed, but who become recognised in the trade as persons who can be looked to for the proper passing of the necessary entries through the^ Customshouse.

59,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"Ilicensed agents, so that security is given to the Customs department, which they would not otherwise possess, for the proper fulfilment of the law as laid down in this Bill and in the regulations which may be passed under it. But I think the proposition to add the words submitted by the honourable member for Corinella may go further than he possibly intends, because under the clause, as he proposes to amend, it, an agent may be a firm, and, as defined in the interpretation clause, the word "" owner "" includes all sorts of persons. why a consignee firm, which has its own Customs-house clerk, should not pass entries. that, because the clerk would be "" exclusively in the employment of the owner"" within the meaning of the interpretation clause. use the words "" in the service of."" confusion of terms here, and I suggest that if the Minister takes the proposed amendment into consideration he will also take the wording of the clause into consideration. There is, to my mind, some confusion between "" owners and agents "" ; and clause 170, as proposed to be amended, would evidently mean that a consignee of goods could not pass entries for the goods, but that the owner, in the ordinary sense, must employ a Customs agent. If you take it with the interpretation clause, all agents are owners, including the Customs agent. there has so wide a meaning as the honourable memberascribes to it . clause describes ""owner"" as including all agents, and consequently a Customs-house agent must, for the time being, become an owner. The owners of goods might not be in Australia, but in other ports outside the Commonwealth. accepts the amendment, he should consider the wording of the clause. satisfied to, have the wording altered. something in the criticism of the honourable membei for North Sydney, and I shall look 1 more closely to the wording, if it appears to be necessary. carefully to the arguments presented in connection with the clause. The Minister himself said that, so far as the owners are concerned, if .they were satisfied there would not be much danger to be expected. The only argument used in support of the. amendment is that it is in keeping with the practice adopted in South Australia and in Victoria.. There is no proof that there will be any guarantee for the revenue of the country by the establishment of licensed Customs agents. The honourable member for Bourke, in suggesting an amendment, said that the clause was probably due to the practice in Sydney. If this idea has been suggested from Sydney that does not make it bad. Then he argued that because Great Britain has a lesser Tariff than has Victoria probably that is the reason why they have not licensed agents. But there was a time in Sydney, whenfor about two years we had a Tariff nearly as strong as the Victorian Tariff, and there were no complaints from the Treasury 'in regard to the invasion. of the law, or difficulties in regard to people passing entries for goods. I think it is. much wiser to provide for freedom of action. It is said that a servant can be used by the indentor. That practically gives away the difficulty arising as to a Customshouse agent, but suppose that a small indentor himself wished to do the work, he could. I am afraid that the only reason why' Customs-house agentshave been used, has beensimply because, by being practically on right lines, they have the run of the Customs-house It has been known for I do not think that ""agent"" some, time past that Customs-house agents present facilities to various business people, and that through their relations with Customs-house officials they manage to pass entries for goods more speedily than other persons can do. Unless some reason be given to me showing that the provision now' suggested will be a safeguard for the revenue, or that there is some necessity If then, the Minister for it , I shall vote for the clause as it stands. I have said that I am draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the interpretation clause. If he will look at it he will see that clause 170 reads as follows :Any person holding himself out to be an agent of goods may comply with the provisions of this Act by agent lawfnily authorized.",21,Malcolm Mceach A Customs House Agent Receives Through

Clause 171 agreed to.

But nothing herein contained shall be token to relieve any principal from liability. Mr G. B. EDWARD S. (South Sydney). I desire after the word ""person"" to insert the words "" other than a duly licensed agent."" Mr A7. L . SOLOMON -Custom-hous e agent. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not .think we have the word ""Customs"" in the previous amendment. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -If we want any words inserted there, we had better insert the words used in clause 170, because this clause will have to be taken in conjunction with that clause. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN have added certain words to clause 170, and we should employ the same words here. Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (South Sydney) I took those words to be ""owner or being duly licensed in manner prescribed."" All I want to do is to protect the ordinary Customhouse agent from being held liable, in the same way as we hold liable an agent who may collude with the owner. A Customhouse agent has no means of ascertaining the facts, except from the person employing him, and he ought to be protected against probable fraud on the part of a man who makes use of him. Taking the words of the previous amendment, I move That after tbe word ""person,"" line 1, the words ""other than a person duly licensed as an agent in manner prescribed,"" be inserted. the Minister will explain exactly what is intended by the clause. As I understand it, he means to make those persons who are, under the terms of clause 170, exclusively in the employ of owners, personally liable; but as it reads, it seems to me that it may also have application to those who act as Custom-house agents. What we want, therefore, is clearness, as between the person exclusively employed, who ought to be liable as being the direct representative of the owner, and a Custom-house agent, who ought to be liable under the bond he will have to givej which is another kind of liability. Perhaps, if the Minister will explain the situation, or suggest words which would make it quite dear, the whole matter would be righted. Sir MALCOLM M c EACHARN (Melbourne) I would like tbe Minister to explain the clause further, because it appears to me to mean that a man may represent himself as the agent, who may not actually be the agent, and commit a fraud, while the person concerned, not knowing, may become responsible for the penalty. Clause 172 as it stands provides that when any person represents himself as an agent, he is to be deemed to be the owner of the goods, and liable for tbe penalties recoverable under the Act to tlie same extent as his principal; not to give hhn any protection or to throw upon him any obligation which does not properly attach to the owner himself, but to let him know that he cannot so act without exposing himself to the consequences. to the Custom-house agent ?

If the honourable member for South Sydney can point out to me clauses which create penalties for oifences which the agent might be ignorant of committing, the point he has raised might be considered in connection with those clauses. But the vast majority of the provisions of the Bil l to which any penalty is attached are provisions dealing with matters of which the agent especially has knowledge. In moving the amendment recently, which created, or rather extended, tbe system of licensed Customs agents, I certainly did not contemplate that in addition to giving licenses, we should also give license to agents to do what they choose without being subject to penalty. I know the honourable member for South Sydney does not desire the latter, but I am afraid that, so far as I understand, the amendment will have that effect. It seems to me that the effect of the clause as is no pleasing amended would be to say that every agent, except a licensed agent, shall be responsible for breaches of the law as if he were the owner of the goods, but that licensed agents shall not be responsible for breaches of the law, because they are not the owners of the goods. know better, and the people who know best It seems to me that ought to be punished most.

Now the worse cases would be those in which the agent has no principal principal."" allege any person as principal; but we desire to make the agent liable to the same extent as the principal, as if he were the principal. to cover both ? Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (South Sydney). In defence of my amendment I may put a case to the committee. A man could go to a Customs agent and say"" Pass entries for me for 30 cases of flour."" That so-called flour may turn out to be tobacco, but the agent, not knowing anything of that, may pass the entiy, and when the cases are stopped and found to contain tobacco, the innocent agent may be made to suffer for the fraud of his employer It may be that being a mere layman I cannot construct my amendment in the way I would wish, but it is quite clear what I want to get at, and I should be glad of any assistance. Customs agents, as the clause now stands, will be made responsible for a great deal more than they are undertaking, and they majbe the victims of fraud. Having regard to the latter part of the clause, which provides that nothing therein contained shall be taken to relieve any principal from liability, I think the revenue . would be amply protected if my amendment were passed. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs cannot have looked closely into tlie existing systems under .which Customs agents work in most of the States at the present time. The clause would make the Customs agent liable not only for any neglect of duty in regard to the manner of passing entries on his own part, but also absolutely personally liable for fraudulent invoices, for under valuations, and for a host of other offences of which he has no possible means of possessing proper knowledge. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Of course, and the owner of the goods should be liable. The Customs authorities always have the owner of the goods at band, and the goods very best guarantee of liability. Is that nob the system in Victoria and in South Australia to-day 1 The Customs agent is liable for any breach of any Customs Act. He is liable for wilful misrepresentation ; but this clause as it stands would make him liable, not only for any offence that may be laid down and will be laid down under the regulations, which will have to be framed for the guidance of Customs authorities, but also liable for fraud on the part of the principal. For bogus invoices, invoices which do not represent the full contents of cases, invoices which represent improper and under valuations and a host of other offences, which might and which do come fairly under previous clauses of the Bill, the Customs agent, who merely receives the half-crown, or whatever is the usual charge for the entry will be held responsible exactly in the same way as a principal. That, I think, is absurd. We undoubtedly want Customs agents, not only for the assistance of owners and principals, but also for tbe assistance of the Government and the Customs department, in order that the -work may be done properly. The experience of every business man in the House will endorse tbe statement that properly licensed and experienced Customs agents are a benefit to the whole business community; and we do not want to prevent the employment of such agents, who pay reasonable licence-fees and give bonds for good behaviour to the extent of some hundreds of pounds. The bonds amount, I think, to £50 0 in South Australia, but I do not know what they amount to in Victoria. We do not want men like that to be debarred by any clause so stringent as this, from carrying on business which they may have been conducting for the last quarter or half a century.

For instance, a carrying agent passes his entries, and neither he nor the Customs-house agent can be acquainted with the contents of the cases for which he is passing those entries. know-if ad valorem duties are being levied -that the values given are legitimate values. He simply passes the entry on the faith of his instructions, and he is equally innocent with the Customs agent if there is error or an attempt to defraud. The clerk to the firm is also made liable under this Act, although he may be absolutely innocent of any to defraud. tlie owners are the security behind the agent, but I would point out that the owners are very often beyond our jurisdiction. Then the goods are security in addition. But the goods very often are not worth anything like the amount of .the duty imposed. For instance, when it is attempted to smuggle goods, the value of those goods is often very small in comparison with the amount of duty that would be levied. Where is the security there?I have not agreed with some of tlie extremely drastic provisions of this Bill, but I do agree with the necessity for holding responsible somebody who is "".get-at-able."" I do believe in holding the agent who passes an entry responsible for frauds which may be . Buti f we let tbe Customs-house agent escape, because he cannot know-and it is a fact that he cannot know-the n we must let tlie other people, such as forwarding agents, carriers, clerks in the employ of .firms, business firms who act as delivery agents to pass goods from another firm in another country, who cannot know anything about the goods, be fully freed from responsibility. The principle of Customs provisions is. this-that any agent acting takes care to see that the people he is acting for are such as are not likely to commit fraud, or to insure that he has sufficient security from them to pay any penalty to which he may become liable. amendment which has just been carried, we have created two kinds of agents. One Some remarks have been class includes those who act,-and who are, in point of fact,, clerks, and the other class comprises those who are not clerks, but who act for all and sundry who have to^ do Customs-house work.

The penalty is that these He does not licences may by order be cancelled or revoked, and tlieir holders' businesses stopped for any fraud or misconduct.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I would urge the Minister to accept thab> suggestion, and to deal with this matter at a later stage. I still feel that I am right in my reading of this clause, notwithstanding the Minister's explanation as to its intentions.

Mr .KINGSTON -What has fallen from the honourable member for Melbourne would be met by the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Indi.

I trust that honourable members, seeing that we have got so far with the clause and that we propose to amend it to meet tlie suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne, will reject the proposal of the honourable member for South Sydney, and let the clause pass. me that it will be necessary to go a good deal farther than the Minister has so far expressed his readiness to go, and that, as an honourable member has suggested, we should provide that agents shall give bonds or other necessary security for tlie proper performance of their duty. I think the Minister would hardly be able to provide for this merely by prescription under regulation, and as there must be a very stringent provision for voiding the bonds in certain events, I submit that it is necessary to introduce some provision in the Bill with regard to these bonds.

I would like to ask the Minister whether, in considering the question of the liability of agents, he has looked into the position of It is a difficult matter to Customs agents at the present time in Victoria and South Australia; whether he has studied the regulations under which Customs agents work in those States, and whether he can tell us if Customs agents are liable, as it was suggested by me just now they would be under this particular clause, for making false invoices, for undervaluations, and for incorrect descriptions, in the same way that the principals or owners of the goods would be liable. Mi"". KINGSTON I would not say that i u so many words. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I shall feel justified in pressing this amendment, unless the Minister will consent, as suggested, to hold it over for further consideration, so that he may consult bis officials, and bring it forward again in some more acceptable form. I hold that these agents might be made quite innocent perpetrators of fraud, and they should not be held responsible with regard to declarations of values. The difficulty that has been suggested by the Minister, could easily be got over, because it could be insisted that tlie declaration as to value should come from the owner or bis business agent. The Minister has not answered the case that I put of a man passing an entry for say -30 Cases of flour which afterwards turned out to contain tobacco. It would be impossible for an agent in such circumstances to discover tbe actual facts, and he ought not to be held responsible for the incorrect description of tlie goods. The owner of the goods ought to be called upon to declare the value, either personally or through his business agent, and the matter should not rest with the Customs agent at all. Asi t is not fair or just that the agents should be held responsible for all the frauds that might be perpetrated through them, and considering that in cases of fraud the department has the owners or principals to fall back upon, I will press my amendment. These agents cannot be in collusion with the principals. Mr G. B.

It is really a very important matter which will affect a large number of people in various parts of the States and involve a large sum of money, and, as the Minister has already admitted, it is one really vital to the collection of the duties. 1 hope he will give the matter further consideration, and that the representations made will show the Minister clearly that, while there is a strong feeling on the part of some honourable members as to tlie undesirability of pressing the obligations too heavily on the agents, it is recognised that the department is entitled to look to the agents to take some share of the responsibility. A middle course will have to be taken, and I am strongly of the opinion-whic h I believe to be shared by several other honourable members-that the clause should be postponed, so that the obligations and responsibilities of agents may receive consideration. view of the determination of the honourable member for South Sydney to press his amendment, I would like to add a few words to what I have already said. I would point out that all classes of agents dealt with in this clause might be the innocent perpetrators of fraud or error-al l of them-bu t the only proposal so far is to relieve those who happen to be licensed Customs agents. Why sliould thisprotectionbegiventoonesetof men and not to others 1 I have already directed the attention of the Minister to one matter, and that is that while I quite recognise the need of protecting the Customs by imposing penalties even where there has been innocent error, I do object that, with these penalties, there shall be any imputation of fraud, or any description of the offence as a crime, when no crime has been proved or any evidence of intent to defraud produced. In another part of the Bill where smuggling is dealt with, I pointed out that, whilst there should be a liability to penalty, there should be no charge of crime or any description of crime unless such crime could be clearly proved. The penalty may be imposed, but-wha t is [161] often worse to an honest firm the suspicion that they have been committing crime should not be imputed to them. I agree that there should be opportunities of imposing penalties, or else carelessness would become so frequent that the Customshouse would have great difficulty in dealing with it . MrV . L .

Victoria and South Australia. the regulations. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Has the right honourable gentleman looked into the matter as to licensed agents ? Mr V.L. SOLOMON -If the right honourable gentleman has looked into the systems with regard to licensed agents that have prevailed in Victoria and South Australia, what is the reason for the Government departing from a system about which I never heard any complaints made-although I have been in business in South Australia for a great number of years-either from the Customs houses or from mercantile firms 1 received any suggestions for introducing the system referred to, except as regards a clause protecting the rights of agents, of which the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has given noticeI am speaking a little bit without book and without reference to the papers in my possession, but I believe I am correct in ' saying that I have not received either from the officers of the department or the general public suggestion's that the system of licensed agents should be introduced. Of course the Government are desirous of getting on with the Bill, but I do not want to press it unduly; and we ought to know at the earliest possible moment whether there is an intention to depart from the practice which requires Customs house entries to be passed under such circumstances that whoever passes them shall be liable to consequences if he does not pass them correctly.

120,Mr Kingston,"In some respects.are different in other respects ? give the committee the references to other Acts with regard to this clause. They are the New South Wales Act, section 7 0 ; Victoria, section 28; India, section 202; Great Britain, sections 65, 69, and 72; Canada, sections 46, 110, 145, 158, and 159. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The Canadian and Indian Acts are not so important from outpoint of view. Mr KI NGST ON I think we can learn a good deal 'from the examples of other -countries. The case put by the honourable member for South SydneyI understand to be this-suppos e an agent attempted to pass twenty cases of tobacco, calling them flour. not put it in that way; he did not give the case of an agent attempting to pass tobacco as flour. ed to pass tobacco as flour, and got an invoice from the merchant, if he was not to be liable under tlie circumstances, the question arises-wh o should be liable? First, the department would bring its action, or attempt to impose penalties upon the agent. He would turn round and offer the defence that he was not responsible. He wouldescape. Next, it would be attempted to enforce the remedy against the merchant. The agent would not be a willing witness under the circumstances. The -department would not know from whom the consignment came or by whom it was obtained. If .excuses of that sort were allowed, it is impossible to over-estimate the danger to the Customs revenue. honest traders. protect honest traders from reckless and fraudulent competition. I would ask the committee to assist the Government in passing the clause, and I will promise that afterwards, if it is desired that the clause should be reconsidered, the Government will not offer any factious opposition to that course. that this is a rather strange way of doing business. A number of honourable members have very courteously -asked the Minister provision. to postpone this clause, and the right honorable gentleman, in reply to them, says""Letus fight it out now, and after we liave fought it out we may go back to it again."" If the Minister has theslightest intention of yielding in any. event to the postponement, it will save time that that course be taken now; because there are only a few clauses which will offer trouble, and the effect of posponing a debatable clause very often is. to get the work through more readily Honourable members are justified in calling j o in t e d attention to some of the provisions of this clause. Right through the Bill the provisions are, as honourable members who are familiar with the Customs Acts will admit, very severe. They multiply the possibilities of persons being punished by the Commonwealth Customs department in a fashion that is entirely unknown at the present time. All sorts of things are attempted against persons who have business with the Customs department; there are all sorts of penalties and conditions in favour of the department, and enablingthe Minister to punish as fraudulent actions which are not in all cases fraudulent at all. The Minister might see his way to reconsider some of these matters. In the case of the licensed Customs-house agents the Minister will see that the department has such persons completely under his control. The bread and butter of the agents depends largely on the confidence and favour of the department. That is evident. What is a penalty in connection with a shipment of goods to a Customshouse agent as compared with the risk he would run of being deprived of his licence ? The amendment suggests that these the danger to persons should be licensed in the manner prescribed. That means that the Government may surround'the licences with every precaution and may take pains to secure themselves It is important, to in any conceivable way. They can take away the licence of any agent who comes under the suspicion of the department in connection with his business. Could there be a heavier penalty than that ? I put it earnestly that that is the greatest penalty that could be imposed upon any Customs-house agentthat if he is not acting in a manner that is straightforward with the department he is immediately exposed to the forfeiture of his means of living.",29,Malcolm Mceachakn An D The Attempted On The Customs House Authorities

130,. Mr Hume Cook,"That is the Victorianspecial provision is scarcely required,' however, because if the agent is licensed the power to license implies a power to revoke. It follows as an incident of the licensing that the Minister, if he found a Customhouse agent associated with any suspicious character or a party to any suspicious transaction, might immediately say, ""We can have no confidence in this man j we will take away his licence."" That is the hold which he possesses over the licensed Custom-house agent. I think that every well-administered Customs department does its best to remain on good terms with these agents, because they are practically of great advantage to the department. officers a great deal of trouble. They are persons skilled in their work and the department finds tliem a positive convenience. In dealing with them they are dealing with skilled persons, instead of with a number of persons more or less ignorant, perhaps, and perhaps more or less tricky. A . Customhouse agent cannot afford to be tricky, because the Minister has his thumb on him all the time. The more the Custom-house agent is encouraged the better it will be for the department. As a rule, these agents take a good deal of care of themselves. My anxiety goes a good deal further. I can see that clerks in offices may be liable to these penalties in simply carrying out their masters' business. They may come down to the Custom-house to pass an entry, and some unfortunate man may, perhaps, be designedly put forward by the principal. Sometimes there is a tendency to take the smaller instead of the larger man. Mr Pi ESSE -Claus e 173 touches that point. are concerned. seems to me to be, that after the Customs authorities have taken every conceivable precaution over these people, they want a second string, and they wish to keep their hold of the first string all the time. These things can be overdone, and I think there is an attempt to rather overdo the penalizing previsions of this clause. I certainly would vote for the amendment distinctly on the ground that by it these persons will be brought directly under the control of the Minister, and therefore we shall have some assurance that they will be kept in order. committee should be all the more careful in passing a clause.like this which makes agents responsible even when they act boiul fide, when we remember the way in which the whole Bill has been drawn. It has been drawn as if every attempt at trade were a criminal offence, and in certain prescribed oflences the penalties accruing are laid down in a manner rather worthy of Draconian legislation than legislation of to-day. Therefore we should not allow agents to be made liable, provided that they can show that they have acted in a bond fide manner. The Minister for Customs says that they are liable. I presume, therefore, that he is also They save tlie Customs liable for the acts of his Custom-house officers; and as his Custom-house officers last month' destroyed the heads and livers of 150 head of cattle and some 1,200 or 1,300 sheep,which would have done very well for food, he must take the responsibility of that act. MrR -EiD -W^haf c food was destroyed ? actually took place last month. The Minister has now expressly declared that he himself takes responsibility for all these things, and so a charge should be made against him of doing away with good, wholesome food. The people whose food was destroyed in that fashion ought to wait on the Minister. If the clause reads one way it must read the other. If the right honourable and learned gentleman had been living in the time of the French Revolution, and had sanctioned such a proceeding, we know the fate that would have befallen him -Nomatter how innocently an agent may act, clause 242 provides that no reduction of the penalty can be made. That clause providesNo minimum penalty imposed by this Act shall be liable to reduction under any power of mitigation which would but for this section be possessed by the court. It will, therefore, be of no avail for an agent to say that he acted innocently. In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that many of these ofiences are almost of a criminal nature, I will support the amendment proposed by the member _ for South Sydney. I should like to see it go further and exempt every agent, provided that he acts in a bond fide manner. Mr G. B.

I think the Minister by resisting this request has hardly treated the committee in a way that will help us to get through the Bill. If the right honourable and learned gentleman had agreed to the postponement half-an-hour ago, we should have been half-a-dozen clauses ahead. 1 am quite certain that if he allows the clause to be postponed and comes clown to the committee with some qualification, which, while it might not give all that we ask, would meet the position I have taken up, we should get on much faster. I am of opinion that we ought to take the amendment a little further so as to include innocent agents outside licensed Customs-house agents, and at the same time, if the Minister thought fit, he might make some further amendment so as to protect his revenue from fraud, where these people were clearly participating in that fraud. I think it is the Minister who is really wasting the time of the committee, because if he were to postpone the clause and to come down subsequently and say that he could not meet us to more than a certain extent, we should be prepared to help him. I am certain he has not fully considered the clause. I do not think we shall gain anything by postponing this clause, and I intend to support the Ministeri n asking that the matter should be decided at once. We have had a very fair debate on the clause. The question is not a particularly complicated one, and I view were."" do not think that it has been rendered more complicated by the amendment which was carried in clause 170. The effect of that that the Minister is prepared to recommit clause is to give certain agents a licence and these clauses ? practically a monopoly, and to make their positions very much more profitable.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (MelDourne) I am not disposed to support the amendment, but at the same time. I would urge the Minister to recommit these clauses. I do so because I feel that the amendment made in clause 170 may have such an effect upon other clauses, that it is wise to give the matter ful l consideration before passing them. I think the Minister may undertake to recommit that clause, because I shall certainly move the recommittal of clause 172 upon another point, and also of clause 173. will not be opposed. I am sorry if honourable members think I am too much attached to this Bill. We have not introduced its provisions without giving them some consideration, and we may therefore be expected to adhere to them until we are satisfied that they are wrong. So far as the amendment of the honourable member for South Sydney is concerned, we are not satisfied that there is any error. We would ask the committee therefore to take a division, and give us the clause, as I am perfectly prepared, seeing that a new point has been raised by the introduction of licensed agents, to recommit these clauses.

142,Mr Kingston,"Yes.whether the Minister has intentionally departed from the provisions of the Victorian Act, but I would like to draw his attention to the difference, because it seems to me that very great and unmerited hardship may be cast upon owners of goods by this clause. The provision is absolute thatAny declaration authorized by this ActAnd that of course will include the regulations alsomade by any employee or ageut of any person shall be held to have been made with the knowledge and consent of such person. It matters not whether he can prove absolute innocence in the matter, or whether he has given written directions which have been wilfully violated, the clause holds simply that because tlie declaration is made, it is made with the consent of the person. In the Victorian Act, which has never been found to be defective, we have section 83 under which it is providedAny declaration made under any law now or hereafter in force relating to the Customs by any shipping clerk or known emploj'eof any importer or owner of goods or merchant shall be held to have been made with the knowledge and consent of such importer or owner of goods or merchant unless the contrary be proved. And the note to that section in Dr. Wollaston's book, ""The Victorian Customs and Marine Law,"" at page 39, is thisThe burden of proof is shifted upon the importer, &c. He would have to prove a negative -alway s a difficult task. It seems to me that it is a very important thing,' and a very strong thing to say that however clearly a man may be able to prove his innocence be is not to be heard. It should be quite sumcient to put the onus of proof upon the owner, and until he proves his innocence to assume him to be guilty.. That itself is a strong thing to do, but I think it is necessary to do it . I think it is of Acts here. certainly sufficient to do that without shutting the door upon him altogether. A man's character may be at stake, and he may have taken every proper precaution, but business cannot be carried on altogether personally; men must trust to agents, and for the mere wilfulness or negligence of an agent, a man may be held irretrievably to have made a false declaration when he is absolutely innocent. I trust the Minister will see tbe necessity for adding these words, which are to be found in the Victorian Customs Act. I believe they will be found to meet all that is required, and if in time they are not found to be effective, the law can be strengthened. I do not want formally to move the addition of the words, but I ask tlie Minister to accept the sug-* gested amendment. learned member will see what the result will be, if we are compelled to trace the connection between the employer and the agent or clerk.

182,Mr Higgins,"The employer signednegligence, just as any employer is responsible for his employee's negligence. As regards the pecuniary penalty, if a master does not know anything about the offence, he must pay the money which the conduct of his clerk involves. But the honourable and learned member for Corio asked me to look at clause 228, under which it appears that when a person has been convicted so as to be liable to a pecuniary penalty twee, he is further liable to be imprisoned for a period of not less than sixmonths, nor more than two years, with hard labour. that to which the honourable and learned member directed my attention. NowI am told that clause 243 has a similar effect, but the latter refers only to the treatment of convicted' offenders, and providesWhere any pecuniary penalty is adjudged to be paid by any convicted person the court may(1) commit the offender to gaol until the penalty is paid ; .or (2) may release the offender upon his giving security for the payment of the penalty ; or (3) may exercise for the enforcement and rehimself guilty. I am with the Minister so covery of the penalty any power of distress or execution possessed by the court for the enforcement and recovery when it is said that in addition a man shall of penalties in any other case. apply to cases under clause 173, because under the latter clause the offender is subject to pecuniary punishment only. look at clause -228 he will see it here providedWhen any person is convicted of any offence against this Act for whioh a pecuniary penalty is provided and it shall appear that such person had been previously convicted of any similar offence, the Court may in lieu of or in addition to imposattach weight to the legal opinion of the ing any penalty order that such person shall be imprisoned with hard labour for a period of not less than six months nor more than two years, and with or without the right of release on payment of a penalty. because clause 173 limits the master's liability to pecuniary punishment. clear in clause 228 that that clause does not apply to anything referred to in clause 173. That would be a mean betweeh two extremes, and would be fair. It is exceedingly important that no man should be treated as a criminal unless the criminality be proved up to the hilt. It is a most dangerous thing to go on the lines of constructively making a man a criminal. It is our duty to keep the brand of criminality off a man's back as far as possible. Even though the State should lose something occasionally by not being sufficiently alert, I should be strongly in favour of making it clear that the provision in regard to a double conviction ought not to apply to a conviction where a master is made liable for tbe acts of bis agent. tended to apply to cases under clause 173. The latter clause says that the offender shall be liable to ""pecuniary punishment."" be made clear. The Minister is sufficiently aware, and I need not impress on him, that, as we are making a law, we ought to make it perfectly clear that a man is not to be liable to be put in prison for a crime unless he is guilty in .his own personal mind-unless , in fact, he is cognisant of the offence which his clerk or agent is committing. I would rather have a thousand evasions than one case of an innocent man being put in gaol for a thing of which he was not actually far as a pecuniary penalty is concerned, but be liable to imprisonment, I distinctly contend that clause 228 ought not to apply to offences under clause 173. If clause 173 be passed, I hope that in clause 228 the Minister will insert distinct words providing If the Minister will that the latter shall not apply in tlie case of ' a conviction for an agent's default. words as those indicated by tbe honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne ought to go in .clause 173, and not, as be suggests, in clause 228. I , of course, honourable and learned member; but if he is"" afraid that clause 228 might mean that imprisonment, for instance, should follow the second offence, I would point out that there may be amending acts introduced at some future time which, without considering this clause 173, may provide that a second offence It ought to be made means imprisonment, and, the clause being read in connection therewith, imprisonment may possibly follow. That would be a ridiculous position, because any one who knows how the large business of a merchant's establishment is conducted, knows that the principal can have no knowledge of a great number of declarations.",35,Malcolm Mceachakn An D The Attempted On The Customs House Authorities

Customs clerkspassthe entries: and if a principal is to go through every entry and declaration, and see that the facts therein stated are correct, he will himself become a Customs clerk and be able to do nothing else. Errors will arise, trifling errors often, that do not mean any loss to ' the revenue, such as in a drawback entry where a wrong ship may be stated, or something of that sort. Such cases no doubt, could be met by providing very small penalties. We must not incur the risk that in addition to a pecuniary penalty, imprisonment may be suffered by a man who knows nothing, and can know nothing of those declarations, and who has not been proved to have any guilty intention. Customs clerks in the hurry of entries, and the intricacies of their work, often make mistakes. This will happen even in the case of a careful clerk, and a careless one will make mistakes much more frequently. I say, let us make the principal liable for tlie mistakes up to a reasonable amount of fine, and l e i us make that clear in any clause in which the punishment is stated. is really very much difference between the various sides of the House in connection with the great principle which underlies this legislation. I think we are all prepared to concede that penalties must be attached to inaccuracies, because motive does not affect the question _ of injury and possible loss to the revenue. I think, too, .that there is a general disposition to sever by a great gulf the two classes of cases-inaccu racy and fraud That is what the Government have attempted to do as well as they possibly can, by tlie broad distinction in a great class of cases of simply mentioning the penalty, and in the more severe cases of providing for the allegation and proof of fraud and . the heavier punishment. As regards a matter of this sort, we are agreed that there must be a penal hy. I think that the clause is put sufficiently clearly at the present time, but there is nothing like making it in deference to the views of honourable members-as clear as it can possibly be made. I think that the clause is clear as it stands for this reason-if the honourable and learned member for In d i will follow me-that as regards the nature of the punishment which is the question raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, it applies only to the pecuniary penalty. Honourable members will see that the provision runsIn any prosecution in respect of any declaration made by any such employee or agent, such person shall be liable to the pecuniary punishment provided by any Customs Act, as if such declaration had been made by himself. When we there specify pecuniary punishment it would be difficult to read in punishment by imprisonment, which is provided for in clause 228 in reference to the second offence. two pecuniary punishments may mean imprisonment. not only states the liability of the master, but marks its limit. It limits it by specification to pecuniaiy punishment. I think, therefore, that the matter is perfectly clear. I hope that the honourable and learned member for In d i will not insist upon the inclusion of these words here for the reasons to which I have given expression. I do not hesitate to assure him that as regards the other objections raised concerning clause 228 I will make the matter as clear as it I do not think there can be made. Wouldi t not be a good plan, if the honourable member intends to take the sense of the committee upon the question of an offender escaping punishment through allegation of want of knowledge which he ought to possess, and the establishment of a class of cases where ignorance be bliss even to the extent of conferring immunity from punishment which ought to attach, to do so upon one simple clause, applying it to a variety of cases 1 I think it would. I am perfectly prepared to remove the objections raised as regards the provisions of this clause extending to many cases to which I do not wish it to extend for very obvious reasons; but I trust that we shall not let in here an avenue for escape and a door to evasion, which I do not think ought to be opened. I take it , that when we specify one kind of punishment in a clause it is to the exclusion of all other forms of punishment.

196,Mr Kingston,But this provision,37,Malcolm Mceachakn An D The Attempted On The Customs House Authorities
197,Mr Isaacs (Indi),"In the first piace,-necessary to remove the application of clause -228. This Bill contains clauses which provide that for certain offences a pecuniary .penalty should be incurred. matter whether it be a principal or an agent; wherever that is provided only a pecuniary penalty is incurred. In this instance a principal, innocent it may be, but in law deemed 'to be guilty, is rendered expressly liable to a pecuniary penalty. quent clause, which says that wherever a pecuniary penalty is provided, if the offence .is committed a second time, imprisonment .may be ordered. How can the Minister exempt any particular case from that provision t the punishment is -limited to a pecuniary .penalty. cannot say that, because a particular early clause provides that, if a particular offence is committed, the offender shall be liable to a pecuniary penalty, a subsequent clause shall not apply because the earlier clause .mentioned only a pecuniary penalty. Clause 228 is a general provision applying to all other 'clauses in the Bill prescribing a pecuniary penalty. The clause says that' wherever a pecuniary penalty is provided for, in the case of a second offence the court may order imprisonment. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the early part of clause 173, and I venture to say that he has not removed the difficulties that I have pointed out. The clause saysAny declaration authorized by this Act made by should be liable not only to fine but also to any employee or agent of any person shall be held to have been made with the knowledge and consent of such person. . On the hypothesis that we are putting,' the owner is perfectly innocent. He is not reckless, he is vigilant, he has given specific directions to his agent, and yet the agent, by reason of negligence, or worse, has made a false declaration. Let us forget the second part of the clause for a moment, because that only sets out that the owner is liable to a pecuniary penalty, as though he had made the declaration himself. But the early part of the clause .provides that it is to be an irrebuttable presumption of law that he has consented to the agent making the declaration. The penalty is imposed on the owner as though he had made the declaration himself. Now, if -the agent has made, a false declaration, what may happen under clause 222, which provides that any person who counsels or procures, or by act or omission is in any It does not way' directly concerned in the commission of any offence against this Act, shall be deemed to have committed the offence and shall be punishable accordingly. The penalty under the previous clause is imprisonment with hard labour. So that Then comes-a subsetwo distinct things are provided for in clause 173. A man is taken without any opportunity of proving his innocence-h e is taken by law irrebuttably to have counselled and consented to his agent making a false declaration, and a subsequent clause makes him punishable by imprisonment in addition to having to pay the pecuniary penalty, and I think that no innocent person should be exposed to that punishment. The Victorian law, which throws the onus of proving his innocence on the owner, seems to me to be quite sufficient, and, I think further, that the pecuniary penalty would provide quite sufficient punishment for the employer for an act of his employee or other person which may be malicious and for which he is not morally responsible. It must not be forgotten that the Victorian Act has been so constructed that fraud may be reached, and I do not wish it to be supposed for a moment that I desire any fraud to go unpunished. I have already shown the Minister how that could be prevented, but I do say that I regard with abhorrence the idea that a person who ' is able to prove his innocence should be morally tainted with fraud, with a design to cheat the Customs, and that he imprisonment. 1 am with the Minister fully in his desire to punish fraud, and I would assist him in any way to strengthen his hands in that direction, but if a man can show cause why he should not be punished for a fictional offence-io r that is what it is if he is not morally 'a party, to it I say that he should be given every opportunity of proving his innocence. The department will have the goods and control over them, in addition to the other means of punishing the owner. I do not object to making the owner of the goods liable to a pecuniary punishment, but the earlier part of the section goes a great deal further. It does not say simply that for the purposes of the section the owner shall be deemed to be guilty, but it contains an absolute statement",37,Malcolm Mceachakn An D The Attempted On The Customs House Authorities
198,Mr Kingston,Becaus e it is stated that,38,Malcolm Mceachakn An D The Attempted On The Customs House Authorities
199,Mr Isaacs,"The honourable gentleman'that he is to be held to be party to a false ''declaration, and it goes on, in addition .to that, to say that he shall be liable for the pecuniary penalties as if the declaration had been made by himself. I hope the 'Minister, if he means that the owner of the goods shall be liable only to a pecuniary -penalty-and that is stiff enough for an innocent man-wil l take care to restrict the Operation of the clause so that it shall not go further than intended. It will not be -merely sufficient to say that clause 228 will not apply to such a case, because there .are other clauses which might apply, and place perfectly innocent persons in jeopardy. -manufacturers of misery has often been applied to the framers of protectionist Tariffs, and it seems to me that the title is well deserved by those who, as pointed out in connection with theprovisions in a previous clause, preferred that wholesome food should be destroyed by pouring kerosene over it, rather than allow it to be used, simply because it had riot paid duty. The whole of this Bill seems to have been framed with the object of making men stand in the position of criminals. -offence whatever beyond, perhaps, merely making statements which they have drawn up and signed with the consent of their -employers, are to be treated as criminals, -even though they may have acted in a perfectly bond fide manner. Minister, owing to some peculiar kink of his mind, seems to think that this is a proper course to pursue. I agree with the 'honourable and learned member for In d i that it is a disgraceful proposition to bring forward, and I ' would like the honourable member to suggest an amendment that would meet tbe case.

The clause would then read as follows :Any declaration authorized by this Act made by any employee or agent or any person shall be held to have been made with the knowledge and consent of any such person so that in any prosecution in respect of any declaration made by any such employee* or agent such person shall be liable only to the pecuniary punishment provided by any Customs Act as if such declaration had been made by himself. I think that goes far to meet some of the objections raised by honourable members. It points to what is intended, that we hold, or want to hold, that the. act of the agent shall be deemed the act of the principal for the purpose of enforcing the pecuniary penalty provided for in the Bill. provement. some way towards meeting the points raised, and I would ask honourable members to agree to the clause in that form, and if honourable members afterwards consider a further amendment of clause 228 is necessary, I shall .be prepared to consider it . I am confident, however, that these amendMen who are guilty of no ments will meet so many of the points that they will clear the matter 'up altogether.

And the Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I would like to make a further amendment by inserting after the word "" person"" in the sixth line, ""unless the contrary be proved."" I think it would be very unfair to place the f u l l responsibility for the wrongful act on any one who might unwittingly have an agent pass an entry im properly. The owner of the goods in such a case should not be madeliable for the pecuniary penalty. The Minister said a short time ago that the penalty only applied to one party under this clause. That is true, but under clause 172 the agent is made responsible, so that the Minister may recover the penalty from the agent under clause 172, and from the principal under clause 173, whilst the principal would have no opportunity what I have an amendment ever to show whether he had any knowledge of the matter or not. of the Minister has cleared away a great many of the difficulties I had before me-that is, as far as I can see at present.

There is confined to ""any officer,"" which I understand is a Customs officer, while under the previous clause power is given to any commander or officer in charge of any ship or boat in His Majesty's service, or in the service of the Commonwealtli or Customs, to deal with such a vessel ! A clear distinc1 tion is drawn. I do not know whether the Minister intends to limit the power in clause 175 to an officer of the Customs department. It might be that an officer of Customs might .not be at hand, while an officer of the Commonwealth naval service might be available. Unless there is some reason to the contrary, I would suggest to the Minister that he should not limit the power in this way. It will be seen on reading the two clauses that there is'a limitation. point. I think that clause 175 has more particularly to do with Customs work than with the firing at a vessel to compel her to bring toa work that is better intrusted to naval officers-whic h is dealt with in the preceding clause. one service. the naval authorities to search a ship. Clause agreed to. Clause 176 agreed to. Clause 177Any officer may(1) Board any ship (2) Search any ship. (3) Secure any goods on any ship. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I would suggest to the Minister that we should insert after the words "" An y officer may"" the words "" with the written authority of the collector."" The clause enables any officer to board and search a ship, but in clause 189, where similar power is given, it is provided that any officer having with him "" a writ of assistance or a Customs warrant"" may make a search. is a much greater interference with personal liberty and with the sanctity of the home than there is in clause 177, which relates to a ship. Clause 189 provides thatAny officer having with him a writ of assistmay board a ship. ance or a Customs warrant may at any time in the day or night enter into any house, premises, interpretation clause of the Bill, "" officer "" or place and may break open the same . . . That is the power of breaking open and entering into the sanctity of a dwellinghouse if necessary. 177 applies to a ship alongside a whai-f. power. I think it would be an excellent/ thing for the security of the revenue to allow the Customs officer to have this power to board and search a ship. Otherwise the whole provision relating to Customs war-' rants is a farce, and the Customs officer w ill : be armed at all times with a written letter from the Collector of Customs, which will.' impose enormous disadvantages in the speedy administration of the law, and afford facilities-' for evasion which ought not to be per-' mitted.

Under section 60 of the Victorian Customs Act, it is provided thatThe proper Officers of the Customs may board any ship arriving at any port in Victoria and freely Stay on board until all the goods laden therein shall be duly delivered from the same, and shall have free access to every part of the ship, with power to fasten down hatchways or entrances to the hold, and to mark any goods before landing, and to lock up It is a long clause, and I think the honourable and learned member will see there is no additional strength in using the words "" officer or proper officer."" The officer will be discharging his duty, and there is no limitation in the Victorian A ct as regards the written authority suggested by the honorable member. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I still think tlie Minister sliould amend this clause. The clause we are now dealing with and the next clause are two clauses made out of clause 200 of the Victorian Act, and that most clearly provides that the officer must show his authority forgoing on board. I think it is desirable that that should be so. Clause 200 of the Victorian Act readsAny officer or officers of the army . . . or any officer or officers of Customs producing his or has worked well. I do not see why the their warrant or deputation (if required) may go on boai-d any ship which shall be within the limits of any part of Victoria. . . . and rummage and search the cabin and other parts of such ship for prohibited and uncustomed goods, and remain on board such ship so long as she shall continue within the limits of such port. I would rather tbe Minister accepted the suggestion for the amendment of the clause than move it myself. thing in clause 200 of the Victorian Act which qualifies tbe clause to which I have referred. It saysAny officer or officers of the army, navy, or marines on full pay, or any officer or officers of Customs producing his or their warrant or deputation.

I am i nclined to think at the present time, thatprobably the existing State law would deal with such cases. Sir MALCO LM M c EACHARN I do not think that proposal would meet the case. The provision is made in the Victorian statute, and it would be no satisfaction to a ship-owner to think that any one could walk aboard his ship and say that he was a Customs officer, and that the Customs department could afterwards punish him for it.

What we are putting into this clause is a general power which is never hedged round with conditions of the character referred to. I call honourable members' attention to the fact that where we are pioposing to exercise any special powers, we provide by clause 187 that any Judge of the High Court of Australia, or any Judge of the Supreme Court of any State, may, upon application, grant a writ of assistance; and "" such writ, unless superseded, shall be in force so long as any person named therein remains an officer of Customs."" Then there is power given under clause 188 for the comptroller or State collector. to grant a Customs warrant to any officer, and by the next clause any officer having a writ of assistance or Customs warrant may break open things and use force. But the ordinary power of entry and examination, searching, and securing will not be found hedged round by tlie conditions to which the honourable member refers; and I could not consent to having his amendment introduced at. the present time: I shall be delighted to look up the matter further for him and see if any precedent can really establish the present, and I therefore must resist it . compel an officer to produce some evidence that he is an officer of Customs unless there is some provision to the contrary in the Bill. Sir MALCOLM M c EACHARN (Melbourne) I am afraid that power w,ill be taken away under this clause, but I am quite willing to accept the Minister's assurance that he will look into the matter. I may say the difficulty has arisen from the fact that sections which have dealt with two different matters are now in this clause dealing with one matter.

330,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"Let ussay what damage lie has suffered. It might be necessary for him, after ascertaining the extent of the damage, to communicate with people at home, and I do not think, therefore, that the six months will be sufficiently long to allow. As officers of the Customs department claim the right to go back in the books for five years, they ought to be content to allow a considerable extension of the term now proposed for taking proceedings. It is not to be supposed that these matters will crop up every day, and it is only fair that we should allow a reasonable time to enable people to arrange what steps shall be taken. I shall propose that the term be extended to twelve months. long. the Minister's attention to another phase of clause 213.

I think that the period should be further extended, and I would be satisfied if nine months or even eight months were the period fixed. Sir MALCOLM .McEACHAKN -The owners of the goods could communicate with. England by cable if the occasion arose. be no necessity for that. know within six months whether they are to be sued or not. but the clause says the period shall be calculated from the time the cause of action shall have arisen, and the goods which may be the subject of the action may not be handed over to the owners for three months after the cause of action may have arisen. The extension of the time as I suggest would not be attended with any disadvantage to the Customs authorities, and I* think that opportunity should be given for bringing an action within at least twelve months. Mr CR OUCH (Corio) I wish theMinisster would accept the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. 1 speak from experience in this matter, and I think the suggestion is the Railway department in Victoria, where a similar provision exists and the period is fixed at six months, although the affairs dealt with are entirely internal and local, six months has pro ved too short a time. A person who has a cause of grievance against the Customs to department should not be deprived of his right of action for at least twelve months, and as no great harm could result from making the suggested concession, the Minister could wisely concede the point.

I am sure that tlie clause is intended to apply only to civil matters, because of the use of the word ""defendant"" and other terms in connection with it, and I think the Minister will be going beyond tlie intention of the clause if he says ""proceedings"" will apply to any offences which are committed under the Bill. An officer may make a false statement, or help some one else to commit a crime, and I do not think there should be any statutory limitation to the liability of the officer for proceedings in such eases where other people are not similarly protected. I no not think the Minister will adhere to that provision when lie comes to consider it, but that he will limit the operation of the clause to civil matters. I do not think that an officer who commits an offence under this Bill should bo favoured simply because he is an officer, as his duty really ought to imj50.se a greater responsibility upon him than upon an outsider. I think the Minister will see that it is wrong to limit the officer's liability to proceedings being taken against him for criminal offences. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

It maj' be very difficult for the ship to depart. The winds, for instance, may be contrary. There should be some definition. The penalties in this Bill are altogether too severe.

When tbe Act from which this clause is copied was originally framed the word "" double "" was inserted, because ships with double bottoms were used for the purpose of conveying smuggled goods. If bottoms will only be regarded as false, if there is an attempt to disguise the nature of the cargo by the construction of the ship.

467,"Mr Mccay"" (Corinella)","I should likecases. Of course I quite understand its object, but I would like the Minister to look at clause 87, which provides thatNo person shall, except by authority, open any warehouse, or gain access to the goods therein. It seems to me that if any person without authority opened a warehouse which contained £20,000 worth of dutiable goods, having himself in that warehouse £ 5 worth, he might be liable to a penalty of £60,000. Of course that is not intended. Jf we look at other clauses we shall find some, in respect of which the maximum penalty is very high, and, as a consequence the minimum penalty becomes alarmingly large. I woidd draw the attention of the Minister to this fact. The more I look into the matter the more I am inclined to think that there is a lot in tlie objection raised by the honourable member for North Sydney, and that probably we shall have to give a larger discretion to our courts, particularly as regards the minimum penalty, when that minimum would be of tlie character referred to by the honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat. I think that that matter, however, would be more appropriately dealt in connection with the clause relating"" to the minimum. We need not be afraid of our courts in regard to the imposition of the maximum penalty, so long as they have the necessary power with regard to the minimum. necessary. we make the minimum penalty very high-the punishment being so severe-ther e will be a tendency to. let off a man who is guilty. Clause agreed to. Clauses 227 and 22S agreed to. Clause 229'.l?he minimum penalty for any offence against this Act shall be one-twentieth of the prescribed maximum. is a clause to which, on several occasions, I have called the attention of tbe Minister. Whilei t may be necessary-and is sometimes desirable-to have a high maximum penalty, because an attempt may be made to smuggle a large quantity of goods, and the fine imposed might not be at all in proportion to the offence I do not see that it is necessary to have any minimum penalty. Very minor offences are provided for in this. Bill, and it has been held as a very reasonable principle that an offence, even if committed unintentionally, and of a minor nature, shall'be made subject to a penalty, if, in the opinion of whoever has to determine the question, it merits it. Whilst that is so, there are offences for which a fine of £ 1 would be quite sufficient. to some extent. There are penalties of. £100, £ 5 0 , £ 2 0 , and £ 1 0 . would be ample for some of tlie offences under this B ill . The Bill contains some very strict provisions which do not take notice of error or inadvertence, or of the fact that I notice the point. there could be no disadvantage . to the Customs revenue by reason of the error which has been committed. But for the purpose of accuracy, and so that no firm shall shield itself behind an error, it has been considered necessary to render the parties making an error liable at any rate to a penalty. The extent to which they shall be liable must in every case depend upon circumstances. In some cases £ 1 would be a sufficient fine to impose, but other cases might require the imposition of the f u l l amount of £ 1 0 0 . As the range is a very large one-w e may go up to £20,000 or £30,000 under the maximum penaltyI do not see that there is any necessity at all to fix the minimum penalty. some minimum. because there is no relationship to the value of goods. The maximum penalty is fixed by the value of tlie goods. Of course there is a reason for that. ' If there was an attempt to smuggle or improperly pass a large quantity of goods, the advantage to be gained might be so great that an offender would require to be discovered ten times, and a fine of £ 1 0 0 im-. posed each time, before he lost the entire value of the goods. But three times the value of the goods is a very high maximum. There is an attempt made here to fix the minimum in proportion to the value of the goods, because it is provided that the minimum penalty shall be onetwentieth of the maximum penalty. there. shall be may very well be .left to* the 0",57,Honourable Member A Keg Of Better For The Minister To Put In The Word

Here we have the possibility of a man being"" fined heavily for some trifling offence for which a mere nominal fine of a few shillings would be amply sumcient. Why should that not be left to the discretion of the court ? I hope we shall not retain in the Bill this clause, providing a minimum penalty, or clause 242 which says that no minimum penalty imposed by this measure shall be liable to reduction under any power of mitigation. I hope the minimum penalty will be struck out altogether. looks at clause 229 he will see that that provision, relating to the minimum being one-twentieth, of the maximum, must refer to imprisonment for indictable offences as well as to pecuniary penalties. Division 2, Part 13, is headed with tlie word "" j>enalties."" If the right honourable gentleman looks at clause 218 he will find indictable offences provided for with imprisonment, not exceeding three years. Under clause 221 the penalty is imprisonment not exceeding four years. This provision is clearly applicable to punishments for indictable offences. In clause 243 a distinction is drawn, and pecuniary penalties are specifically mentioned. Undoubtedly under that clause the court would have no option, if it found a person guilty, but to inflict a penalty amounting to one-twentieth of the maxiI t is. not the usual mum penalty provided by the clause. Since hearing the Minister's explanation I am confirmed in my view that it would be better to strike out the clause altogether. I am specially convinced of that after the remarks of the honourable member for Indi. The Minister has argued that there are certain people who have such a low opinion of smuggling that, even when sitting on the Bench, they would be disinclined to impose a penalty at all, unless there was a minimum penalty which they must inflict. If that argument is a good one, it goes against allowing these cases to be tried in. the courts at all. The court has first to find the offence before it can inflict a penalty; and if the court has such an estimate of its duty and of the non-seriousness of smuggling, will it find the offence 1 Surelyi f we trust the court to find the offence we may trust it to impose the penalty, in which case Yes it there is no necessity for the minimum. Under the circumstances, and considering the trifling nature of some of these offences, and also considering, as the honourable member for Indi has pointed out, that the clause would refer to other than pecuniar}' penalties, it would be well to strike it out altogether. agree with the honourable member who",59,Honourable Member A Keg Of Better For The Minister To Put In The Word

Those who are familiar with such courts will know that as a rule they .are careful in properly discharging their -duty by finding the offence and coming to a -decision of guilty or not guilty, but there are many offences as to which, where tliey have a discretion as to the penalty, they inflict a mere contemptuous punishment from the point of view of smallness. Every one who has experience of courts of summary jurisdiction knows that they have a tendency to inflict very small penalties in regard to such matters as licensing and factories act offences, considering that they have done their duty in finding the offence proved. I think it would be better to have .a minimum. would be better to omit the clause. The remarks of the honourable member for In d i make it clear that the clause should come out. the court to inflict a penalty. Under clause -228, which has been adopted, it will be seen that any one twice convicted would be liable to imprisonment. It would be a very serious matter to permit this clause to pass as it stands. I would ask the Minister to reconsider it. Under clause 224, the minimum would be only 10s. That being . so, surely the minimum under the clause before the committee should not be more than 10s.; and why the Minister should endeavour to fix it at £ 2 I cannot understand. Mr .KINGSTON -As to the point made by the honourable member for Indi, the clause could be made clearer by inserting the word ""pecuniary"" and saying the ""minimum offence shall be so and so. I would ask the committee to consider, however, whether it is not wise that there should be some minimum 1 As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Corinella, justices of the peace very often approach a case in a spirit of opposition to tlie law, or having sympathy with the nature of the offence. They will not so far forget their duty as to openly flout the law or disregard the evidence in face of the plainest proof, but they will record a verdict against the -defendant, and at the same time manage to defeat the object and scope of the law by inflicting some ridiculous penalty altogether out of proportion to tlie nature of tbe offence, but merely expressive of their personal belief [163] that the law should not be as it is, and of their sympathy with the character of the offence.

We do that in a variety of ways. I think it will be found in the various States that in 90 per cent, of the Actsi t is a general rule to provide a minimum' in order to prevent abuses of the character to which I have referred. It is notorious that the general public often improperly extend sympathy to offenders against the revenue laws. The provision is, therefore, particularly necessary in this connection. I ask honourable members to insist upon the provision of a minimum, in order to give effect to a law which, owing to its special nature, and because of public sympathy with pecuniary penalty"" for any breaches of it, will be set aside if we relax any of the precautions ordinarily taken to give effect to other laws.

I do not think honourable members will blame us for sticking to what we believe to be right, until we are satisfied that some better proposition is made.

533,Mr Kingston,"No doubt, but therethink that what the Minister desires to get at could be reached by an amendment in another form. maximum which is stated in pounds sterling. clumsy way of doing it . In clause 5 it is provided that the penalty referred to at the foot of a section is the penalty to be inflicted for breaches of that section. In order to get at what the Minister desires, I would suggest that we should say that the minimum penalty for any offence against this Act shall be one-twentieth of the penalty referred to at the foot of the section. at the foot of every section. thought they were. The honourable member for Indi just now asked why should not the penalties have some relationship to tlie value of the goods. For this reason : That the offences here specified may be simple errors. For instance, making any entry which is false in any particular is one of the offences which may be made in connection with goods of very high value. It may be admittedly an error caused through inadvertence, and still the minimum penalty for that in the case of goods worth £10,000 would be £1,500, which would be absurd. There is, therefore, no relationship ; and, as the Minister says, the punishment cannot be made to fit the crime in dealing with a minimum penalty on a basis of the value of the goods. I am willing that the Minister's proposal should be accepted in the clause, and then when we come to divide upon the clause, as amended, we can strike it out altogether if we think f it to do so. My opinion is that in some of these cases in which a penalty of £ 1 0 0 is provided, while that might be a reasonable penalty where there is a deliberate attempt to evade duty, it would not be reasonable where there is simply an' error made. The error is no worse in a case where £ 1 0 0 penalty is provided for than it would be in connection with an offence for which only £ 1 0 penalty is provided. If the offence is a deliberate one it is worse in cases in which is imposed to make the distinction, but if it is only an error it is no worse in some of the cases in which maximum penalties are provided for than in cases where only a minimum penalty is provided for. I would prefer to see the clause omitted altogether, and next to that I would prefer the Minister's proposal for a minimum of £ 2 . would be to make the clause read as followsThe minimum pecuniary penalty for anjoffence against this Aet shall be one-twentieth of tbe maximum whioh is prescribed in pounds sterling. right honourable and learned member would have to amend the penalties right through. mum 1 ber for North Sydney is not laying so much I stress upon the extravagance of the minimum in reference to cases where the amount is specified, but he has pointed out that the minimum in cases where the goods are of very considerable value might be so t high as to have a disastrous effect. If we agree to the clause in the waj' I propose I think the difficulty will be entirely removed, and the question of the value of the goods will not-interfere in the slightest, because although the maximum is raised on account of the value of the goods the minimum will still remain one-twentieth of the penalty as expressed in pounds sterling within the four corners of the Bill. I move That after the word ""minimum,"" line 1, the word ""pecuniary"" be inserted. Mr Y. L. SOLOMON (South Australia) This clause has been twisted about Until one hardly knows what it is intended to convey. In spite of what the Minister has said about the unreliability of some courts in Australia, and their sympathy with certain classes of offences, I still think that if we are going to give these courts jurisdiction in regard to this Customs Act, it would be better to strike out altogether this clause referring to a minimum penalty. The Minister told us he was quite willing to reduce the minimum to £2, but in the alteration of the clause now under consideration he proposes to provide in the bulk of the cases for a minimum of £5. For instance, take the penalties which tlie higher penalty may be imposed for offences under clause 220. We have under that clause a penalty of £100 provided for, and what are the offences 1 Any person who shall make any entry which is false in any particular.",62,Edward Braddon Spli T The Dif Months I N Resj>Ect Of Offences Which Might

542,Mr Kingston,"The honourable memI t was suggested when the clause was before the committee that we should put in some word to signify that it must be a wilful making of a false entry, and that there must be some improper intention. That was fought, if I may so describe it, tooth and nail by the Minister, and now if a false entry is made, without any intention to defraud, and as a mere mistake, the minimum penalty that can be inflicted by the courts under this clause 229, as the -Minister now proposes to amend it, will be one-twentieth of £100, or £ 5 . That will be the fine for a mere error in an entry which is false in even the smallest particular, some simple error for which probably a fine of £ 1 would be suflicient in order to make the importer a little more careful in future in his Customs work. Then we come to another offence described as "" misleading any officer in any particular likely to affect the discharge of his duty."" it is not a wilful misleading of any officer, but if in answering interrogations by a Customs officer, something is said which misleads him, the minimum penalty will be £ 5 . too much whisky would, under that clause, be misleading him so as to render him unable to discharge Ids duty. way of misleading him. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Then we come to another clause to which I direct the special attention of the Minister. Under paragraph (h) of clause 220 it is provided that no person shallSell or offer for sale any poods upon the pretence that such goods are prohibited imports or smuggled goods, and the penalty for the offence is £100. only mention this to ask the Ministeri f he has considered if that offence is properly included in this Customs Act, and whether it is not rather an offence provided for by our common law-misrepresentatio n in the sale of goods. Hasi t really any place in this Customs Bill at all ? I direct the attention of the honourable and learned member for In d i and other legal members of the committee to that particular point. I know that in some of the States something similar has been adopted. MrV . L . SOLOMON I am perfectly aware of that, and it has never been questioned ; but I doubt very much whether it has any right in this Customs Bill direct the Minister's attention to that in passing. I think it would be most unjust to limit the power of the .court in such a way that it must inflict a fine of at least £ 5 for making an entry which is false in the slightest particular, whether it is wilfully done or not. I would suggest to the committee that the easiest, best, and safest way is to strike out the clause, for which there is no necessity. If we can trust the courts to inflict penalties up to £100-penaltie s up to three times the value of the goods, which may mean thousands of pounds-w e can surely trust them also in their discretion to inflict extremely light fines without fixing the amount of the minimum which they shall be bound to impose. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -As the Minister seems desirous that there should be a minimum penalty, and that the clause should not be omitted, I would urge him to fix the penalty at what he offered a little time ago to adopt, namely, £40. There is one case I spoke about privately to him. Under clause 175 a vessel hovering within one league of the coast is bound to depart; and if the captain, who may not know that he is required to do so, does not get away within twelve hoursand he may not be able to get away in consequence of the wind-h e is liable to a penalty of £100. There are the instances which were mentioned by the hist speaker, with which I quite agree, and for -which clause 220 provides a penalty of £100. I would point out to the Minister that, under clause 224, where any penalties are not provided for in any clauses, the parties offending are liable to a penalty of I £10, so that he may find very much more heinous offences committed which are not provided for under this clause, and for which tlie maximum penalty provided under that is £ 1 0 . Minister is quite right. The matter would be met by the suggestion made earlier in the day by the Minister, that the minimum should be fixed at £ 2 . It would be very acceptable to the whole committee. mind the Minister that when many of these clauses were read, and the penalties inflicted at the end were pointed out-and I merely clause 229 was also pointed out to him-h e",63,Edward Braddon Spli T The Dif Months I N Resj>Ect Of Offences Which Might

I certainly was under that impression. said he would look into the matter, and would, in all probability, reduce them-no t do away with them. member that I drew attention tovery many of these clauses at the time, and pointed out the nature of the penalty. I was under the impression that he was going to do as I have stated. If I had not been under that impression I would have-taken exception to very many of the clauses. I have a lot of the clauses marked where the penalty is £ 1 0 0 ; in fact, I think the Minister got rather annoyed because I brought up the matter so many times. For instance, as regards one clause, it was shown that the penalty was £ 1 0 0 , and when I understood that the minimum was to be £100, because the n a n might wilfully commit the offence, I was willing to allow it to stand, but where it was shown that it was done through some error, although it might only be shown afterwards, then, of course, it would be quite unfair to exact the minimum penalty of £ 5 . Again, under clause 37, which provides that the entry shall be passed by tlie collector signing the same, we find that the slightest mistake involves a penalty of £ 1 0 0 . Now tlie minimum penalty is to be £ 5 . Again, clauses 47 and 50 provided for a minimum penalty of £100. I certainly understood that it was the intention of the Minister to consider all these penalties. I ask him to consider whether he did not lead honourable members to the supposition that there was no necessity to go on discussing the minimum penalties in that way, from the fact that he intended to deal with clause 229 ? I ask him to consider whether he did not say something which led to the formation of that idea 1 He will remember how often I called attention to them, otherwise I should have debated many of them most strongly. I have marked clauses 67, 69, 105, 107, 112 and 117, where the penalty is £ 1 0 0 . For instance, such a thing as the exportation of an article worth 10s. in value would lead to a minimum penalty of £ 5 , and if exported in a ship of less than 50 tons register, under clause 107 the minimum penalty is £ 5 . It was intended to get at gross cases which might occur, and even in those cases it was thought that a penalty of £ 1 0 0 would be sufficient where it was wilfullydone. Andi n a mere case of omission, where the Minister was first satisfied that there might be something in the charge and started an action, and it was clearly shown in court that was not the case, the clauses have been drawn so strictly that there can be no escape from them. I have similar clauses marked. I have not marked clauses 50 and 60 as ones I have called attention to. I have half-a-dozen clauses marked which I called attention to and which the Minister promised to reconsider; and it was done in connection with clauses 224 and 229. I think that the Minister having got all the clauses through on that understanding-certainl y but for that a debate would have taken place upon them-ough t now to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney. I think the honourable member for Melbourne himself drew attention to clause 224. much difference between £ 2 and £ 5 . The Minister has been very good, and let him have his way. question of letting the Minister have his way. If the thing is right, he ought to have his way, but if it is not right he ought not to have his way simply because he is the Minister. It may be very well for honourable members on the other side, who may be under subjection, to take that view. I can quite understand them responding to the crack of the whip. When I allowed so many clauses to go through under what I thought was a distinct promise from the Minister, I feel, and he himself knows it, that he is going back on his word. I will put it in another way, and say that the Minister has forgotten what he himself stated. But I have known him to do it so many times that there ought to be no excuse for him. I have over twelve or thirteen clauses marked, to which I drew the attention of the Minister, and if that is not calling attention to the matter often enough, I would like to know what is. The Minister having got all these clauses through, and we not being in a position to reconsider the penalties, he now says"" Very well, I shall stick to this,"" and puts",64,Edward Braddon Spli T The Dif Months I N Resj>Ect Of Offences Which Might

I would suggest that the Minister should take a vote of the committee, if necessary, when I think he will find the committee will support him. leading the House is a very serious one, and if I thought I deserved it , I should injustice in the public courts of the country. deed be sorry; but I do not tliink that any honourable member, other than the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, would for a moment support such an accusation. Under the circumstances, I shall best consult my own dignity by saying nothing further on the point. I assure the honourable and learned member that he is mistaken. The promise I gave to the honourable member for North Sydney, I have most faithfully performed. The idea was that when we got to this clause, we should fight the matter out on the general question of whether there was to be a minimum. We are now fighting the matter out, and I trust the Government are not doing, and never will do, anything to merit censure of tlie description suggested by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. may say at once that I quite acquit the Minister of having deceived me in any way. Mi'. KINGSTON -The Minister would not try, which is better. Minister of even having tried to deceive me. I raised the question at an early stage, during tlie second reading debate, and subsequently on some of the clauses, and I always understood that when we came to the minimum penalty clause, the Minister would take it into consideration, with the view o? arranging that there' sliould not be anything like the tremendous penalties for which the clause provides. Under the circumstances I thought of going to a division to test the question of leaving the matter entirely to the courts, but now I shall let the matter pass, if the -Minister introduces his proposed amendments. quite .touched by the way in which the committee has vindicated the Minister in this matter, but I have some degree of hesitancy in allowing the clause to go without expressing my regret that the Ministeri n charge of the Bill should have made so many serious chargesagainst persons engaged in the administration of justice. It is veiy easy for us to be on our dignity and stand by one another in this Chamber when there is the slightest suspicion of any conduct as affecting the Minister, but I am not one of those who can sit here and listen to imputations on persons sworn to administer I look on that as a much more important matter than the delicate interchange we have just witnessed. I consider that the Minister has made statements which will seriously undermine the confidence of the people in our courts. That is, if the people pay the slightest attention to those statement. I wish my right honourable friend to quite understand that. No fashion should be set by Ministers of the Crown in this Chamber in -the way of disparaging the honest discretion of persons acting in a judicial capacity. It is a very easy thing to do, and, at the same time, it is a thing to avoid. My right honourable friend was veiy much in earnest in the opinion he expressed, and I know his thoroughness too well to believe that he otherwise would have consented to the very large surrender he has made in this matter of penalties.. If the benches who deal with these matters are capable of, or show a disposition to take a side against constitutional authority with a view to looking leniently on offences, some of which amount to fraud, against the Customs, is it not a pity that tlie Minister should not have taken upon himself the whole of the jurisdiction as the one righteous person who could administer everything from a high standard of justice 1 Wouldi t",65,Edward Braddon Spli T The Dif Months I N Resj>Ect Of Offences Which Might

I think my right honorableancl learned friend will admitthatlie did; although it is just possible that this is another ment, together possibly with the insertion misunderstanding. Of course if my honourable friends opposite are satisfied everything is over,.but I must claim some consideration for honourable members on this side, and if the Minister does not deny that he promised to reduce tbe minimum penalty to £ 2 I think some explanation is due. round mininuin of £2, but it was pointed out that a £ 2 minimum was too high in cases where the maximum penalty was fixed at £10, so what we did was to provide for a reduction proportionate to the maximum.

The honourable member for North Sydney was chiefly interested, and he expressed his willingness to accept that alteration. bourne) 1 have been dragged into this matter in some way. The position was that the Minister did suggest a £ 2 minimum, but it was a suggestion, and not a promise. Upon that being offered, opposition was raised, and a desire expressed to strike out the clause altogether. Between the time of tlie offer and the discussion taking place on the question of omitting the clause, tlie Minister, I suppose, found out something, and thought it advisable to alter what he had originally suggested. I still think the Minister was wrong, but being an easy-going individual, and seeing that the Minister has been very good during the discussion on the Bill, I thought it was not wise to press the matter.

The effect of my amendof the words, "" whichever may be the lesser amount"" at the end of the clause, will be that the minimum will be fixed at £ 2 , or one-twentieth of the prescribed amount of the fine, whichever amount may be the lesser. That is to say that, in the case of a £100 fine it will be perfectly competent for I suggested an all the court to reduce the penalty to £ 2 , but, in the case of a £ 2 0 maximum it will be quite competent for the court to reduce tbe penalty to one-twentieth of that amount.

My reason for this amendment is that I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Trade and Customs made a distinct promise to me with regard to these clauses. He led me to understand that there would be a reduction of the minimum penalty. That is why I am willing to accept the minimum of £ 2 ' I will give way to that extent.

I thought the right honourable gentleman would make a greater, reduction, but some red notion there must be if the Minister intends to keep faith with me. He cannot expect me to accept any statement whatever from him if he does not reduce the minimum ,, able and learned member must know that a statement of that kind is disorderly. He must not impute improper motives to the Minister. I s aid that the Minister cannot expect me to accept any statement of his if no reduction is made in-the minimum Afte r what the right honourable gentleman said to me when he led me to believe that the minimum would be diminished-h e did not say by how much, it is perfectly correct, but that some reduction would be made-h e cannot expect-me to believe any future statement of his if he does not reduce it . . 1 should have raised objections to many of the clauses, and should have moved that reductions be made, but I did not discuss them, because of this promise winch the Minister made to me. I let the clauses go on this assurance from the Minister, which he gave to me not once, but half-a-dozen times. As the clauses came up I said, "" I expect there will be an amendment with regard to this,"" and the Minister said he would consider them all. I am sure honourable members must-recollect how many times I mentioned the matter. Now the clauses have all gone through, and I cannot get at them. They are to stand as they have been passed. The Minister himself knows how often I appealed to him about them. Now, however, he says that he will not go back upon them. That is what it means. We cannot have that kind of thing done by Ministers of the Crown. Honourable members opposite who laugh apparently believe that no one should accept the word of a Minister of the Crown. Those honourable members have had a great deal more than I have had. It is perfectly clear that the .committee are not with me on this point, and are determined to have a minimum of £ 5 . If that is so, there is the Minister promise no more to be said; but the next time the Minister for Trade and Customs wishes to have the discussion on any clause postponed, I hope that some one else will make the remarks which are necessary. I may then be able to accept them. Amendment negatived. toThat the word ""prescribed"" be omitted. That the words "" which is prescribed iu pounds"" be insertsd after the word "" maximum.""

The only cases excluded from courts of summary jurisdiction however are those in which the penalty is over £500. not exceed £ 5 0 0 the case may be instituted in any court of summary jurisdiction. is for a pecuniar}' penalty, we go to the higher court. all cases, may be taken to the High Court; courts ? but when tlie penalty does not exceed £500, or the excess is abandoned-indictable offences. exceeding £500. value of the goods might exceed £500. the case of an indictable offence we. cannotsay it is in regard to a penalty exceeding £500. this is a penalty which does not exist. However, I think we can make the clause clearer. for me. As the honourable and learned member for Corio has said the provision as' to summary jurisdiction in relation to monetary fines applies with greater force to other penalties, and I think that the right honourable and learned gentleman should consider whether it would not be well to insert in clause 230 the word ""pecuniary"" before ""penalty."" MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). -Unde r this clause it is entirely at the option of the Customs authorities in instituting proceedings to reduce their claim if it is larger than £500 in order to bring it within the scope of a court of summary jurisdiction. A court of summary jurisdiction includes a justices' court, such as we were told by the Minister, a little while ago, was in some cases hardly trustworthy in questions affecting the revenue. Thus, these cases in which a penalty of £ 5 0 0 is sought, may be tried by a court consisting of justices who cannot, in some instances, be relied upon to inflict a minimum fine, and provision for a minimum fine has to be set down in the B ill in cold black and white without even stipulating that it shall be a £5-note. The Minister of Customs is to have the power-and as an important point turns on this I would invite the attention of my honourable and learned friends, the member reverse. for East Sydney and the member for In d i to institute proceedings involving a penalty of £ 5 00 before justices in courts which under the present State legislation are not in some instances permitted to have a jurisdiction up to. £100. member think it more merciful to the people MrV .

638,Mr Kingston,"Does not the honorableof the good points, and one of the improvements which people were looking forward to. Althoughi t may suit the Customs authorities to bring cases of this description, involving a penalty of £500, before one of the very inferior courts we have heard about, the defendant who may be made liable for such a sum should undoubtedly have the discretion of removing his case to a higher court if he pleases. If there is anything in the argument as to cheapness and speediness, and that it is for his protection, the defendant should at least have the right, if he chooses, to elect that his case shall be tried by.a Supreme Court or by the High Court if the amount is £ 5 0 0 or anything like it . T would ask the Minister whether he sees any objection to provide, either as an addition to this clause or in another clause after it, that a defendant may have the right to elect to have his case tried in a higher court if he is not satisfied with the court of summary jurisdiction ? While the Customs department as prosecutors may retain the right provided here to bring the case in a lower court, tlie defendant should have the absolute right, with as little expense and trouble as possible, to remove the case and have it tried by a court of higher jurisdiction, such as the Supreme Court of a State or the High Court of Australia. like it , but I will get a clause of the kind drafted for the honourable member. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I have given undivided attention to the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, and I have carefully weighed his expressions on this matter. He has dealt out a sledge-hammering to the Minister for Trade and Customs for even casting the slightest bit of reflection upon the honorary magistrates. Isi t not clear to the committee that the honourable member, who is himself a magistrate, is impliedly .siding with the law-breakers in inviting us here to make this change? I leave it to my lionorable friend, and ask how he can explain his own conduct in delaying the committee at such a late hour, when we are all anxious to get home, and in keeping me here when I ought to be in bed. promise, I do not like the idea of a compulsory power of removal, but I will prepare a clause for the honourable member, and he may move it if he desires to do so. To meet the objection of the honourable and learned member for Indi, I move That the words ""penalty does not exceed,"" in line 6, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""prosecution is for a pecuniary penalty not exceeding."" MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I accept the offer of tlie Minister for Trade and Customs to draft a clause giving the defendant the power I have suggested. I will have an opportunity at a later stage of the Bill to test the feeling of the committee upon it . that under section 245, where the penalty inflicted is over £200, the person fined may, where the penalty is not paid, be imprisoned for one year, and this clause 243, therefore, will practically allow a court of summary jurisdiction to imprison a man for a year. W it h regard to costs, I point out that in all Customs prosecutions the court may award any costs against any party or claimant, and if people are willing to go to a higher court, I think there is every reason why this liberty should be granted to them. The difficulty with me is that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr ""V"". L . Solomon, has accepted the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs. I had a statement before from the Minister, and I do not know how far it goes. However, as tlie honourable member, Mr ""V. L . Solomon, is willing to accept the offer of the Minister to draft a clause, I will now let it go. I hope we shall pass this clause, because it provides for what I think is very propera cheap and speedy form of obtaining justice on the part of the Customs department. The procedure as laid down here will enable the Customs department when they think fit, and only when they think fit, to take prosecutions up to £ 5 0 0 in these lower courts. It is not absolutely mandatory, it is permissive, and no doubt the Customs department may be trusted, where there is' not a good and sufficient reason to prosecute in the lower court, to go to a higher. Amendment agreed to. out to me that the definition of a summary court of jurisdiction might prevent recourse being had to county courts, district courts, and local courts.
