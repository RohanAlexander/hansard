TheA t present we are in . the unfortunate position of having more land available there than is required by the few who desire it . But such might not be the case if the railways I have mentioned State. were constructed. The Minister for Works and Bailways, writing in the suspicion Farmers' Advocate of the 30th May last, bears out what I have said respecting the I do not go so far quality of the landfor We pushed on to Ryan's Well, 82 miles from Alice Springs, and came to the Nickers' aphomestead.

We went can arise if the over, and had a look at the sheep. They weTe in good condition, although shut up every many night, and only let out to graze in the day are seeking land they may time. Mr Nicker, in reply to questions from saved considerable expense by me, said if he could get fencing and means of of the ballot system. sinking dams on 20,000 acres, he would gladly surrender the remainder of his lease of 300,000 acres, and' would be far better off disappointed. financially. That shows that if improvements, such Unless as railways, are provided, what is to-day a living area for one man only will support ten or twelve families. I hope that the Minister w ill see fit to include in the B ill a clause requiring personal residence on the part of the land-holders. The two greatest curses of every country have been Only those successthe absentee landlord and the land monopolist. Residential conditions are imposed upon the agriculturist, but in his case there is no necessity for them. By that course enormous expense The agriculturist cannot afford to be' abI have been sent from his property, but the grazier is in an entirely different position. It is, IfI had however, in dealing with the grazier that the evils of absenteeism are to be perhave petuated. If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), one can only say that the policy of the Government respecting the Northern Territory is in ir. New South opposition to the idea of a living area, and that the Ministry stands for the land monopolist. It is regrettable that Ministers have not the capacity to realize the great possibilities of the Northern Territory. It may be said that no one wants this land, but that might have been said of all the land in Australia in the early days of this country. One hundred years ago no one wanted the great areas of valuable land which are now eagerly sought after. Had some such provision as that now desired by the honourable member for the Northern Territory been made in the earlier land laws of Australia, instead of our State railways being run at a loss, and taking a heavy toll from the pockets of the taxpayers, what was the intention when they were constructed, namely, that they would open up the country adjacent to the line and assist in the development of the country. railways sufficient to settle 100,000,000 people, if the land adjacent to those railways were made available for settlement. Unfortunately, that land has been locked up. land in the Northern Territory from those who are most desirable as settlers, and who w ill be seeking it once the railways are constructed.. The construction of railways in . the Northern Territory is nearer realization than many imagine. The further we get away from the war period, the greater will become the financial resources of the Commonwealth, and so it w ill be possible to provide money to carry out these works. For that reason I ask the Minister to favourably consider this proposal. It is based upon the experience and the failures of past Land Actsi n the various States. We cannot possibly provide for the efficient settlement of any areas of land unless the principle of a living area is accepted. is fundamental to successful settlement, and it is hypocrisy and humbug to talk of land settlement without it . It is the keystone of successful land settlement. Side by side with that is the necessity for personal residence on the part of the landholders. his family should be forced to live 70 or 80 miles away from a settlement, and remain on the land during the whole of the year. erect a residence on the land, and to reside there for at least one half of each year. His wife and children could be domiciled in an adjacent township. A few years ago 100 miles was a great distance, but to-day it is less than half a day's journey by motor car. We, on this side, are not hide-bound in regard to residence conditions, and do not want to impose, undue hardships on women and children, but it is ridiculous to talk about land settlement if the land-holders are permitted to hold land without any restrictions whatever being placed on them. affected include only 3,000 square miles. Senator Pearce, the Minister controlling the Northern Territory, told me that this morning. deference to the Ministeri n another place, I would prefer to hear what the Ministeri n this Chamber has to .say regarding that matter. I suggest to We have built in Australia the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) that he should seek furthe r information respecting this matter from the Minister. I hope that the Minister w ill accept the proThisB ill proposes to lock up the posal of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. It is put forward because we on this side realize that it is futile to attempt land settlement if a living area is not provided, as well as adequate safeguards against absenteeism. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [12.44] I have no desire to delay the passage of this B ill , and realize that there are men in this Chamber who have been brought more closely into touch with the possibilities and difficulties of the Northern Territory than I have. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) should know what he is talking about in connection with this matter, and I listened with interest to his remarks. From the speakers on both sides of the That HouseI have gained valuable information concerning the Northern Territory. Unless we alter the clause we may create very grave dangers in the future by perpetuating a condition of land monopoly that has retarded the progress of every State of Australia. I give credit to I do not mean that a man and honourable members-o n whichever side of the House they sit-for not wishing to perpetuate_ those evils. We ought to be very careful in considering the The lessee should be required to B ill , and, if we can do anything to prevent land monopoly, we should do it .

It was only after the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) supported m y contention that the honourable member for Wakefield admitted that he was wrong. able member for Kooyong all the time. ber flatly contradicted my contention before the honourable member for Kooyong delivered his speech. I can quite understand the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Wakefield for this B ill . He was a member of the South Australian Parliament at the time the Northern Territory was taken over by the CommonI wealth Government, and he then did everything in his power to protect the in terests of the big pastoralists, and to prevent the Commonwealth Government from resuming any of their Northern Territory leases. He is adopting a similar attitude now. I ask the Committee not to regard these leases as they would leases in the southern States, which rarely exceed in area 100 square miles. In the Northern Territory the leases comprise 10,000 and 12,000 sajuare miles. Instead of allowing the lessee to nominate his successor to those portions of the leases which he will relinquish by subdivision, all persons deI f a man of outstanding sirous of settling on the land should have If an equal opportunity of getting blocks. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning)' dealt exhaustively w it h the ballot system, and mentioned that for one piece of land in New South Wales there were as many as 3,000 and 4,000 applicants. That is all the greater reason why we should make available the huge tracts of land in the Northern Territory, and so relieve the congestion of applications in the southern States. I am convinced that once the productive And the man with the possibilities of the Northern Territory were demonstrated there would not be 3,000 and 4,000 people scrambling for one piece of land in a southern State. The honourable member's only objection, to fche ballot system is that a lot of undesirable applicants are included. There is nothing to prevent the Government ensuring' by regulation that only bona fide settlers shall be eligible for the ballot, and thus exclude persons applying merely for purposes of speculation. The Minister asked the Leader of the Opposition to tell hi m what clause 58 means. me what the honourable member's amendment means. two years before 1935, when the first resumption will become due, the holders of big areas of 20,000 and '30,000 square",30,Northern Territory Crown Ment To Link Up Farther The Queensland Lands Bill

The reasons for the amendment are that sub-clause 1 of thc clause enumerates the various public and other purposes for -which resumptions may be made, and it is therefore unnecessary to place further ""reasons for resumptions ""covered by those purposes before Parliament.

52,Mr Stewart (Wimmera,"Ministe rI t is proposed to extend the existing telephone exchange buildings, situated at the corner of Northgate-street and Bellevueavcime, Unley, and at the corner of Queen-street and East-parade, Norwood, South Australia, to provide for the establishment of automatic telephone exchanges. Automatic switching systems, having an immediate equipment of 5,500 subscribers' lines at Unley, and 5,700 at Norwood, with ultimate capacities of 9,400 and 8,900 lines respectively, are to be installed. These will afford sufficient accommodation to meet anticipated developments in Unley and Norwood. In addition, it is intended to provide heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, dehumidifying, air-washing, and compressed-air cleaning plant at each of the exchanges. The proposed building extensions will be of brick, harmonizing in design with the existing structures. These exchanges are urgently required, for the reason that the existing apparatus cannot cope with the development iu the respective areas, and it is imperative that a f u l l automatic system be established in each case to satisfy the demands of prospective subscribers. The annual revenue, based on the actual or estimated number of line connexions on the undermentioned dates, is as follows:Unley. Norwood. 30th June, 1023 (actual) 1st January, 1925 (estimated) 1st January. 1930 (estimated) ' The estimated cost of the respective schemes, excluding cost of premises existing at present, is as under:Unley. Norwood. been subjected to great inconvenience. Buildings Ventilating, heating, dehumidifying, compressed«ir cleaning, vacuum cleaning, washing plant, electric light and power Automatic telephone equipment and external line plant Honourable members will observe that the provision of the telephone plant itself represents the 'greater portion of the estimated expenditure. I lay on the table the plans and specifications required by the Act. Mr Stewart. The facilities covered by this motion are long overdue. In Soutli Australia, considerable inconvenience has been caused to business people .and others because of their inability to secure the necessary telephonic conveniences. While the works covered by the motion are certainly very urgent, I regret that provision is not to be made for an automatic telephonic exchange for the western suburban district of Adelaide. I have repeatedly brought under the notice of the Government the necessity for such an exchange. At pre-' sent, there is serious congestion in connection with the telephonic services in' that district. Not only are persons desirous of obtaining telephonic connexions being put to considerable inconvenience, but subscribers are being penalized because of the excessive rental they are called upon to pay by reason of their premises being so far from the Central Exchange. People living in districts 4 miles from the Central Exchange have to pay higher rents for telephones than those liviug in more distant places provided with local exchanges. The works proposed at Norwood and Unley are very necessary, and should be regarded as urgent.. I am glad that at this late hour the Government is prepared to submit the question to the Public Works Committee, and I hope that the Committee will not unduly delay the presentation of its re£10,454: £14,820 port.

53,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [3.28],"future, instead of having cause to complain, we shall applaud the Government for endeavouring to provide a satisfactory and adequate service. [3.35] -As the districts mentioned in the motion happen to be in my electorate, I should like to express my appreciation of the Government's action in submitting the motion to the House. I know, probably as well as does the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), the difficulties that have been experienced for some years past in connection with telephone communication in that district. I have received many complaints and requests for an improved system, and I know that the extensions proposed will be heartily welcomed. I would like to pay a tribute to the postal authorities in my State. in that State has to me to be extraordinarily good. I the telephone systems in all the States of Australia, and while I do not say it for the sake of making an invidious comparison, I have not found any system in which the telephone attendants render a better service than they give in my State. That, to some extent, must be due to the control exercised over the employees by the Deputy Postmaster General. ment for what it has done-the concession is somewhat belated-and expressing my gratitude for it , I would like to endorse what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said regarding other parts of Adelaide. I know something about those parts, because I happen to reside in the district represented by the honourable inember for Adelaide( Mr Yates). I have no doubt that he often expresses the official views of that district, although .he may not always express my views. I hope that the difficulties which have existed in my district in the past will be greatly removed by the motion now submitted, and that improvements in other parts of Adelaide will follow. I am glad that the Government has submitted the motion, and I hope that the House will pass it readily. I do not oppose the motion, but I remind the Government that there are other parts of Australia needing attention. The State from which I come supplies nearly half the revenue of the Commonwealth, [61] and yet we cannot obtain facilities equal to those given to a little place like Boothby. Tasmania, no doubt, will . shortly come along with grievances, and w ill want additional exchanges. It is very nice of the South Australians to form a "" Mutual Admiration Society"" and tap the Minister on the back. I would like to have ah opportunity of doing it , too. I hope the Government will honour the promise made to me in this House some time ago that a post office would be erected at South Kensington, near Maroubra Bay, and that the construction of an exchange at Randwick would be expedited. A congested population exists in those districts, but while we have received promises from the Minister, and nice letters from the Department, nothing has been done. I hope there will be no more of The telephone system this pandering to South Australia, and always seemed withholding of justice from the State that supplies most of the revenue. South have personally had experience of Australia should not be too greedy. Honourable members interjecting. If honourable members do not attend to the call of the Chair for order,, the Chair will have to take its own course, and for whatever ensues honourable members will be responsible. While thanking the Governwill look into the proposals I have mentioned. For the South Kensington post office land has been secured, but nothing has been done. A t Randwick hundreds of people have been trying to obtain telephones, but replies from the Postmaster General say that the switchboard is f u l l , and u n t i l the new exchange is built the requests cannot be granted. Members of this House, irrespective of party, do not object to money being spent on extending telephone services and building post-offices. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) has been fortunate in getting a large exchange for his district. It was mainly owing to his efforts that the exchange was sanctioned. I hope the Minister will assist me in getting a post office at South Kensington and a telephone exchange at B.andwick. am pleased that the Minister has submitted this motion. It is necessary that every facility should be provided for telephonic and telegraphic services, not only rn South Australia, but also in every other State.

68,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [3.54],"r -Ithe corporation of Thebarton, South Australia, for assistance by way of a road grant were received. The matter affects every metropolitan local governing body. The corporation of Thebarton represented to the Home and Territories Department that although the Commonwealth Oovernment owned property in the municipality, and made good uso of the corporation roads and other facilities, it conquestion raises a very big issue which will tributed nothing towards the maintenance of roads, and paid no -taxes. Honourable members know that motor and other vehicles of the Postmaster-General's Department use the public highways in every municipality, and, so far as the corporation of Thebarton is concerned, the roadways are also used to a large extent in the conveyance of material required for the construction of War Service Homes. The State Bank of South Australia is the constructing authority for War Service Homes, but it operates as the agent of the Commonwealth Government. In consequence of the amount of traffic that goes over the roads of the municipality they have in a number of cases fallen into a state of disrepair. The Commonwealth Government is responsible for this in no inconsiderable degree, and the corporation requested some assistance from it to effect necessary repairs. The reply received' can only be regarded as an evasion. The Government stated that the War Service Homes were being built by the State Bank, and that the Government was not responsible for any road troubles that had occurred in consequence of that work. It provides the money for building the homes, however, and it must accept its share of responsibility. I trust that the Prime Miuister will give me an assurance that the Government will seriously consider rendering some assistance to the corporation of Thebarton, and to all corporations in a similar position, to enable them to maintain their roads in a proper way. The Government contributes towards the upkeep of country roads, aud it is only reasonable to expect it to contribute towards the maintenance of the roads which it uses so largely in the metropolitan area. Motor traffic has greatly ' increased the difficulties of road .maintenance, and much of the Government transport is accomplished by means of motors. In these circumstances I hope the Government will favourably consider my request. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.55] I shall discuss the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh with the Mmister for Home and Territories, and it will receive consideration by the Government, The amount involved in the specific case which he raises would not be very great, but the general need serious consideration.
