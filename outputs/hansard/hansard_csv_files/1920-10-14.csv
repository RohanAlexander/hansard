22,Mr Prowse,"The honourable mempresent time. I can see in it nothing of the kind suggested by the Prime Minister (Mir. Hughes) during the last general election, when he told the people that since Australia was a producing country we could hope to shift our burden of debt only )>y the stimulation of production. The old methods adopted by the most antiquated Governments are followed in 'this national balance-sheet. We find the Government resorting to the levying of heavy duties on the goods that are consumed by the people, as well as to additional taxation, without any discrimination as to the form or incidence of that taxation, so that it falls most inequitably upon the shoulde|rs of some, while it lightens the burdens of others. There is no hisjh road to prosperity except that, of production in Australia. There is no artificial means of arriving at prosperity by the juggling of funds or taxation. This is essentially a producing country. Our public debt to-day, owing largely to the war and also to extravagant administration in the past, is a very heavy one to be borne by onr small population. I do not wish, however, to sound a pessimistic note. I have as much faith in the potentialities of Australia as has any citizen of the Commonwealth. I believe that it is possible for us to get r i d of this burden cf debt if we get to work properly, but I clo not see in this Budget any attempt on the part of the Government to properly 'set about the task. We find combines in all directions.. have a. combine of labour to> defend its interests-to highest price that it is possible to extract from the community and to give as little as possible of its commodity. merchants-the also in combination, ""with the object of extracting as much as they can from those who must pay them for their We find these two combines working hand and glove to impose upon themselves a heavy burden of Customs duties, which essentially bring up the cost of living, although, for some reason, they do not appear to recognise that fact. think the Government one moment to contend that the increased duties for which the Tariff schedule recently submitted are necessary for protective They are really proposed as a short cut to additional revenues for an Government, utterly regardless of whether Mr Prowse. such duties will help or hinderthe Commonwealth. It is to me singular that men who complain of the high cost of living will back up these high duties. We find the two combines to which I have referred, desiring to obtain foodstuffs from the primary producers of Australia ' for less than it is possible to obtain those supplies in any other part of the world. They are combining against 'the producers, and by means of heavy levies they place upon their shoulders burdens which make it hard for them to compete with other countries. It is urged in this House that onr primary ' products, in respect of which there is no Protection whatever, shall be given to the members of these two Combines, because of the force of their power, and the number of .their votes, for less than' they can be obtained elsewhere. That is the demand made in respect of sugar, jam, butter, bread, and meat. All these things we in Australia are asked to supply to these two great Combines for less than they can be obtained in any other country. We primary producers have not asked for a Protective Tariff for our industries. We ask the Government to call tenders for the food supplies of the people; and'we know that if they do we shall be the successful tenderers every time. Australia being essentially a primary producing country, it should be the first We duty of this or any other Government so to exert themselves as to stimulate our sell its commodity at the natural resources in order that we may cover our national debt. But what do we find? What, for instance, is the position We find the in regard to taxation ? Every one knows suppliers of the peoplethat the revenue of the primary producer, . whether he be a producer of butter, sugar, f r u it , or wheat,-is spasmodic This year wares. he may make a loss; next year lie may make a couple of hundred pounds, and so on. Assume that such a man, in this spasmodic fashion, receives £10,000 in five years, and compare his position w i th I do not that of a member of the medical profeswill attempt for sion, or a Judge, or other salaried man, who can regulate his income at £2,000 a year, and thus has an income of £10,000 to the House provides in. respect of the same five-year period. purposes. We have these two citizens of the same country, speaking the same language, reimpecunious ceiving £10,000 in five years. The man receiving his sure £2,000 per annum, and £10,000.in five years, pays to the Taxation Department £ 7 1 0 . who, in the same period, receives the same total income, but in spasmodic sums from year to year, according to varying natural conditions between drought and opulence, pays £1,500 odd to the Taxation Department. The individual with a certain revenue, who knows what he is going to get ancl can arrange his expenditure accordingly and invest his margin after paying for the upkeep of his household, is charged, under our taxation system, £ 7 1 0 ; whereas the other, earning an equal income during the same period, must pay more than double. That is not British justice, nor is it calculated to stimulate the business of the producer in Australia. And , although a Commission has now been appointed, I am afraid it is a. case of the geese being put to watch the oats. An independent tribunal, with an instruction to put this inequity right, should be appointed by the Government, and this unfair exaction from the producing community should not continue for one hour longer. It may be asked, in what way can the Treasury.who was really strong, and who Government reduce expenditure? It is a was indifferent to people's opinions. He sad state of affairs if the Government canset out with a pruning hook; he not find some means for reducing expensaw the condition of Victoria, following diture below' their latest When the Commonwealth Legislature Turner-for it was he who was in occuwas inaugurated the estimated expendipancy of th© Treasury-inaugurate d a ture was not beyond £750,000.

26,Sir Joseph Cook,"May I interpolatelate Sir George Turner found its Public Service a nettle, which had to be firmly grasped. I am not against efficiency in the PtVdic Service. I am not averse from the proper payment of those who render value for their services in any business or Department. But the Public Service should bestrictly examined by a capable man, or men, who should be equipped with requisite power of action.. In the press of their overshadowingly important legislative business the Government have shut out a little measure which I had proposed in order to involve a saving of £50,000 per annum. action of members of this Legislature in awarding to themselves, at this time, additions to their salaries involving £50,000 a year has, to a considerable extent, robbed this Legislature of its prestige. -We were obliged, as managers of the Commonwealth, to exhort the people to the strictest economy; but, as we preached we should have practised. However, I hope I shall have another and more suitable opportunity to express my opinions upon this subject. ready drawn attention to the iniquitous taxation which has to be borne by those who obtain a livin g from the soil. I have received from the H o n . John Scaddan, Ministerf o r Minesi n Western Australia, a letter, in which he says:I would draw attention to tlie unfair incidence of taxation in connection with the mining industry here. That is another industry we should encourage. W it h a proper policy we might discover some of those oil deposits to which the honourable member for F l in ders ( Mr Bruce) referred last night, or another Eldorado like the GoldenM i l e As you are aware,, under the Federal law, in the event of a prospector making a discovery worth, perhaps, £1,000 or so, he is taxed on the full value for that particular year. It may be that lie has battled along for a number of years, barely making a living, and, in some cases, subsisting only on the backing he obtains from his supporters. In this State we think it would be better if the tax were imposed spread over a number of preceding years, i.e., if a prospector earned at the rate of £50 to £80 per annum for five years, and in his sixth year made a discovery on which he realized the sum of £1,000, five years with all deductions and exemptions should be taken from the total amount of £1,000, and tax paid only upon the balance. The same thing also applies to thc sale of leases. In a thousand ways primary production, which is the most important activity of the Commonwealtb, is almost entirely disregarded. I have received from the fruit-growing community in Western Australia a communication which shows how the fruit-growers have been grossly fleeced owing to the difficulty and costliness of getting their products to market. After all we have done for the Mother Country, the Imperial Government has placed a restriction on the sale of Australian f r u it in England. There was a period during which Americanf r u it was allowed to enter England free of any restriction, The but now a restriction has been placed on both American and Australian fruits. We were informed by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) yesterday that the Imperial Controller of Foods .iutends to reimpose the restriction on the 15th November w i th a slightly higher fixed price. During last year our f r u it was sold in England under these restrictions, but tbe buyers transferred it from the cases in which it was lauded into paper or cane baskets, and sold it for alI have almost any price they chose to ask. In that way they were exploiting the Australian fruit-grower. made over 50 per cent, profit by that one transaction. one of the co-operative f r u it societies in Western Australia setting for t h the tremendous costs whioh the grower has to meet before his product leaves Australian shores, making it almost impossible for him to continue production.

29,Mr Prowse,"I have a letter f r o mThese figures are on a truck-rate basis; smaller consignments would cost at least 4d. per case extra for railage. The balance left to the grower on rails on the foregoing basis is about 6s. 2d. per case. Add to this the cost of cartage from the orchard, 3d. per case (which would be quite a fair average); 4d. per case for picking and carting to the orchardists' packing shed; reduce the net return to 5s. 7d. per case. In addition to this, of course, there is the spraying, cultivatParliament, this recurring debt was ing, pruning, upkeep of the orchard, &c, interest on capital invested, which, obviously reduces the net profit considerably. Australia is a country of primary production. According to Mr Knibbs' statistics for 191S, Australia bas derived its wealth from the following sources:Agriculture, £98,297,000; dairy, poultry, and beefarming, £33,738,000; forestry and fisheries, £7,137,000; mining, £26,156, 000; and manufactures, with all the centralized efforts, assisted by Tariffs and ideal working conditions, £75,261,000. total wealth derived from primary production was £223,408,000, as against the total of £75,261,000 from secondary industries. When it is obvious from tbose figures that practically the whole of our wealth is won from primary production, would we not make much more profit by applying a little more energy to the increase of that productiona policy with which I have heard the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) express sympathytban by seeking to establish hot-house industries in the cities? We have raised tb. Tariff wall so high that the combine of labour wishes to wo.rk shorter hours, and to enjoy the products of the primary producers' labour at cheaper prices than are paid anywhere else in the world, whilst the machines used in such production are dearer than anywhere else. A policy of that kind does not stimulate primary production. Neither price-fixing, embargoes, regulations, nor other artificial expedients will overcome the problem thab is here presented. The great necessity is increased production, which connotes honest labour on the part of those-who work with us. With' increased production we may anticipate a lower cost of living and a reduced burden of public debt. There is absolutely no other way by which those two desirable ends may be attained. By merely imposing additional taxes to meet debts that are falling due we are creating an artificial solvency, and are, indeed, adopting theMicawber-like attitude of paying our : debts with a promissory note, and then saying, "" Thank God, that is settled."" Tbe bonorable member for Plinders( Mr Bruce) was quite right when he referred to the increasing obligation of our recurring debt. At the opening of this something like £21,000,000 a year, and today it is over £25,000,000. This debt will rapidly increase, because tbe renewal of every loan will involve a greater burden of interest. We, therefore, are faced with an annual recurring debt, which £58,000,000; pastoral, before this year expires will represent over £30,000,000. That obligation is not to be met by any artificial shuffling of the cards, but by actual production. There is another item -althoug h I see 1 it is provided from loan-of £3,000,000 The towards Oommonwealth ship construction. I am not one who would readily cast aside the project of ship construction in Australia. It was an excellent idea during the war, and I think it has been evidenced to most Australians that ship construction, after some blunders, can be carried on effectually in this country. How successful in the future we may be in the matter of competition with other couutries is doubtful. I would, therefore, urge the Government to go extremely "" slow ""-to make haste slowly iv. the matter of Commonwealth ship construction. I would not advocate abandoning the project entirely, but would rather keep our shipbuilding paraphernalia in progress, so that we may remain in touch with shipbuilding. I desire, however, to strike a note of warning in my humble way against any excessive attempt to compete in shipbuilding with' other parts of the world. Mr Knibbs tells us that there is more tonnage afloat to-day than there was before the war. In other directions, honourable members know that when a commodity, such as potatoes, is cheap, and no profit is being made, nobody enters the business. The result is that the following year potatoes are £25 or £30 a ton, asd this tempts numbers of people to undertake their production, only to find, in the next year, that the price has dropped to unprofitable dimensions. To-day, everybody has a -mania for shipbuilding; and in some ports, where ships were never built before, a great number of steamers have been turned out. The United States of America got the craze, and the Old Countiy accelerated construction, with the result, as I said before, that there is more tonnage afloat to-day than before the war. With the extra freightage that is involved as an aftermath of the war, we shall inevitably find at no distant date a great slump in shipping; and, therefore, while it is advisable to keep in touch with shipfavour of economy. Of course, we, no more building, any attempt at construction, at a great rate would be unwise and unsafe, and likely to result in loss. I feel that the item to which I refer might quite easily be written down by £1,000,0.00. mitments; they are a liability that has been incurred. ister and Attorney-General) [3.15] -The honourable inember for Swan. ( Mr Prowse) has been giving us his ideas on matters of very great importance, in regard to which it is well we should all speak freely. lapse of the potato market, about a reEven those who are intrusted by this House with the government of the country must necessarily derive great benefit from the advice and criticism of their fellowmembers. spoken of the position in which the country finds itself to-day, ancl, although he said he imposed an embargo against sounding a pessimistic note, I am bound to say, after listening most carefully to him, that his speech has most profoundly depressed me. The honourable gentleman peers into the future with gloomy eye: he foretells catastrophies, falls in prices of primary products. He instanced potatoes as an example. In his opinion the potato market would go down like a plumb-bob. When he knows that I , myself, have started as a potato-grower, he will realize the effect of his gloomy prophesies. However, putting subsidiary matters on one side, tlie honourable member's remarksI regret that I had not the advantage of liearing other honourable members-were, » by-and-large, directed to two matters-^one, the necessity for economy, and the other for the production of more wealth. I have never in my life met a man, either in this Parliament or outside, who was not heart and soul in favour of both those propositions. course, met people who, while enthusiastically in favour of economy, declined to apply it to themselves; in fact, I have -never met anybody who did willingly so apply it. I have met people in favour of producing more wealth whose contributions towards the sum of the nation's riches might be expressed by a cypher. However, viewed in the abstract, the honourable member's propositions comtnieud themselves to us all. We are all in than any one else, begin with economy at home, and of this the honourable member has reminded us. He will permit me, I hope, to remind him of the fundamental difference between doctrine and conduct. It is very ea3.y to be a Christian if one's claim to be such depends on words; it is not quite so easy when one'3 claim is to be based on conduct. The honourable member told us many, things, but he did not tell us how w.e can substantially economize or how we could actually produce more wealth. He had something to say about a probable colstriction imposed by the British Government on ths price of Australian fruit, and about taxation; but surely he will not seriously affirm that if the difficulties he The honourable inember has mentioned were adjusted-and those within the power of this Parliament to adjust are being adjusted-the work of those who seek economy would be completed, or that production would be sufficiently increased. My right honourable colleague has already expressed his approval of assessing taxation on a quinquennial basis. i Sir JosEni COOK--We are going tb do it. waited on me I said, -without committing my colleague, with whom I had not then had an opportunity of discussing the matter, that personally I was in favour of it. The 'honourable gentleman emphasized the fact that the greatest part of our wealth comes from the pastoral, agricultural, aud mining industries. Some persons are inclined to overlook the fact that, in the main, Australia depends for its prosperity on the sale of its primary productions; but I have never failed to emphasize this point, as the honI have, of ' orable gentleman himself admitted.

32,Mr Hughes,"When a deputationthis is a wonderful country, and we are a many-sided people. The honorahle gentleman spoke rather contemptuously of the £75,000,000 which was the value of the production of the manufacturing industries of this country in 1918. doubt this was only a third of the value of the primary products, which were worth £220,000,000, yet, nevertheless, it was of considerable importance, and when the figures for this year are available, 'the honourable member will find that the manufactures of this country are progressing by leaps and bounds. And this increase in production is due to the policy of the Government through the T a r i ff and other inducements to manufactures. It is easy for him to tell us to econow ill say thafc in doing that we tire doing mize, and to say that what the country wants is more production; but I ask h i m, and others who thus criticise the Government, to tell us just how we are to produce more, to let us have some better way than the Government is pursuing of increasing production, and to tell us just whore we are to economize-the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) put that question very pertinently last night, but it has elicited no reply. Let me remind the honourable member for Swan of what the Government has done to increase the production of wealth in this country. knows, we found a market for the produce of tlie country, and provided freight for carrying it to that market, so f a r as freight was obtainable. war, when no man knew whether wheat would be saleable or not, we gave a guarantee to tbe grower of 4s. a bushel. Since the war we have offered a guarantee of 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for wheat. He w ill hardly say that that offer has not borne good f r u it . He spoke in rather a melancholy fashion, when dealing with the potato market, of the vagaries of the world's parity, and of the local parity, so that he must know that it is one thing to grow an article and another thing to be certain of marketing it profitably.

During the war, and. since, we have done what was possible to find markets for the primary products of Australia. As to the secondary industries of the country, which the honourable member seemed to treat rather contemptuously, the Government was returned on a definite policy for their encouragement, and to that policy we have given effect. We said that we would encourage manufactures by imposing a protective Tariff. No doubt, it is impossible to frame a Tariff which will .meet with everyone's approval, but I venture to say that, conDuring fche war, as he sidering the needs of the community by and large, the Tariff that has been in troduced will be a substantial and permanent means of increasing our producDuring the tivity. We have also taken steps to assist the production of wealth by providing means for insuring the maintenance of industrial peace. The honourable gentleman seemed to leave out of his consideration that factor in production. Without labour nothing could be produced ; unless we have industrial peace it is idle to talk about producing more wealth. The Government during this session has passed measures providing ample facilities for the settlement of industrial disputes. And , as a consequence, a very serious industrial struggle has been avoided. Thus, by giving a guarantee to the farmers, by becoming a member of the pool for the marketing of the wheat, by imposing,a Tarifff o r the encouragement of manufactures, and by providing means for the settlement of industrial disputes,",25,Budget 1920 21

If he is selling his labour, he joins a union; if he is a farmer, he wants the world's parity, and is not satisfied until he gets it ; if he is a manufacturer, he asks for a Tariff, and makes our lives miserable until we give him one.

I'presume that the honourable member for Swan referred to fche salaries of the higher paid officers, and not to the allowance paid to members. Air. PROWSE own parliamentary allowance. who favour a reduction in the parliamentary allowance will never get a quorum in this House. Let us deal with this objection tpi.the increase i u the salaries of some of the higher paid officials. Curiously enough, this House asked the Governmeut to appoint a Commission, and, in consequence, the Economies Commissiou was appointed. That Commission is the child of the loins of this House. It went about its work, and made certain recommendations. One of those recommendations was that these salaries should be increased. The Government accordingly increased them. Honourable members of the Country party now tell us that we ought not to have done so. When I was speaking on the ouestion of salaries in this House a few days ago, I said, taking the head of my Department-Si r Robert Garran-as a case in point, that he was paid a shamefully inadequate salary, and he is now to be paid £2,000 a year. Does any honourable member say that he is too highly paid ? The honourable member for Swan may-have an idea of his ""own value, bufc I speak of what I know. Sir Robert Garran would have been appointed to a position in the Judiciary but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him. such a man only £2,000 a year. Is there in this city any lawyer who is his equal, who would work for the salary for which Sir Robert Garran gives such loyal, honest, and capable service? Take fche salaries of the heads of the various Departments. If we want competence in the Public Service, we must pay heads of Departments and the staffs generally reasonable salaries. The honourable member for Swan, in referring to the Public Service, paid fchafc he wanted efficiency. It is a curious reflection upon the point of view of the critics of the Government thafc no sooner do we adopt the recommendations of the Commission which the Parliament itself insisted IIDOII than our critics fasten upon them. They Budget [REPRESENTATIVES. ] (1.920-21). condemn alike the criticised and the critic. We bring m a measure to place the Public Service under a Business Board. How does it fare? No t very well. W h a t is it that honourable members of the Country party want? Do they desire I would include our business efficiency in the Public Service. Do they believe in a. Business Board? The Government brought down a B ill providing for such a Board because the Commission recommended it , and because the House apparently wanted it . I am not particularly enamoured of the proposal, and I hope thafc no honourable member will spare his vote with the idea of sparing my feelings in the matter. If honourable members throw out the proposal the responsibility is theirs-no t ours. One thing I want to make clear is that, while we arc perfectly willin g to discuss with the Committee every item, of the Budget, we cannot accep't a direction at large such as is covered by the amendment. planation, I wish to point out that I did not say that I desired to make the proposed saving out, of the salaries of public servants. I did say-and Hansard w ill show it-that I desired efficiency in the Public Service, and that efficiency should be determined by a competent person, or persons, who should be appointed, no matter what amount of salary might be involved tliereby. , The figures contained in the Budget, when compared 'with those having to'do with a pre-war Budget, are somewhat staggering. We pay Australia has scarcely increased her population in the years between, but now our people have to meet tremendous outgoings, and the situation is such that one faces Australia's great financial problems w i th diffidence. It 13 very difficult to meet, fche Treasurer's challenge to place one's finger upon a specific item in regard to which considerable retrenchments can be effected. A f t e r all, ifc is for the Treasurer himself to show that he has done his best to cut down expenditure, and that he cannot reduce further. In contemplating our enormous expenditure, amounting to £68,000,000, it must not be forgotten, of course, that about £1S,000,000 of this is to be paid out of revenue whicb, previously, was met from loan money. That indicates a step in the right direction;",28,Budget 1920 21

46,Mr Prowse,B y way of personal ex,29,Budget 1920 21
47,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot ) [3.53],"but the Treasurer should show that, ir. regard to many items detailed in the Budget, he had found it impossible to do better by way of reduction. The Treasurer, as a matter of fact, has not proposed or revealed any definite line of policy for the reduction of expenditure. To-day we have abounding revenues and bountiful harvests, but we are not only spending all that we expect to receive this year, but are setting out to raise additional revenue by taxation, and to spend even the accumulated surplus of £5,000,000. We cannot go on like that year after year. We cannot expect our harvests to be always abundant and our revenues always to be abounding. I doubt, personally, whether the anticipated revenue for the current financial year will be raised. example, whether our Customs and Excise duties will be the means of realizing £26,000,000. I hope, of cqurse, that they will be; but if his estinvates of receipts are not realized it is to be presumed that the Treasurer will not spend as much mowey as is now proposed. That is how some of our surpluses have been obtained. The Treasurer finds that he has not the time, within tlie scope of one financial year, to spend all he bas proposed to lay out. The very fact that we are enjoying exceedingly good times renders our position the more acute. I speak of good times in the sense that we are getting suoh high values for our primary produce. While fortune favours, we should do our best to employ our abundant revenues in the best possible directions. There is no reason why we should spend tbe whole of our income, seeing that next year we may be by no means so prosperous. Although our figures in respect of primary produce are so high, the Treasurer bas demonstrated that he is fully aware that the actual volume of production has not expanded. Our greater returns are due to higher prices, and not to enhanced production. That fact applies not only to primary produce, but to manufactures as well. Although the value of our manufactures is much greater than some years ago, the total number of factories has by no means proportionately increased. financial year 1913-14 exports were valued at,£78,571,000, and in 1919-20 at £14S,564,000. were valued at £79,749,000, and in 191920 at £97,456,000.. There was an increase of 22 per cent, as regards imports, and of no less than S9 per cent, in respect of our exports. Tbe output from our factories in 1913-14 was valued at £166,000,000, and in 191S-19 at £226,000,000. At the same time, however, the number of our factories had only very slightly increased. The Government have done something in the direction of economy. For example,the Government have transferred items, involving an expenditure of between £16,000,000 and £18,000,000, for payment out of revenue. Those items had previously been' paid from loan money. That is a step in the right direction. There sbould have been more of I am doubtful, for that kind of thing during the war. We all see that now. There was one honoralble member, however, wbo saw it while the war was being waged. I have often heard the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) speak in those terms in this chamber; but his warnings were not heeded, and to-day we are suffering accordingly. I trust that, year by year, until our dead-weight debts shall have been got rid of, we shall be able to increase our contributions from revenue to the sinking fund. The Treasurer has already practically demonstrated his belief in that policy. iSome days ago the Treasurer mentioned that he had cancelled something like £3,500,000 worth of notes. It is very important that, at the earliest possible moment, our note issue should be reduced to proper dimensions. In his Budget speech the Treasurer referred to the time when the note issue would be handed over to the Oommonwealth Bank for control and management. He saidI t is expected that, in the hands of the Board,, the amount of thc note issue will automatically contract and expand according to business requirements. It is to tbe credit of the Government that there has been already a large cancellation of our notes. Not only do we require to practise economy, but, at the sametime, to display During tbe a certain amount of enterprise. While we must save all we can, and cut our expenditure down to bedrock, our debts Our-imports in 1913-14 are such that we can only remain solvent by encouraging increased production. We must find some means of helping the refused to erect oil tanks at Devonport people to increase the total, and the before the oil was produced. value, of their productions.

61,Mr Atkinson,"Even so, that is nonot due to increased production, but to better prices. One fact to which the Budget speech does refer is that our tonnage now is less than it was in pre-war days; and it is fairly claimed, I think, by the Treasurer that tonnage is a good measure of the volume of our overseas trade. In 1914 our inward overseas tonnage was 5,272,000 tons, and today, when we are receiving more, perhaps, than we were some little time back, it ia only 3,696,000 tons. All this points to the fact that we have to be extremely careful to make the most of the money that comes to our hands. There are one or two other matters on which, I think, the Budget speech might have touched. It is admitted that a good deal of the expenditure is unavoidable, seeing that it is due to statutory enactments of .this Parliament.; but even this expenditure might be dealt with in an improved way. proved method, the recipients of invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity allowance, and so forth , should not in any way suffer, the burden of the community might be lightened.

There must be some system of the kind, sooner or later, if we are to continue old-age pensions; and I only hope the result will be increased stability, and larger payments. The contributions to the funds for such a purpose ought to be made easy, and, if a person could not pay, exemption might Do granted so that the pension would be enjoyed in any case.

On a previous occasion, while you, sir, were acting as Deputy Speaker of the House, I made arequest to be supplied with this information, and that request was supported by the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes), who was most sympathetic. As Deputy Speaker, you were informed that the information was at my disposal. Portion of the required information was supplied to me, but it related only to officers of this House. I know of no such fchis House can go. fchat is fche position under the Public Service Act. If so, the Act should be amended. I do not think any honourable member desires that an officer of this Parliament, who is a married man, shall receive only £ 2 14s. a week. A married man who was employed in this building afc such a salary was told by a senior official that if he did not return to duty at once, he would lose his position. He was away on sick leave, but, in view of this direction, he returned to duty before he should have done, caught a chill, and died. He lef t a widow and children, whose blessings are uot likely to follow r.he officer who brought him back to work before he was fit to resume.

When I was in charge of the Maternity, department in St. Mary's Hospital,, London, I had under rny jurisdiction, as obstetrical officer, every maternity case which came into that institution or required assistance therefrom. I remember being called out one night to deliver a childa babe which the Christ, 2,000 years ago, would have taken in his arms and blessed. It was a sad case-of such a character, indeed, that ,1 had to send for the Medical Superintendent. Together, with our sleeves rolled back, we fought for those lives. The life-blood of the mother was flowing away, and we could only hope to save her by the unremitting application of physical pressure. We relieved each other every five minutes, and directly we stepped back from the bed we had to sweep from our arms and bodies the loathsome, filthy bugs which were crawling all over the room and its occupants. If that mother could have be6u given material assistance, would she not have spurned such surroundings in which to bring her child into the world? gest that, in circumstances sueh as those, help should not be given. swords with the lionorable member' in respect of this specific matter; but I ask him, in view of our world-wide knowledge of the deadly effects of .germ carriers today, what chance had that babe of reaching .maturity, born as it was into a world of poverty and squalor? Sof a r as Australia is concerned, the very fact that almost the whole of our people have accepted the maternity bonus removes the stigma of charity. It was announced by the Treasurer not long ago that 98£ percent, of the mothers of Australia bad claimed the bonus. say that it is a charity. universal acceptance does not r i d the maternity bonus of tliat aspect. when the women of this nation, almost as a whole, claim it as their right. ever, I am not severely angry with the honourable member, because I realize that, as a crusty qld bachelor, he does not know much about the subject, after all. Buti f he has ever patted the head of a dog, or stroked the arching neck of a fine horse, and found pleasure therein, I assure h i m that he would find a f a r greater t h r ill in gazing upon the budding intelligence to be perceived in the eyes of an infant. I hope that the maternity allowance w ill not be decreased, and that it w ill never even be attacked. W it h respect to the old-age pension, it is absurd that one man should be able to own a house valued at £500, and that, so long as he lived in it and made it his home and did not earn more than 10s. a week, he could claim the f u l l amount of pension; while another, who had money in the bank equivalent to the value of tliat house, should be prevented from participating in our pensions scheme. As a matter of fact, a house affords a far greater opportunity for securing an increase in value than does £500 when it has been put into a war loan. tween the two cases is, that from one investment a man derives income, while fro m the other he does not. 10s. a week by way of rent from his house ? I am not. crossing debited with its value. He can only participate in. the pensions scheme so long as he lives in his own house, and earns nothing from it . earn up to 10s.

I hope to see the age limi t in connection with pensions reduced some day, and there should be a further reform in that the States should be required to contribute more than they do.

Even members of Parliament, despite tbeir recent increase of salaries, must find it hard to keep themselves in "" smokes."" We should endeavour to make matters as easy as possible for our unfortunate old folk, who, after all, were bom in God's glorious likeness. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) referred to the national insurance, and upon that subject we are in agreement. A t one time Germ amy led the world with respect to national insurance; but when the British scheme was evolved it stood head and shoulders above the German system. I trust that when Australia shall have inaugurated national insurance our scheme will tower above the British system as the latter does above the German. To the Australian plan of national insurance both employer and employee should contribute. In Germany, and in Denmark, and Great Britain, that principle holds good. But, when we shall have established our system, we should make the unearned increment from all the lands of Australia furnish the contribution of the whole community. In that way our national insurance would become the greatest ever known. In a recent year it was estimated that the value of Australia amounted to £1,200,000,000. year later-and this was a war yeartbat colossal valuation had' risen to £1,645,000,000-a n enormous increase. I do not say that the whole of that sum represents the unearned increment of the land, but a very large proportion, of it does. The unearned increment during the next ten years, if it were applied to Australia's Army, Navy, and pensions expenditures, would totally relieve the Commonwealth Government in respect of those heads. I desire to quote now from Alfred Russel Wallace, .the peer of every writer on land nationalization. year Wallace, in his efforts bo find the cure for poverty, wrote and published a book entitled Moral Progress. not believe in a Creator if he thought that poverty could not be eliminated. with our high intelligence, we can attain to the standard of the ant and the bee. No ant or be© suffers from want or privation; and surely we human beings, with God-endowed intelligence, should be able to make laws and so organize our communities that starvation, poverty, and misery Dr. Maloney. would be'no more. Dealing with the ""Root-cause and tlie Remedy,"" Wallace establishes four points, as follow: 1. They are due, broadly and generally, to our living under a system of universal coinpetition for the means of existence, the remedy for which is equally universal co-operation. 2. It may be also defined as a system of economic antagonism, as of enemies, the remedy being a system of economic brotherhood, as of a great family, or of friends. 3. Our system is also one of monopoly by a few of all the means of existence: the land, without access to which no life is possible; and capital, or the results of storcd-up labour, which is now in the possession of a limited number of capitalists, and, therefore, is also a monopoly. The remedy is freedom of access to land and capital for all. 4. Also, it may be denned as social injustice, inasmuch as the few in each generation are allowed to inherit the stored-up wealth of all preceding generations, while the many inherit nothing. The remedy is to adopt the principle of equality of opportunity for all, or of universal inheritance by the State in trust for the whole community. I. know that the seeds fchat great man -sowed will bear f r u it , and I hap©fchafcthat f r u it will be of benefit to this beloved Australia of ours.

I had the honour of going about London with the late Sir George Reid, when he was H i g h Commissioner, to inspect tha different sites on which Australia House might have been built.

113,A Mr Atkinson,"Unless w© get betterWhen some wealthy Australian shakes the dust of Australia from his feet, and decides to spend the remainder of his days in England, he desires to be introduced to Royalty, and seeks the aid of an Agent-General or the High Commissioner.

It would be an extraordinary thing if the proprietor of a business, or the owner of a farm, on looking at the proposed expenditure for the year, said to his manager, "" You, must cut .this down by so much,"" leaving it to the manager to effect the reduction as he thought best. In my opinion, the business method would be to go through the items, and pick out those in which a saving could be effected. The business man would say, "" There are too many office boys employed,"" or "" too much is being paid for such and such a service."" It has been said that business methods should be applied to the administration of public affairs, and in this case the business method would be to name the items which might be reduced.

155,Mr Bell,"The Prime Minister( Mr.to make such a statement, the present High Commissioner should have 'been on his way to Australia. If , notwithstanding the fact that we are spending £53,000 a year on the High Commissioner's Office, the Leader of the Government felt compelled to say that owing to tbe ex-Treasurer's resignation, Australia was left without representation at the Conference in question, and without any one to conduct various important negotiations, it cannot be denied that Australia House is, as I have said, merely a monument of inefficiency. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. 3£illen), who is now on his way to Europe, is, we are told, to go into the question of the re-organization .of the High Commissioner's Office. He is not proceeding to Europe specially for that purpose, but has another most important mission to carry ont. I am of the opinion that neither Senator. E. D. Millen nor any other Minister should have to be sent from Australia to reorganize the office. It needs to be reorganized. If that were not so, the Government would not have announced that that was part of the business to be carried out by Senator Millen; but the High Commissioner himself should be the man to undertake the work. When his successor is appointed, fl. young man of vigour should be .selecteda .man who will look upon the office as sufficiently imceed to consider in detail the Estimates portant to demand of its occupant that he shall maintain tbe high prestige of Australia in the Old Country. If the High Commissioner's Office is to be re-organized and put in a state of efficiency, the work should be done by tbe High Commissioner himself. If he cannot do it, he is not fitted for his office. I have in my notes a reference to the Federal Capital expenditure, but that bas already been dealt with rather fully, and I do not propose to make more than a passing reference to it. When we have a large expenditure proposed in respect of the building of the Federal Capital at the present time, I fail to understand how the Treasurer can substantiate the claim so often made by him that there is no possibility of cutting down these Estimates. There are some items in the Estimates relating to the Prime Minister's Department that call for attention. Mr Bell. penditure of that Department has already been criticised pretty freely by some of those who have preceded me. I would, however, direct attention to such items as those relating to Royal Commissions. I have always held the opinion that far too many Commissions are appointed to inquire into Commonwealth matters, and it is certainly startling to see in these Estimates an item of £10,000 to provide for the Royal Commission' in regard to the adjustment of tbe basic wage. I agree with the remark made by an honourable member, who, when dealing with another question, said that there are in this Parliament men who have a wider knowledge, and are far more competent to deal with such questions as are usually brought before Commissions of inquiry, than are those to whom the work is' allotted. The Ministeri n charge of .each Department should be responsible for its efficient administration; and it is a waste of money to expend thousands of pounds a year on Royal Commissions, ancl upon, inquiry after inquiry into the administration of different Departments., Here, then, is another item in respect of which economies could be effected. At this stage, I am making merely a hasty, review of the items, recognising that we shall be able to deal with them more fully when we proof each Department. My only desire is to point out now to the Treasurer tliat there are items which some of us think might well be reduced, ancl that it will be necessary for ns to move accordingly. I agree with the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) that there is a great waste of money in connection with our printing bill. I wish to emphasize my protest 'against the waste of paper and printing that goes on in all the Departments into whicli I have had an insight. In respect of this Parliament, I know of no item in connection with which there is greater waste than that relating to paper and printing. There is no reason why we should not cut down the expenditure on such items. It may be said that they are relatively triflingj but they show us that Ministers ancl heads of Departments have not a proper regard for economy, otherwise they would look into the little things, and cut down expendiThe exture wherever possible. When that is not clone, they cannot claim to believe in absolute economy in public expenditure. The honourable membei; for Franklin amendment yesterday, said that he had never known any good to result from thc criticism of items when dealing with the general Estimates. He went on to say that honourable members generally did not consider it right or proper that they should deal with item after item, and say that this salary or that salary should be cut down. It may be very convenient to move an amendment such as that which is now before us, to obtain the decision of the Committee upon it , and then to go away for two or three weeks, leaving a very thin Committee to deal with the items in detail; but I am prepared to stay here to discuss the Estimates item by item. It is our duty to do so. We should cut down expenditure wherever possible, and I do not think Lt is in f r a dig. for honourable members to move for the reduction of even small proposed votes. A Minister, or a head of a Department, who considered, for example, that the matter of printing and the awful waste of paper -suc h as honourable members see about this chamber and its precincts-wa s beneath attention, could not be said to possess the real spirit of economy in administration. deluged with printed matter of one kind and another, very. little of which they peruse, and it musb represent an enormous waste. Sir honourable member's speech are jotted on the very best of the House's writingpaper. I invite him to look at this common scribbling pad which I ' keep before m© for my use. The whole of my notes are jotted down on a minimumspace. Poor soldiers, like myself, at the Front quickly learned that paper was not allowed to go to waste; neither were jam tins and the like. They were all collected, and sent somewhere or other, for further use. Now that we are back home in Australia, and soldier members see the waste of printed matter which goes on around us, we are not i m pressed with any demonstration of economic administration in the Public Service. I merely mention these minor facts to show that the spirit of economy is not to be noted in this Parliament. I have made it clear that I am not in . agreement with the method proposed by the bonorable member for Franklin for bringing about economy. He has his own ideas of putting right that which is wrong; but if any honourable member should care, when the opportunity arrives, to move to cut down an unnecessarily extravagant item of expenditure, I shall assist hun to the utmost of my ability. It may then be for the Government to consider whether our action should be regarded as a vote of want of confidence; but I shall not be deterred by that consideration if I am of opinion that that is the only practical way to economize. Of course, I do not presume to dictate to older members of this Chamber concerning the correct method to, adopt; b u t I emphasize that, in my view,' the proposed amendment amounts to nothing. If it is carried, we are to understand that a new Government must be found. That is an awful alternative, which requires most careful consideration. We know that we shall not achieve economy by putting the Government, out and promoting to the Treasury benches a Government selected from houorable members opposite. It would be of no use to attempt to appiy a remedy which, in fact, could only in tensify the trouble. Reductions of Honourable members are various items may be made, I think, without ill-effect, and, certainly, without bringing about the downfall of the Government. Therefore, if no other honourable member feels disposed to do so, I shall be prepared to move for certain -when the Estimates are being dealt w i th line by line. I am sure that -the honorliams) does not wish to put the Government out cf office, and to set up anotherI have wasted no paper. from among honourable members opposite. the honourable member votes. carried it would not have the effect of reducing public expenditure. Indeed, the outcome would be quite the reverse. I prefer, therefore, to take no such risk, and shall not support the amendment. I am hopeful that, as item by item of Estimates is considered, the Treasurer may be persuaded to reduce expenditure here and there to fair and reasonable limits.

Eor example, could the Government allow the honourable member's own leader to give effect to his ideas regarding Defence? No t for a moment! the honourable member would tolerate that. big questions of public policy each hae his own views, but I do not think it likely that a majority would support a policy which would risk the safety of Australia. During the debate, and at other times, both here and elsewhere, the view has been expressed that, provided that the Estimates of Revenue about equal the Estimates of Expenditure, the position of the public finances is satisfactory. mist says that? any political economist has said it ; but many persons who can bardlv be classed as political economists air their opinions about public finance. pressed ; but it is not uecessarily correct. totally incorrect, because it does not take , into consideration the oppressiveness of undue taxation. Of late many complaints have been voiced about the high cost of living, and I think that sufficient attention has not been given to the extent to which the cost of living is due to heavy taxation. Many taxes are in their nature easily passed on to the consumer, and the process has been facilitated of recent years by the combination of large concerns for ' the fixing of prices. Obviously, the im porter of dutiable goods passes on the duty to the consumers of them. so. plus interest, on the money which he has had to pay out in the first instance. also a profit on tine increased capital that he has been forced to put into his business. I say nothing on the merits or demerits of import duties; but I draw attention to the fact that they are paid It all depends upon ultimately by tbe consumers, and are largely responsible for the high cost of living. Then, again, the Pair Profits Commission, presided over by Major General Sir James McCay, which has recently been sitting in Melbourne, has ascertained from traders and manufacturers who have given evidence before it , I do not think that even that, in quite a number of businesses, not only are Customs duties and many other items of expenditure charged to the consumers, but that the income tax paid on a firm's profits is often passed on a? well. It is difficult to discover a form of taxation which cannot thus be passed on, ancl made to increase the burden of the masses. The business of the Treasurer is to obtain revenue which w ill balance his expenditure; but every Government should, as f a r as possible, keep down expenditure in order to lessen taxation.' It might be asked: 'Supposing it to be possible to decrease the expenditure of the present financial year by £1,000,000, I clo not think that what would be gained.by doing so? Let me show how, by such a saving, a diminution of taxation could be made which is in the highest interests of the people, because it would relieve those who have I have heard the view exheavy responsibilities in bringing up large families. When I entered ParliaI n my opinion, it is ment two years ago, the then member for Calare( Mr Pigott) moved an amendment on an Income TaxB ill to increase the allowance in respect of each child from £ 2 6 t h e present amount -to £ 5 0 .

In both cases' the. amendment was negatived on the ground, that the Treasurer could not afford the loss of revenue which its adoption would involve. When in due. course I have an opportunity to submit a similar amendment I have no doubt that I shall be met with a similar reply. When the honourable member for Kennedy asks me what would be done with the money saved, I give him this illustration. I would save enough out of this year's expenditure to enable such a remission of taxation to be made, and so give relief to one of the most deserving classes in the community-thos e who honestly enY e s ; and he charges deavour to bring up large families as good citizens. . ments Tax Bill provided for a remission of taxation equal to the amount of",50,Joseph Cook I Do Not Mind Vernment Will Not Treat Such A Pro

' In the course of public discussions ou^ this matter we hear many arguments in favour of placing still heavier taxes on the community. A point that I wish to emphasize is that, having regard to the heavy burdens which-the people of Australia already have to bear, no matter what tax we impose, we cannot escape doing, by reason of that taxation, a great in j u r y to the commuuity. It may be said that there are circumstances in which heavy expenditures and heavy taxation are necfcssary, but the injur y done to the community by heavy taxation, no matter what may be its nature, is so great that we should zealously scrutinize every item' on the Estimates with a view of eliminating all unnecessary expenditure gross expenditure for which the Estimates provide had been £1,000,000 less than it is, would the honourable member still have moved to reduce it by £1,000,000? not have done so. But there is no evidence that the Estimates could not be further reduced. The Treasurer has already told us that he reduced the original Estimates by some £15,000,000 or £16,000,000. I ask him to go through them again and to try to discover where a further reduction Of £1,000,000 may be made. Sir member wants to finish me off. halo round my right honourable friend's head. If he could reduce by a very substantial amount the expenditure for which the Estimates provide he would become Stilly mere popular-if that were possible -tha n he is to-day. The question may be asked-it generally is on such an occasion as this"" What practical means are there by which a Committee that unanimously desires to reduce expenditure and to secure the .most economic administration may achieve its object?"" I am reminded of an incident in the history of Egypt, when the British Government took over its administration "" Joseph went down into Egypt?"" turies later. I am glad ito be reminded of a Joseph who was almost as illustrious a statesman as is his namesake who is in charge of the Commonwealth Treasury to-day. When the British Government .took over the administration of Egypt in January, 1884, t""hey appointed Sir Evelyn Baring, who subsequently became Lord Cromer, to take up the task of organization. I read the other clay, in an article i u the Spectator, the statement thatWhen Lord Cromer took over the government of .Egypt, tlie Statu WHS on the very verge of bankruptcy. I do not wish it to be inferred that, because of my reading of this quotation, I am making any reflections on Australia. I do not think any one would accuse me of -doing so, but sometimes people are hasty, if not reckless, in tbe aspersions which they cast on honourable members. The article continues: Lord Cromer saved it hy rationing the Dcpiirtuients. Each Department had so much money given to ifc, and no more. They had to make tlie best use they could of it. I am not recommending thafc this rather rough-and-ready method of reducing public expenditure should be adopted in fche Commonwealth. I cite it merely as a means that was adopted afc that period, with very good effect, by L o r d Cromeri n Egypt. Some years afterwards, the writer of the article congratulated Lord Cromer on what he described as the miracle of being able to obtain both efficiency and economy. which should be attentively studied by There is no miracle. Tho administration here is efficient because of, not in spite of, our economy. Out of the energy and afctentiveness generated in cutting down the expenditure, has sprung the efficiency which you note. These words ought ever to be with' us when we are considering any question of public expenditure.. I do nofc stand as an advocate merely of economy. I ask not so much for economy as for efficiency.

The Budget debate was proceeding most harmoniously unti l yesterday. The Estimates had been introduced by the Government, who, apparently, had done the best they could in the circumstances. We are told that behind the Government is a band nf rapacious officials who demanded £10,000,000 of expenditure more than, has been provided for in the Estimates. The Treasurer, being anxious to guard the money of the public, reduced £10,000,000. pened if the Government had adopted the Estimates submitted by the officials ? Would honourable members opposite still have pressed to reduce them by 6d. or Is.? The Treasurer having reduced the Estimates by £10,000,000, honourable members in the corner ask that they be reduced by another ""£1,000,000. Our little babbling brook of discussion was flowing on, and would have meandered gently to its end,, and everything would have been serene, had not the honourable thrown into the brook a squib which he asks us to believe is a live bomb.

I desire to take the .opportunity of pointing out the frailties of the honourable members in the corner. The honourable member for Franklin initiated this discussion; but for it many of us could have gone to our homes to-night, whereas we must now remain to vote on nothing. No harm is teing done by t h e ' amendment, but some of us must atay here to prove that we are in the House sometimes. The houorable member gave in a clear declaration that his party, neither collectively nor individually, has tlie Estimates by any anxiety at any time to displace the What would have hapGovernment. I do not blame h i m ; I am iii sympathy with him, and I hope he will keep to his resolution. I will not say what my own feelings are in the matter. I merely accept the honourable member's candid admission that the members of the Country party have not tlie slightest intention of doing anything serious. The mover of the amendment commenced by drawing attention to the general condition of society, the enormous expenditure, and the necessity for economy. Where? Read his speeches* or listen to them; seek for some definite proposal; endeavour to ascertain in what direction the honourable member desires the Government to economize-h e does not know. About the only definite proposal that the honourable member for Franklin made was in regard to the Northern Territory, and I shall come to that in due course. He firstly drew our attention to the enormous indebtedness of Australia State debts, and a similar sum of Federal debts, will fall due within the next five yearsa tremendous burden!

265,Mr Anstey,"I voted against myupon the maintenance of Australian soldiers, making a grand total of £370,000,000 of indebtedness to be shortly redeemed. Lt is absolutely improper, the honourable member says, that Australia should be owing £50,000,000 to the British Government. That is all right;'what does the honourable member' propose to do? Are we to tax the people more in order to pay the debt? "" Yes ' "" or "" No "" ? He dare not say anything. £200,000,000 to be raised within the next five years, making a total of £570,000,000, which must oe met by any Government in-occupation of the Treasury bench. How? Do honourable members propose to cut out any part of it? No; they merely mention it in passing, meaning nothing in particular. There is a further sum of £50,000,000 of expenditure in connection with repatriation. Isi t proposed to cut that down ? Not at all. The honourable member for Grampians C Mr Jowett) referred to taxation ir. Great Britain. There is nothing we can think or do, either walking or sleeping, in connection with the government of this country, unless we first know what has been done in Great Britain. So, because the Imperial Government appointed a Committee to taxation we also must have a Royal Commission on taxation, and it wiU come to the same useless conclusions. The Committee in England called as a witness Mr Blackett, the British Finance, and the chairman said to h i m, "" Do you regard fche indebtedness of # Great Britain as vital to the situation, or do you believe that the businesses and industries of the country can be so conducted that they can carry the load?"" And the British Controller of Finance replied, "" I do regard the problem as vital, and I do not believe that the businesses and industries of Great Britain can continue to carry the load."" Bv a member of the Committee he was asked what he thought could be done, and he replied, "" I do not know what can be done; tbe only thing I can suggest is a tax upon wealth, which in itself is dangerous."" As a matter of fact, the problems that afflict the Government of Great Britain afflict also the Government of the Commonwealth. Both Governments are incapable of making any recommendation to solve the problem, and any Government which is incapable of coping with that question copes with nothing and does nothing. A tax upon wealth, whether suggested by one party or another, or increased taxation of incomes, is no remedy. If we put a tax upon wealth, and that wealth represents the industries of the country, the organizations of 'employers can combine to fix prices and pass the tax on to the masses of the people; thus W ill he answer the tax merely increases the burdens upon-the general public, and does not There is also another solve the problem. If we increase the taxation on incomes from the pastoral, agricultural, and other primary industries, which cannot pass on the tax, the burden then becomes so heavy that the industries cannot carry ou in competition with the rest of the. world, and they pass out of existence. Thus we create more of the economic disasters that we seek to prevent. The Government know not what to do. When a tax' is either passed on to the consuming public or cripples industries, it does not solve the problems which confront the Government. The honourable member slid over that probblem; he made no attempt to deal with it ; he ignored it ; like tlie honourable member for Grampians he merely mentioned it i u passing. He spoke of a debt of nearly £400,000,000 which the country investigate has to meet within a few years, and then he spoke of saving 6d. here, or cheeseparing there, or scraping a few shillings off the salary of an officer in this or that Department. But God help anybody who wishes Controller of to carve anything off our own salaries! Then he turned to repatriation-anothe r £50,000,0001 What does he propose to do in regard to that? Nothing. Then why mention it? He turned to the Oodnadatta railway with its annual loss of £500,000. Does he propose to do anything ? Does he blame the Government because fchey are makingfchafcloss ? Nofc at all. He passed thafc over, and turned fco Defence. Does he, or does he not, propose a reduction of the Defence Estimates ? I do not know.

280,Mr Anstey,"No , it is not. I holdabsolutely impossible for them to carry on the Government at any cheaper rate than they are doing. All they could possibly do in face of their annual expenditure of nearly £100,000,000 would be to knock ofi a few thousands here and there, but that is like scraping the rind off a piece of cheese; it does nothing so f ar as the great problem itself is concerned. I had no wish to speak to-night, but I "" asked myself whether the honourable member for Franklin and his followers meant business. Perhaps, I said to myself they see things in a different light from myself. They may not be looking at the problem from the extreme point of view I do, and, as reasonable and rational men, they may think that they have a better remedy. We have heard one remedy proposed by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse). That member clearly and definitely proposes to take £1,000,000 off the expenditure on shipping. That, I take it , refers to the £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 the Government are spending on the development of a mercantile fleet. But if there ever was in the proposals of this Government an expenditure that is of value to Australia and its primary producers, it is this. may have been in connection with the building of the wooden ships, that seemed inevitable at the particular time and under the particular circumstances. Even since the war we have been confronted with the fact that Australian ships, uuder the influence of the great British capitalists, linked up with their friends i i i this country, have been gradually withdrawn from our coast until we are now about 60,000 tons short. So great has been the resultant inconvenience that there is an outcry for the withdrawal of the Commonwealth-owned ships from overseas traffic to make up the shortage here. were specially constructed for deep-water traffic, and, therefore, are the most useful for the transport of the commodities of our breaking down of the Shipping Ring. Apart from the boycott by the Inchcape crowd, the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the Orient Company, linked up with Burns, Philp and Company, who are now the owners of the Australian TJnited [231] this coast, and, with the Union Company, this gang of British capitalists, who not only control the traffic of the world, but have monopoly privileges on our coast, are pushing the Australian Government into the position of being compelled. to withdraw their ships from overseas traffic in order to meet a shortage which the Combine itself has created. And at this hour, when it is most imperative that the f u l l energies of the Government should be , devoted to supplying shipping for both overseas and coastal traffic, a man, who professes to represent pota-. toes and the primary producers, proposes to save this country by a policy wbich simply throws Australia more and more into the hands of the Combine. That is the remedy of the honourable member forSwan( Mr Prowse), and it is the onlypractical proposal that he and bis colleagues have put before us. The other night, when we were discussing Defence Estimates, I determined to find where the economists were. I came to the House to propose a reduction of millions in the Defence votes, not because I do not wish to see my country defended in her hour of necessity, but because, like Whatever errors or waste there the honourable inember for Flinders( Mr. Bruce) who regards the financial problem as vital, I think it is useless to have men enrolled for defence if we have not economic resources to maintain them in the field. It seems to me waste of money to merely put arms into the hands of men, until we have reconstructed our financial and economic conditions, and have a material buttress for them. I moved an amendment, but the Country party would not support me in the reduction of a single penny. Now they come along w it h this amendment, but, of course, tbey do not mean anything, and that is the most despicable and contemptible thing of a l l .

The Government do not know at what moment that party may stab them in -the back. moment when, the Country party will march-forward united;'and in that moment the doom of the Government may be sealed.

He said, ""I will give ear to tlie arguments for, and I will hear the arguments against, and 'bring both to the bar of judgment,"" -but God Mr Anstey. knows what the decision would be. I am this not compelled, on this occasion, to sacrifice my country in my own interests. There is no need for me to vote for fche Government and to save it from a party whose views are so indefinite that no one knows whether they face north, south, east, or west. Being paired I could, if the position of the Governmeint were 'precarious, walk out of the chamber and not vote; but, as a matter of fact, the Government is quite safe, so that I can vote against, it, with the sure and certain knowThere may come an unexpected ledge that it will not be defeated. The members of the Corner -party are in the same position. It is grand to be able to stand on the public platform aind say, "" We opposed the Government tooth and nail."" There are no more glorious champions of human rights and human liberties than those who struggle, knowing that tbeir efforts will not prejudice their personal convenience. How many members are there'in the Corner party? I know not. Perhaps their Leader may be They able to tell us. He may be able to say how many there are to-day as against yesterday, and what they will number to-morrow when, after the division, they will again be a grand united party, .banded for the defence of the primary interests against a vile and extravagant Government. But on the eve of a division they must always make sure that a sufficient number of their members is absent to prevent the Government from being overthrown. I once more congratulate the members df the party on the magnificent effort which they have made. Their struggle for the country's good is worthy of them. It hasprovided an inspiring and uplifting spectacle, and what the honourable member for Grampians has described as a very intellectual discussion. The honourable membeifor Franklin spoke of what willhappen when the prices of wool, wheat, and metals fall. What will happen when . the Customs revenue also begins to fall? In the trade and finance column of to-day's Age it is stated that the banks are raising-, The honourable the rates for money overseas pretty stiffly. In many cases they appear to 'be : refusing overseas credit altogether, but in any case their rates are almost prohibitive. The article to which I direct. attention says that these banking corporations are taking this action because they are short of money overseas-don s the Prime Minister believe that?-aii d find it difficult to meet their obligations there. The article goes on to say that tlie object of the banking corporations is to restrict importation, which will have the same effect as a prohibitive Tariff. They have taken on themselves to proceed with a policy which may be detrimental to the Customs revenue of the country, and when it takes effect, although our expenditure w ill remain the same, our revenue w ill be greatly diminished. I . do not say that it is disadvantageous to restrict imports if thereby internal industries are built up, because it is well for a country to have a variety of industries to provide for the.varied abilities of its inhabitants, and to build up a population for its defence. 'The banks registered in Australia, together with the three English banks which do business in this country, had at the end of June £450,000,000 of assets, of which £270,000,000 were then in Australia, and £180,000,000 overseas. As the imports of July and August did not total more than £22,000,000, their oversea money could not have been reduced below the amount of £150,000,000, and therefore they must still have £100,000,000 overseas more than they had at .the outbreak of the war. seme purpose which they know best, but not for the benefit of the country, they propose to increase their oversea holdings. The enormous power of the banking corporations and the Shipping Ring provides problems for us to deal with But I have .said all I need say on the subject to-night, and now I am willing that the Committee shall proceed to the division, and God save the Government! [9'.56] I was not able to satisfy myself && to the motive of the amendment, and having heard the speech delivered by the honourable member for Bourke. I find that he has made the tion still more difficult of solution. I am sorry that the honourable member present, and in his absence I address a few words to the members of the Corner party generally, some of whom may share with him responsibility for' the amendment, which, it is evident, either means mischief or is evidence of a great deal .of simplicity on the part of those who support it , perhaps both. Although the demand for economy has come from the Corner party, I would remind its members that long before they were elected there was in this House for years a strong combination, which quite as persistently demanded economy iu public expenditure. I believe that recently considerable economies have been effected, and we were hopeful of further increasing the application of economical principles to the public expenditure. But the amendment makes an effective attempt to economize practically impossible. Since the commencement of tlie session the cry for economy has been on the lips of the honourable members sitting not only in the Ministerial Corner but in other parts of the House. There has been an insistent demand that the Government should give us an early opportunity to discuss the Budget and deal with the Estimates. For the first time for many years this Government yielded to that request, with, the result that we have the opportunitv to deal with bhe Budget and the Estimates at a much earlier period than we have had for many years. And how is that opportunity appreciated by the Leader of the Country Yet, for outset, he makes it impossible for us to be with him, because by his proposal to reduce the item by £1, with the accompanying condition that it shall be a direction to tbo Government to reduce the Estimates by £1,000,000, he immediately throws out to the Ministry a challenge that must be accepted. Honourable members sitting on this side, and particularly those who represent the producing districts of Australia, had reason to expect that there would be 1 sympathetic co-operation on the part of honourable members of the Country party on not only this, but many other similar questions affecting, not merely the general interests, but particularly the producing quesinterests of Australia. Yet we have a hostile amendment submitted immediately the opportunity offers for us to get into close quarters with the Government proposals, and to examine the Estimates thoroughly, so that we may know something about important items of public expenditure of tbe details of which we have a right to be informed. B y such cooperation we should very soon have obtained the* information. This, then, is",58,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Else Is Responsible For That Mistake Who

I have already referred approvingly to the increased outlay in the Postmaster-General's Department, because there can be no objection to an expenditure which carries comfort and relief to those who have blazed the trail outback. I also desire some information on the increase in the Attorney-General's and Taxation Departments. latter is probably accounted for by the fact that its activities have been extended and the staff increased. Notwithstanding what has been said by the Minister ton), I believe that the Northern Territory under existing conditions is overmanned. should tell us what duties the public officials are performing, because, apart from the work associated with the pastoral and mineral industry, operations are at a standstill. Australia House, which has been referred to in this Chamber on frequent occasions during the last .few months, is also mentioned in the Estimates. Practically every visitor who has returned from Great Britain bas a sad story to tell of the conditions prevailing in the Commonwealth's head-quaTters in London, and tbe Government sbould give some details of the proposed expenditure. I also desire to refer to the Department controlling shipping. I was particularly interested in that portion of the speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr the Estimates have always been brought Anstey) in reference to shipping, and its bearing on the interests of primary producers in Australia. face with the actions of a Shipping Combine, wbich owns a very large proportion of oversea shipping, and whicb, by its strength, influences the price of every pound of wool, 'every bushel of wheat, every pound of butter or other produce we export. If it were not for that, I would be a very severe critic of the Government shipping policy. been a warm supporter of this particular governmental activity, but my mouth bas been closed because conditions have been such that opposition was not justified. I am anxious, however, to ascertain if we are doing right in pursuing a policy of shipbuilding in Australia. I have been informed that so marvellous have been [232] the activities in the shipbuilding yards in the Old World that at the present time there is a tonnage approaching 8,000,000 available above the pre-war standard, and that construction is still being continued. In these circumstances, we have to consider whether we are justified in extending our shipbuilding operations in Australia beThe additional outlay in the yond the keels already laid down, and whether it would not be cheaper to stay our hands and risk a fall in the market. Our present Inter-State fleet is altogether inadequate, "" because Australian shipowners have adopted the shrewd policy of not restoring their fleets to their pre-war strength until they learn whether If it is not, the Minister ships cannot be purchased at a cheaper rate than that at which they can be built. It has been said by the Leader of the Country party that the plan that has been adopted is the only effective way of making an impression upon tbe Government, and that statement has been repeated by other honourable members. In my opinion, it is the least effective way. To begin with, it is asking this House to perform an impossibility. It would be infinitely better if we were to pass the first item, and then, when we are dealing with particular items, to demand the fullest information from Ministers. During the twelve years I have been a member of this Parliament, we seldom have been able to perform effective work, because down so late. On one or two occasions they were not introduced until tbe folWe are face to lowing year, when every penny had been spent. When they have been presented reasonably early, we have either spent all the available time in aimlessly debating the first item, or devoted days and hours to trivial ' votes, allowing items involving an expenditure of millions to afterwards go through without any consideration at all. I have not In regard to many Departments there is nc hope of cutting down the Estimates. TheTe is no possibility of that, for example, with respect to the Defence Department. The honourable member for Franklin, when moving his amendment, indicated that most of the money upon wbich he aimed at economizing could come from the Navy.
