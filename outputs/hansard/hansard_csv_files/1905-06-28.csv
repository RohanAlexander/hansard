I have attended in the Senate Chamber, where His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to deliver his opening speech, of which, for greater accuracy, I have obtained a copy (vide page 5). That a Committee, consisting of Mr R. Edwards, Mr G. Fuller, Mr W. J. McWilliams, and Mr A. Robinson, be appointed to prepare .in Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. The Committee retired, and having reentered the Chamber, presented the proposed address, which was read by the Clerk, as follows:MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. very great pleasure to move That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's -speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. It was, doubtless, gratifying to honourable members to find that the speech delivered ""by His Excellency the Governor General this afternoon was so brief, being confined practically to one matter. that deliverance was exceedingly short, compared with other Vice-Regal utterances, my the exception of one map, remarks in connection with it will be brief relatively to the speeches of others who to-morrow. . That is the reahave moved the adoption of the Address-inReply upon previous occasions. The speech to which we listened this afternoon must have come as a surprise to most honourable members. a shock, particularly to those honourable members who read the speech which the Prime Minister made at Hawthorn a few W ill the new boundaries evenings ago. In that utterance, the right honourable gentleman forecasted the introduction of a series of non-contentious meaI have not sures which he hoped the Opposition and this House generally would see fit to pass in the interests of tlie people of Australia. further intimated in that address that if the Opposition were not prepared to deal with the non-contentious measures which he proposed to submit, the situation which would I have to report that then arise would have to be seriously considered by himself and his colleagues. Since that speech was made, events have undergone a change. We have had a. notable deliverance from the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. We all remember how active he was in the formation of the Coalition Government which now occupies the Treasury Benches, and it must be clear to every one who has carefully read his recent declanation, that as f ar as the Ministry are concerned, they can no longer consider him the warm and cordial friend and supporter that he was prior to making that speech. action of the honourable and learned member has dissolved the very basis of the alliance between himself and the Prime Minister.

32,Mr Fuller,"That is a matter which.orable and learned member for Ballarat pointed to no alliance of any sort. The only conclusion at which I can arrive from a perusal of his address is that by withdrawing his support from the Coalition Government he desires to bring about a return to the three-party system of Government which was introduced into this House some time ago. Nobody who feels keenly j j j connection with our representative institutions wishes to see a return to that system, which undoubtedly degraded those institutions. Under these conditions the Government, composed as it is of men of high standing in our public life, naturally had to seriously consider the position. It is clear from the Vice-Regal speech that they have done so. All the measures which were forecasted by the Prime Minister at Hawthorn have been placed upon one side, and the Government now propose to deal with one matter only, which everybody will agree is a matter of pressing urgencyI refer to the Redistribution of Seats Bill. Sir Prime Minister's seat. ber had better look after his own seat. themselves to the question of a redistribution of seats. Everybody recognises that whenever -a redistribution of seats takes place, it is proper to hold a general election. The Government have met the position like men. met the difficulty which has arisen in the only way open to thema practical, honourable, and straightforward way. I believe that a majority of the people of the Commonwealth will commend them for having adopted an honourable and manly course. Sir Prime Minister meet the House at all? look at the honourable member. That a redistribution of seats is necessary, must be patent to everybody. As time has elapsed, the inequalities which were proved to exist when the first distribution of electorates took place have increased. To-day they are of such a glaring character that, in order to insure a proper representation under the liberal franchise which exists in Australia, it is necessary that we should have a Redistribution of Seats Bill passed at the earliest possible moment. That fact is recognised, not only by the Government, but by every right-thinking person in the community. In some quarters a great outcry has been raised, because, under the redistribution scheme' which is projected, Victoria will be represented by one member less, and New South Wales by one member more. What is the real position, and what is the reason for the great outcry which has occurred in that connection ? When the first distribution of electoral divisions for the Commonwealth Parliament took place Victoria obtained her twenty-, third representative by having 1,135 P "" er sons in excess of half the quota. In the second distribution which took place in 1903, that State secured her twenty-third representative because she possessed 2,280 in excess of half the quota. The statistics for 1905 show that half the quota necessary to entitle a State to return a representative is 27,443, and that Victoria has 24,631 less than half the quota, or only 2,812 persons in excess of the number required to return twenty-two repreto New South Wales? In 1900 and 1903. that State returned twenty-six representatives upon the full quota. There was no bare allowance in the case of that State. Her representatives were returned upon the full quota in every instance. According to the official figures for 1905, she is entitled to an additional member,, because the figures show that she has 2,767 above half the quota. When Victoria, in the first instance, obtained her twenty-third member she had only 1,135 persons over the half quota, while in the second instanceshe had only 2,280 over half the quota; but in neither case was objection raised by any one. jected. any of the other States. But now that New South Wales has more than half the quotaentitling her to an additional member, namely, 2\i6j, as against the 1,135 ' then first instance, and the 2,280 persons in thesecond, upon which Victoria obtained her twenty-third member, we hear grumblingsin certain quarters in connection with the 1 proposed redistribution. In the interests of the proper representation, not merely of New South Wales, but of the whole Commonwealth, it is absolutely necessary that there shall be a redistribution.

40,Mr Fuller,"There was no grumbto secure proper representation in this House, so that we shall have, as nearly as possible, equality in the matter of one adult -one vote throughout the Commonwealth, it is imperative that every honourable member .should recognis'e that it is his duty to support the position assumed by the Government, and to help them to pass a Bill for .the redistribution of seats. I have nothing further to add. I have dealt with the only matter referred to in the Governor-Gene.ral's Speech, and I trust that it will receive the proper consideration of the House. I commend the Government for the manly, straightforward, honest stand they have taken up,, and feel satisfied that it will re-ceive the commendation of every rightthinking man and woman in Australia. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) In -rising to second the motion for the adoption 'of the Address-in-Reply, I may say that, like the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, I intend to be brief, becaus'e I -think that His Excellency's Speech leaves very little for me to say. The only matter with which it deals is the proposal of the ""Government to bring in a measure for the redistribution of seats; and, apart altogether from the question of whether any State should have the number of its representatives varied, I think it is essential that the States should be divided into something like equal electorates. If we are to have one adult one vote, the corollary is that there shall be one vote one power. It is not in accordance with such a Constitution as is ours that one honourable member should represent more than double the number of 'the electors to be found in practically an adjoining electorate. -same representation in the Senate as has any of the other States? MrM c WILLIAMS -of the Constitution as it stands. It has given the States a certain measure of representation, and every one who is familiar1 with the difficulties surrounding the erection of the Federal Constitution knows that, without equal representation in the Senate, there would have been no Federation todav. It is essential that a proper redistribution of seats, shall take place before an appeal is made to the country. I regret, 'however, that any State should lose a proportion of tlie representation which it has enjoved, and I hope that when the population statistics are counted or recounted, it will be found that Victoria will not have to -part with any of her existing measure of representation. It is deplorable that in a young community like that of Australia any State should lose a proportion of its representation on account of a decrease of its population, and I hope that such a contingency will not arise. As to the position which the Government has taken up, I must say that they have my hearty congratulations. There has never been a Government in office with a majority at their back since my election to this House, and the majority supporting the present Ministry has always been small. Indeed, if my advice had been taken-for what it was worth-the course they now intend to pursue would have been followed when a crisis occurred on a prior occasion. When I first entered this Chamber the Deakin Government, who were then in office, had not a majority, and, indeed, they did not at any time have a majority behind them. We had then three parties in the House, and each was practically as strong as that behind the Government. When the Watson Government took office, they had very little more than one-third of the honourable members of this Chamber sitting behind them. It was really impossible for either the Deakin Government, or the Watson Government, to pass practical legislation, to control the House, or to govern the country. As long as the honourable and learned member for Ballarat remained faithf u l to the agreement entered into between his party and that led by the present Prime Minister, the position was different. That agreement was an honourable and proper one, and I believe that' it had the support of a majority of honourable members. AlthoughI confess that I have been unable to W h y has Tasmania the thoroughly grasp the exact attitude taken up by the honourable and learned member for Biallarat in his recent address to his I am speaking constituents, it must be patent to every one who has perused the reports of that address, that the. loyal agreement entered into between the two parties has, so far as the leaders are concerned, terminated. They -have reached the parting . of the ways. There is no one who would have received more abuse than the Prime Minister would have done had he come down to the House with a proposal to attempt to carry on when his majority had practically gone. The very honourable members who are now attempting to deride his action would have been foremost in abusing and challenging him to take up the very position that he has now assumed. What is the",15,William Lyne Wh Y Did The Ling On The Part Of Honourable Members From
41,Mr Watkins,"objection which some honourable members have been taking, both in the lobbies, and whilst the honourable and learned member for Illawarra was speaking? It is urged that the Prime Minister has indicated a course which he cannot himself carry out. It would be useless to deny that it is not in the power of any Minister, or any Government, to command a dissolution. It is not in the power of any Ministry to saythat they will not exert themselves to remain in office, and that the moment they retire there will be a dissolution. The position which the Prime Minister has taken up is thoroughly in accord with the highest traditions of constitutional government. When the Ministry of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat failed to hold a majority, they retired, and when the Watson Government failed to carry a majority, they also retired. honourable and learned member for Ballarat on leaving office did not apply for a dissolution, but we know that the present leader of the Opposition did, and I think that he was to be commended for his action. That being the position, what objection can there be to the proposal of the Prime Minister to make a proper and above-board provision to enable him to apply for a dissolution if he cannot hold a majority ? Minister secure a majority if he went to the country? MrM c WILLIAMS It does not lie in the mouth of the honourable member for Darwin to say that he could or could not do so. That is a question which those who have sent us here must decide. If there be a majority of the electors of Australia prepared to adopt the programme of the Labour Party, that party ought certainly to be in office to carry out that programme. programme ? MrM c WILLIAMS member will have an alternative programme, and I sincerely trust that it will be more clearly gramme which some honourable members matter. of result being' that during the last three is the arbiter in all these matters. months they have been running about the country attempting to explain that they and learned member for Darling Downs did not mean it.

I within the power of any Prime Minister, refer to a cartoon which appeared in Lonor of the leader of the Opposition, to comdon Punch, and has been considered one of the few worthy of preservation. As honourable members are aware, when John Russell sought to put back the hands of the clock, so far as Catholic emancipation was concerned, he ran through the country attempting to explain his proposal. This led Punch to bring out an exceedingly clever cartoon depicting John Russell, after putting up "" No Popery"" on the wall, flying for his life. I think that is exactly the position of the ex-Prime Minister-the present leader of the Opposition-for , having written up "" Socialism "" on the walls of the Commonwealth, he has been engaged during the last three months in touring the country, and attempting to explain that what he proposed was really not Socialism, or, if it was, it was such a little bit of Socialism, that, after all, it was not worth' I believe that the considering.

Mr .REID (East Sydney-Minister of External Affairs) I have consulted with my honourable ' friend the leader of the Opposition, andi he has raised no objection to the proposal I am about to make. As we have no standing order governing the matter, no time would be fixed for another meeting of the Housei f , by any misfortune, at the hour appointed for our next meeting a quorum could, not be obtained. I am sure that as we stand at present no one-especi ally not my honourable friends opposite!wishes to risk any such position of affairs. I , therefore, think it right that we should' without delay pass a sessional order which will safeguard us from such a misfortune, and I therefore move That until otherwise ordered this House shall meet for the despatch of business at half-past 2 o'clock on each Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoon, and at half-past ro o'clock on each Friday morning.
