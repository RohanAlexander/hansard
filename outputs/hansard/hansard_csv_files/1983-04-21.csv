It is of the then Government he did two things. First almost impossible for the business sector to gain of all he arranged for an immediate advance of any form of meaningful government welfare $16m to the two States ahead of the ordinary assistance. payment requirements under the natural disaster There should also be a criterion for the degree relief arrangements. Secondly, he declared a of generosity between a person whose principal moratorium on campaigning in a critical period home is burnt and somebody whose holiday or and this was his loss rather than the then Opposecond home is burnt. This problem has been exsition's loss. However, the point I want to make is perienced because quite a number of holiday that the then Prime Minister declared and led a homes were burnt out in southern Victoria on this moratorium. I think that is to his credit and to the occasion. The third criterion which is neededcredit of all others who were in that situation at this has been mentioned by previous speakers that time. from this side-would provide an incentive for What about the period since the fires-the people to insure their houses. It would be wrong aftermath, the post-mortems? This is always a far for a person who neglected to adopt a personal more difficult matter. I think one of the things responsibility to receive greater generosity than that have become obvious concerns the inability somebody who had taken some care in this of the Government of Victoria. I am not having a matter. crack at the present State Government. ThisI come now to the Federal Government and its would probably be true of any State government responsibilities and problems in the aftermath of faced with the magnitude of this situation. But it is these disasters. The first point I want to put to the obvious that the State Government was not ready Minister for Finance( Mr Dawkins) is that one of to implement what was necessary for relief and the forms of tremendous generosity that were proreconstruction afterwards. There was no strucvided during the fires was donations in kind by ture or no arrangements which would automatiother farmers in areas already drought stricken. cally follow. One of those forms of donation was the provision I support a previous speaker from this side of of fodder.

Because of implemented so that everybody in that State the greatest drought in our history there was knows that whenever the next disaster of that already a shortage of fodder. However, those domagnitude strikes certain things will follow and nations were not tax deductible. I appeal to the certain procedures will be adopted. For example, Minister to consider that situation because that donations should not be paid into the consolidated was a donation far more generous than money. revenue of the State Government. I think that is Money would have been useless in the circuman insult to the generosity of the individuals who stances. I understand there is still the problem of what happens to the advances made to people as twice-in 1939 and again this year-and no fire relief and whether that is tax deductible. lessons seem to have been learned. The necessity However, the main point I want to concentrate for precautionary strategic burning is so obvious the Government's attention on is whether it is from this situation. It should be done both in forpossible to do something about donations in kind, est commission areas and in some of the hilly and particularly when they are given with such treed suburbs of Melbourne.

The next point-it has already been made-is The final point is that it would be completely that there is a need for sensible conservation foolish if the Government, in its cost cutting measures to reduce the risk of that sort of fire or measures, were to interfere in any way with the holocaust occurring again.
