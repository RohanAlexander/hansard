11,Mr Brucesmith (Parkes),"The-obvious from its title that an attempt is being made to. give the proposed Court of -Conciliation and Arbitration jurisdiction to interfere in industrial disputes, not merely when they have arisen in and extended beyond the limits of a State, but at a stage at which they can be prevented from doing so; -and I predict, with some confidence, that this will lead to the Court being appealed to merely to duplicate the efforts of the -States Courts. If it interferes in industrial -disputes as they are defined in the Bill, it will not wait till a strike or a lock-out; it will attempt when the States Courts could do the work. petent to prevent a dispute has extended beyond the stage at which it is said that it will intervene. pointed out that to talk of preventing an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act, at a time when it had already begun and had extended to another State, was a paradox;. and ' therefore that this Bill, if really within the provision of the Constitution, section 51, subjection (35), cannot provide for anything more nor less than a court for the settlement-of which have arisen and have extended from one State to another. thinker on political questions and every honourable member who reads history and recognises the seriousness of this question, .will admit that in beginning an experiment of this kind:-which according to the honorable and learned gentleman in charge of the Bill, is going to mark a new era in civilization-every from any community in which a similar Act has been in operation must be of very .great service to us. We cannot but look to countries like New Zealand, Western Australia, and South Australia, quite apart front abstract principles, for tbe actual practice which has been brought about by the operation of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts there. I referred previously to an expression of opinion which had been given in New Zealand by trades unionists themselves. Bland, the leader of the labour party, said that that expression represented the view only of one man. Now, I find on referring to the document.upon which I relied, that it was not merely the expression' of opinion of a unionist, but. of tlie Trades Hall Council of Wellington. Mr Bruce Smith. from New Zealand; read in the South Australian Parliament. I am reading now from the South Australian Hansard, which contains an extract from the South Australian Register as to what had taken place in New Zealand. Tlie extract was quoted by the Honourable George Brookman, in making a speech on the Factories Act Repeal Bill. This is what he saidIn the Register of 14th June, 1902, was a telegram dated Wellington, 13th June-""The manner in which the Arbitration Act has been found to to intervene at a stage operate, is meeting with unfavorable criticism at the hands of the Wellington Trades and Labour Council. ' The delegates stated at Otherwise it must be incoma meeting last night that the' unionists until it of Wellington cursed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It would soon be the biggest curse the colony ever had, unless unionists raised I have their voices to protest against the methods in which the Act was being carried out. These remarks were called forth by the award in the painter's case given by Judge Cooper (President of the Arbitration Court). The speaker urged that the President of the Court should bo elected by both parties, who would then have confidence in him. The President should not be a Judge but a commercial man."" And that will have a bearing upon a part of disputes this Bill when we get into Committee. I think that every of New Zealand have since repudiated that expression of opinion. able member should have read the repudiation in his speech, if he knew that it existed. Another unionist said the preference clause was so hedged with conditions that it was absolutely useless. Registration under the Act meant giving possiblelight that can be thrown up their right to refuse to sell their labour at a satisfactory price. If that last sentiment is typical of the feelings of unionists, 1 submit that it goes to the whole root of this measure. Because, if the unionists desire to retain the right to sell their labour, which is their particular commodity, at what they consider to be a satisfactory price it would be perfectly useless to bring into existence a Conciliation and Arbitration Act; which takes the right from them and undertakes to settle what is .The honourable member for a proper price for that labour. that discussion 1 South Australian Register! port continuesIt was time, said another speaker, that employers started to build up their funds and organize.

If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has in his possession any document in which the whole of that series of utterances is repudiated, I invite him either to read it to the House or to allow some one else to read it in order to neutralize the probable effect that a feeling of this kind on the part of the unionists of Wellington, as expressed by the Trades-hall Council, would be likely to have upon the minds of reasonable men who are considering the probable effects of this Bill upon the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth. conference ? as a sort of encyclopaedia upon unionist discussions or agitations.

The Arbitration Court is unfore it. . Mr Seddon told a deputation of unionists this evening thatfchesystem was being ridden to death, aud unless they conducted their affairs more circumspectly public opinion would turn against them. He declared the people were beginning to grow sick of the whole thing, as a result of which industry was hampered, and employers were kept in continual turmoil. The correspondent of the Age commentsThese remarks by the Premier coincide with the views generally expressed hy the newspapers which comment adversely on the easy manner in which fche machinery of fche 83'stem can be utilized. then Mr Seddon has said the opposite. honourable member to quote his subsequent remarks if he made any. an opportunity. at the time when the President of the I am not here Arbitration Court was attacked 1 and I cannot say.

35,"Ously From Observations By Mr Mcgregor,","to the doubtfulness of what he has said, we must also regard the fact that a man has been friendly to a principle as giving emphasis to the fact that he is now of the really great encouragement that the A ct has afforded to people to bring their disputes before the Court, not when there is a liability of a strike or lockout, but when they think that they can get something from the Court, possibly a splitting of the difference, points out clearly that when Mr Reeves introduced the New Zealand Act he never intended for a moment that it should be used for such a purpose. This is what Mr Reeves himself saidI determined to confine its operation to disputes between masters and trade unions. I was induced to take bhat course for several reasons, one of which is this : That if you allow one workman, or two or three organized workmen to drag an employer before the Board of Conciliation, not only would that be grossly unfair to the employer, but it would soon make a laughing stock of the whole system. It would make tlie measure so extremely unpopular, that a succeeding Parliament would probably sweep it away. I know that Mr Reeves has since published a book in approval qf the Act, and also that from time to time he has published in the London Times statements contradicting communications received from its representative in New Zealand showing how unfairly and how injuriously to industry fche Act was operating. One cannot, however, lose sight of the fact that Mr Reeves' intention, as indicated at the time the A ct was introduced, shows that he expected a very much more limited application of it . His views are at present very much those of a mother upou having the good looks of her offspring attacked, because those who read the Times must know that upon every occasion when the correspondent of the Times in New Zealand has sent a communication showing how unfairly and injuriously the Act is operating in New Zealand, Mr of Sydney.

If"" the honourable member is classing Times correspondents among the ordinary local correspondents of Australian newspapers, he iscomparing men of a totally different calibre, and to whom totally different criticism should be applied. in Melbourne is in the Argus office away from the fact which I stated previously that in New Zealand within five years, no less than"" 400 cases have been actually tried by the Arbitration Court.

42,Mr Bruc E Smith,"We cannot getmatters into their own hands. Then Mr Wise saidThey could not make men work for terms that they were dissatisfied M ith, any more than the : men could make an employer run his factory if he did not want to. 'The Trades and Labour Council had a meeting, to which the following reference was -madeThe attention of the Sydney Labor Council was directed last night to the Arbitration Act Amending Bill introduced in the Legislative Council by the Attorney-General. Two speakers, Messrs. F. : Flowers, M.L.C., and T. H. Thrower, briefly outlined their objections to Mr Wise's proposals. This is what Mr Thrower saidApparently it was found that trie technicalities which surrounded the administration had caused a heavy accumulation of business, and now the Department desired to farm some of it out; but the workers' views would have to be heard on that question. I quote these passages because I think they clearly show that the very easy-going and Utopian views which some honourable members entertain of this Bil l require to be carefully considered. We may depend upon it, that if the trades unions of this country can bring into operation the adjudication of this Court merely by extending the ramifications of any particular union from one State to another, and by subsequently inducing that union to make a demand upon an employer, so as to constitute under the Act "" a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State,"" the business of the Court itself will speedily reach that condition of congestion into which the New South Wales Court has fallen, and into which, according to the utterances of Mr Seddon, the New Zealand Court has also drifted. Evidently the Attorney-General contemplates that possibility, because, instead of providing for an itinerant Courtwhich -could move about from State to State and settle disputes as they arose, it is -actually proposed to give power to delegate the work of the Court to the different States Courts, and even to other tribunals, should the Federal Court deem that course -desirable. gestion. might not, because, as I have shown, not only is the New' South Wales Court congested with two years' work-as was announced by the Judge-bu t it is now proposing to delegate its work to District Court Judges in various parts of the State. If all that is required to make an industrial dispute extend beyond the limits of any one State is a demand on an employer by a union whose ramifications extend to another State, so that it can be called an "" Inter1 State"" dispute, there is every prospect of the business of this Court being also congested. As I have pointed out, the same conditions obtain in New Zealand and New South Wales. Now, I wish to put this proposition before the House : This Bill contemplates that the work of the Federal Arbitration Court may be delegated to the States Courts. Why, then, is there any necessity to call an additional Court into existence ? We all know the spirit of economy that was displayed in connection with the Judiciary Bill. A very large number of honourable members contended that there was no need for the creation of a separate court composed of Federal Judges when the work of adjudicating upon Commonwealth laws could be delegated to the States Courts. Why is not that argument employee/1 here instead of calling into existence a fresh court, the President of which is required under the Act to be a High Court Judge at £3,000 a year, and to be associated with two assessors at correspondingly high salaries. plate the expenditure of an extra £3,000 a year. that it does not. We are aware that as long as the Government contemplated the appointment of five Justices to the High Court, it would have been a very easy matter to say-""We will allow one of those Justices to perform this particular work."" But, now that the House has limited the High Court Bench to three Justices, I should like the honourable and learned member to tell me how that tribunal can carry on its work with two Justices in order tliat the third may be enabled to conduct the business of the Arbitration and Conciliation Court, seeing that a difference of opinion between.the two would mean that the whole proceedings before them would count for nought 1 the President of the Arbitration Court shall receive no more salary than attaches to his position as a Justice of the High' Court.",15,Second Reading

47,Mr Higgins,"Claus e 24 declares thatanswer my objection. I repeat that so long as the High Court consisted of five Justices, as was originally proposed by the Government, one of them might at any time have conducted the work of the Arbitration Court. But, seeing that the Justices of the High Court have been limited to three, if one of them is to transact the business of the Arbitration Court, two of his colleagues will be required to do the work of the High Court. for the appointment of five Justices to the High Court. A t the same time, it does not answer my argument that the operation of this Bill will necessitate the appointment of another Judge at a salary of £3,000 a year. It would be absurd' for the High Court to attempt to perform its work with only two Justices, seeing that at the end of long proceedings, there might possibly be a division of opinion amongst them, causing the whole of the time of counseland of the parties to the suit to be wasted, and necessitating the case being argued afresh. Therefore, I say that we are asked to pass a' Bill which practically necessitates the appointment of a fourth High Court Judge at a salary of £3,000 a year, and of two other members at correspondingly high salaries. If sure 'the same spirit of economy which was prompted by the Kyabram movement, it will hesitate very much before it calls into existence a new court which is quite unnecessary, because-as I have already pointed out-it is perfectly easy to delegate the whole work of this tribunal to the States Arbitration Courts, and to obtain just the same careful and complete adjudication that we should get in any Commonwealth Court which we might establish. Courts in some of the States. if a dispute can be extended from one State to another, why can it not be tried in the State in which such a court does exist 1 If it is easy to bring an industrial dispute within the cognisance of the Arbitration Court by extending the ramifications of any union to another State, why is it not possible to extend the ramifications of a union -sa y in Tasmania or in Queensland-int o Victoria or New South Wales, so that the courts in the States to which such disputes extend may adjudicate upon them ? We should thus get rid of this dreadful £3,000 a year, which is such a nightmare to many honourable members, of the salaries of the two other members, and of all the administrativeparaphernalia which must follow the creation, of an additional court. extends to a State which has no Arbitration Court? pointed out that under this Billi t is possible to bring industrial disputes within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court by extending the ramifications of any particular union to another State.

If the extension of the ramifications of any union into another State, or the federalization of the the House applies to this meaunions in the different States, will have the effect of'giving jurisdiction'to the Federal. Arbitration Court, it simply means that in every dispute the question of the conditions, of labour in the States will be tried by two courts-namely, by the court which exists in the State where the dispute originates, and by the court whose operations extend to that State. We may also, by a sort of rivalry between the courts, which is not altogether an impossibility, have decisions given by the States Courts and by the Federal Arbitration Court which are absolutely antagonistic to each other. Take, I know that; but for example, the case of a union whoseramifications extend from New South Wales into Victoria.' A dispute in. which thatunion was concerned would immediately become a matter within the jurisdiction of the State Court. Buti t would also come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Courtby reason of the fact that the dispute extended into Victoria.

The paragraph has a very strong bearing upon the question of experience, for it shows that the working of an Act of this kind for five or six years is not sufficient to enable one to judge of its effect. Judge Backhouse saidThe awards generally have been iu favour of the workers, and it is, therefore, easy to understand that the unionists to a man believe in the Act, and non-unionists so far as my observation goes, find .no fault with it. . . . The preferI t is very uncommon. ence to unionists so far has affected non-unionists but little, as upfconow there has been abundant work for all. . . .

This is what he has said upon this questionIt has been tried in New Zealand, where, it is alleged, it has signally failed; this seems to have been admitted by the author of the measure. As well make litigation compulsory. In all trading and commercial disputes, before arbitration can be resorted to the parties must enter an action at law; this is voluntary. Those are the opinions of three men whose testimony cannot be doubted ; because one receives the opinion of an interested person which is against his interest, as being of much more force than an opinion emanating from a person whose interest is in the direction of the view that he advocates. Here are the heads of two great American labour organizations, wholive in a country in which there is a population of something like S0,000,000, and who, though aware of this panacea, say "" We want none of it . We know all about it ; but we do not want it . "" The recommendation of the Moseley Commission tended to confirm that conclusion by telling the workmen of England"" We do not want any of these ready-made millenniums; we will work out one for ourselves by natural laws."" It is a fact which.it is well for the House to know that in New Zealand the farmers were entirely removed from the operation of the Arbitration Act by an AmendingB i ll which was introduced because of the influence brought to bear upon the Prime Minister of the country by a large and growing part of the population. Why did they want to be dropped out ? The farmers of New Zealand, we may suppose, saw for themselves the effects of this panacea, which was operating in their country. If compulsory arbitration be such a beautiful means of making the lion lie down with the lamb, why did not the farmers in New Zealand, who are a ""cute"" class, remain within the fold of the measure ? Why did they seek-and seek successfullyto get out of it 1 Does not the fact that in New Zealand the conciliation clauses of fche Act have been dropped out altogether -althoug h included in the measure before us-sho w that even in New Zealand, apart from the experience they have had, and apart from the insufficiency of the time allowed us to judge of its ultimate success, the measure has not given satisfaction ?

The employer says in effect-*' I have to carry on a certain industry, and I must have certain labour for that purpose. I am prepared to pay 7s. per day."" A number of men, however, who belong to a union reply-""We will not sell our labour for less than 9s. per day."" Freedom of action requires that the individual who declines to pay more than the 7s. per day should be allowed to shut up his establishment and say-"" I cannot afford to pay more than that amount."" Under the operation of this Bill he is to be compelled either to pay the 9s. per day or to come before the Arbitration Court and assign, reasons why he should not do so. We might just as reasonably insist that the shopkeeper who demands 10s. for a hat, for which I have offered 7s. 6d., should be brought before the court to state his reasons for declining to accept my offer. What is a strike? A number of workmen offer their commodity, which is their labour, for, say, 7s. per day. modity? force or manual skill. That is the commodity which they are prepared to sell to the employer. The latter, however, may s a y "" I cannot afford to pay you 7s. per day; I can offer you only 6s.""

151,Mr Bruce Smith,"I do not takeAs a rule, whenever men talk about these things they fail to apply the principle involved to their own occupations. Whenever a workman becomes an employer, I am very much interested in noticing his complete change of view of the econo inic situation. It is purely a question of political economy, and everything paid over and above the amount payable under the principle which I have enunciated represents philanthropy. Thank God, we are all free to exercise philanthropy at any time. If I choose to go into a hatter's shop and purchase an article which is marked at 10s. there is nothing to prevent me from saying to the shopman"" I think you are a very decent fellow, and I insist upon paying you 12s. 6d."" The two matters, ho wever, are quite distinct. The gravest objection which I have to this B ill is that it hands over the management of one's business to a board of men, who, to my mind, are the least competent, from the point of view of their character and ability, to perform the duties which they are called upon to discharge. In any investigation into something which has already occurred, I can quite understand that we should employ a lawyer who thoroughly understands how to sift evidence, and to apply the law to the facts of the case. But where, instead of an investigation by a Judge or a jury into past events, the inquiry to be instituted practically amounts to a settlement of the conditions under which, not merely the parties before the Court, but persons all over the country, shall in future conduct their business, it is an inquiry of a totally different nature. It is not then a question of investigating the past but of settling regulations for the future management of the business of the whole country to which the common rule may at any time be extended. I heard the honourable member for Bland declare that there was no difference-and I think the Attorney-General also urged the same contention -betwee n compelling men to refer their labour disputes to a Court of this description and compelling them to refer their ordinary disputes to a court of law. I maintain that there is all the difference in the world. There is absolutely nothing in common between them. If I render myself liable to any oue of my fellow citizens for a breach of the law, he will bring me before a court-eithe r for something that I have done or that I have left undone-in order that my breach may be reduced to a money value. But in this instance we are asking employers to come under the operation 6i a Bill-no t because they have done something which is either right or wrong-bu t in order thcit they may have their business regulated ; during the coming years, although they may not be before the Court at all. AVe know that the common rule principle means that A and B, having a business in which certain men are discontented, may be brought before the Court in Melbourne. That Court may, in the light of the evidence given by A and B and their employees, lay down a rule, with regard to the conduct of their particular industry, which rule will extend to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and compel men carrying on the same business in the northern parts of Queensland to manage it accordingly. That is the effect of the common rule. I should like to know how it would be possible for a court sitting, say, in the southern part of Australia to lay down a common rule that might extend to businesses carried on in an altogether different climate, where the state of labour was entirely different, and the surroundings of business absolutely foreign to those of the community in which the Court sits. in such a case. the Court power to make it apply. a thing ? whatany Judge would do. Idonotthink that a Judge is the best type of man to place in such a position. If we are to recognise that this Court will be, not merely a Court to settle past strikes or locks-out, but a Court that will regulate the business of industries for future years, or months, in all parts of Australia, then a lawyer will not be the best man to preside over such a tribunal. We should have a man familiar with the particular kind of business which is to be regulated. and learned member agree in this matter with another honourable member who is in the same line of business 1 member for Melbourne is not in my line of business. that the honourable and learned member was a shareholder in a shipping company.",25,Forrest I T Was Passed In How A Measure Of This Kind Will Ultimately

175,Mr Bruc Esmith,"I am aware ofunder this Bil l will not be able to do anything but settle disputes which have extended from one to another State. It will have no jurisdiction to deal with a dispute in any State until it has extended to another State, because until a dispute so extends it is purely a State question, and comes within the jurisdiction of the State Court. But if this Court will have in the settlement of disputes which have occurred to dive into the future, in order to lay down conditions that will prevent a recurrence of trouble, it will be necessary to have, not a lawyer, but a business man to do the work.. It is an absurdity to think that a lawyer would be able to briug to bear experience equal to that of men of business attainments. I could understand a proposal, for example, that an iron-founder with a knowledge of business principles should be appointed to investigate a case in another class of business altogether. Buti t would be an absurdity to take a lawyer having .no business experience whatever-and knowing not even what I might call the elements of business, nor the phraseology of business men-and to ask him to"" dive into the future, in order to determine the conditions of a particular industry which might be finally carried on all over Australia, or, at all events, in two or three States. My only fear is that the injury that will be done by interfering with businesses in any way will be accentuated by bringing legal minds to bear upon business principles and business concerns. and learned member vote for the Bill if it provided for the appointment of commercial men to deal with this matter? more readily vote for a B ill of that kind than for one proposing to create a tribunal the president of which would be a lawyer to deal with these questions. Experience shows that whenever the employers and the workmen come together in order to arrange an amicable settlement of a dispute, they almost invariably choose as their representatives men who have some knowledge of the business with which they are called upon to deal. The honourable member is aware of the fact. He.has been connected with the coal industry, and he knows that if the members of the colliers' unions were choosing some one to decide between the miners and the mine-owners, they would not think of selecting a doctor for the purpose. banister to do the work. bers know that when the Prime Minister was chosen as an arbitrator in connection with the dispute in the coal trade, he was selected for the purpose of settling a difficulty which had already occurred.

The Attorney-General spoke very feelingly about the advantages of the principle of the minimum wage. I should like to say a word on that subject, because the experience of Victoria has thrown a very important light upon it . When the wages boards were first appointed there was no anticipation of the possible effect of minimum-wage provisions upon the least capable workmen and workwomen. Buti t was found that as soon as the employer had to pay a fixed minimum rate of wage he naturally tried to obtain for the money the best workmen available, and the consequence was that the older and infirm workmen, who could not do as much work as",27,Forrest I T Was Passed In How A Measure Of This Kind Will Ultimately

In the Attorney General's speech we were told that the Bill introduced a new era in the history of civilization, and would bring about a condition of human happiness such as we have never had before. If that beso, why should not the public servants of the Commonwealth be allowed to enter the hallowed circle? Why should not a dispute such as recently occurred between the Victorian Government and its railway servants come under the jurisdiction of the Court? learned member vote to bring public servants under the operation of the measure ? glad to exclude every one from its operation. I am endeavouring to show the inconsistency of the Attorney-General. He .flowered out into a beautiful poem of three hours' duration, for the edification and instruction of the people of Australia, and, at the end of his remarks, coldly told us that he proposed to exclude public servants from the benefits of his panacea. I hope honourable members will find out why he has done that. He did not in his speech use one argument which justifies him in excluding them from a share in the general happiness. He told us that the Court would have no power of enforcing its decrees in regard to them ; but surely the Parliament of a (State would not disregard the decision of a Court appointed by the Commonwealth Parliament ! If the Attorney-General has no better reason, for excluding the public servants from the operation of the Bill, I advise him to set his legal wits to work to conceive some means of compelling State Ministers to obey any orders which this Parliament may empower the Court to make. I should be glad to exclude everybody from the operation of the measure, because I believe that all who escape from its octopuslike embrace-whethe r they be farmers, or seamen, or others-wil l be the happier for having done so. But the Attorney General is highly inconsistent in providing this magnificent ""salve for all industrial ills, and preventing the public servants from sharing in the happiness which it will produce I have spoken in no spirit of antagonism, but as a friend who thinks that the adoption of the measure will not bring about the happiness expected from it. If I have in any instance spoken roughly, or violently, or too forcibly, and have hurt the feelings of either capitalists or workmen, I hope that it will be understood that I have done so only because I honestly believe, as the result of my reading of history, and of my observations of commercial and industrial l'fe, that the measure will not only not bring about the benefits expected from it but will create great trouble. I think that the expressions of opinion of the trades unionists of New Zealand tind Western Australia, which I have read to the House, will be repeated throughout the Commonwealth, when the decisions of the Court are againts the unions, and that dissatisfaction will intensify until we have in time such a cumulative objection to the Bill as will lead to a I should be very very strong agitation for its repeal. ThenI shall haye one sort of satisfaction. But, in opposition to my own convictions, I hope that the Bill, if passed by this House, may succeed. I am afraid it will not, and I think I have only done my duty in presenting my pressing thoughts upon this House, for good or for ill . Mi"". HIGGI NS (Northern Melbourne) I congratulate the honourable and learned member upon his able and well arranged speech. I think that he has submitted theories which ought to have been brought under the notice of honourable members, and I do not think they could have been better expressed. The honourable and learned member says that he has studied political economy for more than thirty years, and his speech showed tlie result of prolonged and careful study of the subject. It struck me, however, that his thirty years of study must have been based upon the political economy of at least sixty years ago, and that he had not kept himself in touch with latter-day conditions or criticisms. The honourable and learned member is not to be rebuked by us for speaking, although he may be in a minority. I have had the experience of being in a minority, and I can sympathize with him. I feel that it is.my duty to give him credit for honest intentions, just as honourable members credited me upon a former occasion when I was in a minority. We all desire that honourable members should speak fairly, as straight-out opponents, of any of the measures which may be brought forward. It was not the violence of the honourable and learned member's language which pressed upon us sometimes so much as his attitude of lecturing in a superior tone, and his apparent wish to inform all and sundry",29,Forrest I T Was Passed In How A Measure Of This Kind Will Ultimately

207,Mr Bruce Smith,"that no one but himself had studied the subject; in fact, I was reminded of Mr feature about the position of the honourable Barlow in Sandford and Merton. The honourable and learned member, in the character of Mr Barlow, expressed himself with equal felicity and equal sententiousness to the honourable member for Melbourne as Tommy Merton, and to the honourable and learned member for West Sydney as Harry Sandford*, and gave them a lecture which rebuked the two extremes at the same time. I feel peculiar interest in this measure, because it was upon my motion, as the honourable and learned member for Parkes has mentioned, that sub-section (35) of section 51 of the Constitution was inserted. It was proposed in substance by the right honourable and learned member for South .Australia, Mr Kingston, at the 1891 Convention. I proposed it in Adelaide, and I was beaten by 22 votes to 12. Some of the satisfaction I feel in connection with this matter is due to the gradual accession of those who opposed the principle of the measure to the ranks of those who are supporting it. Looking over the list, I find that at the Adelaide as well as at the Melbourne sittings of the Convention, the Prime Minister opposed the sub-section. The leader of the Opposition also opposed it . Downer was among its opponents at both places. independent of any opposition to the principle of compulsory arbitration. were several reasons actuating several men. Another Minister, the Postmaster-General, the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, the Vice President of the Executive Council, and the honourable member for Wentworth also opposed the sub-section. Not only that, but the Hon. B. R. Wise, the Attorney General of New South Wales, who has since introduced an Arbitration Bill into the State Parliament, opposed the sub-clause at both Sydney and Melbourne. Not only do I find the leading members of the Ministry and Opposition in this Parliament supporting the Bill, but also an honourable member who has a grip of a very important industry. I refer to the honourable member for Melbourne, who has become converted to the idea of conciliation and arbitration in trade disputes. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN orable and learned member convert h i m l and locks-out. member for Melbourne is that he did not speak from mere theory or hearsay, but from a concrete knowledge of, and from actual touch with, the facts. I think that his opinion will carry great weight owing to the fact that he speaks from the attitude of an employer of labour in one of the largest industries of Australia, and with a knowledge of the extent to which the industry may be affected by the operation of such a Bill as that now before us. The leader of the Opposition made a statement that startled me. He has become converted to the desirability of establishing a Court of Arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes ; at least, he is going to vote for the Bill. I am not quite sure that it is quite the same thing. He said that the Bill was an admission that our civilization had failed. I conceive that the very reverse is the truth. It simply affords an instance of civilization being applied to industrial disputes in the same way as to disputes regarding property and other matters. Private wars have been crushed and put down. Even the ordinary duels between individuals have been prohibited, Sir John and women who are neighbours, and who. are disposed to quarrel, are told by the law that they must not quarrel any more on the public footpath. . honourable and learned member contend that I have no. doubt there there is any analogy between such cases and those to which the Bill will apply % is an analogy. The point .is that trades disputes are not the concerns only of those who are immediately engagecl in the quarrel. Such disputes affect the public ; they affect innocent people who have nothing whatever to do with them. It is all very well to say that a man should be allowed to do what he likes, so long as he does not interfere with any one else; but it cannot be said that trade disputes do not interfere with other people. The position has been well stated by. Mr Reevesi n an article in one of the American reviews. He saysThe wisdom of a householder who might allow his family and servants to settle'a domestic dispute by smashing the furniture and each other, while he contentedly locked the front door and kept strangers from the door step, would not impress any one.

The losses which the public sustain are tremendous, and far and away greater in proportion than those incurred by the employers and employees directly concerned. I wish to say a word with regard to the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution. References have been made to sub-section (35) of section 51, the words of which have created some difficulty. They are as follows :Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. There are two things that can be done with one set of facts. The subject to be dealt with is disputes extending beyond the limits of anyone State. The Federal Parliament is empowered to deal with disputes which are widespread, asdistinguished from those which are confined to one State. Such disputes may be dealt with by prevention or by settlement, or both. Now, we cannot prevent a thing which has occurred ; therefore I hold that our power to legislate under this subsection is extremely wide. I do not mean to suggest that this power should be exercised at once, but I decline at this stage to set any limits to the powers which future Parliaments may exercise under this subsection. "" Prevention is better than cure,"" and the prevention of wide-spread disputes may cover measures which are beyond our cognizance, and beyond even pur imagination at present. Prevention is a tremendous power. It may interest honourable members to know something of the history of the adoption of the words of the sub-section. My first proposal at Adelaide was to insert the words "" industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" Those words read in conjunction with the words in the early part of the section would have amounted to a provision as follows :The Parliament shall have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. If those words had been adopted they would have permitted of any kind of legislalation with regard to industrial disputes of a widespread character. However a discussion took place, and I see by a reference to page 792 of the report of the proceedings of the Adelaide Convention, that I saidI am prepared to accept tlie suggestion of my honourable friend the President to have before the words "" industrial disputes,"" these words: ""Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of "" industrial disputes. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN W h a t did the honourable and learned member mean by "" prevention ?"" . honourable member understands the derivation of the word "" prevention."" Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I am referring to the scope of the honourable and learned member's proposal as it appeared to him at that time. have preferred to end the sub-clause at the word ""disputes."" I went on to sayBut in order to obviate the fear which some members entertain that this may enable the Federal Parliament to interfere in disputes purely local, I think it better to put in the words I hact originally at the end of my previous amendment; "" extending beyond the limits of any one State."" Throughout the whole of the Convention debates, I felt that labour legislation should be exclusively vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. Unfortunately, members had come to the Convention with their minds prejudiced in favour of certain theorieswhich they had derived from the antiquated Constitution of the United States. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN We had to obtain a Constitution which would be acceptable to all the States. Mi-. HIGGINS -There was a general belief in the Convention that factory legislation should be left to the States Parliaments. It was utterly impossible to overcome that feeling. Therefore, I had to see how the Commonwealth Parliament could, to some extent, obtain control over industrial disputes: Personally, I have always felt that Australia is ripe for a unity of a much higher character than it has obtained. I think that if members had not gone to the Convention with their judgments prejudiced in favor of the sanctity of the United States Constitution, we should have obtained a much better charter of government than that which we did. However, the fact remains that we have, in our Constitution, words the ambit of which I cannot foresee, and the power of which cannot at present be gauged. Speaking of the constitutional point which is involved,. I understand that the Government do not.",31,Forrest I T Was Passed In How A Measure Of This Kind Will Ultimately

233,Mr Glynn,"Unde r that section it wasfrom saying that, somewhat unusually, the Legislature of this country, in the very next session but one, passed an Act of Parliament (2) reversing that judgment-tlia t is to say, affirming, in the strongest terms, that the decision which had been arrived at by bhe majoribya very narrow majority-in bhab case was one bhab was nob the law of England; because bhe Acb does nob purport simply bo alter the law, bub ib declares bhe law, and says, in very plain terms, bhab bhis m and always has been bhe law of this countiy. Tlie Imperial Parliament, therefore, has said, in effect, that the decision given in that case did not express the true law, which was that the Parliament of Great Britain had f u l l power to imprison or even to execute for an offence committed upon a foreign ship which was trading within the three miles limit. upon a foreign voyage. difficulties which may have been raised in the Attorney-General's mind by that case can be disposed of. quoted it was to show the necessity of an A.ct of Parliament to re-express the will of the Legislature in dealing with the question of jurisdiction within the three miles limit. TheA ct has overridden in that particular instance so far as it applied, but not the principle of it to which I alluded. and the country very much regret that there has been a volcanic upheaval in the Ministry in consequence of such a difference of opinion among its members. In spite of all the ill-natured comments which appeared in certain sections of the press of the different States, I feel that the country as a whole recognised tlie honesty of purpose, the indomitable will, and the determination to do right, which were characteristic of the late Minister for Trade and Customs. It is only a pity that Ministers did not see their way-as I think they could have doneto included in this Bill the provisions which they intend to incorporate in another measure which may or may not be passed hereafter. "" A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" I apprehend that tlie late Minister for Trade and Customs felt that he could not allow Australian shipowners to be subject to disabilities which were not applicable to foreign shipowners. WhilstI am referring to the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, I desire to say, in justice to him, that he cannot be upbraided : Arbitration B ill. 3469 for not having furnished Government supporters with copies of this Bill at a very early stage. I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne referred to this matter last. night in a spirit of complaint. Interested as I was in the measure, I ventured to ask the late Minister for Trade and Customs for an advance copy of it , and he at once forwarded it and asked for suggestions. I have no doubt whatever that in the same way he was anxious to secure .suggestions from any quarter that he possibly could-of course, I refer to a friendly quarter. I have asked the permission of the right honourable and learned gentleman to make this statement. I can well understand his action in declining to supply draft copies of the measure indiswas criminately. I am quite sure, however, that if the honourable member for Melbourne had only written to tlie late Minister for Trade and Customs in the same way that I did, he would have been supplied with a copy.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The late Minister for Trade and Customs forwarded draft copies of the measure to certain organizations, but not to others. able member for Wentworth is doing him an injustice. After all, we must look at this matter from the evidence that is available. I do not dispute that the Bill is open to criticism, even in regard to its main features. I quite recognise that we are apt to be carried away by the idea that we are about to discover a new panacea for all ills.

242,Mr Higgins,"I think that the honorcompromise, which is devised to prevent most tragic results. I think that it was well saidThe ample proposition that hope makes In all designs beeun on earth below, Fails in the promis'd largeness. Sir quotation from a speech by the AttorneyGeneral1 be much more happily put. to choose between two evils. I do not know what solution may be found for the industrial troubles, which, judging by cablegrams from Russia, the United States, and other countries, recently published in the press, exist all over the world j but we have in this scheme of conciliation and arbitration a means of enabling the parties to work together better than they have done in the past. I admit that there is a distinction between a Conciliation and Arbitration Court and ordinary courts for litigation. In ordinary litigation we have principles of right, statutory or otherwise, to guide us, but in Conciliation and Arbitration Courts we have no principles to assist us. The position has been well put by Mr Sydney Webb. He says that, on the one hand, the workman insists that the first condition is a living wage, while, on the other hand, the employer insists that a certain margin of profit is essential. Which basis is to be observed ? I admit that we cannot logically find any means of so fitting in these two theories as to make them work together. But we must not forget the case of the iron workers in the North of England, who have successfully observed the principle of arbitration since the year 1869. The system thus observed has worked wonderfully well, because, as Mr Sydney Webb points out, the workmen are willing to admit that the employer is entitled to a profit of 10 per cent. The employer is required to produce his books, and to give evidence as to the extent of the business which he is transacting. Buti t is not everywhere that we can induce both parties to agree upon the adoption of such a basis of settlement. Although we cannot at present find -a principle of decision, I have .not the slightest doubt that such a principle will be evolved by intelligent men meeting and determining to settle disputes, and to arrange a mode of working amicably together. If we look into the history of the ordinary property laws of England, we find; that it was necessary to work out a principle in connection with that question. A t one time one person said"" I am entitled to this piece of land,"" while another one said"" I am entitled to the land that covers partprinciple to guide the parties, but when they said"" Come, let us meet together and conN o ; if it were it would sider the matter,"" a tremendous gam wasWe have secured. The point is not that we can make conflicting principles agree, but that each side can give up something. There must either be strikes or arbitration. We have no alternative. What principle of decision is observed in connection with strikes ? While in Chicago a few years agoI went through Armour's meat-preservingestablishment, and witnessed what wascalled "" Chicago sport."" I saw a man with a rifle in his hand walking over the heads of the cattle, and every now and then placing' the weapon behind the ear of a beast and, shooting it . The animal fell as it was shot,, and was at once dragged into the sheds. A young fellow who was assisting the rifleman told me that there had been a strike during: the year in connection with the industry. In answer to my inquiry he said that themen struck to obtain recognition of their demand that they should work only ninehours a day. "" Did you win 1"" I inquired. "" No , "" replied the man, "" b u t we shall strike again next year, and then we shall have the final tussle."" I gave the matter someconsideration at the time, and I asked myself what principle could there be to guide theparties in dealing with the question at issue. If the men could succeed, it would matter little what the loss to the employer might be, while, on the other hand, if the employers could succeed, it would matter little what the cost in human life might be, as long as their object was achieved. Strikes are a most brutal method of effecting the settlement of industrial disputes. When both sides meet round the same table there is a far greater chance of some principle of decision being arrived at. I was recently engaged in litigation affecting the Outtrim Colliery dispute, and I was very much alarmed to find that on the average a strike occurred at Outtrim. about once in six weeks. I learned that the men were continually going out on strike, and that the employers were constantly in trouble, as they never knew when men would be available for their work.

I understand that the honourable and learned member for Parkes usually concentrates all his efforts in a big and good .speech, and then vanishes. I am exceedingly sorry that he is not in the Chamber, for I should like him to show us an alternative to this scheme. Is the existing state -of things to go on for ever1 Has he no -suggestion to make to improve the present state of affairs ? Are we to remain in the miserable position of striking and fighting, -and to have no remedy 1 What has the honourable and learned member for Parkes done ? He has simply read extracts from irresponsible writings prejudiced newspapers published in different parts of the world. If I desired to do so, I might present the House with a thousand quotations for every one put forward by the honourable -and learned member, setting forth views directly opposite to those read by him. The -honourable and learned member gave us no facts. What fact is there in the whole history of the industrial question which shows that arbitration has been a failure ? I have not been able to find one. I care nothing for the "" man from Wellington."" While this B ill was being discussed last 'Tuesday, I had a conversation with a man who had been one of the leaders of a trades -union in Christchurch, New Zealand. He -told me that thissystem did not work in a wholly satisfactory way in that colony, -and he stated that although the New ZealandA c t provides that a man shall not be '-dismissed from his employment simply because he takes part in an agitation for better at large to be about 80,000,000 dols. terms, he had been dismissed for that very reason.

As a matter of fact, he had been dismissed with others, but ciple to which he referred was being -continually evaded. overcome the difficulty by appointing paid organizers, who stand as buffers between employers and employed. debate tbe old arguments against the adoption of the system have again and again been used. We are told that if we pass this Bill we shall drive capital out of the country. This is a cry of which I thought we had heard the last; but it is constantly being put forward. Honourable members have read the details of the Pullman strike which took place in 1894. Let me show the way in which capital was driven out of the country by that dispute. A Commission of impartial men was appointed after the event to inquire into the whole .question, and they presented a unanimous report. Bliss, in The Encyclopaedia of Social Reforms, states the finding of the Commission thusAccording to the testiinonj' the railroads lost in property destroyed, hire of United States deputy marshals, and other incidental expenses, at least 685,308 dols. The loss of earnings of these roads is estimated at 4,672,916 dols. Some 3,100 employees at Pullman lost in wages, as estimated, at least 350,000 dols. About 100,000 employees upon the 24 railroads centreing at Chicago, all of which weremore or less involved in the strike, lost in wages, as estimated, at least 1,389,143 dols. Many of these employees are still adrift and losing wages. Beyond these amounts very great losses, widely distributed, were incidentally suffered throughout the country. The suspension of transportation at Chicago paralyzed a vast distributive centre, and imposed many hardships and much loss upon the great number of people whose manufacturing and business operations, employment, travel, and necessaiy supplies depend upon and demand regular transportation service to, from, and through Chicago. During the strike, the fatalities, arrests, indictments, and dismissal of charges for strike Dissentients are always to be found. offences in Chicago and vicinity were as follows:Number shot and fatally wounded ... 12 Number arrested by the police ... ... 515 Number arrested under United States statutes, and against whom indictments were found ... ... ... 71 Number arrested against whom indictments were not found ... ... ... 119 The arrests made by the police were for murder, arson, burglary, assault, intimidation, riot, inciting to riot, and lesser crimes. BradstreH's estimates the losses to the country That is equal to £16,000,000. Of course this is a mere estimate, for it is utterly impossible to say how widespread the disaster will be when a dispute of this kind arises. A strike is very much like the act he was satisfied that the prinof throwing a stone in the water. It is true that the further it goes the less is the In America they force of the ring caused by the dropping of the stone into the water, but that ring is tremendously wide. And so in the case of During this a strike, none Can say who will suffer from it. The critics of this Bill do not sufficiently recognise that they have to choose between strikes and arbitration. If any one can tell me of any better remedy than this I shall accept it . It is very easy to criticise-to point out dangers and difficulties-bu t what have the wise men who oppose this Bill to suggest as a substitute for this proposal 1 I can find no originality in their propositions. survival of the strongest-pa n out as it may. strongest"" is not a sufficient answer to my query.

They like the present state of affairs because they are fond of fighting. Even the weakest side, that is being beaten, has a liking for the fighting element in the struggle. MrA . McLEAN head,' hit it . "" the idea. I recollect hearing of a man working in a colliery district in the old country, who one day saw a collier giving his wife her weekly thrashing with a poker. He interfered and separated the two, whereupon husband and wife both set upon him, the wife inquiring, "" Has not a man . the right to lick his own wife ?"" . She attacked him as bitterly as did her husband. The gentleman who wrote to the Argus seems to have written in much the same spirit. I remember the picture in Punch referred to by the honourable and learned member for Parkes,' in which one man is depicted as saying to another-""D o you call that arbitration 1 Why, they have given it against us !"" I have had a doubt as to whether, when times are bad, men will be willing to accept awards which are given against them, and I am, therefore, gratified that the leaders in the shearers' dispute had the wisdom to recommend the men to accept the award given against them, and that the men had the wisdom to take their advice. Nothing would be more injurious to this cause than for the men to flare up whenever an award went against them. I admit that the power which is being intrusted to the Court is a most dangerous one. We do not like to entrust our liberties to a board of lawyers or of business people, or to any one else.' But in this case we do so only faute de mieux -; there is nothing better which can be suggested. There is one true. Then we provision in the Bill which I consider an excellent one, that providing for conciliation before arbitration. The honorThat is a "" gag "" which has been assoable and learned member for Parkes is not correct in saying that in New Zealand they have given up conciliation, as the following letter from Mr Tregear, dated where there is the 17th June last, which has been furnished to interest me by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, will show :The principal things we are going to ask for this year are ""preference for unionists"" (but this will probably be made subject to awai-ds of Arbitration Court), and reversion to the work of Conciliation Boards. This latter is in consequence of an amendment (section 2.1 of Amending Act of 1901), which practically passed the boards by, and has thrown all the work on the higher court. TheA c t of 1901 provided that parties could go direct to the Arbitration Court"" Whenever you see a without appearing before the Conciliation Boards, with the result that the Court was flooded with disputes which could have been settled by the process of conciliation. It is, therefore, thought now that conciliation should be tried first, so as to relieve the Arbitration Court; and to provide for the more speedy settlement of disputes. To my mind it is a tremendous gain to have the processes of conciliation and arbitration conducted by the same tribunal. There will be far more chance of conciliation if the parties feel that the Court has in its hand the rod of arbitration. Under this system fewer cases will, go before the Arbitration Court,, and less time will be spent in the settlement of disputes. The Attorney-General was a little inaccurate in speaking of the principle of Conciliation and Arbitration Courts as distinctively Australian, because I remember",35,William Mcmillan Is That A Of What You Claim Andsoforth Therewasno

250,Mr Higgins,"That would seem to be that a witness before the Victorian Law Commission described very graphically the principle of a Conciliation A ct which has been in operation in Denmark since 1795. Honourable members will find the subject referred to in the evidence of Henry Olsen, which is printed on page 849 of the Victorian Parliamentary Papersf o r 1899-1900. This is what the witness saidBy law of 10th July, 1795, was enacted the Conciliation Commission. The principle is, that it is the bounden duty of everybody who desires to obtain justice by process against anybody, to first try if it is not possible to obtain a satisfactory arrangement of the case in dispute without the intervention of the law courts. About 40 per cent, of the cases are settled in that way. objections of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, because it is quite respectable as regards its age. and learned member appears never to have gone beyond the English political economists of a certain school; he appears to have read only the works of men like Ricardo, McCulloch, and Mill. I think, however, that some advance has been made in the science of political economy since they wrote. Sir Danish system apply to industrial disputes ? an a fortior i instance. We have no recognised principle to go upon in industrial matters, but we have recognised law in regard to ordinary litigation. I desire now to say a word or two as to the relation of this measure to the Factory Acts. There is a good deal of force in what the last speaker said. The Court will not consist of experts. The President is to' be a lawyer, and there are to be two other permanent members.. It may happen that one of these is a mine-owner, and the other a seaman. But suppose a dispute affecting the woollen trade comes before them. appoint experts to sit as assessors. dent and the two members 1 themselves. provision, and I was going to suggest that instead of having two permanent members at a fixed salary, it would be better to appoint assessors for particular, disputes, paying them by fees. The President of the Court must, I think, hold a permanent appointment, because if the dispute is very keen his decision must ultimately settle the question. AlthoughI have the utmost respect 'for my confreres infchelegal profession, I am sure that their minds, if they are in full work, are so occupied with their daily business, that they pay less attention to economic and industrial subjects than do the members of any other class in the community, and their sympathies naturally tend towards what I may call the bourgeois idea. I think the reason why lawyers are chosen in England is that the best arbitrations have been conducted by men who are. prominent in public life-me n like the Earl of Rosebery, Sir John Gorst, Sir Henry James, and others. Besides, there is something in a legal training which tends to make a man impartial; to make him apt fco look at questions as he would look at mathematical problems, and to desire to find the light answer without regard to consequences. A t the same time, I recognise that we are placing a tremendous power in the hands of the President of this Court, and if we can by any means appoint persons who will take some of the strain off fche Judge appointed as President, it will be for the benefit of the Court to do so. special knowledge is required for the purposes of any particular industrial dispute the Court shall be constituted of other members in addition to or substitution for the ordinary members, and under clause 57 the court may appoint two assessors for the purpose of advising it in relation to any industrial dispute involving technical questions. ' operation of our Factory Boaids with a good deal of interest, and it has always appeared to me to be of great advantage to bring the employers and employees face to face. In an Arbitration Court, as distinguished from a Factory Board, we do not necessarily have as Judges men who know the conditions of sit with the Presithe trade in regard to which a dispute has occurred. A great deal of time would be saved if the witnesses felt that those on the Bench knew all about the industry.

There is a practical difficulty to which I wish to direct attenr tion. The Bill deals with industrial disputes only, and, according to the definition of ""industrial disputes,"" we see that there must be employers on one side, and employees on the other. means "" A dispute in relation to industrial matters, arising between an employer, or an organization of employers, on the one part, and an organization of employees on the other part."" There must be an employer and employees. It has been suggested that, in some cases, there may be no relation of It will save a great deal of employment. Supposing that upon a station shearing is coming on, and a number of men camp outside the station and offer to go to I think so. I have work upon certain terms. The owner of the station could not take advantage of the operation of the Bill, because he would. not be an employer, and the men would not be employees, for the purposes of the Bill. I am willing to submit to the superior judgment of those concerned in the pastoral industry, but I think that it will be only fair, if there is a union of shearers and a union of employers, to have some agreement under which the union, in consideration of certain terms, shall engage to supply a certain number of shearers. able to do so. funds of the union would be liable to be levied on in the event of any breach 'of agreement, and that faGt would afford a very strong incentive to the men to go to work. culties in the way. lieve that honourable members in favour of the B ill are determined to be just to both sides, and that where there is a real difficulty they will try to meet it .

If he will look at clause 39 he will see that one of the ways in which the Court can have cognisance of a dispute is when it is certified to the Court by the Registrar as proper to be dealt with by it in the public interest. It occurred to me that that provision might be so enlarged as to apply to cases such as those referred to by the honourable member. that you cannot say that there is a dispute between TomJ ones on one side of the fence I have considered that. and John Smith on the other.",38,William Mcmillan Does The

There is a great deal of danger in the provision for a common rule.

I can recollect going into Court on one occasion with the intention of arguing a certain point. When I reached the CourtI was told that the point to which I had intended to address myself had just been decided in a different case. I was not heard upon the matter, and yet I knew that it would be useless for me to address the Court which, in my case, would follow its previous decision, which was against me. Therefore, the decision given in a case between A and B can also effect C. Clause 63, paragraph (d), confers the power to make a common rule, but clause 75 provides thatEvery organization shall be entitled to be represented before the Court in the hearing and determination of any dispute in which it is interested. AmI to understand that that provision would enable a union to apply to the Court for leave to be represented in a dispute going on between other persons ? provision in the right direction, and I suggest that, as a preliminary to the making of a common rule, the Arbitration Courtserved upon such persons or organizations as the common rule would affect. If the Court is what it should be, it will see that allparties interested have fair notice of the intention to apply a common rule. This would prevent discontent. land has been to give notice to those in the district to whom the common rule is to be applied. should have the fullest discretion in the matter. learned member think that our power as a Federal Parliament extends to the control of persons who are not parties to a dispute ? to anybhing of the kind.

295,Mr Deakin,"But the Court could keepsafeguards the principle of the Bill could be applied to State public servants. It is a mistake to regard railway servants in Victoria and New South Wales as servants of the State, because under the very Acts which create them the} are the servants of the 7 Commissioners. The object was to make them the servants of the Commissioners in every respect. Parliament, of course, has the power to appropriate such moneys as it thinks fit, but it leaves the Commissioners f u l l power to act. We are going back to the old days of political influence in Victoria and other States, when we find the Premier of a State bargaining with railway men, and bringing his pressure to bear upon them, to induce them to accept certain terms. Inasmuch as railway strikes produce such devastation, and involve interfererence with the play of industry and commerce throughout the country, I do not see why we should not include railway servants within the scope of the Bill. Of course it may be said that a railway dispute would not extend beyond any one State, but that is an erroneous idea. Suppose an agitation were raised for a fortnightly payday. Wouldi t not be possible for it to extend to Victoria and New'South Wales, and perhaps to Queensland ? the public servants of the Commonwealth t to apply it to them before taking action with regard to railway servants ? two classes of servants are different. control of Parliament. sense. It is true that Parliament can alter the conditions at any time, but the railway servants in Victoria and New South Wales are under the immediate control of the Commissioners. In New South Wales the Government had the courage to include railway servants, as well as Harbor Trust employees, withiu the scope of the State Acts, and I cannot see why, if we are to interfere between employers and employees, we should not include railway and other public servants within the scope of this measure. I admit that the proposal must be thought out, but at the same time it would be better for the Government to be bold in this matter and to let I think that. with due the country know that what is sauce for the goose shall also be sauce for the gander. Concerning the employment of lawyers in the Court, the proposal contained in the Bill is that the parties to an industrial dispute may obtain the services of counsel, but no costs shall be allowed them. I think that of all possible arrangements that is about the worse which could be made. Paragraph (g) of clause 63 says thatThe court shall, as regards every industrial dispute of which it has cognizance, have power . . . to order any party to the dispute to pay to any other party such costs and expenses^ including expenses of witnesses, as are specified in tlie order, but 60 that ho costs shall be allowed for the services of any counsel, solicitor, or agent. -There are two views that can be taken of the employment of skilled assistance in connection with these matters. One is that the ability to retain the services of a lawyer may place a man who is weak in putting his case before the Court upon a level with his opponent who is well qualified in that respect. retaining counsel 1 nately, however, all persons have not the necessary funds to secure the skilled assistance of a lawyer, so that, although the Bill apply to there would be an advantage conferred upon the one side there would be a disadvantage upon the other. The proposal in the B ill simply means that the wealthy party to a dispute may employ a lawyer, but if the other party does so, and wins his case, he cannot obtain any costs. Ifc therefore favours the man who has money as against the man who has not. able and learned member is instancing the case of a man who employs a lawyer for his own purposes, and who, therefore, should pay his own costs. with the help of a lawyer, he will lose a l l ' that he has to pay to the lawyer. That is not a good arrangement. Upon tlie whole I think it would be better to settle these disputes without the aid of lawyers. As honourable members are aware, the parties to a dispute are not required to deal with questions of law. The Court is to disregard all rules of evidence, and to simply deal with matters of practical arrangement in the working of industries. Lawyers know no more about these than do other people.",40,Mcmillan But How Could Should Have The Power To Direct Notices To Be

Generally speaking, those unions have skilled secretaries, who will be able to present their case very fully. Western Australia they harangue the Bench politically.

If they find that men are unduly occupying time by speaking to their organizations, they will quickly prevent them from continuing to do so.. Of course, the pivot of the whole scheme is the President of the Court. If we have a sufficiently strong Presidenta man who understands how to handle men-the time of the Court will not be occupied at undue length. might agree to retain lawyers. that. In my judgment no party to an industrial dispute should be represented by counsel unless both sides agree to it . I thank honourable members for having listened to me so attentively. This is a subject well worthy of the serious consideration of the House. We have before us a genuine attempt to fulfil the responsibilities committed to this Parliament by the people and by the Imperial Government in our Constitution. I never expected that in the first Commonwealth Parliament an attempt would be made to exercise this power. I rejoice to find that it is to be exercised. I am very glad, too, that the Bill is to receive the support of honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber. The measure is not one which is of a party character. It rises above that. It is one upon which men holding such extremely divergent views as the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney can come together. Anybody who looks at the state of affairs which prevails in Europe, America, Australia, and in all civilized parts of the world, must see that it is our duty to find some modus vivendi in the settlement of the grave industrial problems which we have to face. The honourable member for Melbourne has been driven back from his opposition to conciliation and arbitration by the stern logic of facts, and the House listened to his statements because it was aware that he knew the facts. Honourable members always listen to men who know the facts. Indped,"" it must be said in justice to Australian Parliaments, that they always lend an attentive ear to men who speak from personal knowledge. I cannot speak upon this Bill from my own knowledge as I should like to, but If we have a strong I ' recognise that some most valuable information has been imparted during the course of the debate. The speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for Parkes was a valuable contribution. I am aware that he was a director of tbe firm of Howard Smith and Co., and that he spoke from very large experience, but any one who watched the line of his arguments must have seen that they were based upon the theories of the sixties and seventies, and not upon the experience which we have had of industrial struggles recently, The time of constipation in political economy was in the sixties. A great I had not thought of change has taken place since then. I regret to find that my honourable and learned friend, who put his case with the utmost ability, has not gone beyond the political economy of the sixties. In the course of a few years, experience will show whether our civilization can hold together in the face of continual strikes. I should like to hear any other means suggested by which we could avert the suffering, devastation, loss, and ruin which follow such industrial struggles. with very great diffidence to address myself to this Bill. It is one of such overwhelming importance, that I extremely regret my inexperience in parliamentary speaking, and I trust that the House will grant me its indulgence in the somewhat disjointed remarks which I may offer. I recognise that a modern Parliament must keep pace with the conditions of modern life. Therefore legislation upon a question of this kind is to my mind imperative. The great doubt which presents itself to me is as to whether it is wise to introduce this measure at the present time. I confess that I have learned something from the speech of the honourable and learned member .for Northern Melbourne.

If either party to a dispute were dissatified with the award given That was my reading by the New South Wales Court, and the and I regarded it matter at issue was of sufficient importance to warrant the prolongation of the trouble, they would have no difficulty in causing it to spread to another State, so that they might take their case to the Federal Court. Let us take for example the mining industry. But the Constitution does If the proprietors of collieries in the Hunter River district had a dispute with their miners in reference to a question of importance, and the matter went before the State Court, the defeated party, by means of its He organization, would be able to cause the disturbance to spread beyond that State, so that it would then become a Federal question. That stage having been reached, there would practically be an appeal from Being the New South Wales Court to the'Federal Court.

We have, for example, the maritime trade of Australia. The sailors and others engaged on ships trading along the Australian coast could not be dealt with by any State Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, because the industry is not a State, barrassment. I should not as an honest but an Australian one. I should have been very glad if the Government had introduced a Bill confined to disputes affecting induslay them open to the unrestricted competitries such as the maritime trade, which is a national rather than a State undertaking. industry. shearing industry would be one of the worse features of the Bill. I am satisfied, that the anything like the details covered by this. industry is far better dealt with by the States Courts than it could be by a Federal Court, because the conditions prevailing in the various States are widely different. those differing conditions into account. wide knowledge to enable it to do so. That is one grave feature of the Bill which causes me some disturbance of mind. I do not say that arbitration is not a good thing; but the question is whether we should, at this early stage in our Federal career, deal with this matter when we have not received the slightest hint of any desire on the part of the States that we should do so. gave us the power under the Constitution to deal with this question. even the lay members of this House, when they read the Constitution, did not interpret it in the way that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has done. Before passing on to other questions, I should like to say a few words in connection with the vexed question of foreign shipping on our coasts. If we interfere-and I suppose we shall do so-and regulate the wages and the conditions of employment of those engaged on vessels trading on the Australian coast, it will be absolutely unjust to allow any foreign vessels to compete with those whom we control. It would be wrong to give foreign and British vessels trading .on our coast a free hand, whilst we handicap Australian ships. So far as my judgment permits me to form an opinion on the subject, I am in. sympathy with the Government in refusing to introduce into this B i ll a provision which would have the effect of bringing; foreign shipping companies trading on this coast within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Such a course would lead to friction and serious emman help to impose conditions upon Australian owned ships, and at the same timetion of foreign vessels. But I think it would be far better to introduce a separate Bill-cal l it a Navigation Bill or what you will-providin g simply that foreign shippingcompanies shall not engage in our coastal trade. Bill. into details. If a Bill of the description I . have indicated were passed, it would avoid the complications and friction that mightotherwise ensue. Other civilized countries have adopted the system I have mentioned, and why should we not follow their example 1 I draw a very broad distinction between passenger traffic and goods traffic.. The honourable member for Melbourne lastnight gave us some very interesting information in relation to the subject. It appears from what he said that the oversea, vessels derive a revenue of something like£120,000 a year from the Australian coastal trade, and I believe that something like £100,000 out of the total of £120,000 isobtained by the carriage of passengers. If I also followed the honourable member correctly, almost three-fourths of that return represents fares paid by passengers travelling between the eastern States and Western Australia. three-fourths. obtainable, it seems to me that, strictly speaking, the British and foreign oversea ships do not compete with Australian vessels in the Australian coastal trade. As a. matter of fact, their fares are nearly double those demanded by the owners of Australian vessels. much higher, but are not double. much higher, and I am infoi-med that the",43,Mcmillan But How Could Should Have The Power To Direct Notices To Be

I believe that we shall find that honourable members from Western Australia with the people of that State, will be very antagonistic to any attempt to prevent them from travelling by those vessels. 1 believe that if we debar the oversea vessels from engaging in the Australian coastal trade, we shall not have a sufficient number of vessels to meet the passenger traffic. One clause iu the Bill to which I should like to draw special attention is that which provides for the appointment of one Judge. If , as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne suggests, this Court will be able to deal with all Federal matters if it will be able to take action to prevent strikes, and to intervene and say, "" This dispute is not going to stop in New South Wales or in Victoria. Ifc is likely to spread beyond the limits of the State, and we must take it up and prevent it from extending in that way "" I am perfectly certain that it will be impossible for one Judge to do the work involved in covering so wide a jurisdiction. these things should be done in this Bill. limits to the power of the Court are not so narrow as some people would have us believe. learned member says the Constitution gives us power to deal wibh these matters. pass a Bill of that kind j but it is not proposed in this Bill to go to the utmost extent of our constitutional powers. that, although I shall not enter into a controversy on the subject with two eminent lawyers. As I have already pointed out, an important dispute involving far reaching issues, might, under the terms of this Bill, spread beyond the limits of one State, and would thus become a Federal question. If we had a mining dispute at BrokenH ill , and another in some other part of New South Wales as well as in Victoria, would not that be a dispute extending beyond the limits of one State? Take a shearing dispute, for example. If there was a shearing dispute in Queensland, my friend, the honourable member for Darling, would only have .to l if t his little finger and he could make it extend beyond the limits of one State, and come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. In that way the Federal Court will practically become the Court of Appeal from the States Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, and it is absurd to imagine that one Judge will be able to cope with' the work which will have to be done. Buti f we have one Federal Judge in Victoria, another in New South Wales, and a third in Queensland, is it to be expected that their decisions will be in perfect accord ? W ill not the system lead to diverse-and , perhaps, conflictingjudgments? The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to tbe case of .Switzerland, where, he said, the different cantons had different arbitration laws, and the varying decisions upon them were found so inconvenient that latterly the Swiss people have resolved to make the subject a Federal matter. But how absurd it is to compare Switzerland, which is not so big as Victoria mania. country not so big as Tasmania with the And it is not. great continent of Australia ! I hope that I merely say that the before the debate is over some one like the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, will throw a considerable amount of light upon this subject. I am in grave doubt as to whether it is wise or prudent for us to pass a measure of this kind, because I feel that it will bring about great dissatisfaction, and cause friction with the States. The Bill, according to the phraseology of its title, is a measure for the "" prevention and settlement of industrial disputes."" No better or nobler purpose than that could be set before any Parliament. If we can prevent strikes, and put an end to industrial warfare, the end will be worthy of our highest efforts. I remember reading the statement of a certain writer on economics that to establish a minimum amount of well-being should be the first and chief aim ofall statesmanship, and, believing that to be so, I cannot but approach the consideration of the Bill with feelings of sympathy. The end which the measure has in view is to be accomplished",44,Mcmillan But How Could Should Have The Power To Direct Notices To Be

343,Did Not Say That All Mr Sawers,"Fancy comparing afirst of all by the establishment of a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In regard to that Court, let me say, in passing, that I am not at all satisfied with the principle which has been adopted in New Zealand and in New South Wales, and which it is proposed to follow here, of appointing a Judge and two associate members, one representing the employers and the other the employees. The persons chosen to represent the respective parties can be nothing else than partizans. They may be thoroughly honest and honourable men, but as they are elected to protect the interests of, and to do their utmost for those who elect them, they must be partizans. Why should such men sit upon the Bench? Sir MALCOLM appointed because of their practical experience. experience in all tlie trades and industries in regard to which disputes may arise. I do not wish to criticise the personnel of the New South Wales Court, but does any one imagine that the gentleman who is the representative of the employees there is an expert in every industiy, or that the representative of the employers understands the intricacies of every trade? Mr G.B.EDWARDS -Practica l experience should be obtained from the evidence of experts in the witness box. more than one Judge, let us appoint as many as are needed ; but do not let us play with this great question. Parliament should not cavil at the expense of as many Judges as are necessary to give ample satisfaction ; but it is against all judicial principle that partisans should be chosen as Judges. Sir .MALCOLM honourable member think that none but the Judges can give fair decisions'? have partisans on the Bench, and the lay members provided for in the Bill must of necessity be partisans. MrA . McLEAN -The same sort of men are chosen on an Arbitration Board. chosen for the decision of the particular case, and appointed for their special knowledge of the subject. Their position is very different from that of the members of this Court. The honourable member for Melbourne not only approves of the arrangement in the Bill, but has indicated his intention to move an amendment reducing the term of office from seven to three years. Mr G.. B. EDWARDS -That makes the danger greater. ter over in my mind when the honourable member for Melbourne was speaking, and to my thinking it would be better, instead of reducing the term of office, to increase it to, say, twelve years, so that the appointees ""will have less temptation to play to tlie gallery, or to try to win the suffrages of those whom they, represent. If their term of office is limited to three years, they must be keener partisans than if they had a term of seven years, because they will always be considering their hood would there be of a man who had the courage to decide a case on its merits, against the interests of those whom he represented, being re-elected ? I agree, of course, that all the members of the Court should be removable if good cause is shown. If the members of the Court are given a long term of office, they will no doubt rise above partisanship, and will cultivate a judicial turn of mind ; but to shorten their term of office will make them all the keener partisans. I come now to the recognition of trades unions and employers' associations for bringing about the system of collective bargaining. Whether preferential treatment is or is not given to members of trades unions, the recognition of trades unions as industrial unions must tremendously swell their ranks. I , personally, have no objection to the principle, though I feel that great care must be taken in preventing the unions from becoming political organs. When the Australian Workers' Union came before the it had a rule under which every member was bound to vote for whatever parliamentary candidate was recommended by the association, and that outrage upon the principles of personal and ' political conduct was the Waterloo of the Union, because the Court refused to entertain its case until the rule had been altered. Becognition of trade unions is, however, tlie only way of forming industrial unions. Three years ago, when a member of the New South Wales Assembly, I opposed very strongly the first Arbitration Bil l introduced by the Attorney-General of that State, and I do not regret having done so, because the measure was very crude and",45,Mcmillan But How Could Should Have The Power To Direct Notices To Be

348,Mr Sawebs,"I was turning the matimperfect, and another Bill was subsequently introduced, the provisions of which had benefited by the criticisms passed upon its predecessor, and that Bill is now law. I remember saying then that, if I thought that the only, or the best, or even a good way of forming industrial unions would be to recognise the trade unions, I would throw all prejudice aside, and give the system my support. .1 have come to the conclusion, that that is the Mr Edward Ery, a large employer in Engonly course, but not without great reluctance and after much consideration, and I defy any opponent of arbitration to point out a better way, or indeed any other way. I have to make my choice between the continuance of the old condition of affairs under which we had hateful strikes, disastrous alike to the victors and vanquished, and the adoption of' the method of conciliation and arbitration, and, being hopeful of peace, how can I do otherwise than act as I am now indicating. New South WalesA ct contains no provision for conciliation, and that seems to me to be a vital flaw. Conciliation has been often tried there.. Some years ago a Conciliation Act was passed at the instance of the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, and it was only yesterday that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney threw ridicule upon it, and told honourable members that the vote for the salary of the Chairman of the Conciliation Board had been struck off the Estimates, because there was no work for him to do. ThatA ct was a failure, because behind the conciliation there was no reserve power of arbitration. exists, conciliatory methods are likely to be successful in the great majority of cases. Zealand experience. pute, who come before a Board of Conciliation, know that there is a reserve power behind to ""force them to arbitration they will probably arrive at a settlement. A t all events, I believe that the absence of some such provision is one of the principal flaws in the New South Wales Act. In the Bill now before us we have provision for enforced investigation, and I am completely in accord with the proposal. It is essential to the public peace and welfare that employers and employees should come to an amicable settlementof their differences, and that they should not be permitted to disturb the public peace. My view is that conciliation without a reserve power of enforced investigation, and arbitration without previous means for conciliation, are alike imperfect. I am prepared toadmit that conciliation has been very succesful in other countries, where industrial conditions are very different from our own. I could produce evidence to show that great success has attended the operations of the conciliation tribunal in Great Britain. land, states that in the cotton trades, and in the.manufactured iron and steel tradesof the North, and in the miscellaneoustrades in London, the machinery devised for the settlement of trade disputes by conciliation has proved very successful. I suppose thathonorable members are familiar with Lecky's work, Democracy and Liberty* in which ' he shows that 3,000 disputes in the Northumberland coal trade have been settled by joint conciliation committees. HeThe also saysSuch boards in Prance have been very successful. In Belgium, Austria, and Germany there* are elaborate provisions for settling labour disputes The report of the Royal Commission in New South Wales contains the following passage :The latest localized industry we have in thiscolony is that of coal-mining in tlie Hunterdistrict, and there the miners and the colliery proprietors have substantially worked out for themselves u system of agreement and arbitration. In England an Act was passed in 1896called the Conciliation Trades Disputes. Where that reserve power Act, in which was embodied the principle, not of coercion or enforcement, but of mutual application or optional conciliation. According to the most recent report of theNot judging by New Board of Trade there were arranged reductions in wages in 1901 amounting to£1,600,000. In 1902 the decreases consented to represented a total of £2,300,000. These l eductions were effected by means of conciliation boards without any arbitrary provision for the enforcement of their awards.. The report saysThe proportion of changes of wages in one line or two which were preceded by disputes causing a stoppage of work was even lower than for 1901, hitherto the lowest on record. Therefore those honourable members whoargue that conciliation can be brought aboutwithout any provision for the enforcement, of the agreement arrived at are quite rightso far as other countries are concerned-",46,Mceacharn Doe S The New South Wales Court I T Was Shown That

350,Mr Sawers,"If the, parties to a disBut failing efforts, either by mutual agreement or by means of conciliation, there must be enforced investigation, which, I think, is miscalled ""arbitration."" Employers no longer have the right to say, as they have said in the past;"" Such and such are our terms; take them or leave them."" The law of supply and demand, as -applied to human beings, has been referred to by the honourable and learned member for Parkes; and it repelled me 'to hear him say that if a citizen desired -a horse, he bought it on the very cheapest terms, and that the same principle .applied to workers in the matter of wages. He said that all businessmen must get their work done at the lowest possible price. The law of supply and demand so applied seems to me to be an outrage upon civilized manhood. With a redundant population what -does the application of such a law involve ? It surely means that where there are many men clamouring for one man's work, the employer will be able to get his work done for the very lowest wage which human beings will accept. -and demand, if carried to its legitimate -conclusion, would mean hopeless misery and despair for the greater number of the people; and if we are not able to achieve -all we desire, it is surely worthy of the Parliament of Australia to at least make some effort to modify the application to human beings of a hideous and barbarous law. blazoned on the scroll of every Employers Association. It is a high sounding phrase, -and has imposed upon many. I quite admit that if weaccept the definition adopted by the Pastoralists' Unions, namely, that freedom -of contract means the right of employers to engage any man they choose, upon satisfactory terms to be agreed upon, with-out asking him whether he is a unionist or a non-unionist, the position would be a -simple ono. But freedom of contract means much more. It means the right to employ men at any wage which they will accept. I consider that freedom to employ men at -any wages which they may be content to accept means liberty to offer them any wage which they are prepared to take in prefer-ence to starvation and death. That is not a principle which should obtain parliamentary sanction in any civilized, countiy. I abhor the doctrine with all my heart and soul. ""The honourable and learned member for .Parkes thinks that because I am an employer I approve of it. He is, however, absolutely wrong. Such a doctrine is opposed to all the higher promptings of civilization, and certainly to .the Christian law. Well might Professor Huxley exclaimA population whose labour is insufficiently remunerated must become morally unhealthy and socially unstable; aud, though it may succeed for a while in industrial competition by reason of the cheapness of its produce, it must. in the end fall through hideous miserj' and degradation to utter ruin. Is this law inexorable ? I do not know. A t all events, I know that if this were a free-trade countiy, if Parliament upheld the principle of unrestricted competition, such a principle could be carried out. I quite recognise the consistency-althoug h I dissent from his conclusions-of the honourable and learned member for Parkes. Indeed, I honour his consistency. To my mind, he is the most consistent free-trader I have ever met in this country. Of course I am quite consistent in arguing that we should make some legislative provision for improving the condition of the workers, The law of supply seeing that I do not approve of open ports and unrestricted competition. TheB ill aims at fixing a minimum wage. In other words, its object is to control wages. It cannot be otherwise. The"" minimum wage"" is, I think, an unfortunate term to employ, though I admit that this Bill does not even provide for such a wage, because it contains modifying clauses in reference to that mat"" Freedom of contract"" has been emter. Mr Sydney Webb-a t whose feet, I dare say, some honourable members have sat -admit s that compulsory arbitration means the fixing of wages by law. I think that another term might have been substituted for that of "" minimum wage,"" because such an expression invites hostile criticism and misunderstanding. To fix a minimum wage is, I admit, beyond the power of any Parliament. Wages do not depend upon what a philanthropist is prepared to pay, or upon what the workers may think they ought to obtain. It depends upon the power of any industry to provide that wage, and to leave a margin of profit to the employer. If an industry cannot yield a margin of profit, no minimum wage established by any Parliament can ever be effective. So far as this question of wages is concerned, I hold that we cannot hope to arbitrarily fix a minimum wage. We must rely upon the wisdom of the Court and upon the moderation of the people of this country. In this connection, I would point out that the English Royal Commission, which was appointed in 1894, and which, was composed of some of the ablest men in Great Britain -me n representing all shades of political opinion-faile d to recommend any proposal for the establishment of a minimum wage. The recognition of collective bargaining was about the extent of their recommendations. Their report saysWe do not think it has been seriously maintained on either side that the remuneration of work or rate of profit, or maximum or minimum wage rates in the general field of labour, should be fixed by law. Perhaps honourable members will pardon me if I quote another extract from that report, which is about the only authoritative document that has been cited in reference to this aspect of the subject. It readsAgain, many of the witnesses on the side of the workmen, who most strongly advocated legal limitation of hours of labour, were asked whether thej' would also approve of State intervention between employers and employed in the matter of wages, and with very few exceptions they returned a negative answer to the question. I wish now to refer to clause 65 of the BillI t provides not only for a minimum wagei but for giving a preference to unionists as against non-unionists. I certainly stop short at a proposal of that kind. I am strongly in favour of unionism. I recognise that it has done much for the amelioration of the condition of the workmen of the world. But I shall be no party to any attempt to coerce free men to join any union. All those who are engaged in industry should become unionists, and I have little doubt that, without giving unionists a preference, the operation of this BiU will prove a mighty lever in inducing them to join trades organizations. If I were a workman I should be a unionist. A t the same time, it is an outrage upon the principles of freedom to coerce free men by declaring-""You must either be a unionist or you will receive no work."" Surelyi t is beyond the province of any Parliament to go so far as that. Such a step would constitute an outrage upon personal freedom. r plover prevents his men from organizing ? Sir. SAWERS -No employer could do that. attempt made by employers to prevent their men from organizing. Company will not allow their employees to become unionists. position that there are certain principles of human freedom which we must recognise. ""A man's a man for a' that,"" and he is entitled to say that he will or will not_ be a unionist Reference has been made to that portion of the Bill which comes under the heading "" Enforcement of Industrial Awards."" Again, I say that that term' as applied, is most misleading. The actual enforcement of any award is impossible. I know that the answer of some honourable members will be that we must trust to the Court and to the good sense of employees and employers. I am quite prepared to do that. I merely point out that in this Bill the term is altogether misapplied. We cannot force an employer to pay wages which will result in his industry proving unprofitable, nor can we compel free men to work against their will. It is generally admitted that no Court can compel employers to carry on their operations against their will, or force unwilling men to work for wages which thej' decline to accept. As a matter of fact there is no serious attempt at enforcement in this Bill. The measure merely provides that ifan. award is given, and the other side disobeys that award, the organization in question can be. fined the maximum penalty of £1,000. If no funds are available in the case of the employees they may-be fined up to £10 per man. But can we exact a fine more than once? Lotus suppose that an organization of employers or employees refuses to obey an award of the Court, and that the maximum fine is inflicted. If the organization which has transgressed still refuses to obey the law will it be fined again 1 this provision in the Bill is a very inequit; able one, because, whilst it will be possible to get at the employers who are possessed of property, and to. fine them to the verge of ruin, it will not be so in the case of the employees. Their funds may be depleted if they refuse to obey an award, but what then ? If the Court attempted to levy upon large bodies of workmen, it would find that it was absolutely impossible to do so. Clause 73 contains a further provision having reference to disobedience of an award. Under that clause, employers or workmen",47,Mceacharn Doe S The New South Wales Court I T Was Shown That

Any attempt to enforce heavy fines for the refusal to accept awards would, I believe, lead to riot and bloodshed, and generally to a condition of affairs far worse than the desperate strikes of the past. I agree, of course, that such a thing is not likely to happen, and that we shall have to rely upon the good sense of both parties, and the prudent judgments of the Court. A t the same time, when provisions such as these are made in the Billi t is our duty to see that some protection is given. The honourable member for Darling agrees with the views I have expressed. I am glad to admit that he has probably a greater knowledge of trades union matters in this and other countries than has any other man in Australia. AVhat does he say in regard to this question, which has received his special attention? He saysThere is almost unanimity amongst trade union leaders all over the world in regard to the impossibility of enforcing awards. He says furtherI given by the Court, certain penalties may been' forced. It would be unwise to go further. i 8G statement 1 of the New South Wales Parliament, he discussed the first Conciliation and Arbitration Bill introduced by Mr Wise in that disturbance occurring in the district of Legislature. Tlie word "" enforcement "" is a very unfortunate one, and invites hostile criticism of the Bill. I contend that it is misapplied in this instance, because no enforcement is even seriously attempted. Our hope must be placed in the wisdom of the Court, the loyalty of the people, and the court dare to levy upon such a body of force of public opinion. The honourable workmen ? Certainly not! All the milimember for Parramatta, as a member of the tary forces of the Commonwealth could not State Parliament, also made a very able and instructive speech on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill first introduced by Mr AVise, and I had not long ago the pleasure of reading the Hansard report of it. In referring to the French Arbitration tunity of determining the possibilities. If Courts he said thatThej' do not go to the length of enforcing awards by legal process, but there is a compulsory investigation. The decision can be advertised and placarded in all public places. It is said that this method of enforcing awards in France is almost as effective as the method of legal process. I am prepared to support the imposition of monetary penalties, but I hope that the House will never pass the provisions for imprisonment. During the debate a good deal has been said in regard to the opinions held by trades unionists in the United States of America. It is singular that the trades unionists in different countries differ very seriously in reference to this question. I could understand the existence of a great difference of opinion between the leaders of trades unions in Australia and in England, but one would imagine that the conditions in the United States of America are somewhat similar to our own. I find, however, that Mr Lennon, who, two or three years ago, was treasurer of what is known as the American Federation of Laboura huge confederation of labour, containing perhaps 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 members-ha s written as follows :We believe in arbitration, if ifc be voluntary, but we have more faith in conciliation. . . . The Federation is unqualifiedly committed against compulsory or legal arbitration.

363,Mr Watkins,"The employers have reWe call it arbitrationfollowed by penalties which would probably make it a legal offence for a man to quit work or to continue it if a Board of Arbitration should have decided against him. We also consider such a method inconsistent with the principles of our American Government aud with the natural rights of man. The English Royal Commission did not recommend enforcement of any kind, and I am satisfied that it would never have dreamt of recommending the enforcement of awards. It simply recommended that collective agreements, voluntarily arrived at, should be recognised, and be enforceable at law. I imagine that they are already enforceable. If A and R come to a legal agreement, that agreement should be enforceable, and if two bodies of men arrive at an agreement that determination should also be enforceable at law. I think that the Royal Commission of Great Britain came to a somewhat impotent conclusion on this mighty question, and that its report fell far short of what I consider should be recommendations upon such a subject. Another important feature of this Bill is the liability of the funds of either employers or employees' unions for failure to carry out agreements. I am glad to read that the leaders in trades unionism in this country are agreeable that the funds of the unions shall be liable for any breach of good faith in carrying out agreements. I maintain that there should be mutual responsibility ; but it is strange that the leaders of trades unions in Great Britain have most bitterly opposed the proposition that trades union funds should be held responsible for good faith in the carrying out of these agreements. I have here an extract from a minority report of the British Commission, signed by trades union leaders such as W . Abraham, Michael Austin, Jas. Maudesley, and Tom Mann. In referring to the question of the liability of trades union funds, they saidAny attemptfcorevoke this hardly-won charter of trade union freedom, or in any way tamper with tlie purely voluntary character of their associations, would, in our opinion, provoke the most bifctered resistance from the whole body of trades unionists. I have no desire to refer at length to the Taj} Vale decision. We all know that it paralyzed unionists of Great Britain. they were previously under the delusion that their funds were sacred and secure from any interference on the part of a Mr Sawers. court, but the decision dispelled that idea from their minds. In my opinion they were absolutely wrong. As I have already said, agreements made in good faith should always be backed up by substantial guarantees. The honourable member for Darling will also acknowledge that the New South Wales Court has held the trades unionists of that State liable for certain acts a decision which, no doubt, will be dissented from. Some time ago a case relating to the shearing trouble arose in New South Wales. Mr Keogh, a squatter, residing near Coonamble, on his own responsibility, and, so far as I know, without any support from the Pastoralists' Union, brought an action against the Australian Workers' Union for an injunction to prevent it from interfering with non-union workmen while they were proceeding to their work on his estate. He was seeking to shear with non-union labour, and he complained that the union had interfered with his men. The Court held that the union was responsible for the formation of a camp, which interfered with his non-union workers, and it imposed a very considerable fine. case was never tried. the Court. There was another case which was never tried. went to trial, but he obtained costs. draw any fine distinctions, and I am ready to say that instead of a fine being inflicted Mr Keogh obtained costs. The honourable member knows that another case occurred which was settled out of court. Mr Horsfall, of Widgewa, made a similar complaint, and he stated publicly that he received a substantial sum in settlement of his claim against the union. I have no desire to labour the matter. I am sure the honourable member for Darling knows that 1 am not antagonistic to shearers' unions or any other unions. I am merely stating facts in order to support the opinion which I have expressed, that the funds of the organizations, whether of employees or of employers, must be held reand astonished the trades sponsible for breaches of good faith in carryIt appears that ing out agreements.

367,Mr Sawers,"I have no desire tomost difficult matters to settle. The shearing industry differs totally from any other calling. It is not one in which men are employed all the year reund, and there can be no lock-out or anything of that kind in connection with it . The men work in one particular shed for only a few weeks, and then move on to another. They go from shed to shed in the course of their occupation. There is in Australia a powerful organization known as the Pastoralists' Union, and there is also a powerful organization, headed by the honourable member for Darling, which is known as the Austi'iilian Workers' Union. I trust that those unions will come to an amicable settlement of their differences in regard to wages and other matters affecting the pastoral industry. But if they were unable to do so, and a case were brought before the court in January, February, or March, when shearing was not in progress, what would be the position ? If an award were given against the pastoralists, they would be bound to abide by it. The men would have the force of public opinion behind them, and if the awaid were satisfactory to them they would stand out and "" win in a canter."" But if the award were unsatisfactory to the men, they would find it unnecessary to strike or refuse to work. All that they would have to do would be to fail to apply for work when the shearing season came round, and therefore they would not render themselves liable for refusing to abide by the decision of the Court. That is one of the greatest difficulties be unwise to attempt to bring them under associated with an industry of this kind. If the award were unsatisfactory to the woi;kers they would not refuse to obey it . They would simply fail to apply for work at the sheds, and it would be impossible to hold their organization responsible. We might believe that the union had given a hint to the men to refrain from applying for work, but unless it could be proved that it had coerced them, it could not be held responsible for their action. That is one of the most serious difficulties which we have to face, and I . hardly see how to deal with it in the Bill. But, as I have said before, I have little doubt that some amicable arrangement will be come to. I am prepared to trust the workers, and, indeed, the whole justification for the Bill is the trust of each side in the other. We are constantly asked by members of the labour party if we can cite any case in which there has been disobedience of orders of the Court. 8 Gz My reply is that we have had no proper experience of legislation of this character. I , however, am prepared to trust the workers, and I hope that the workers will trust the employers, and that both sides will honestly abide by the awards of the Court. If experience proves that they will not, we shall have to repeal the Act. I shall support the amendment of ""the honourable member for Kooyong to confine the operation of the Bill to a few years, because it will be easy enough to re-enact it by the introduction of a Bill of one clause, if the public demand its' renewal at the end of that period. But while I ohject to many of the provisions of the Bill, I am in accord with its general principles. Some of its provisions are excellent. Clause 2, which excludes the public servants of the Commonwealth and of the States from its operation, meets with my approval. It would be a dangerous thing to try to establish a Federal Court to regulate the pay, hours of labour, privileges, rights, and duties of the employees of the States. To do so would be to attempt to flout the States Parliaments, and would bring upon the Federation a sea of troubles. There is already enough State jealousy of the Commonwealth without it being necessaiy to do anything to increase it . W i th regard to the public servants of the Commonwealth, it must be remembered that they are already provided for in a special Act, and it would, therefore, this prevision. I approve, too, of the collective agreements, and of the penalties for the non-observance of awards. But, while I strongly advocate the. provisions for conciliation, and for the enforcement of penalties, I object to imprisonment. of fines be enforced if no provision is made for imprisonment 1 the enforcement of fines and the levying upon the funds of the organizations, but I regard the imprisonment of the individual members of unions as impossible. Reference has been made to the satisfactory results which have been obtained from the operation of the New Zealand Act. I have no special knowledge of the cases which have been dealt with in New Zealand, but it is generally known that that colony was on the eveof a boom period when the Act was passed, n almost every case that has come before",51,Mceacharn Doe S The New South Wales Court I T Was Shown That

369,Mr Sawers,"I have no objection to the Arbitration Court there, the wages of the employees have been increased, and the employers have not objected, because the industries of the colony have been flourishing, and the country has been enjoying a career of almost unexampled prosperity. Therefore the experience of New Zealand is not enough to guide us. the working of the New Zealand Act is insufficient, why does the honourable member propose to limit the operation of this Bill to five years'( period I should be willing to vote for its re-enactment, but .if its operation be bad we shall have to review the whole matter. If New Zealand entered upon a period of depression and industrial decay, and the Court reduced, instead of increasing, wages, we should have an opportunity to discover whether the system will always give satisfaction. It is a matter of fact that the New Zealand Court has only once reduced the wages of the men. On that occasion a perfect clamour arose among the trade unionists, and it was actually proposed that the Judge should be removed from his position. of wages lower than that offered by the emplover. although that State has been going through a most disastrous period of late years, the Court has in every instance increased the wages of the employees coming before it . the Newcastle miners, for instance. ters to bring before the House, but as they were referred to by other honourable members, I shall not mention them. I would, however, direct the attention of the A t torney-General to the definition of an industrial dispute, which is given in clause 6. It is as follows :""Industrial dispute"" means a dispute in relation to industrial matters arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one part and an organization of employees on the other part, and extending beyond the limits of uny one State. Clause 42 provides thatNo industrial dispute shall without the approval of the President be submittedfcofcheCourt ny un organization unless the Registrar certifies(a.) That he is satisfied that the consent of the organization to the submission has been given in manner prescribed by the rules of the organization ; or (6) That fche consent of the organization to the submission has been given by resolution of a general meeting of members convened in manner prescribed for the consideration of the question or as a result of a poll on the question taken in manner prescribed; or (c) That consent to the submission has been given in writing under the hands of a majority of the committee of management offcheorganization. So that a trade dispute could be brought before the Court on the written request of a majority of the members of the committee of management of an organization. A more serious attempt should be made to limit the submission of cases to the Court. In my opinion, it should be necessary for a majority of the members of the organization to make a request for submission. Only the other day at BrokenH ill a minority qf the members were able to involve all the others there in trouble without consulting them. It is notorious that only one-third of the men employed at BrokenH ill are unionists, and these men were able to bring a case before the Arbitration Court which affected the whole number. I have here another illustration of the danger of allowing a small body of men to bring a case before the Court. The following statement is that of the writer of a private letter, in whom I have the utmost faith :The Colonial Sugar Company, Sydney, employ something like 3,000 hands, and a little while ago they were cited to appear before the court to show cause why practically the whole of the wages of the men in their employ should not be raised. The point was taken that no industrial dispute existed, and when the matter came before the court Mr Justice Cohen had no alternative but to find that no industrial dispute existed ; but adjourned the matter to enable a conference to be held between the parties. The conference took place, at which were present the representatives of fche union and representatives of the men themselves. One. of the principal claims put forward by the union was that eight hours should be adopted. Now, the sugar company have had in their employ some men who have been with them from 30 to 40 years, and if the eight hours system is adopted these old men could not do the work. . . . The representative of the men, as distinct from the representative of the union, at the conference stilted that he was satisfied with the conditions of the company's work, and that his followingthat is the great bulk of the workers-desire d no change until the company should be able to see its way clear to offer it. The majority are satisfied with things as they ""are.

I am not the representative of any one section in the community, but I represent all sections, and any man who charges me with being favorable to "" scabs"" or antagonistic to unionism is making a huge mistake. I have only one or two remarks to make with reference to the constitutional difficulty. I repeat that I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of passing a Bill of this character. I am not sure that it would not be wise, for a time at all events, to leave fche States Governments free and unfettered to manage their own industrial affairs, and to confine our attention to matters such as those relating to the shipping trade, which are of an Inter-State character. The whole crux of the position seems to hang upon the word "" prevention."" -claiming the right fco intervene before -a dispute has actually extended beyond any one State. In my innocence I never dreamt that that provision in the Constitution had any such significance. If -it has, I think we should do well to pause before passing the Bill. I am afraid that in the event of their failing to obtain satiswe are aiming, I shall be prepared, even at faction from the States Courts, the labour organizations will take very good care that the disputes in which they are concerned are extended beyond one State. The result would then be as I have stated previously. Although the New South WalesA c t provides that there shall be no appeal from the decision of the Arbitration Court, if a dispute is carried beyond the borders of that State, and the Federal authority in a court qf appeal which has not been sanctioned by the State. The effect might be to hang up a dispute for two or three years owing to the congestion of business in the Federal Court. I am quite aware that upon tlie general question of my sympathy for enforced arbitration and conciliation, or for the creation of some authority to bring about industrial peace, I may have laid myself open to some charges of inconsistency. But I am notinconsistent, although my views may have developed to ' some extent. I have always said that if I were once satisfied that by such means as those proposed in the Bill we could devise a satisfactory method of dealing with industrial disputes, I should throw my prejudices on one side. The application of a common rule will be one of the most delicate and dangerous operations in which the Court can engage. In my constituency there are two or three boot factories which, according to our ideas, are large and important, and which employ a considerable number of men. Suppose that the Federal1 Court gave a decision with regard to the boot manufactories in Melbourne or Sydney, where they have the most up-to-date machineiy, and that that decision immediately became the common rule so far as wages were concerned. I know that the Court has certain discretionary powers, but I am sure that the difficulty and trouble that would be created by the application of a common rule would be intense, and that it would probably have the effect of closing up many small establishments. I shall It seems to me that we are support the second reading of the Bill in order to show my sympathy with the principle of conciliation .and arbitration, but I shall assist other honourable members in amending some of the clauses in order to bring them into closer accord wibh my views. If the opponents of the Bill can show any other way of achieving the object at which this stage, to throw over the Bill and adopt their scheme. A t present [ know of no better way.

Ijustification of my somewhat lengthy remarks that, for years past, I have given my very best thoughts to this question, and that I have considered the provisions of the .Bill without prejudice or passion.

It may be beyond the power of statesmanship to modify the hideous law of demand ""and supply, as applied to flesh and blood, but I , at least, shall be abundantly satisfied if by my presence here I Gan assist to remedy the evils of industrial strife, or modify the inequalities of social life, and as far as may be within my power bring about the triumph of justice, conciliation, and peace. belong to the party with which I am associated, and who, from their personal experiences, as well as from their more or less close wish some of those gentlemen who talk so study of social science, are naturally deeply interested in this measure, cannot but be pleased with the reception with which it has met at the hands of the House. If one had stated some years ago, when Federation was first proposed, that the first Federal Parliament would have received, with so little opposition, a proposal to deal with the great industrial problem, he would scarcely have been regarded as a true prophet. It can hardly be said that the B ill has met with any opposition on general principles. twitted by the honourable and learned member for Parkes with having given us a poem, which he suggested should be set to music. I think that that is a very good idea, because we are endeavouring to bring about harmony between employers and employees. The honourable and learned member for Parkes seems to rest content until he hears the rumble of a progressive .movement, and then he rises in his place in the House and gives us a sample of thirty yearold political economy. We know very well that there are many difficulties to be overcome in connection with a measure of this kind, and that we have to give full consideration to its possibilities under the limited powers with which we are invested by the Constitution. But we can at least devise means for the settlement of those larger difficulties to industrial struggles, and it appears to which undoubtedly come within the purview of the Federation, namely, those which extend beyond any one State. I think that I am justified in claiming to speak with some authority on the subject, because I have had twenty-five years' continuous experience as an agitator, and for a considerable portion of that time as a paid agitator, which is considered by some Conservatives to be very much worse than any other kind.. honest man is an agitator. I cannot conceive of any man failing to be an agitator in the midst of the many evil conditions under which we live, and which we can at least do something to remedy. I propose to address myself to some of the concrete difficulties with which we are faced, and to consider whether the Bil l offers the best way of overcoming them. It is scarcely necessary to say that strikes are inevitable under our present social conditions, nor is it required of me to advance the proposition that they are an evil. I lightly of strikes, and, in a fatherly way say, "" We believe in trades unionism, but whatever you do, do not strike,"" had had some experience as executive members of some of thetrades organizations.' They would then realize that strikes are always the very last resource, and that they are only declared when they are forced upon the unions. I am speaking of the well organized and older unions. No doubt there are odd cases in which the men act hastily, but in the older unions many The Attorney-General was hours, or days, or even weeks, are devoted to the close consideration of the dispute before a strike is declared. They know what suffering it -involves to those who are dearest to them. No one who has made a close study of strikes can fail to admire the heroism exhibited by women and children in connection with many industrial struggles. In my judgment, they have displayed far greater bravery than has been exhibited upon any battle-field. They have always fought toresist encroachments rather than to obtain concessions. A great deal of good work has been done by individual writers and thinkers; but the great improvement of conditions which the workers have gained has been due solelj'to the power of trades unionism. I have been looking up some statistics relating me that they run through the whole commercial life of every country in a somewhat similar proportion. Under present conditions that seems inevitable.

384,Mr Spence,"I believe that everyUnited States, and Belgium, I find that there have been more than 9,000 industrial battles per annum. In the United Kingdom and America, during a single decade, there' -were over 21,000 disputes. The figures, moreover, seem to have some relation to population. I have not attempted to go into the question of the cost which these struggles involve, because I do not think that it is ascertainable. Some of those who argue that strikes on the part of workmen are foolish, assume that the latter are always influenced in their action by fatuous motives. The statistics of America, however, show that in 60 or 70 per cent, of the strikes that occur the workers secure an advantage. Of course the loss which they sustain is considerable. New South Wales, I am aware that a few years ago Mr James Curley, the secretary to the Miners' Association, made a calculation of the amounts which were contributed towards the support of the men during strike time, clearly demonstrating that it had actually paid them to go upon strike. country. merely pointing out the insurance which the strikers were called upon to pay. Of late years, however, the conditions have -completely changed. In giving evidence before fche Royal Commission on strikes which sat in New South Wales in 1890 I expressed the opinion that probably the loss sustained as the result of the great maritime trouble in that State was about £1,000,000. The actual loss of the New South Wales unions was £37,272, and of those in Victoria £31,209. In the Queensland shearers' strike, which occurred in 1891, the loss of the unions totalled £20,583, in the Barrier miners' strike of 1892 it represented £22,000, and in the shearers' strike of 1894 it amounted to £20,000, making a total of £131,064. That was the cost to the unions alone. In Queensland the Government spent £137,000 in sending quite unnecessarily soldiers to the affected districts. to the unions has been £32,000. In other words, the total loss to the unions, from 1890 to the present time, is £163,000. Prom these figures one ran imagine the enormous sacrifice which the other side sustains, quite apart fromfcheloss to the country. When I hear honourable members referring to the cost of the proposed Arbitration Court, I feel almost inclined to suggest that it would pay the unions themselves to bear it . In the United States an estimate has been made of the cost of strikes which have occurred there. Between 1881 and 1886 there were 3,902 industrial disputes, involving 22,304 establishments, and affecting 1,332,203 employees. From 1887 to 1894 there were 14,389 disputes,involving 69,166 establishments, and affecting 3,714,231 employees. The loss to the employers between 1881 and 1894 inclusive, was 82,589,786 dols., and to the employees, 163,807,657 dols., or a total of 246,397,443 dols. It is interesting to note that the cost to the strikers represents 3-77 dols. per In the Newcastle district, year. That is the premium which they have to pay. It is also worthy of remark that the eight hours movement, which was inaugurated in Australia, reached America about that period, and that a year or two later one of the very big strikes which occurred there was for a shortening of hours. In that case, 240,000 men were successful in obtaining a recognition by the employers But it did not pay the of the eight hours principle, and 210,000 had their hours of labour reduced to nine per day. Reference has been made to the great Pullman strike. In that struggle the loss sustained by the workers in wages was estimated at 350,000 dols. About 100,000 railway men came out in sympathy with the Pullman employees. During its continuance the railway companies concerned lost by damage. 685,308 dollars, and in earnings' 4,672,916 dols. The estimated loss to the country was 80,000,000 dojs. Of course the question of the loss sustained as the result of strikes is a serious one in itself. But there is infinitely more than the direct loss involved. We have to consider, not only the loss of time and wages, but the number of very serious evils which flow from industrial strife. I intend to quote just a few of them. I have no desire to say hard things concerning employers, but I shall show what has been the effect of these disturbances upon really good men. I shall state facts which Since then the estimated cost are within my own personal knowledge, and I am justified in doing so, because of the amount of misconception which exists in the public mind.

As soon as the so-called agitators were discharged, 4,000 out of the 10,000 employees on railways went out on Strike. The company procured the services of 50 engine-drivers to fill some of the vacancies thus created in their service, but as soon as these new employees ascertained the true position of affairs they refused to blackleg. They disguised themselves and left the service of the company. The result was that within five days the strike was brought to an end. The men secured better wages-the y got three yens a day instead of one-the y secured better treatment, and they also obtained a recognition of their demand for a better social position, the company deciding that porters and guards should in future rank equally with stationmasters. position to be a matter of importance. The Judges in Japan considered that they were being treated unfairly, and a Commission was appointed to inquire what salaries were paid to occupants of seats on the Judicial Bench in the western countries. The Commission sent in its report, and the Judges immediately went out on strike, contending that they were underpaid. The Government pointed out that the purchasing power of the salaries they were receiving was quite equal to that of the judicial salaries paid by western nations, and, some of the foremost fighters having been replaced by other men, the remaining Judges gave in. Thus the railway servants of Japan did better than did the Judges. It is a question whether this B ill should not apply to our Judges, because I think I am correct in saying that at one time something in the nature of a strike of Judges was threatened in Queensland. Some difficulty arose in regard to the allowciliation. In the three months endingances granted to them. every criminal who came before thema suggestion which evidenced more astuteness ontheir part than was shown by the Japanese Judges. thinks that there should be an anti-strike B ill against Judges. show why strikes are inevitable under the present system, and why the system of conciliation has hitherto failed. France has had Conciliation Courtsi n existence since the year 1296, so that the people of that I country should be fairly familiar with th© system. The lines upon which the courts work in France are well known, and it will be unnecessary for me to deal with the subject at any length. The courts dispose of a great many minor cases, and consequently the statistics relating to their operation in the early part of last century cannot fairly be compared with those of .more recent years. I find, for example, that four of thesecourts in Paris are said to have disposed of about 24,000 cases annually in the early days. In 1889 they dealt with 43,141 cases, but in 16,178 in stances they failed to effect a settlement. In 1890, 3,112 cases in the textile tradescame before the courts, but 1,124 were not settled. In 1891, 940 out of 2,841 wereThey evidently consider social not settled. From 1871 to 1880, conciliation was arrived at in 71 per cent, of the cases; in 1881, in 61 per cent.; and in 1882' and again in 1883, in 64 per cent., while sincethen the average number of cases settled has been 53 per cent. After the big coal strikeof 1892, which was settled by M . Loubet, the present President, power was taken by the State to interfere, but they stopped short of the compulsory enforcement of decisions. From 1893 to 1899 the Act was brought into force in 778 cases. Of thosecases, 425 came before the Courts on the application of the men, 23 on the application of the emplo3'ers, 18 on the joint application of the two parties, and 312 by the interference of the officers of the State. There was a settlement in 204 cases, but the remaining574 were not settled. In the six months ending April, 1902, of 293 cases in dispute only 26 reached the Courts; 11 by theinterference of the State officials. In 7 of those cases the employees refused conJanuary, 1903, out of 84 'cases in disputeonly 16 went before the Court, and only two were settled. I will not read all the figures in detail, but they show a steady decrease, and latterly parties have declined to go before the courts because of the failure to settle cases. Similar courts, Conseils de Prud'hommes, were established in Belgium The honourable member in 1806,and in the period between 1887 and 1891, 22,691 cases occurred, of which 16,190 were settled by conciliation, and 2,704 by arbitration, while there was a failure in 3,696 cases. In England an Act of 1824 gave a c»urt power tofix wages if 'both sides accepted the award. In 1867 the A ct was amended",56,Mceacharn Doe S The New South Wales Court I T Was Shown That

390,Mr Spence,"-Yes. I desire now to to give equal representation to both parties. In 1872 the arbitration principle was introduced, and it was provided that if either side presented a printed copy of its terms to the other side they became legally binding upon both, unless they were repudiated within 48 hours. The English Labour Commission of 1891-4 favoured some compulsory system. The big coal strike of 1893 lasted sixteen weeks, and then Mr Gladstone took action, and it was settled under the arbitration of Lord Rosebery. In 1894 Mr Asquith was the arbitrator in the great cab-drivers' strike. In 1895 the difficulty in the boot trade was settled under Sir Courtenay Boyle. In connection with that settlement a principle was introduced which is contained in this Bill. Each side put into the hands of the chairman £1,000 as a guarantee that it would comply with the award, .and part of that money has since been forfeited for a breach of the award. If we take the Board of Trade reports, the strikes seem to have aggregated for the seven years ending 1894, 5,949, and are about the same for a similar period since. Taking an average of years, 300,000 persons were involved. It is strange to see how evenly thefiguresrun -900 , 700, 600, and 900 cases each year. Statements have been made about the success of tbe English boards. It goes without saying that in every industry disputes will arise which never see the light of day, being settled in a friendly spirit. Others come to a head sufficiently to be reported, but are quickly settled. Boards of Conciliation, and in others again persons of tact and judgment interfere and bring about a settlement. AH these methods of settlement will be possible under tbe Bill. There were 139 of these boards in operation in Englandi n 1899. The cases listed number 1,232, of which 506 were withdrawn, and 675 settled, while 51 remained unsettled. Most of them were settled by joint -committees. I think that one of the most valuable clauses in the B ill is that which provides for committees of that kind. It is an extraordinary fact that the Sydney Daily Tekf/rafjh had an article one day speaking strongly in favour of the English system, and next day an article denouncing this Bill, which provides for joint committees of the trade. In New York, for ten years past, there has been one in the brick industry which has been very successful. Builders and their workmen meet every ""Wednesday. The arrangement has been a great success, and could be adopted in many other industries. In Englandi n the five years between 1894 and 1^99, the courts settled from 38 to 45 cases a year out of over 700 cases that arose. Notwithstanding the large number of cases settled, if the number of men concerned is taken into account, only about 6 per cent, appear to have been affected by the settlements. Out of 113 cases in 1901, 70 were settled ; 32 by conciliation and 38 by arbitration. The experience of England, as well as of other countries, shows a falling-off in the number of cases settled by ordinary methods of conciliation. In Germany they have Industrial Courts, and although they have not the compulsory system, they have some means of interfering. I will not give the whole of the details connected with the German experience, because it would take too much time to do so. I will, however, quote the figures for 1896. In that year the intervention of the Courts was sought in 44 cases, eighteen of which were settled, and, out of eleven decisions, two were accepted and nine rejected. Those are the latest figures I happen to have. Reference has been made to Switzerland. That country has already moved in the direction of preventing strikes. It has been found that to leave the cantons to deal individually with matters of this kind has not been a success, so the law has been amended, and every effort is now made to arrive at the settlement of industrial disputes, first by conciliation and afterwards by Others are referred to arbitration, and there can be no strike or lock-out while a case is pending. In Italy they have ah official conciliator who can interfere, . and thej' also provide for arbitration. In Austria they do not allow strikes or locks-out. They have arbitration courts to which the parties must go, and if a settlement is not obtained there they can go to the ordinary courts. In Denmark and Norway the Conciliation Court is the court of first instance, where disputes such as would come into our police courts arise. I think that their system would be a good one to copy here, though the members of the legal profession would not favour it . Although my authority in the case of Norway is a few years old, I have been told that 88 per cent, of the cases are successfully settled, the fees amounting to lO^d., and the whole cost of settlement being 2s. 7 i d . People accustomed to that method of conciliation would easily be got to agree to a similar method for the settlement of industrial disputes. Denmark has a somewhat similar law for rural districts, and parties must go to the Court set up under it before going to any other. and Quebec, Acts providing for conciliation and arbitration have recently been passed, though their provisions are not compulsory. the American Union similar Acts been passed, though, as in other cases, they have failed. In Massachusetts and New York the Courts have some power of enforcing their decisions. Unless 6.0 days' notice is given decisions are enforceable. call attention to that fact to show how different is our position in Australia. if employers and employees come to a friendly arrangement, it is not binding. An arrangement between two individuals can be enforced as a contract, and either side can be punished for any breach of it. But if a trades union makes an agreement with a body of employers, either side can break it, notwithstanding about. In concluding my remarks upon the experience of America, I should like to emphasize the fact that, in 188S, they passed an Actdealing with therail way companies and the shipping on rivers and lakes connecting the railway lines. That Act was amended in 1898, and, to show the trend of opinion in the direction of the principles of this Bill, prohibits strikes and locks-out. 'It also provides for the enforcements of decisions and makes them binding. before the Conciliation Court and then before an Arbitration Court. ©f the latter is binding, being placed in the same position as a decision in a Court of Equity. PenaltiesfromlOOdols.to can be imposed upon the employers, to check them from doing certain things, such as discriminating unionists, boycotting, and requiring the men to sign agreements to make payments to a doctor or to a society. That is the latest legislation, and it shows that the trend of events is in the direction in which we are going. I think that it will be generally conceded that the opinions of the leaders of labour in Australia are worthy of as much consideration as are those of the American labour leaders. They both speak from the stand-point of their own surroundings, and judge from their experience as to the probable effects of any Mr Spence. law of this kind. In view of what we> know of the American Courts, and of the system of electing Judges, I am not at all surprised that the American labour leaders should hesitate, in spite of their difficulties, In the Provinces of Ontario to hand themselves over to the courts. The information which I have presented to honourable members shows how the law isused against the workers, and how all the In sixteen of the States of powers of the States and Eederal Governhave ments are employed to coerce them, unreasonably in many cases. I desire to read one quotation to show that there is still some misunderstanding in the minds of American labour leaders regarding the I effect of the New Zealand and Australian arbitration laws. Some extracts have been . Here, read from the utterances of Mr Gompers, and I wish to quote a paragraph from a speech he made quite recently at the meeting in connection with the Civic Federation, at which it was proposed to form a greatconciliation board, and at which a number of leading employers were present. Mr. Gompers quotes Lincoln as having said : the trouble in bringing it "" Thank God we live in a country where people maystrike."" He remarksNevertheless a strike ought to be avoided by every means within the power of every man, capitalist, labourer, or the neutral citizen, and hewho would not give his best efforts and thought to prevent a strike is scarcely doing justice to his fellow-men, nor is he loyal to the institutions under which we live. But I re-assert that there are some things which are worse than strikes, and among them. I include a degraded, a debased,, or a demoralized manhood. Labour insists upon Cases go first and will never surrender the right to free locomotion, the right to move at will, the right to gofrom Philadelphia to Camden, or California, or The decision vice versa, at will. Xo achieve that right it has cost centuries of struggles, and sacrifices, and burdens. Labourers, moreover, will insist upon the right freely to change their employment, a, l.OOOdols. right which they have secured through centuries of travail and sacrifices. That right three-fourths of the nation was up in arms a little more than between unionists and nonforty years ago to achieve for the black man, and the white labourers of America will not surrender that prerogative. Labourers are aiming at freedom through organization and intelligence. Several other remarks uttered by the same gentleman show that he has failed torealize that we have a system for the compulsory settlement of disputes which still leaves the workers and the employers free. He and other leaders in America havefailed to grasp the fact that under our laws we have the power to prevent locks-out and strikes without compelling an employer to carry on his industry. We simply tell theemployer that if he desires to carry on he must comply with the conditions of the award, whilst, on the other hand, the workman is free to leave his employment and to engage in another. Therefore, the freedom of the individual is not interfered with. We quite agree with Mr Gorapers in the position he takes up, but we claim that the advantages to be derived from a peaceful settlement of disputes more than counterbalance any that may be gained by the exercise of the liberty to strike. I propose now to deal with the attitude of the employers. I have had experience as a labour leader for a quarter of a century, and it appears to me that the employers are like spoilt children crying for what they will never get. eyes to facts which are patent to every student of political and social economy, and which ought, perhaps, to be better known to business men than to many others. Instead of directing their energies to the prevention of trouble, they are doing their best to throw obstacles in the way of any scheme having such an object in view. I have no recollection of auy measure ever proposed for the benefit of the working classes that was not opposed by the . employers. In an exceedingly interesting summary of the labour laws of Massachusetts, I find it stated that the first law was passed in 1836, and that there have -been altogether 238 Acts or amendments of Acts dealing with labour. The report says that these Acts contained many imperfections that were retained with the definite purpose of defeating the object of the legislation, and they attribute all the best results of such legislation to the efforts of labour agitators. The Employers' Unions have been distributing circulars containing statements which do not closely adhere to facts. Mr F. T. Derham, president of the Employers' Federation of Victoria, is reported as having recently statedFree men would be compelled to join unions, Messrs. Flood, and Company on the Cirand be brought to heel under unionist leaders, cular Quay. many of whom-no t all--were self-seeking, and looking for fat billets. Those who were listening to Mr Derham said ""Hear, hear."" If there had been any working truth in that statement, and the members quired by us. of the unions had followed their leaders, we should have had labour Parliaments in all This is the position that the Employers' the States long ago. They do not, however, Federation takes up to-day. act as their leaders tell them, otherwise gentlemen like Mr Derham would honourable member object to that if the not occupy positions of authority. The terms of employment were fair 3 employers have not made any progress in the study of economic questions during the last few. years. I think it would be fair to quote a statement made by the late Mr E. M . Young, who was reported in the Argus of 27th February, 1891. I quote the statement only as expressing an idea. Mr Young saidUnfortunately we had in this community leaders of men who asserted that labour was not receiving its fair share, aud their agreements, ar.d utterances, and manifestoes, fairly showed that until they possessed the properties of the employers, and afterwards their lives, thej' would not be satisfied. . . . The working men were simply asking for control. There was no question of wages, of hours, They are closing their nor of terms. All that the employers insisted on was that thej' should be allowed to conduct their business as they pleased, and to employ whom they pleased, whether the men were in unions or not. To the idea of non-interference with their business the employers seem to hold fast as a creed. I took some trouble to obtain a definite expression of the employers' creed, particularly in regard to the term "" freedom of contract."" In a statement compiled by the president of the Master Bakers' Association in Adelaide, freedom of contract was defined, the fourth paragraph reading as followsThey shall pay what they choose without being questioned in the matter by anybody. I was present when that statement wasobtained. The definition adopted by thePastoralists' Union isThat employers shall be free to employ, and shearers shall be free to accept employment,, whether belonging, to shearers or other unions ornot, without favour, molestation, or intimidation: on either side. I think that the best example of a concrete' statement regarding ""freedom of contract"" was a notice posted at the time of the 1890 strike in. Sydney outside the offices of The notice read as follows :-Let it be understood that for the future all men for us will be expected to do such work on such terms and arrangements as may be reSir WILLIAM McMILLAN W o u l d the emphatically object to it . Sir WILLIAM member surely does not object to the principle of employers fixing the wages 1 want is a collective agreement. I have endeavoured to find out what the employers want. They will not tell us straight out. It seems, however, from then* recent utterances, that they now hold the same view as in 1S90, and that they claim the right to dictate the terms upon which they shall employ labour, and that the workmen must accept such terms or leave them. Many employers have absolutely refused to recognise the unions, or to have anything to do with collective bargains. They want what is called the economic iron law of wages to operate. That law is that wages have a tendency to fall to the lowest sum that any individual workman is prepared to accept, or any individual employer is prepared to give. But in the midst of a society that is departing from that principle, what is the use of the employers refusing to recognise patent facts. The unions have beeji formed with the object ,of defeating the operation of any such law. I believe in a mutual arrangement between the parties, under which a minimum can be fixed. It is not right that the employer should be allowedto dictate to the workmen as to the rates of pay which shall be given. must take the initiative. Isi t a sin for an employer to say-""Erom my point of view these are the wages which shall be paid."" It is for the workman to say whether he considers they are fair. After that I believe in mutual concessions, but the honourable member seems to think that it is a crime for an employer to fix his own rate of wages. ployer must fix the wages in the first instance, but in cases where the employers break away ""from collective agreements and start a free labour bureau, bhe conditions are altogether altered. The employers seem to think that they should be free to prescribe the conditions of employment. They resent anything in the shape of what they are pleased to term ""dictation."" In conresponsible for the first one. nexion wibh this very Bill is it not bandied about that we desire to control their busically that no man could have made ness ? We want to do no such thing. We a more determined effort than I did merely ask that something like reasonable conditions as regards workmen shall be failed to put unionists upon an equality wibh non-unionists, but they have instituted a system of boycott against the former. I cannot find a stronger case in favour of compulsory arbitration than that which is presented by the Pastoralists' Union. I have just read the definition of freedom of contract which it adopts. It insists upon putting that definition at the head of its agreements. But does it carry out those agreements 1 Certainly not! I have seen confidential circulars which were sent to employers particularly in Queensland and New South Wales -askin g for reports upon the shearers engaged by bhem. Those confidential reports, when forwarded, contained references bo every individual shearer. These were frequently marked ""good,"" showing that a man was quite capable of performing his work well. The references were printed with a special kind of type. The lists of men marked off on these reports distinguished union men and agitators. As a result, when the men sought employment from the Pastoralists' Union one would be engaged. whilst the services of another would be declined, although both were equally competent according to the references of their employers. Thus some of the best menin Queensland have been boycotted by the Pastoralists' Union. Any number of them have drifted to Western Australia. I am glad to say that they carried their principles with them, and that they assisted in the return of representatives to this House who are in sympathy with labour legislation. It is sixteen years since the Shearers' Union was organized. In every district in which it established itself it issued circulars to the pastoralists, together with a copy of its rules, and invited suggestions to render the scheme which it had in view a workable one. In some instances these overtures were met in the most friendly manner, but in most cases its request ""was absolutely refused. We have had any number of strikes. I believe that the Shearers' Union alone has experienced close upon 6,000 of them.",59,Mceacharn Doe S The New South Wales Court I T Was Shown That

The South Australian pastoralists met us in 189.1, and as a result we arrived at a friendly agreement, although the Federal Council of the Pastoralists Union subse1 quently compelled its members to repudiate it. In Victoria, the pastoralists have always been willing to come to an amicable agreement, but have been prevented from doing so by their own association. In New South Wales the squatters refused to meet us year after year. In 1891, it is true, they did meet us in conference, and we adopted an agreement which, it was expected, would last until an alteration was effected in it by mutual arrangement. In 1894, however, the pastoralists deliberately repudiated it , and brought about one of the biggest strikes that has been experienced in the bush countrya strike which cost us about £12,000, and which involved them in an expenditure of £2,000 upon the western line alone. They raked the cities in order to get men, and as a result induced all the criminal class available to go into the bush country. The most notorious burglars were sent out there under police escort, and the managers of the back country stations declare that things have not yet resumed their normal condition. What was the object underlying the action of the Pastoralists' Union? They inserted a clause in the agreement relating to the conditions of labour which would make the employer the sole judge in any dispute. That is their idea of freedom of contract. When we discovered tliat they had broken the agreement, we called into operation the machinery of the Conciliation Court. Sir George Dibbs did all that was possible to bring about conciliation, and I . personally drafted a telegram which he sent to the Premiers of Queensland and Victoria soliciting their friendly co-operation. Sir George Dibbs also induced the managers of 'the big banking institutions in New South Wales to come together. The Banks refused to use their influence to prevent trouble. The pastoralists refused to meet us in conference. I make this statement because we are constantly charged with having promoted trouble. Five times in eight consecutive years we have applied to the New South Wales pastoralists to meet us in conference, and they have consistently declined to do so. It is not the bond fide pastoralists who are to blame, but in dealing with them officially we have to treat with them as an organization, and I say that the union in question has forced upon us quite unnecessary trouble. The result of the serious strike which occurred in 1894 was not only a tremendous loss to the State, but 87 members of the Shearers' Union were consigned to gaol under the extraordinary law which prevailed. Of course it is easy enough to send a man to gaol under the A ct dealing with the creation of disturbances, as the Attorney-General knows. For example, one of our men was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, simply because he was a member of a camp from which some men went out and created a disturbance. The Chief Justice declared at the trial that it did not matter if he were 100 miles away at the time the offence was committed. Two of our men were shot, and one of themdied after leaving gaol from the effects of his wound. The non-unionist who shot him received a medal from the President of the Pastoralists' Union for his bravery. In Queensland a great many men have suffered unjustly. non-unionists out of their bunks? to enter into details, or I could tell honourable members that some of the stories which were circulated in the public press have no foundation in fact. For instance, the statement was wired to England that a wool-shed had been burned down, when, as a matter of fact, there were 2 feet of water in the building at the time. The whole story was concocted as a bit of fun. I do not forget that in a great many disputes conciliation is possible. Buti n this connection, what is our experience in Victoria? In VictoriaI organized the Amalgamated Miners' Association, which had branches all over Australia. In our earlier history we had to fight. In thirteen out of thirty-six disputes, the employers posted a notice declaring that any man who joined the union would be dismissed. In Melbourne-to come nearer home-ther e is in existence a wages-board system. It is not satisfactory-certainl y not so good as would be an Arbitration Court. But let us look at the attitude adopted by the employers in this connection. The wages boards consist of representatives from both parties to a dispute, -with some independent person acting as",63,Mcmillan The Honourable Imposed Not Only Have The Employers

I have a newspaper report setting forth that last month one of the employers was proceeded against by the Inspector of factories wages fixed by the determination of the Board. called to support the case, and I learn that they have since been discharged. another case, certain men have been boycotted since 1901, and hav.e been unable to obtain employment. which a man was boycotted, because of a remark which he was alleged to have made at a meeting of the Miners' Association in Victoria. reported ; he never made the remark attributed to him j buthe was boycotted, and had to leave the district. cases, at least, a lock-out was resorted to in order to prevent men from joining unions. I should like to refer to another case which I also inquired into. In the -early days of Broken Hill, the Mine Managers' Association circulated, a list, giving the names of eight miners whom the managers of the mines were requested not to employ. I have the authority of one of tlie managers, who received a copy of the circular, for the assertion that it was sent to all the mine managers. No reason was given for the request that these men should not be eraployed. The men went from mine to mine, and were unable to obtain They knew* of no reason for the refusal to -employ them, and they were not aware of the fact that they had been placed upon a "" black list."" The system of issuing "" black Jists"" was freely adopted in America a few years ago. When the employers agree to meet the workmen,, the system of conciliation works very well; but, unless they are prepared to do so, it is .utterly useless. In this, as in other matters, we' have to look at the percentage, for we find that there is no great difference between employers and workmen. the part of employers to break the factory laws, and they are occasionally fined for such offences. We have also known the Cnstoms Act to be violated by respectable people, many of whom are always ready to. talk about the violence sometimes associated with strikes. Mr Spence. which was sent round the-sheds in Queensland? that matter. ' I have seen certain reports in which statements relative to a man's capacity, the union to which he belonged, and other details, were set down under the for failing to pay the rate of heading of "" remarks."" The union to which I belong has taken some trouble to investiSeveral of his employees were gate cases of the kind, and we find that these tactics have been adopted by a union In which refuses to conciliate or to meet us ; but is, nevertheless, ready to charge our organization with all the evil things which I remember a case in sometimes occur when trouble arises. I wish those who are so ready to speak of the violence associated with strikes to take a note of what is done by As a matter of fact he was misthe big trusts in America. Those trusts scarcely stop at any crime. Henry D. Lloyd, in his Wealth against Gommomoealth, deals In thirteen with the tactics adopted by the Standard Oil Company in the United States of America. He shows that the company has destroyed the property of opponents, and that, by requisitioning the services of soldiers and planting cannon, it has prevented its opponents from laying pipes with which to carry on their operations. I have even seen violence used by employers in Australia. I have been drilled with others in the use of spears 9 feet in length, which we were expected to prod into the bodies of miners working a claim adjacent to that in which we were employed, and who, in following up the gold, were getting employment. very close to us. I remember also a case in which a few years ago a truck load of pick handles was sent down a mine near Ballarat for fighting purposes, and we were expected to use them. Sometimes, when a man is provoked, an incident occurs which every one regrets. We find certain people always ready to make the most of such cases ; but they have nothing to say in regard to the wrong-doings of their own class, oi of the violence which they are pre1 pared to use when it suits their ends I have no desire to say that such a There is often a readiness on practice is common. Happilyi t is disappearing. I wish now to refer to the question of unionism. Unionism seems to be a bugbear to many people, but I . think I shall be able to show not only that it has proved useful in the past, but that if this Bill be passed it will be an advantage rather than a disadvantage-if it has ever really been",64,Mcmillan The Honourable Imposed Not Only Have The Employers

400,The Workmen Have Been Dis,"Mr SPENCE I have already explaineddisadvantageous to any class. Shulze. Gaeveinitz, at page 24S of Social Peace, writesThe more intellectually gifted employers in the most important English industries have given an ungrudging recognition to the unions, and comparing the present with the former state of incessant strife, they see in the trades union movement the instrument which is to restore English industry to-the paths of peace. The late Mr Gladstone said that trades unions were ""the bulwarks of democracy,"" while Professor Marshall in his work, Economics of Industry, saysLittle but mischief comes from weak unions, always ready to interfere, but seldom able to -secure the faithful carrying out of an agreement to which its own officers have been a party. But .a strong union, guided by able and far-seeing men, who have a grave sense of responsibility, -is found to enable a few minutes of conversation to settle innumerable petty disputes that in old times would have caused much delay and worry .and loss of mutual good feeling. My experience is that whenever the employers are willing to confer with the men -much good is accomplished. One of the beneficial influences of unionism from tlie standpoint of the employer is that it sifts .all grievances. I was for sixteen years secretary of a very big branch of a trades -union. For eleven and a half years I acted .as general secretary of a union, and I have held office for seventeen years in another large union. I claim, therefore, to' know isomething of unionism. I have made a close study, of the system and of its effect upon individuals. I assert, as the result of rny experience, that all grievances are -examined by the unions, and only genuine -or what appear to be genuine grievances in the eyes of the workmen, are presented to the employers. In that way employers are saved much trouble and annoyance, and it is because of this fact that the trades unions .are largely recognised. It is only when the employers refuse to recognise them, and wish to do as they like with their workmen, that difficulty occurs. The testimony given by Mark Hanna, who is a very large -employer of labour, and has taken an active interest in this question, is worthy of attention. He saysI believe in organized labour, and I have for 30 years. I believe in it, because ifc is a demonstrated fact that where the concerns and interests of labour are intrusted to able and honest leadership, it is much easier for those who represent the -employers fco come into close coutacfc .with the labourer, and, by dealing with fewer persons, to .accomplish results quicker and better. We have also the testimony of Potter Farmer, of Chicago, who is reported to have saidPor ten years I made as desperate a fight against organized labour as was ever made by mortal man. Ifc cost me considerably more than 1,000,000 dols. to learn that there is no labour so skilled, so intelligent, so faithful, as that which is governed by an organization, whose officials are well-balanced, level-headed men. I now employ none but organized labour, and never have the least trouble, each believing that the one has no right to oppress the other. This is splendid testimony to the value of trades unions. Any employer who' shows tact in the management of his affairs will endorse the opinion I have just quoted.. Of course every rule has its exceptions. But I am prepared to assert that strikes generally take place because an employer or his manager shows a want of tact and judgment in dealing with his men. In spite of what may be said to the contrary, I hold that workmen are very easily managed, and I have arrived at that opinion after closely observing their habits. An employer may sometimes have an excellent manager ; but. when he refuses to' listen to any grievance, or to have a grievance sifted by a trades union, and even declines to recognise a union, trouble often takes place. I know full well that men have no desire to quarrel with their bread and butter. They have no wish to enter, upon a strike, and the larger a union becomes the greater is the safety to the employer. I propose now to deal with some of the statements which have been made during this debate. It is said that unions are tyrannical, and that men are forced to join their ranks. I do not think that much attention need be given to a statement of that kind. All unions are democratic in their form of government. Membership must be purely voluntary, aud no mail can be coerced into joining them. Another statement is that trades unions are led by agitators, who induce the men to strike. It goes without saying, however, that if any one attempted to lead a good, solid body of unionists he would very rapidly discover that they had opinions of their own. It is idle to say that they are led this way or that way by agitators. Lord Rosebery has described the harcl-headed unionists of England as ""the aristocracy of labour."" It is well known that the unions are managed with great care, and it is only necessary for a man to become a member in order to discover that there is no truth in the assertion that unionists are led by the nose by agitators. Another contention is that unionism interferes with the efficiency of labour. It goes without saying that business undertakings often fail because of influences which are quite apart from industrial difficulties. Competition may crush them out; but I have never found any evidence of interference on the part of unions with the management of a business or any indication that unionism tends to impair the efficiency of labour. It is frequently asserted that this Bill will interfere with the employment of old and slow workers, and many people believe that trades unionism causes many old men to be thrown out of work. My experience is that the manager of a business invariably takes care' to secure the services of the best workmen available, and I have heard some aged men say that they find it necessary to dye their beards in order to obtain a billet. I have never known an employer to evince a special desire to obtain the services of old men, unless their capacity was equal to that of younger workmen. I should like. to draw attention to the experience of the Victorian boot trade. A wages board was appointed to deal with the boot trade in this State, and the men, being anxious that there should be no interference with the employment of aged workmen, asked for the adoption of piece-work rates. The employers, however, refused that request. The men were anxious that the old workers should be affected as lightly as possible by the change, and on the prsmise of the employers that they would not discharge the old men, they accepted a minimum wage of 36s -per week, the employers agreeing to pay more to the better class of workmen. That was Is. a day less than labourers obtain for unskilled work. They reduced all to 36s. a week,' and I am informed that when they decreased the number of their hands they kept only the best men. The wages of those men have twice been raised by the board since then. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I s the honourable member speaking of a time when they had duties of 35 and 50 per cent.? rers always ask the workmen to support high duties, but they try at the same time to reduce their wages. I do not wish, however, to be understood as making a charge against employers as a class. There is enough in the social system to find fault with without abusing particular classes. Indeed, I am in a way an admirer of the tyrannical employer, and if I favoured the setting upof monuments to any one, I think it would be to the tyrants, because of the good they do in shaking other people up. I have done a great deal of organizing in my time, and I know that the difficulty . which all organizers find is, not in getting men who have big grievance's to organize, but in getting those who are satisfied with their conditions of employment to join the unions. Of course, now that education is widespread, the principle of unionism is very strong. It is stronger in Australia in proportion to population than in any other part of the world, as I have proved by careful calculations, though the strength of unionism is not to be measured by the number of members, in any organization. Let me now show what there is iu this talk about union and non-union men. When the workersin any particular trade become organized, it is the best men who join the union, because the employers, so far as they can get them, will have none but the best men. The weaker men, as a rule, do not join the unions, and the feelingagainst them is very strong when trouble takes place, and they are ready to fill thepositions of unionists. The idea that the Bill will coerce men to join unions is a mistake. Men will, however, readily join unions under its provisions, because of theadvantages which they can so readily obtain by combining, since if they have grievances they will be able to get them remedied. The men of what I term the anti-union class are invariably men of the criminal type. I do not refer to all men who are not members of unions, though I believe that every man is the better for joining a union. Our experience has been, however, that a big percentage of those who cause trouble are well-known criminals, and in that statement. I am borne out by the police. The pastoralists, too, out. Bourke way, have lost jewellery and other effects from their homesteads, through the dishonesty of these men. A dog if he sees a bone will not worry about its ownership. He has no sense of proprietary rights, and promptly seizes it for himself. In the same way, when a burglar enters a house, he does not care what value is attached to the jewellery which he sees lying about. It might be an heirloom",65,Mcmillan The Honourable Imposed Not Only Have The Employers
401,Mr Spence,"Yes. The manufactuwhich the owner would not sell for any money. That does not trouble him. All he wants is to satisfy his own particular needs. There are many men who are so utterly selfish that they care nothing about the injury they inflict upon others so long as they make some gain for themselves. These men, who will selfishly cut the throats of their fellows in industrial warfare, are always men of the criminal type. They may not be professional criminals, but they belong to that class. They are generally the rakings of the city-me n who are only given occasional jobs. They are employed when there is trouble, but they are not generally kept on very long after the trouble is ended. Men of that class are not entitled to consideration. We should consider the decent, honest working man, whether he be a member of a union or not\ but men of the class I speak of are not such as any one would trust, and if I were an employer I should be very sorry to have them in my factory. The introduction of such men into a factory or workshop invariably causes annoyance and loss. non-unionist is forced upon a number of unionists they put a lot of trouble in his way. Human nature being what it is, they humbug him in a great man}' ways. Who loses 1 The foolish employer who is trying to make a stand against a principle which has been gaining ground for a century, and which nothing has been able to kill. There has been a great deal of talk about this kind of legislation frightening away capital. I do not take much notice of that cry. When the Tariff was under discussion, and protectionists desired the imposition of high duties, we heard a great deal about men walking about with millions in their pockets, which they were ready to embark in suitably-protected industries; but now that the discussion is over, we hear nothing of them. We have been told by the Premier of New South Wales, however-and this is a material fact that, since the passing of the Arbitration Act there, £1,000,000 has been invested in the State. That fact is more tangible than the talk about millions of money having been withdrawn from the country. The honourable and learned member for Parkes told us that some firms in England have withdrawn several millions of money from the country. Sir true. doubt about the accuracy of the statement. But if several millions of money have been withdrawn by English firms, I believe there is enough money left in Australia for our purposes. We have the richest country in the world. We produce more wealth per head than does any other country. We have more property owners; we have a tremendous sum per head deposited in. the Savings Banks in fact, we have everything to indicate that there is plenty of capital available. I should like to see something more tangible than mere assertions. I cannot find any evidence of the withdrawal of millions of money. The other day the Age reprinted a paragraph from a New Zealand newspaper stating that in that country the ladies were taking round a petition to the Parliament in favour of immigration, because all the,girls there were getting married, and therefore they could not get domestic servants. That is a pretty good sign of the prosperity of New Zealand, quite apart from the many interesting facts When a which tbe honourable member for Bland brought out, and which I do not wish to repeat. There is a good deal of truth in a paragraph of the report of the Royal Commission which sat in New South Wales in 1891, and inquired into the cause of the maritime trouble, and of strikes generally. In paragraph 3 the Commissioners stateMany investors are timid about embarking their savings in any industrial pursuit which can at any time be brought to a stop by a strike or lock-out, and if this uncertaiuty could be removed, there would, in all probability, be a great development of industry. I think that is much more likely to be true than is the talk of this legislation frightening away the capitalist. If a man is to be subject to the annoyance of the unions of which he is always complaining-and he is sure to have that annoyance-if he is to be subject to the risk of strikes which may upset his industry, drive away his trade, and put him to great loss, surely he need not be afraid of a court which will prevent that kind of thing from taking place 1 I wish to present an economic phase of this subject, which has an important bearing upon some of the arguments which have been levelled against this kind of legislation. I desire to show why it is thought necessary to have a minimum wage, and the conditions somewhat tries, and that if some of the employers had",67,Mcmillan The Honourable Imposed Not Only Have The Employers
402,Mr Spence,"I have a very gravetheir way the inevitable result of the present social system is such that they would be crushed out anyhow. I have taken a quotation from a speech by Mr G. A . Chace, of the Bourne Mills, Massachusetts, who has had a profit-sharing system with the workers for twelve years. He saysAside from any sentiment of philanthropy which may lurk in the motives of a broad-minded employer of a large number of workmen, it seems to me that there is a good business reason for high wages, provided a minimum cost is Making 10 carts ... Machine 500 lbs. butter Machine 500 yards twilled cotton, &c. 100 pai rs cheap boots Machine 1,000 lbs. loaves) 12 doz. men's jackets Machine. ... Some manufacturers talk about the wages which they pay to the workmen, and they think that if they were to pay a little more it would add to the cost of production. Now, in manufacturing only a very small factor indeed in some cases. The figures I have quoted illustrate what an enormous difference in cost there is between hand-labour and machinery. The more machinery is introduced the more rapidly is the production of the article hastened, and the less interest the capitalist has to pay. Take the spinning and weaving industries. ceased entirely to be a factor in the production of cloth. Unless colonial manufacturers-the under a law of this kind-recognise the organization of industry, in the perfection of its machinery, and endeavour to keep up with the rest of the world, inevitably they must go down, and it cannot be averted by any reduction in the wages. We should also remember another important economic truth, namely, that there is a constant decrease in the number of smaller Mr Spence. secured by a maximum wage. We have recently expended a million dollars with the express purpose of securing improved products at lower cost' with higher wage scales. That is a most important statement, which I commend to manufacturers who are entering into competition. I shall now quote from a wonderful analysis made for the Labour Bureau in America in 1898, to show the cost of producing, by hand labour and by machinery, a few articles which I have picked out:Workmen. Operations. Hours."" Labour cost. Hand2 11 1,180 §54-40 52 97 37-28 $7-90 Hand3 7 125 §1.0-08 7 8 12-30 §1-78 Hand3 19 7,534 §135-61 Machine 252 43 84 §6-81 Hand2 83 1,438 §408-50 113 122 154 $35-40 bread (1-lb. Hand1 11 28 §5-80 Machine 12 16 8 56 §1 -55 ... Hand1 4 840 §50-40 11 8 97 15 §12-80 employers. This class of employers must go to ruin in any case. In this connection I desire to quote some interesting figuresapplying to Germany and covering a period-, to-day, labour is from 1882 to 1895. The number of independent manufacturers was diminishedjin. numbers during the period mentioned by 139,382, whilst the total, inclusive of labourers, increased by 861,468. .Takingthe whole of the manufacturing, agricultural, and commercial industries, the independent manufacturers increased by 5 per cent., the labourers by 20 percent., and theThe cost of labour has employees by 100 per cent. In England,, since 1895, the number of the joint-stock companies has been trebled; in fact, the indemen who are likely to come pendent employer is disappearing altogether.. that, in In the State of Massachusetts, from 1885 to 1895, the private employers increased in number by 9-33 per cent., and the corporations or companies by 77 per cent. The fact is that everywhere the same development is noticeable. PerhapsI cannot do better than quote some other figures given by Leroy Beaulieu. He says that in tlie big manufacturing countries with which wer have to compete for every ten men who embark in manufacturing or commercial enterprises, two or three fail totally, five or six manage to make a livelihood, and only one or two make fortunes. Out of 2,554 German companies, the affairs of which were investigated between 1891 and 1892, 471 went into liquidation with deficits, 888 declared no dividends, 641 gave a return of from nothing to 5 per cent., 734 paid dividends of from 5 to 10 per cent., 149 from 10 to 15 per cent., 64 from 15 to 20 per cent., 39 from 20 to 30 per cent., 18 from 30 to 40 per cent., and 21 over 40 per cent. Included among the last of these was the Arenburg Coal Company, of Essen, which paidadividendof 80 per cent. A strike recently took place at their mines, although one would suppose that they could afford to pay good wages. includes the Goetlingen Sugar Company, which paid S3J per cent.; the Marine1 ; and River Transportation Company of Dresden, which paid 100 per cent.; the Upper Silesia AVood Pulp Company which returned 120 per cent. The average obtained by all these companies represented S-S per cent, interest upon their nominal capital, and they paid dividends of 6-1 per cent. In their attitude towards the wages question, manufacturers seem to overlook the industrial evolution that is being pushed on rapidly by the capitalists themselves, not by labour or by labour legislation, butbythecompetitive social system under which we live. The individual employers and smaller companies are rapidly being crushed out. Those who can pay no dividends, and there are a very large number of them, before they disappear attempt to reduce wages, and even if they succeed in this they still have to succumb, because the system under which we live inevitably crushes them out. The evolution goes through various stages. First of all, the individual gives place to the company. Then the companies enter into agreements under which they adopt a list of prices : the same plan is adopted in many countiy towns in Australia. The law of supply and demand goes by the board the moment it is applied to commercial enterprises. There is no such thing in its strict application, and the very people who talk about it do not practise it . Then the companies, in order to keep up prices, restrict production. In Belgium there is an arrangement among some of the cotton manufacturers under which they can order a reduction of the output by one-sixth, in order to keep up prices. They also regulatethe markets by fixing the sphere of influence of certain manufacturers. In many cases also pools are formed for the distribution of trade and the division of profits. The Dynamite Trust, which is formed of English and German manufacturers,, have a pool and divide the trade among the various manufacturers. The agreements among manufacturers in their turn lead to the formation of trusts and combines, which eventually become monopolies. In 1889 there were 353 trusts in the United States, with a total capital of £5,S32;882,842, and in an article in the Revieio of Reviews for May, 1900, it was estimated that the American trusts had a. capital of 10,000,000,000 dols., or more The list also than ten times the amount of the war indemnity paid by France to Germany. The trusts operate in the direction of closing upestablishments and reducing the means of employment. The Whisky Trust, for instance, took over 80 firms and closed them all except twelve, which possessed the best plants, and by which production could bemost economically carried on. The SugarTrust took over 49 firms, and now they carry on only one. Dr. Adam Smith said that certain enterprises could not be conducted by joint-stock companies, and Lord Ulverstone, who knew the difficulties of banking, said the same thing with regard to that class of business. Yet we find that joint-stock banks are crushing all the private banks out of existence. TheEnglish statistics show that the whole of tire conditions of manufacture and commerce are being entirely revolutionized. I contend that strikes are inevitable under the conditions of life in which we live, and that they are increased in' intensity because of the industrial evolution, which leads to the creation of big companies and the separation of the employers from direct contact with the workmen. It is not that the shareholders of the companies are more heartless than others, but the conditions under which manufacturing enterprises are carried on are responsible for the want of consideration now shown towards the workmen. The idea tliat more than a certain rate of wages cannot be paid in any industry , must be entirely set on oneside, because industries cannot be saved unless they can stand in competition. That is the position they are in. They cannot be saved by reductions in wages, as if the men worked for nothing it would not save them. What is wanted is that those who are working under exactly the same conditions shall have equal competition. The gentleman who was at the head of the Pastoralists' Union, in an address sometime ago, desired to make out that if we took' the whole of the results from the woolgrowing industry, they showed that there was a certain wage fund, and that if the workmen took more out of it the effect would be to crush the industiy. In connection with that, I refer honourable members to the illustration I have given, and they will see that, while a profit might be shown on the total of the companies floated in Germany, the case in connection with individual companies was different. They lost, and eveiy investor to-day knows, if he knows anything about the social system, that when he invests in a small concern he is taking big risks of being crushed out. show how the system worked out until we reached the trusts and combines. I regret that I have not had time to deal more fully with that phase of the question, but, perhaps, it is now sufficiently stances, Mr Justice Walker was against known. -change the idea that an individual concern has to be run on the question of whether it can pay, a certain wage or not. The employer takes that risk, and the employee has to have a living wage to enable him to maintain himself and family. He takes the risk of his employment being lost through the employer by whom he is employed being crashed out by the system of trusts and combines which is coming on so rapidly. AVe already have them in Australia, and they will increase here more rapidly now that we have federation than they did before. What we have to do then is to see that conditions are at least equal, and that men are not depressed below a certain point. They have to take the risk of the way in which business works out, and I should like to have dealt with a number of points in connection with that at greater length. : in Committee. leave their consideration until we get into and one or two other cases. It is by no Committee. I did not intend when I began means clear what the legal position is, but to deal specially with the Bill. I think we while the law for thirty years has been held shall save time by postponing a discussion on to be in a certain direction, the Taff Vale the details of the B ill until we get into Committee. The measure is perhaps defective in one or two points. . Some reference was made to-day by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, to the Taff' Vale decision, and I desire to correct an inaccurate statement which was made in that connection, and at the same time to call the attention of the Attorney-General to a particular matter requiring his consideration. It is altogether incorrect to say that we are objecting to having unions made responsible. I was on the deputation that waited upon "" Mr Wise, and I know what the members of that deputation asked. They asked Mr AVise to give effect to what he said was contained in the New South Wales Bill when it was being passed through Parliament. He said that the Compulsory Arbitration Bill protected the funds of the union We have found out in law cases, in which I was interested, that that is not so. We had that point argued by admittedly one of the I had intended to ablest counsel we have, Sir Julian Salomons, and although that gentleman devoted a solid hour to the discussion of the matter, and made out, perhaps, the best case which could be made out in the circumI t is clear now that we must him. I may say that all the legal gentlemen whose opinions I have had on the point agree that the Judge was quite right, and that the section in the New South Wales Act, to which reference was made, does not give the protection to the uniou funds that Mr AVise said it would. IfI mistake not, we have a clause in this Bill which is a copy of that section in the New South Wales Act. If that' is so, the Attorney-General will probably consider that phase of the question, and see whether that clause cannot be so amended as to conserve the funds of the union for the purpose of this Bill. Unless that is attended to, we shall not have the protection of union funds which is necessary for the carrying out of awards under the Bill. This is the position-The registration under this Bill may make some little difference, but in New South Wales a trades union has to be registered as a trades union and also as an indusliable under the Trades Union Act or under the",68,William Mcmillan I T Is Quite Uniform I N Order To Give Fair Play To Indus

404,Mr Spence,"That is so, and I must reading of the law given in the Taff Val.edecision has altered that und leaves the unions at the mercy of any one' who chooses to take out injunctions, and by interfering with them in that way deplete their funds in law expenses. It is not necessary that he should win, but if the intention is to fight the unions, he can deplete their funds. I think that some provision is necessary to secure the protection of union funds. 1 should like to have said a great deal more, but I do not desire to keep honourable members too late, and I shall reserve anything further I have to say until the Committee stage of the Bill. Asu reflection has been cast upon the trades unionists of Australia, I should like to remind the honourable and learned member for Parkes, if he were here, that exactly what we are asking for in Australia in the trades union movement bos been nearly carried in the House of Commons. The proposition made was defeated by only twenty votes, and was remitted to a Royal Commission to take evidence upon it, with a view to having the Jaw laid down. The vote upon the question was 240 against 226, so that honourable members will see that a big voto was taken, and it will interest them to know that Mr Asqurth, the late Home Secretary, voted for the proposition, and also Mr Haldane, who is admittedly a very able barrister. It is, therefore, an unfair statement to make that we are asking for special protection. We do not objectto be liable for acts done by the anions, but we have been made responsible for the acts of people outside the unions, and with whom we have had no connection. That is what we object to. I thank honourable members for the attention they have givon to mo. I think that perhaps I undertook a bigger task than I had time to-night to satisfactorily complete. I should like to conclude by a final quotation which seems to me to express the right spirit. It is from the Honourable M . A . Knapp, Chairman of the Inter-State Commission of the United States, who said in a recent addressShall we continue to enforce with precept and penalty the rule of competition, whose cruet creed is every man for himself, or shall the effort and industry of the world be hereafter conducted on a more humane and fraternal principle ? That is to say-is society stripped of its polished and altruistic pretences; is society, after all, only n mass of struggling brutes, fighting for the best placeB and the biggest bones; and is the Government simply an armed' referee standing by to soo that every dog has fair play? In snort, is personal selfishness the ultimate force arid individual greed the bottom fact. . . . Can we settle the economic questions ? Can we raise the adjourned. wide realm of industry from strife to friendship, from competition to co-operation, from the warring instincts of the savage state to the larger and nobler needs of associated life ? I think we are moving in that direction. The advance may not be very great, but I think it is in tlie right direction, and honourable members will never regret passing this. Bill, possibly with some improvements. I do not expect that it is going to bring about very great changes, or that it will entirely accomplish the main object which it has in view, that of securingpeacefulindustrial conditions. Tho result of such legislation has so far not been to raise wages beyond the rates which fair employers willingly pay. In the same way trades unions have only succeeded in securing wages which the best employers pay without any pressure being brought to bear upon them. The most favorable decisions in New Zealand and New South Wales have had only that effect. Therefore, the employers have nothing to fear. On the other hand, the Bill gives them a great deal, as I could show if I had time to do so. The workers are, in my opinion, taking the greatest risks by accepting the B ill . They surrender privileges for which they have fought hard in the past, and for which many have suffered. They are giving up those privileges into tlie hands of one man If that man is able and fair-as I have no doubt he will be-there need be no fear of the result. But still it is a big thing to do and a great risk to take. The employees are certainly taking greater risks than are the employers. If we consider the general bias and trend of society, it will be apparent that the employers have nothing to lose. It cannot be said that the Judges are drawn from thoso social circles who are generally favorable to labour, though I believe that they are as unbiased as men can be expected to be. But we willingly take these risks, because we know what terrible things strikes are, and we recognise how much more severe they must become in consequence of the trend of industrial evolution, which hands over the control of capital to comparativelyfew persons. Therefore, l a m proud. thattheCommon wealth Parliament is taking a step in this direction. I deny that it is to be regarded purely as an experiment The evidence is that arbitration without compulsion is ineffectual for settling disputes, and that nothing short of compulsion'will secure that industrial peace without which no country can prosper.",71,William Mcmillan I T Is Quite Uniform I N Order To Give Fair Play To Indus
