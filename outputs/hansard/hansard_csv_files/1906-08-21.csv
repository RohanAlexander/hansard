28,"Mr Crouch Asked The Treasurer,","to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow: 1. The average amount o i silver coins issued lo thc Commonwealth, in the fifteen years ended 31st December, 1905, was ^'77,000 per annum. Taking this as a basis for the future, the profit to the Commonwealth will be about ^'38,000 per annum, or, roughly, one-half of the nominal value of silver coins to be issued. This does not take into consideration the profit (if any) to be derived from the withdrawal of the existing coinage, and the substitution of an Australian coinage, neither does it take into account the cost of rehabilitation of gold coinage. The amount of the existing coinage is estimated at from ^'1,200,000 to ^'2,000,000. 2. It is desired to establish a decimal system of money concurrently with an Australian silver coinage, and to facilitate that end, the Imperial authorities were asked on the 10th March, 1905, to arrange for the withdrawal of ^200,000 worth of silver coins per annum. No reply has been received, but the Treasurer during his recent' visit to England learned that the Imperial Government is unwilling to agree to the withdrawal of more than ^109,000 per annum. He found that thc question of silver coinage was one of great interest to several parts of the Empire, and that it was considered advisable that it should be included in the subjects to be submitted to the Imperial Conference which is to meet in London next year. It is hoped that as a result of the Conference the profit on silver coinage will be secured to the Commonwealth on fair terms. It is not clear that as implied in the question any large revenue is being finally lost. net import into Australia of silver coins increases the profit which will accrue to the Commonwealth on the substitution of an Australian for the present currency, if the Imperial Government will agree to withdraw the latter at its nominal value. the Postmaster-General, u f o n notice1. Is he aware that the work of despatching officers is being performed by junior sorters in Sydney? 2. .Is he aware that qualified despatching officers are engaged on much less responsible work? 3. Is it a fact that such work is done by the despatching officers in all States other than New South Wales? 4. Will he see that these officers are installed in the positions to which their grade entitles them ? lowing information has been furnished by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, in connection with questions 1 and 2 : 1. Yes, despatching work is being performed by sorters pending a settlement of the question as to whether despatching officers in mail vans will be transferred to the General Post Office, or forego their title, and remain in their present positions, as some of them desiTe. Action is now in hand which should shortly result in an early settlement of the case. 2. Pending a settlement of the matter referred to in No. 1, despatching officers are engaged at other mail work which is not, however, considered less responsible. The replies to questions 3 and 4 are as follow:3. The practice in the other States is being investigated. 4. See answer to No. 1. senting the Minister of Defence, ufon notice1. Is there any difference between the English examination for tactical fitness to command and the examination now established in the Commonwealth for promotion to the position of Lieut Colonel? . 2. How long has the examination for Lieut Colonel been established in England, and is this examination superior lo or more difficult than that in Australia? 3. Was it necessary for the Inspector-General in England to pass the examination for tactical fitness to command ? honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1. In the Imperial Army there are two alternative syllabi under which officers may be examined for technical fitness for command-i.e. , for promotion to rank of Lieut -Colonel-namel y :The (1) in which actual troops are employed. (2) By means of a staff ride or tour. The examination for technical fitness for command (i.e., for promotion to Lie""ut -Colonel) in the Commonwealth does not provide for an alternative syllabus-the syllabus prescribed being practically a reprint of that prescribed in (1) above referred to for the Imperial Army. Notification has recently been received that a revised syllabus has been adopted for the Imperial Army, which omits one of the subjects of the examination previously in force, but which is still retained in the Commonwealth syllabus. 2. So far as can be ascertained, the examination for Lieut -Colonel was established in England in 1899; the syllabus prescribed is not superior to or more difficult than that prescribed for Australian officers. 3. The present Inspector-General of the Imperial. Forces was promoted to the rank of Lieut -Colonel prior to the coming into force of this examination, and. consequently was not required to pass the examination for technical fitness for command, i.e., for promotion to rank of Lieut -Colonel.

Yes. 2. Yes. The action taken recently was with a view to prevent large expenditure being incurred in taking evidence in Canada, which would be rendered useless if the Court subsequently decided on the point of law that the Minister's valuation under section 160 of the Customs Act is not subject to review. As the case is now before the Court, the direction thereof is necessarily in the hands of the prof essional advisers of the Department.

50,Mr Reid,"Then, as a matter of jussome time would have been afforded for making the people acquainted with it . The history of the proposal is contained in Hansard of the 23rd of July, 1902. When it came before the-Committee, the honourable member for Bland is reported, at page 14,612, to have said-thi s was eighteen months, and not two months, before an electionI should like to know what attitude the Government intend to assume with regard to this clause. I believe there is a very strong feeling against the contingent vote, and I , for one, am opposed to the introduction of any of these fancy systems of voting. As it is probable that at the next Federal election the two Houses will go to the country at the same time, the introduction of the contingent voting system would lead to a great deal of confusion. At the next election the two Houses will go to the countiy at the same time, and, therefore, it is proposed that there shall be two methods of voting adopted in electing the members of the respective Houses. The 'honourable member for Bland continuedI do not know that the object aimed at is of sufficient importance to justify us in unsettling the minds of the electors, and thus, perhaps, disfranchising a very large proportion of them. In certain cases the contingent vote might not attain the object aimed at. If that was so, when eighteen months were available within which to prepare the minds of electors, how much more strongly would the remarks apply now that a new and complicated method of voting is submitted within two months of an election ? electors were advised not to adopt the preferential voting system. Labour Partv in Queensland never would use the preferential system of voting. Queensland, and the electors have exercised the option by not expressing their preference. election, which a large and important party n<3ver takes advantage of, cannot be a good and a proper one. says that it is not a good system. condemned if both sides take the same view and refrain from availing themselves of it. on to sayOn rare occasions, in New South Wales, a candidate has been returned by the votes of a minority; but this has happened to every party in the State, and it is not at all certain that the results would have been altered by the. operation of the contingent vote. In reply to a suggestion that it might be made mandatory, the honourable member said, "" Yes, but that might result in still greater confusion."" The present Minister of Trade and Customs was in charge of the Bill upon that occasion. honourable gentleman leave me alone? that I should mention what was stated by the Minister in charge of the Bill, in reply to the statements of the honourable member for Bland. In regard to a proposal exactly similar to that which is now being suddenly introduced, the Minister made a certain statement. Honourable members know that last session the present Government introduced a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. If they had had the remotest idea of applying a new system of voting, such as that now proposed, to the next election, surely it was their duty to make provision for it in that measure, in order that honourable members and the electors might have the fullest opportunity to accustom themselves to the new idea. The matter must have been considered, because in their first measure they had a series of elaborate provisions relating to the contingent vote. This must be a mere political manoeuvre. I do not think that it has been: conceived by Ministers, because they are merely instruments in the hands of the Age. Ministers are simply moved as that organ dicI n Queeiisland the tates. They are under the direction of two organs, one inside and one outside of the House, and their lot cannot be a very happy one. The Age made a rabid statement as to the necessity for an exhaustive ballot. It represented that It is optional there. the House was frantically eager to It is made optional in pass an amending B ill , and that all sides would welcome such a measure. Then a cold current passed through the political I submit that a system of atmosphere, and that measure was dropped. A demand for the contingent vote is th? next one that comes from that influential quarter. I desire to read what was stated by the Minister of Trade and Customs, who was then in charge of the former Bill, in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. He saidThe honourable member for Bland went In theory the contingent vole appears sound, but the method proposed here is not quite the same as that adopted in Queensland.

58,Mr Reid,"No ; because it is. necessaryand the votes are divided between the two remaining. That is in the case of single electorates. Then he went on to explain the proposal, which was probably the same as that contained in the B ill about to be introduced. He saidThe proposal in the Bill is that if there are four or five candidates, only the last one shall be struck out in the first instance, the votes belonging to the rejected candidate being distributed amongst the others. Then thelowest on the next count is struck out, and so on until only one remains. The system is somewhat complicated, and I took the trouble a day or two ago to work it out with rather astonishing results. He stated furtherI found that it was possible for the candidate who obtained the largest proportion of No. 3 votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of No. 1 votes. son system? which the voters were to be enabled to express their order of preference. proportional voting in connection with the Senate elections. the same. ing it out was very different. the electors to indicate the order of their preference. There was no suggestion of what is called proportionate representation, as apart from the indication of the wishes of the electors on their ballot-papers. complicate elections. avoid some thorny subjects that may otherwise have to be dealt with. with which the honourable and learned member is acquainted. The Minister saidI found that it was possible for the candidate who obtained the largest proportion of No. 3 votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of No. 1 votes, and consequently my faith was very much shaken in the scheme contained in this B ill . I think lhat I accurately gauge the feeling of the Committee when I say' that we ought not to persist in the proposal for the adoption of the contingent vote. And the Government withdrew that proposal. The Ministry, of which the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister of Trade and Customs were members, withdrew the proposal, although there was then time to secure a fair and exhaustive discussion of the principle which it involved.' But now there is a sudden and mysterious intrusion of this question. Can there be the slightest doubt that it has been introduced because the Government believe that it will serve their personal political interests? Do people think that this comet is throwp across the political horizon either to assist the Opposition or to help the Labour Party? Complications are arising in various places, and I say that to bring forward such a vital proposal-at the close of the session, and within a few weeks of the closing of the Parliamenta proposal which the thousands and tens of thousands of electors are supposed to master before the approaching election-is a most sinister act. The origin, of the' proposal itself is sufficient to condemn it. It has emanated No , it was a system under from the office of the Melbourne Age. The exhaustive ballot system was first-projected, but that fell still-born, and now this proposal is put forward. I do not feel disposed to discuss the merits of the question, because I have always recognised some good points in the contingent vote. honourable member's trouble? will listen, he will understand. The argument which was put forward by the honourable member for Bland with reference to the confusion which would inevitably result from the adoption of a new system of voting within eighteen months of an I think this is a Bill to election, becomes irresistible when applied to a proposal which is sprung upon the O r perhaps to kill time, to House and the people of Australia within a few weeks of an election. Has, the Minister of Home Affairs acted upon thi? advice of his officers, who have been I think that there are some assuring us that the 21st November is the earliest date upon which the general elections can be held? Have his officials been consulted as to whether the adoption of these proposals would not have the effect of delaying the elections? A t this stage, perhaps, it is premature for me to seek much information, but I wish to point out that these proposals are sprung upon the electors too late. So far as I can understand, they do not apply to the elections for the Senate. But whether they do or not, the objection to be urged against them is precisely the same.

70,Mr Reid,"If the honourable memberapply to the Senate we shall be introducing two different systems of voting. The electors at the last election-that of 1903became accustomed to placing a cross in a square opposite the name of the particular candidate whom they favoured. If this House adopted the Government proposals within a few weeks of the next election it would place itself in this unfortunate .position: that the representatives of the people, whose duty it is to properly adjust our electoral system long before the elections take place, would expose themselves to a charge of having kept these proposals absolutely in the dark instead of dealing with them when the Electoral Bill was under consideration last session. I repeat that they have been deliberately kept in the dark in order that they might be sprung upon the House under the pressure of certain political exigencies, which are only too manifest. I protest against the remaining time of the session being taken up in their discussion. It is unreasonable to expect the electors to understand them in the short space of time that will elapse before the elections take place, and unless the Government have already got the numbers, and know that they will be able to force the Bill through, it would be folly to proceed with it. would be a matter for extreme regret if we found that, in considering the Bill, we liad sacrificed valuable time, without securing any practical result. of Home Affairs) [3.5] -Al l I have to say in replv to the remarks of the right honourable member for East Sydney is, that the Bill has not been sprung upon the House under pressure of any political exigencv.

The resolution was brought down upon the 14th inst., but we"", dealt with it upon the 15th and 16th inst., and, in view of the fact that the few transactions which took place in the interval involved no complications we think it is only a reasonable concession to date all the duties from the 17th inst., so that whatever changes have been made will all operate as from that date.

Another objection to the duty is that it bears unequally on the States.

The Government, I understand, propose that, instead of there being an absolute duty of ""6d. per gallon, there should be a charge to cover the cost of inspection, which in no case should exceed 6d. per gallon. Sir what I . desire. proposal. H a d the honourable gentleman elaborated the argument, which he based on the figures presented by his Department, he might have shown that the duty is not imposed for revenue purposes, and is open to the objection that it is comparatively small, while it is at the same time unequal in its incidence on all the States. The proposal, therefore, to substitute a maximum charge of 6d. per gallon to cover the cost of inspection is a fair one. The duty of is. per gallon was particularly heavy in relation, to the cost of production and largely interfered with the competition of Australian wines with those of the outside world. That remark will apply, to some extent, to the duty of 6d. per gallon now imposed. If the Minister proposes to reconsider the item in the light of these additional facts, I shall be prepared to support him. would suggest that when the Bill is before us we shall have a fair opportunity to reconsider any question arising out of this matter. to amend the schedule, unless we go into this Committee again.

There is one subject which has been touched on during the debate upon which I particularly desire to express my opinions, and that is the need for increasing our population. The position of the Commonwealth in regard to population is not as healthy as the well-wishers of Australia desire, because for some time past there has not been a material excess of Immigrants over emigrants. In view of the latent possibilities of wealth and production that we possess, the fact that immigrants are not being attracted"" to our shores is one that in vites consideration. I do not think it will be contended that even the older settled States have reached the limits of their possibilities in regard to the support of population. Eveni n Victoria, where there has been a decrease, there are enormous possibilities for the support of a much larger population than the State now possesses.",21,Spirits Viz

100,Mr Brown (Canobolas) [3.32],"The only conclusion to be drawn from the present state of affairs is that the conditions offered to workers here are not inviting, and before we can hope to attract immigrants, we must take means to induce those who are here to remain; because our population is not likely to increase so long as there is a continuous drain of emigrants. To provide a remedy for the present state of affairs, the co-operation of the States must be secured, and I am pleased to know that special attention is being given to the subject by the States authorities. need for a larger population is recognised, and the Titeasurer has promised to second tbe efforts of the States in attracting people to our shores. There are now about 4,000,000 while our national debt is something like £236,000,000, amounting to between £8,000,000 £9,000,000. den of this indebtedness^ we should endeavour to bring about the presence here of .1 larger number of persons to share it, while a larger population is necessary also for the progress and development of the country, and the production of wealth. There a:ie two or three methods by which we might increase our population. might, in the first place, draw upon the coloured peoples of the islands of the< Pacific, as has been done in the past. Chinese were first introduced into Australia to provide cheap labour, whereby production might be increased', and the presence of the Kanakas on, the sugar fields of Queensland is to be accounted for in the same way. . But, whilst there are a number who would like to see Australia developed by these means, the verdict of the Commonwealth is against it, the electors as a whole having emphatically for a white Australia. might be increased, in the second place, by the introduction of pauper labour from Europe. a tendency to debase and demoralise, and the experience of America is not likely to make us ready to follow her example by the introduction not condemn those who are poor, and, no doubt, even in the ranks of the very poor are to be found men and women who, given reasonable opportunities, converted into good citizens. who come to our shores must have energy and grit, and should possess some little means, if they are to make a favorable Mr Brown. start. The honourable member for Darling, when speaking in this debate, quoted a telegram from New Zealand which seems to indicate that that country is having some experience in connection with the introduction of 'paupers. Recognising the need for increasing her population, she has encouraged immigration, but, according to the information put before us by him, immigrants have recently arrived there who had to be provided, on arrival, with clothes and blankets and the means of subThe sistence. I do not think that the people of the Commonwealth wish to draw largely from the pauper populations of the old world, and, particularly, not from the pauper populations of Europe. We should souls in the Commonwealth, prefer people of the race from whicli we have sprung-good' , vigorous!, healthy the annual interest upon it stock, who will be able to help to bear and the burdens of nation building,. We .are, In order to lessen the burhowever, prepared to welcome all desirable immigrants, whether from Great Britain or from other European countries. The present position of stagnation in regard to our population must excite keen consideration. In the view of some honourable members, much of the legislation of New Zealand of recent years has been obWe jectionable because of its socialistic or humanitarian character, but, despite that fact, the population of the colony during the last five years has, according to the statisticians, in creased by 43,000, while the population of the Commonwealth has within the same period increased by only 3,000. I know that a good deal of the New Zealand increase is to be accounted for by emigration from Australia, young men, natives of the State from which I come, and of other States, who have been discouraged and voted become tired in their efforts tb secure emOur population ployment in Australia which would give them an opportunity to make a decent living here, having gone to New Zealand to Pauperism, however, has always better themselves. Generally, they have bettered themselves by doing so, and the encouraging reports which they have sent to their friends have induced of paupers. I do others to follow their example. I find by reference to Coghlan that during the decade from 1882 to 1891, when employment and wealth production were could be not so restricted as at present, we added But those to our population by excess of immigration over emigration 374,094. In the foi-, lcwing decade our gain by the excess of immigration over emigration was only 2,377 --This was a very remarkable fallqualified to express an opinion state that ing off. In regard to this Coghlan saysI f the result of the last twelve years be comhas tended to encourage immigration, and pared, it will be seen that there was an exodus that otherwise New Zealand would have both from Victoria and South Australia, the been in the same state of stagnation as is former losing 145,227, and the latter 23,222 by the Commonwealth. That brings me to excess of emigration, while Tasmania also lost another point. Why do our young men 6,119 from the same source. Whilst people move about from one State having made every effort to better themto another, because they conceive that they selves here, leave for New Zealand and can better their position, no great concern other'parts of the world? I contend that need be felt. The inducements, offered the cause is to be found in the fact that to persons born in a State to leave the natural opportunities that should be it must be very considerable. must not only have a hope, but a plenty of land was available, and our reasonable assumption, that they will be mineral resources could be exploited withable to improve their position, andi we out undue restriction, immigrants were need not begrudge Western Australia an attracted here. Now, however, that most increase of population at the expense of of our lands have passed into the hands the other Slates. But when population is of a few persons, and our mineral relost to the Commonwealth as a wholewhen our people are leaving us to settle polists, it is impossible for the bulk of in New Zealand, South America, South our population to find here a suitable outlet Africa, or the United States-the matter for their energy. becomes very serious.

My contention is that our stagnation in the matter of population is due to the monopoly of the best lands of the Commonwealth. I have compiled a table showing how the lands of New South Wales are held. I have taken my data fiom the latest statistics in the Year-Book of New South Wales, 1904-5, edited by MrH a l l , the Government Statistician. In New South Wales, there are 60,427 holdings qf 400 acres and under, which embrace a total area of 5,500,000 acres. Of this area about 824,000 acres, or about 14 per cent., is cultivated. Of holdings Size of Holding. Holdings. 1 to 400 acres 401 to 1,000 acres. . . 1,001 to 10,000 ... 10,001 and upwards Totals Holdings under 1,000 acres total 69,437, having an area of 11,256,861, representing 5""74 per cent, of area of State; the cultivated area being 1,483,613 acres, equal to 52-32 per cent, of thc area alienated. Holdings of over 1,000 acres total 6,234, having an area of 36,824,443, representing 18-80 per cent, of area of State; the cultivated area being 1,018,243 acres, equal to 6 44 per cent, of the area alienated. One remarkable feature of that table is that 722 holdings embrace about one-half of the total area which has been alienated. A point which is made in this connection is that whilst the number of this! particular class of holdings is decreasing, their area is increasing, thus proving that the monopoly of the land by the few is steadily -growing. -of affairs has been brought about, I would direct attention tb the fact that whereas during the twenty-three years from 1882 to 1905 .18,481,880 acres, the land' in which complete transfers 44,352,613 acres. ing'that period, there were 25,870,000 acres more transferred than were required for Mr Brown. of upwards of 400 acres, and less than 1,000 acres, there are 9,000 holdings, embracing 5,750,000 acres, of which 658,000 He points out, however, that acres are under cultivation. There are 722 holdings which embrace 23,000,000 acres, of which only 300,000, or 1.31 per cent, of the total area, are under cultivation. is . fit for cultivation ? area. Only 1,500,000 acres are devoted to wheat cultivation, in New South Wales, whereas Coghlan tells us that there are at least 20,000,000 acres of land in New South Wales suitable for the growth of that product. Therefore, a large proportion of the best land in the State is still being devoted to pastoral purposes. The table from which I have quoted is as f o llows :Area Cultivated. Number of Total Area Proportion to Alienated. Area ot State. Total Area. Proportion to Area Alienated. Acres. Percentage. Acres.

I should like honourable members to say whether these non-property holders are all thriftless, and make no effort to help themselves.

Indeed, I think I may very properly claim that of the 553,000 persons who do not own property in New South Wales only a very small percentage does not contribute anything towards the creation of the wealth of that State; the manual labour involved in building up the enormous wealth to which I have referred is largely provided by this vast body of non-property holders. The secret of the position is that these men are wage-earners, who are living from hand to mouth, and are helping to create that monopoly of wealth which is concentrated in the hands of the few who are able to take advantage of natural opportunities. This brings me to the question of the development of Canada. Some honourable members have pointed out that the Dominion has been developed on lines that In 1904 there were we ought to follow. Twenty years ago only 250,000 acres were under wheat in Canada, and the yield' from that area was 'about i,2oo_,ooo bushels. InI 9°3-4> however, the total area under wheat had increased to 4,000,000 acres, and the yield was 110,000,000 bushels. 0 0 0 Immigration, meantime, increased in proportion to the increase in the area under cultivation. In 1893, the total number of immigrants to Canada was 10,680, and ten years later-in 1903-thi s number, had increased to 124,653.

For about six months out of every twelve the climate is so severe in Canada that her fertile lands cannot be used, as similar lands in Australia are used, for stock-raising purposes. There the stock-raising industry must be carried on at a cost far greater than is involved under Australian conditions!; the stock cannot be allowed to run at large all the year round, and, therefore, special attention has to be devoted to the cultivation of the soil. The honourable member for Franklin says that land nationalization has not been threatened in the Dominion. I suppose that the honourable member will admit that Mr J. S-. Lark, the Canadian Commissioner in Australia, is am, authority with respect to the lands of the Dominion, and that he is also fairly (familiar with the land laws of Australia. In an address which he delivered some time ago in Sydney, Mr Lark saidIn Canada the Government taxed tlie land, which made it impossible for persons to hold land for speculative purposes, but here they taxed the man on the land. There was a great difference between the two systems. All land should be brought down to its value as a producing clement. As far as he had been able to ascertain, the system followed here was an admirable one for keeping the people off the land. The results of that system bave amply borne out his conclusion. tax a tax on improvements? on Canadian land taxation. ought, to be aware that the Canadian tax is not upon, unimproved land values. the statement of a gentleman who may -fairly be regarded as an authority: on this question. He tells us that in Canada the Government tax the land in such a way that it is impossible for any one to hold it for speculative purposes. Such a tax will prove the solution of the land problem cf Australia. We must not allow persons to invest in land merely for the purpose of holding it for a rise-to secure the unearned increment brought about by increased population and national expenditure.. Land should be held for productive purposes, and every facility should be 'given those who go on the soil to bring it into use. Unfortunately, large areas of our lands are kept out of use, being held purely for speculative purposes. Those who control the, land control the wealth production of the people, with the result that that wealth is unduly concentrated in the hands of the few. I do not think that the honourable member for New England will contend that the 550,000 non-property owners of New South ,Wales are nonworkers. He will not say that they have not contributed to the wealth of the community. I have here a very remarkable letter relating to the industrial conditions at present obtaining in Australia. A little whileago there was a rapid rise in the value of rabbitskins and rabbits for export purposes, with the result that a number of persons, who had been unable for a long time to earn a fair wage, availed themselves of the new avenue of employment thus opened up, and secured handsome returns from the rabbittrapping industry. threw up very good billets. that they might engage in a more lucrative calling. If a man can better himself by leaving his usual employment, he is generally ready to do so. What was the result of the improvement in the rabbit-trapping industry? Many families who had been on the verge of starvation suddenly found themselves able to secure some of the comforts of life, and to live under brighter and happier conditions. Small provincial towns also found that there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation, and small shopkeepers, and others, were thus benefited by the industry. But this state of things did not long continue. Owing to various causes, the price of 'rabbits went down, with the result that several, avenues of employment were closed, and that there was a gradual return to the state of affairs previously prevailing.

The Pastoralists' Union of New Soutli Wales (Industrial Union of Employers), Hoskins' Buildings, Spiing-street, Sydney, i6th July, 1906. Dear Sir,With the advent of the shearing season, the scarcity of shearing labour has become so pronounced that the executive deem it desirable to again call your serious attention to the urgent need which exists for making every possible effort to improve the supply. While emphasising their previous recommendations on this subject, the executive desire to urge that members should also, as far as possible, refrain from entering into fresh contracts for fencing, tank-sinking, & c , and should otherwise reduce casual station work to the lowest limits during the shearing months. The measures which members are asked to adopt for making labour available for shearing purposes, and for increasing the existing supply, are :1. To discontinue rabbit trapping. 2. To reduce contract and casual station work to a minimum during the shearing months. 3. To fill at least one-fifth of their pens with learners. Tn regard to rabbit trapping, the, general feelits present price, I presume to prevent the ing of those who have had experience of the matter is that trapping is not an effective method of destruction, and that therefore in your own interest you should not allow it on your run. You are, however, only asked to disallow it during the months of July, August, and September. It is sincerely hoped that you will carry out these recommendations for the general good, even if your own immediate requirements do not necessitate their adoption. The object of union is to secure concerted action for mutual benefit, and in the present circumstances such concerted action is specially requisite. It should be remembered, too, that the difficulties now being experienced by others are sure, unless coped with, to extend to you sooner or later, and that therefore by assisting your fellow members now, you will be' ultimately benefiting yourself. Yours faithfully, JOHN That letter shows that concerted action is proposed to be taken by those controlling the natural means of production in New South Wales, to limit the opportunities of the great mass of the workers for making a living under the most favorable conditions, so that cheap labour may be secured to the pastoral industry. cheap labour. to have even the shearing rates brought down as low as possible, and the statethe honourable member; but I think that .ment which I have read shows that it is 1,000,000 acres will be required to provide [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget.

Those who hold what the late Mr Seddon declared to be a monopoly in the life-blood of the people are organizing to retain the production of wealth for themselves. It is partly in consequence of these attempts that the wealth of Australia , is in the hands of a few, the mass of the people living from hand to mouth, unable, despite all their efforts, to accumulate. As I have shown, the wealth of New South Wales is ih the hands of 195,800 persons, while 553,500 persons possess no wealth at all. It has been said that the proposal of the Labour Party for remedving this evil state of things by the imposition cf a land value tax is confiscation, and robben. The honourable member for Grampians recognises that the Commonwealth is suffering for want of population, and, to meet the difficulty, proposes that the States should repurchase annually 1,000,000 acres, to be ultimately divided amongst suitable immigrants, and, in the meanwhile, to be leased to the present owners. He suggests that the land be purchased at expenditure of large sums in anticipation of an increase in price. But, before we can make arrangements for possible immigrants, we must devise means for providing our own people with land. In my electorate there are young men, farmers' sons, who know what hard work is, and are not afraid of it, who cannot discover reasonable opportunities for providing themselves with homes. Most of the Crown land of the State has been parted with under conditions which are not creditable to those who have had the control of affairs there, so that only a very limited area is now available, and when any of that area is thrown open, there are almost MAIR, Secretary. as many applicants for it as there are subscribers to a Tattersall's sweep.

Although this is the Budget debate, there are only ten or eleven in the Chamber. [Quorum formed.-\ South Wales in regard to the repurchasing of estates has not been entirely satisfactory. When the Government had power to purchase from those who were ready to sell, it was found that they could not obtain suitable land at reasonable prices, and, with a great deal of trouble, legislation was enacted' giving them the right of compulsory purchase. At least one estate has been purchased under that power, and, while some authorities say that the purchase was a good bargain for the Government, the fact that the whole of the land has not been applied for, notwithstanding the large demand for land in the State, shows, that, it is not as desirable as it might be, while a very unpleasant feature about the transaction is that some thousands of pounds were paid in commission to private agents, presumably to bring about the purchase. An area of 1,000,000 acres per annum would not be enough to meet the requirements of both our own population and' immigrants, and I understand that the honourable member for Grampians now suggests the purchase of 5,000,000 acres. But what would be the state of the land market if 5,000,000 acres were annually being purchased by the Government? cheaper. that would be in contradiction to the general rule that as demand increases it outside of Parliament, even if nothing prices rise. I think that those who own was heard inside the Legislature. land would ask higher prices for it, and therefore those among whom it was subsefor revenue purposes, whereas the Labour quently divided would probably have to Partv propose to attack the bis estates. 1 pay for it at rates which would make their occupation of it unremunerative, or less measure was advocated on other grounds profitable than the occupation of land more than that it would produce revenue, in the remote.

Thus we shall be taxing a value which the owner has not himself created, with the intention of lessening the incentive to invest money in land merely for speculative purposes, and to increase the opportunities of those who desire to get possession of it for the purpose of developing it . Some honourable members object very strongly to the distinction made between large holdings and small ones, but I would point out that the leader of the Opposition was responsible for the introduction of similar legislation into the New South Wales Parliament. The Bill providing for a tax on land values in New South Wales was based upon exactly the same principle that underlies the proposal of the Labour Party, the only difference being that the New South Wales tax is not of a progressive character. It provided for *the exemption of land of an improved value of £ 2 4 0 . and a number of other exemptions were also made. Although we had a very hard fight to get that measure placed upon the statute-lbook, we heard nothing said about confiscation or the unfairness of the exemptions. There are 178,000 land-holders in New South Wales, whereas only 41,000 pay the land tax. According to the latest statistics, it is estimated that the unimproved value of the land in New South Wales is £129,178,000. The land, which is free from taxation under the exemption of £ 2 4 0 , represents a value of £26,280,000 . There are mortgage exemptions amounting to £16,800,000, and conditional purchase balances which are exempted, represent £ 9 , 2 9 8 , 0 0 0, or a total of exemptions amounting to £52.378,000. Yet we heard nothing about would become the inequality of the proposed tax, or of any proposal to confiscate private lands. 1",29,Important Notice To Members

Those who live in the towns do not make the country, but on the other hand the residents in cities look to the country to sustain them. South AusWe tralia has managed to make her postal system pay its way, and I think that the Commonwealth should' work upon similar lines. If our postal revenue is reduced we shall have a smaller amount to return to the States, and so far as Queensland is concerned, I strongly object to the Treasurer'sproposal.

The amount received by New South Wales was £ 6 6 6 , 0 7 2 ; by Victoria, £ 2 9 7 , 8 0 2 ; section, the better it will Queensland, £ 2 4 9 , 3 1 2 ; South Australia, I do not .33:57 5; Western Australia, £ 7 1 , 8 5 6, t < how the Commonwealth can in addition to a revenue of £ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 which was derived from the import duty; and Tasmania, £ 6 9 , 5 5 6 .

For a number of years South Australia has been importing sugar, and consequently its Consequently I fail to see people have been contributing to her revenue to the extent of £ 6 per ton. The same remark is applicable to Western AusI am satistralia and Victoria. Queensland and New South Wales are the only two States which have been exclusively using Australian sugar. When, honourable members examine these figures they will find that the other States have received a considerable amount of revenue from the operation of the Excise duty. That duty is credited to each State, and the bounty is paid out of it. If there had been no Excise duty in operation they would have received so much Jess revenue. It is a matter for extreme regret that some honourable members will continue to assert that Queensland has benefited from the operation of the sugar duties more than has any other State. As a Upon Friday last matter of fact, she has lost more than has anv other State. A t the present time, the retail price of sugar in London is 2d. per l b . ; in Paris, it is 3 d . ; in Berlin, 2^-d.; in Svdney, 2^d.; in Melbourne, from 2^d. to 2 ^ . . ;ir.

Further, I contend that the bounty is not paid by the consumer. If there were no Excise levied, and there were no bounty in operation, the price of sugar would be the same as it is to-day.

That is due to the fact that before the advent of Federation the production o£ that article had overtaken local consumption.

Queensland has received £ 4 1 , 0 0 0 less than her three-fourths, whilst Tasmania has gained. money has not been spent in Tasmania. that honourable members must recognise that, having regard to the large amount of revenue that Queensland is losing, she will not be prepared to agree to any increased expenditure. two questions relating to the sugar industry. According to the Budget, something like £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 has been provided for the deportation of Kanakas, and I should like to know what is the source of the information obtained by the Treasurer that Queensland has only some £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 available for this purpose. Where has the money gone? I trust that the deportation of Kanakas will Ix facilitated as much as possible, and that it will be conducted on humanitarian lines. Kanakas who have married white women, and, have children attending our public schools, are not, I understand, to be deported. It would be unwise to separate those men from their wives and children, ibut those having no ties in Australia, ought certainly to be deported. The Kanakas who have married and settled down do not, as a rule, work on the sugar plantations. For fhe most part they have taken up small plots of ground in the neighbourhood of towns, and earn a livelihood as gardeners, wood-carters, and so-forth. The Queensland Government, through their officers, are taking steps to see that the work of deportation is facilitated as much as possible, and through their officers are giving every assistance to the CommonweaMi. Another question associated with knock a fact into a head like the sugar industry relates to the wages paid to the white workers. During the last year great trouble has been experienced owing to the refusal of the sugar planters, who are enjoying the benefit of the protection which the Commonwealth has afforded their i ndustry, to pay a reasonable wage. I refer more particularly to those carrying on operations in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg, where the men refused to labour in the cane-fields unless they received a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. All that they asked was that they should receive 30s. a week and their keep. Notwithstanding that these planters have been enjoying a protection of £ 2 a ton, they refused what to my mind was a most reasonable demand. Next year, under the amending Act, they will receive a benefit of £ 3 per ton, and if they still refuse to concede the fair demands of the men, I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will take That is because the the matter in hand and insure the payment of reasonable wages. Any one who has visited the sugar-growing district's of Queensland will admit that 30s. a week and rations constitute only a fair remuneration for working in the cane-fields. I do not think that that work is exceptionally I wish now to refer to one or severe, but having regard to the hours of employment, the wage for which the men in the Bundaberg district struck is a very reasonable one. As long as the growers are receiving t!he protection afforded them under Commonwealth legislation, they ought to be prepared to pay reasonable wages. As a matter of fact, the sugar bonus was granted to enable them to employ white men at a fair wage. We do not desire that strikes should occur; but next year, when the Kanakas have to go, difficulties are sure to arise unless we have",32,Important Notice To Members

[5.25] -The debate on the Budget last year centred chiefly round the necessity for taking over the States debts. As I then devoted some attention to the question, and have since been deeply interested in it, I avail myself of the present opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on the steps he has taken to make it a live one in Australia. I wel 1 remember that during the Federal campaign many men-and I was among, the number-were attracted by the statement that the Commonwealth would be able to take over the debts of the States, and thus secure an immense saving to the people. About that time, Mr no w SenatorWalker, who was a member of the Convention, wrote a very able paper pointing out the benefits which would accrue to the people of the Commonwealth by the conversion of the States"" debts into 3 per cents. He showed very clearly that in that way immense savings would be effected, and that is what the people of Australia have long been expecting. ing such savings was strongly emphasized in New SouthW a l e s b u t I think that until the right honourable member for Swan assumed office as Treasurer, this question was not thoroughly grappled with. these circumstances, therefore, that I desire to congratulate him upon having made this subject his own. The right honourable gentleman went to England and interviewed' not only the governors of the Bank of England, and those of other banking institutions doing business with Australia, but also Lord Goschen, and the Under-Secretary of the Treasury, all of whom advised him that a scheme for taking over the debts of the Commonwealth could be carried out with advantage to Australia, but that no hastv step should be taken. They pointed out that whilst we should be readv to avail ourselves of a favorable market, we should continue for some time in the old groove. I certainlv think that the Treasurer will not do justice to himself or to this question if he follows in detail the advice tendered by these gentlemen, since they are for the most part financially interested in the continuance of the existing system. Some of them are connected with institutions and firms which have been in the habit of making a profit of i i per cent, by underwriting the loans of the States; they have derived a large revenue from the management of our public debts, and have also done business in our stocks with trustees. They have practically monopolized the whole of the financial business of Australia, and in these circumstances, we should hardly expect them to enthuse over a system under which the States' debts would practically be taken out of their hands, and converted into 3 per cent, permanent stocks. Lord Goschen, who was consulted by the Treasurer, dealt more successfully than did any other Chancellor of the Exchequer last century with the public debt of England, so that his advice was well worth obtaining. It must be remembered, however, that he is a statesman, and that the scheme which he fathered in connection with the public debt of England was in all probability propounded by the permanent Secretary to the Treasury, and that the view of that gentleman would be of even greater value to us. Financial Secretary to the Treasury. right honourable gentleman had an interview with Sir Edward Hamilton, the The possibility of effectFinancial Secretary to the Treasury. That gentlemanadvised him to convert the debts as they f a l l due. Several schemes have been put by honourable members before the Committee, each of which It is in contains this objectionable proposal to convert or take over the debts as they f a l l due. The honourable member for Koovong takes great credit for a scheme which, in my opinion, is most objectionable. He provides, in the first instance, for the creation of a council of finance. That goes without saying. But he proceeds to suggest that they must take security, have power to receive revenue from the railways, to hypothecate the railways, or to establish floating charges over them. In my opinion, those proposals spell the defeat of the scheme. I shall oppose any scheme which throws doubts on the value of the security given to our financial accommodaters in England, and proposes a lien upon the assets of the States.

145,Mr Henrywillis,"I read that thethem to give security for deficiencies. That is objectionable. The honourable member for Canobolas has stated that the States, taken separately, are as good a security as is the Commonwealth, and, in the abstract, he is correct. Mr Coghlan has told us that the people of Great Britain will require some inducement for the conversion of their present stocks to Commonwealth stocks. They know that the States lean on each other at the present time. But, although the people of the Commonwealth are the same as the people of the States, when the debts of the States have been taken over by the Commonwealth they will be controlled by one authority instead of by six. According to the Treasurer, there is a feeling in England that, therefore, the Commonwealth security will be better than the preJune, 1904, represented £190,564,859. sent States security, and that, if it were made permanent, holders of States stock might be induced to invest in 3 per cent. Commonwealth stock, for which all the States, strong as well as, weak, would be responsible. and don version might be brought -about easilv. readily, and effectively. I see through this problem without difficulty, and have a scheme which I consider preferable to any yet brought forward. It embraces the best features of the Treasurer's scheme, as every scheme must, because he proposes to take over the whole of the debts, though he would do so in two processes, while I should do it in one. existing debts could not be taken over without an alteration of the Constitution. is so. I shall deal with that matter more fully later on. In Mr Coghlan's very valuable paper are the. germs of many schemes. The principles of the scheme pf the honourable member for Mernda are in that paper, as are also those of the honourable member for Kooyong, which is a very amateurish scheme, that is, a scheme, which would occur to an amateur. I cannot see that there is much in the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda which is not to be found in Mr Coghlan's paper. He desires security in regard to future debts, and even goes the length of suggesting that we shall spend the money of the States, and have a lien over reproductive works. He would create a board with power to say when the States should borrow and when they should not. But what State would consent to go cap in hand and with bended knee to an authority of that kind for permission to borrow? These schemes are not sound enough. There is much more in that of the Treasurer than in either of them. The scheme of the honourable member for Mernda differs from that of Mr Coghlan in that the latter has shown what might be done with the debts up to 1904, while the honourable member for Mernda has worked out his calculations for the period ending 1905. A similar sinking fund scheme is in operation in England, and even in New South Wales, in regard to several services, -so that it is not new According to Mr Coghlan, the Australian loans outstanding on the London register on the 30th That sum is 82.61 per cent, of the total debt of Australia, the remaining 17.39 P cent., or £40,128,012, being on er the Australian register. During' the next forty-five years many millions of loans will In my opinion, that is so, fall due annually,' and that fact has,' no doubt, induced the Treasurer to take the matter in hand. He has done so because he takes broad views of large questions. He was the first to open up satisfactory communication between Western Australia and the eastern States, while in Western Australia he carried out a magnificent system of water supply which enables the tens of thousands of persons living in the arid gold-fields districts to draw their water practically from the Perth. The carrying out of that scheme shows him to be a man of far-sighted ideas, who is not afraid to face great problems. He has now an opportunity which will not come again in our time. By converting the debts of Australia, he can bring about a saving of millions pf pounds by reducing the rates of .interest-. Mr Coghlan points out that when the debts are converted at par at a charge for interest of 3 rper cent, per annum,;the saving to Australia within the period in which the present loans will expire will be £1,375,000 per annum. Between 1907 and 1911 the saving will be £273,000, and between 1912 and 1916 £390,000, and it will go on increasing during a period of forty-five years until it reaches the amount I have stated. We are now being asked to face a great problem which has hitherto been kept in the back-ground. A man may well make a big reputation by dealing successfully with it.",34,Important Notice To Members

Each of the States which, whilst they were languishing, issued loans at a high rate of interest should receive the full benefit derived from the conversion of their stock and the 'reduction of the rate of interest. It appears that the Treasurer has been advised that a favorable time for the conversion of the States loans into Commonwealth stock would be when a considerable amount of States stocks are witliin a reasonable period of maturity, and that the stocks, when converted should be called Australian consols. That is suggested by the brokers, who desire to have further opportunities of reaping a large reward. They say, "" Don't convert the stocks until the loans are due."" financing.

It is further proposed that the States should pass Acts making a permanent appropriation for the payment of interest on the loans. That is a proper provision to make to safeguard the Commonwealth. It is desirable that an Appropriation Act should be passed for the payment of the balance of interest without any hypothecation, and without the Commonwealth having to act as a pawnbroker, as suggested by the honourable member for Koovong, or without resorting to the plan proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, namely, that loan proposals should be submitted to a board, and that any shortage in the interest payBut that would not be ment should be made good by the appropriation of revenue derived from reproductive public works payable to a receiver.

Western Australia is a comparatively young State-he r present Constitution has not been in existence for more than fourteen! years. She has a population largely composed of adult males who have gone over from Victoria, New South Wales, and other States, and have left their wives and children behind them. These adult males consume a much larger proportion of highly dutiable goods than do their wives and children and other relatives, who are in the eastern States. An Honorable MEMBER -The excess of adult males over the other elements in the community is gradually being diminished in Western Australia. quently, the rate of revenue per head will decrease, and gradually come down to the level of that derived in the other States. In mv opinion, the time has arrived when the bookkeeping provisions and the Braddon section of our Constitution should be terminated, so that every State may be benefited by improved conditions of trade. It has been said that New South Wales and Victoria benefit the most from Federation, because goods which are consumed in other States of tihe union are required to pass through them Why is that so? Do not the people of the other States obtain their goods cheaper in tihat way ? If those goods reached them direct, as they did formerly, they would be called upon to pay more for them. My proposal is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the States debts, and convert them into 3 per cents. The Commonwealth stocks, being of that denomination, public opinion in the States would furnish a guar[109]2 12 antee against outside borrowing on their part at higher rates of interest. I hold that any State which required to raise money should come to the Commonwealth for it. It would be to its advantage to do so, because it would thereby obtain it ai 3 per cent. Of course, a sinking fund would be established, and that provision would make the security of the Commonwealth more acceptable to the investors in England. I think that the Commonwealth should take ""over not only the States debts which ' were contracted prior to Federation, but those which have ThenI should since been incurred, and I am of opinion that all future loans required by the States should be raised by the iCommonwealfch. to ask the Commonwealth to raise loans for them ? embargo should be placed upon them in that connection. It is idle to urge that the States would be able to extravagantly float loans, seeing that tfhe interests of the same people would be concerned, and that they would be closely safeguarded by the same press, which would act as a watch dog. They would not be permitted to ask for money recklessly. Public opinion would prevent that. inember call the press a watch dog? press is a most valuable institution. If it were not for it, the people would be absolutely ignorant of the. events daily transpiring throughout the world.

The scheme I suggest would be similar -to that under which the Irish land purchases are being carried on, and the local governments of the United Kingdom are working, or practically the same as that adopted in New South Wales and other States in regard to the conditional purchase of land. With regard to tbe Northern Territory of South Australia, I think that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but that the Commonwealth should be responsible only for the loan money actually expended in its development, upon which it should pay South Australia interest at the rate of 3 per cent., another 1 per cent, going towards a sinking fund for the extinction of the debt in about sixty years. I have never declared myself in favour of the Western Australian railway, and shall not do so until I have consulted my constituents on the subject. In mv opinion, however, if the State of Western Australia is really anxious for the construction of that line, it should bear half of any loss arising from its construction, the other half being borne by the Commonwealth, which, as the railway would be of use for. strategical purposes, should also pay £ per cent, on the cost to establish a sinking fund for the liquidation of the debt. tralia? 1 the people of South Australia are opposed to the construction of the line, I do not know that they should be forced to bear any loss which may accrue therefrom, though, if there were a gain, the State should certainly share in it, as it runs through her territory. ber apply the same principle to the main trunk lines of the other States? proposed railway from Oodnadatta to the South Australia border is concerned, that would be purely a State undertaking; but if it became a white elephant through the taking over of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth, it would be the duty of the Commonwealth to connect with the South Australian border the railway from Pine Creek, and the cost would, of .course, be chargeable amongst the people of the various States, per head of population, as new expenditure. In conclusion, T h a t would my proposal is that the Commonwealth shall take over all the debts of the States to date, converting them at 3 per cent, at par, or at any additional sum that may be required, per cent, to be paid as a sink1 ing fund for the liquidation of the debt within a certain period, which would be extended a little if the conversion were effected below par. I propose that the bookkeeping system should terminate within the next twelve months, as is provided for by the Constitution. When it terminates, we shall have Inter-State free-trade. It is unthinkable that there should be Federation . without Inter-State free trade. There would have been no union in the United States, had it not been for the clamour of the public for that boon, ancl the late Sir Henry Parkes, when he stumped the country in favour of Federation, gave as; one of the burning reasons for the movement the desirabilitv of doing away with the barriers between the States. The bookkeeping keeps barriers in existence, everv export and import being credited and debited like the transactions of a small retail establishment in a most vexatious and expensive manner. I would also wipe out the Braddon section, ancl give to the States a uniform allowance of 2s. 6d. per head of population. I would provide for the repealing of the Braddon section at the same time as the amendment of the Constitution, to give the Commonwealth power to take over the debts of tbe States practically to date. The debts having been converted, ' I propose that the States should borrow through the Commonwealth at 3 per cent., with a sinking fund of i per cent. There would, of course, be a certain amount of expenditure incurred in the raising of loans. Even Great Britain has to bear incidental expenses in this matter. This expenditure might slightly increase the period necessary for repayment, which would be a little over sixtv years. There can be no question S o far as the that money could be raised at 3 per cent., and that our stock would be popular in the market. That there should be a Commission to manage our financial operations goes without saying. A Commission of the kind is in existence for controlling the Irish land expenditure, in connection with which £100,000,000 is involved, together with £i2;ooo,ooo for bonuses to landowners.

Personally, I should prefer to ask the people to adopt a scheme such as I have outlined.

Our boasted surplus .of revenue has practically reached vanishing point. If we paid to the States all that is due to them by us, we should no longer have any money to spare. Our expenditure is increasing out of all proportion to our income. I do not know who is to blame for this, but it seems to me that our present outlook is a particularly dismal one. Of course, I know that some honourable members argue that we should not be called upon to pay the States for the transferred properties-that a mere bookkeeping entry would meet all the necessities of the case.

The question of providing old age pensions was that upon which the Barton Ministry gained a majority at the first election. But, though five years have since elapsed, no serious attempt has teen made to establish any such system. Now, because an agitation has been promoted by business persons in favour of the adoption of penny postage, the Government propose to sacrifice a revenue of from £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 lo £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually.

236,Sir John Forrest,"Then we had betaltogether too sensifive to criticism. I say that there is plenty of scope for a Treasurer who has the courage to tackle the land question. The other night the honourable member for Grampians outlined a scheme, which he has since elaborated, for the purchase of some 5,000,000 acres of land at a cost of £25,000,000. There is a good deal to be said in favour of that scheme if any system could be applied to the purchase of the land which would prevent it jfrom being rushed up to boom prices owing to the large demand for it. What a farce it isi to plead to people in other parts of the world to settle in Australia if we have not fhe necessary land to offer them? Of course, we have abundance of land in Australia, but, unfortunately, it is held by very large holders. It would be cruel to tempt immigrants to \ come here upon the mere chance that they would be able to secure land, when we know that at every meeting of the Land Boards there is an average of from thirty to fifty applicants for a single block. orable member want to do? such scheme as that which has been suggested by the honourable member for Grampians, there should be a system of compulsory purchase, which would enable applicants to obtain land at a fair value. Every common-sense land-holder will admit that the sheep at present upon our large holdings must give place to men. The large holdings must give way to smaller ones, for we must have closer settlement if we are to have a population worthy of Australia. within the control of the States Parliaments. right honourable member knows full well that several of the States are cursed with Constitutions under which only two out of seven have a voice in the election of members to the Upper House. In the State which I represent, legislation dealing with vested interests is blocked from time to time by eighteen gentlemen in the Legislative Council who do not really represent the wishes of the people in this regard. As long as this state of affairs continues Australia will not make much progress, and it is with a view to secure a remedy that the Labour Party has suggested the imposition of a land tax on lines similar to those of the tax prevailing in New Zealand, which has done much to burst up large estates there. I wish now to say a word or two about the consolidation of our debts. I see no particular virtue in the proposal that we should at once take over the whole of the indebtedness of the States, nor do I see any special virtue in the contention that if we do not take over the whole of the debts we must at least take over an equivalent portion from each of the States, irrespective of whether they desire us to do so or do not. tion under the Constitution. and I agree with the Treasurer that we should seek an amendment of the Constitution: which will enable the Commonwealth Government to take over the States debts as they approach maturity. When this is done, an understanding must also be. arrived at that the States shall borrow only through the Commonwealth. We must have control over their borrowings. Unless we do so, the moment we relieve them of responsibility in respect of their present indebtedness they will evince a strong tendency to indulge in further borrowing. The Commonwealth is entitled to take special credit for the fact that, although it has been in existence for nearly six years, it has not yet borrowed one penny. We have constructed out of revenue a great many works for whicli prior to Federation provision vvas made out of loan moneys. WhilstI admit that our expenditure in this direction is deducted from the surplus returnable to the States, I am satisfied that the effect of this system has been most beneficial. It has caused us to hasten slowly in increasing our expenditure, and it has had also a wholesome effect in another direction, since a State Treasurer is not so ready to urge the construction of various works when he knows that they must be provided for, not out of loan funds, but out of revenue. I am somewhat disappointed that the Treasurer has not yet indicated an intention on the part of the Government to bring in a. Bill relating to, banking. It seems to me that a Federal banking law is even more urgently required than is the adoption of a uniform system of penny postage. It is monstrous that if one draws a cheque for £ 1 on a South Australian branch of a banking institution, it costs him is. to cash it in Melbourne.",45,Willis W H Y Was That He Suggested A Term Of Twenty Years

258,Mr David Thomson,"That statementcarrying their lives in their hands-were enabled to acquire property. The honourable member does not propose to take the land from them in a fair manner; he does not propose that the States, shall acquire it at a fair valuation. He and his fellow members of the Labour Party seek to impose a crushing land, tax, and thus land-owners to sacrifice their property. I propose to give a brief example. In the State of Tasmania there are one or two persons who own £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of land, and who, under the State. land tax, pay nearly £ 2 0 0 per annum. If the proposals of the Labour Party were carried into effect, this taxation would be increased by £ 4 0 0 , and therefore, taking into account other taxation, these land-holders would have to pay to' the State and the Commonwealth nearly £ 8 0 0 per annum, or almost half of the annual value of their properties, which amounts to about £ 2 , 0 0 0 . I need hardly point out that such taxation would mean absolute ruin to land-holders. No man could pay it and meet his other expendifure, too. The object of the Labour Party is to compel the large land-owners to throw their land on the market. Buti f , as the result of this crushing taxation, the large landholders found themselves unable to live, and their land were all thrown on the market, there would be practically no buyers, as the market would be glutted. As a result, confidence would be shaken, men would not be able to sell or to borrow on land, and the small holders would suffer with the large. The Labour Party, with a large amount of cunning, if I may use the term, though I allude not so much to the members of this House as to those responsible for the propaganda, are saying to the small land-holders, "" Do not be a f r a i d ; we shall not touch you. Our wish is to get at the big men. By making them pay this large burden of taxation, we shall be able, to get revenue for the establishment of an old-age pension system."" the old-age pension system is established, and that this crushing taxation has had the desired result of getting rid of the large land-holders, what must happen? large land-holders, the descendants of the men who pioneered Australia, having, gone, the money necessary to pay for old-age pensions must be found by the small landholders. struck first; but, as sure as God made little apples, the small land-holders will be struck later on. The injustice which is proposed to be done is to be suffered, not by aboriginals or by coloured aliens, but by the descendants of the pioneers of Australia, and for this, among other reasons, I do not think that fhe scheme of the Labour Party will commend itself to the spirit of fair play which animates most Australian to compel these Unfortunate breasts, just as it will not be acceptable to the intelligence of our people. The resumption of private estates by the Commonwealth, or by the Governments of the States, is another matter. Such resumption is already provided for by the Acts of some, of the States, and a Bill is now before the Tasmanian Parliament which will allow the purchase of private estates at their assessed annual value, plus 5 or 10 per cent, for enforced sale. This, in my opinion, is not too large an allowance, in view of the associations and ties whicli bind land-holdersi to their properties. I , as a fair-sized land-owner in Tasmania, would not object to the honest purchase by the Government of land thought to be required for the settlement of small holders upon the soil; but I say emphatically that the system of wholesale confiscation and robbery proposed by the Labour Party ought not to commend itself to the people of Australia. Coming now to the Treasurer's Budget, I wish first to refer to the sugar bounty question. When legislation for the establishment of a White Australia, was introduced into the House, the honourable and learned member for Parkes and myself were the only two members in an assembly of seventy-five who dared to oppose it . I well remember the jeers and unpleasant remarks with which our action was greeted. A little later, when the Sugar Bounty Bill was introduced, as we were told, a neces; sary corollary to the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, some half-dozen members opposed it. Under these circumstances, it is pleasing to me to know that the Treasurer, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for North Sydney, has had to tell Suppose, however, that the Committee that we must soon seriously consider the position. as that.

The right honourable gentleman was a member of the Barton Government, and is therefore responsible for the White Australia legislation and the original Sugai The large land-owners may be Bounties Act.

Australia at the present time is producing as much as she can consume, or perhaps a little more. So many white growers have been induced by the bounties wrung from the people of the States, who have no interest in the matter, to enter upon the cultivation of cane, that the production of sugar has grown enormously, and I should like to know what will be done with the probable future surplus. Thanks to what I may call this cursed system of protection which has grown up in Australia, under which industries are fostered on the plea that we in the sugar industry production has overtaken, or is rapidly overtaking, the local consumption, and within a very short period we shall be exporting sugar to other parts of the world for consumption by negroes, Chinamen, and other aliens. Further, in all probability, this sugar will be sold at a lower price than that, ruling in our own market. whether it is worth our while to continue a system under, which our own people have to pay very dearly for the production of sugar for the benefit of the people outside the Commonwealth. We need only look to the example of Germany. Some years agp, it was thought that it would be a fine thing to encourage the manufacture of beet sugar in that country, and a system of bounties wag introduced which resulted in sugar being sent to London and sold at one half the price realized in the local market. Three or four years ago, however, the system broke down. could stand it no longer, and conferences were held with the result that it was decided to do away with the sugar bounty. Does not this show that the Treasurer was perfectly correct when he stated that we soon should have to seriously consider the question of abolishing the sugar bounties. Mr R. payment of the bounties has been renewed for a further five years. bability, they will be paid for that period. The subject, however, is one that the people of Australia should take seriously to heart.

The people of Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia, although they have no direct interest in the sugarindustry, are being called upon to subsidize it for the benefit of Queensland. Yet we get no thanks from the representatives of that State, and I think that the sooner the sugar bounties are done away with, the better. Had we been met with some gratitude, we might have been willing to bear the burden. grateful. must assist our own people, ber for Capricornia did not show much gratitude. The Treasurer indicated that he intended to relieve Tasmania of the annual charge of £ 5 , 6 0 0 hitherto contributed by that State fowards the cost of carrying on the cable service between Tasmania and the mainland. I have not asked that this should be done, but in view of the sacrifices that Tasmania had been called upon to Then we shall have to consider make, I confess that the proposal is only a fair one. The Treasurer also told us that prior to Federation, Tasmania contributed £ 6 , 0 0 0 per annum towards the subsidy for the mail service between that State and Victoria, and that shortly after Federation had been established, an improved maif service was brought into operation, when the subsidy was increased to £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. He mentioned, further, that New South Wales enjoyed the advantage of a mail service to the South Sea Islands, and that the subsidy payable in .connection with it was charged to all the States uponThe German people a -per capita basis. It seemed to him, therefore, that in view of the similarity pf the circumstances, Tasmania should no longer be called upon to bear the cost of the increased subsidy, but that the amount should be met by a per capita contribution: by the States. I should like to know whether this proposal has been brought forward mania happens to occupy a position in the Cabinet, or whether it has been introduced in view of the general elections, and of the fact that in Tasmania, there is a deep-rooted dislike to the present A d ministration. Is this merely a "" sop to Cerberus ""-a n effort to placate the people of Tasmania? If not, I should like to know why, bearing in mind the fact that Tasmania has for some years borne her proportion of' the cost of the mail service 'between Sydney and the South Sea Islands,",48,Willis W H Y Was That He Suggested A Term Of Twenty Years

For some years past, I have been systematically libelled in a certain newspaper, known as the Melbourne Age, which has charged me wfth having expressed views in favour of creating a state of misery amongst the Australian people. Certain alleged quotations from publications of mine have appeared in that newspaper year after year, with the same vile insinuation attached to them. This morning I took up a copy of the Age, and in it I found certain alleged quotations from a book which I publishedI think tliirty-one years ago-calle d ' Five Free trade Essays. These quotations are given in the Age as quotations which were used at a recent meeting. The first passage reads as follows: Will it not be time enough to manufacture everything for ourselves when we can save, instead of lose, by the operation? Will it not be well to reap the advantages of pauper labour until we are so great a nation that we can create essavs. pauper labour of our own? The article in the Age saysThat quotation, cited as it was in the course of a strong argument about Australia, aroused quite an excitement, and Mr Cock challenged bis opponent with having quoted Mr Reid unfairly. He denied that Mr Reid ever wrote such words. The challenge was at once accepted. As to the accuracy of the quotation made by Mr Haekeld, there is not the slightest doubt. The passage appears in Mr Reid's volume of "" Free trade Essays,"" a copy of which any one can obtain at the Melbourne Public Library. But this is not the only passage that proves these shocking ideas to have been definitely held by Mr Reid. That book was written twenty years ago; but he said in the Federal Parliament, on 31st October, igoi, as recorded in Hansard, page 6,800, volume 5, something that is of the same identical significance. That is to say, the similar "" shocking It is idle for you to ideas-."" The article continuesHe was speaking on the Tariff, and used these words :"" How. are we going to compete with these underpaid sweated countries until our own labour is underpaid and sweated too? . . . It seems to me that the prospect of growing these noxious weeds of sweated industries on this bright continent should cause a man associated with the interests of labour to shudder. In the plenitude of time, when our millions become tens of millions, we shall have a crop of misery which will solve the difficulty in regard'to cheap manufactures."" Here are two different utterances, many years apart, both embodying the same idea. Mr Reid looks forward to the time when Australia is to have sweated pauper labour. It is a goal he is working up to, as the precursor of Australian manufactures. Honourable members can see that there is an imputation of a wicked, deliberate design on my part to carry out a public policy which will involve the masses of the Australian people in want and misery. In the most heated political controversies between free-traders and protectionists in Australia, I clo not think that any free trader has ever imputed to any protectionist such deliberate wickedness, and I do not believe that any protectionist has ever imputed to any free-trader such deliberate wickedness. But this imputation of a wicked design to see my' fellow human creatures involved in misery is being repeatedly made in Victoria for an obvious purpose. I never dreamed that the wickedness of my opponents would go so far as to forge a quotation from my writings by taking words out of a sentence in order to substitute for them other words, which would convey a wicked idea which was certainly not conveyed in the free-trade I have never taken the trouble to verify these quotations, in spite of all these wicked attacks. But the statement in fhe Age to-dav that a copv of these Essavs was obtainable at the Melbourne Public Library led me for the first time to test the accuracy of these alleged quotations from tihat publication. I found",50,Edwards Th E Term For The Merely Because A Representative Of Tas
274,Mr Reid (East Sydney) [9.7],"Ithat the ibook had been removed from the Parliamentary Library, but there is a copy in the Melbourne Public Library, and I have that copy before me. NowI wish to invite the attention of honourable members, and of tihe people of Australia, to the conduct which is being pursued towards me in reference to these quotations. mon the publisher of the Age to the bar of the House? I desire now to refer to page 66 of my Five Free-trade Essays. These are the two sentences to which I refer: Will it not be time enough to manufacture everything for ourselves when we can save, instead of lose, by the operation? That sentence is correctly reproduced by the Age. Then the Essay continues:W ill it not be well to reap the advantage of the pauper labour of other countries until we are so great a nation that we have pauper labour of our own. I was there* alluding to the inevitable result which, unhappily, has attended the growth of nations from time immemorial. It is recognised that the more the millions expand the more, unfortunately, is the amount of human suffering that seems to exist, and fhat in young, sparsely-settled communities which have large natural resources to draw upon, there is not as a rule that state of misery which exists in other countries which count their millions crowded on a low and compact small area. What do I find? That the wordshave pauper' labour of our own have been taken out of the sentence in the form in which it has been reproduced by the Age, and other words have been inserted to convey the wicked idea that I desired to create fJhat misery, this pauper labour. Whereas the Essay from which the Age professes to quote says:until we are so great a nation that we have pauper labour of our own. the alleged quotation appearing in that journal isuntil we are so great a nation that we can create pauper labour of own own. It is this wicked forgery of my words, in order to impute to me deliberate wickedness in the sense of creating human misery, against which I protest. The imputation is exactly the same as would be conveyed if one person, in speaking of a man who had a disease, had his words twisted to mean that he ihoped he would have a [no] disease. It is like altering a statement that a man has a cancer so as to make it appear that the hope was expressed that a cancer would be created. That fairly illustrates the difference between these two statements. Poverty, old age, or misery i,s a misfortune which attributes no wickedness to any one, but when a man speaks of creating misery and misfortune he expresses a wicked, deliberate design. We have such a perversion of words in this case. The word ""have"" has been omitted, and the words ""can create"" have been inserted. Was ever a meaner or viler act of trickery or villainy known in the public history of this country? But the matter does not rest there. In the very sentence preceding the two I have mentioned, the sense in which I made that reference is shown. That sentence runs in these termsAre manufactures so prodigious a blessing, and the high wages which prove unfavorable to their extension so heavy a curse, that we should con-' trive to tax, worry, and depress the free energies of the people to promote the one at the expense of the other? 0 To promote manufactures at the expense of high wages! The whole of my argument throughout this essay was that we can never hope, under present conditions, to compete on equal terms in the markets of the world with industries in other countries which employ pauper labour. Instead of regarding fhe conditions of Aus1 tralian prosperity as a curse, I was seeking to battle to preserve those conditions in the development of the natural industries of the country. The whole of this work is a laboured argument, intended to show that in the interests of the working masses -in the interests of high wages and short hours of labour-w e should do better by developing our great natural resources than we should do in competing with 1 slop-makers in the over-crowded countries of Europe. As a matter of fact, no one knows better than does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-as the' result of the work he has undertaken in connection with' the sweating evils of Melbourne-that the worse instances of sweating arise from the competition in the making of cheap clothes with the cheap productions of countries that have an overcrowded population. tention. state of things not as an evil which I",51,Edwards Th E Term For The Merely Because A Representative Of Tas

I addressed myself to that question in order to see whether there was any reasonable prospect' of our ever meeting these overcrowded countries in the fields of open competition. I discussed the question of raw material: If we obtain cheap raw material, every other nation obtains it. . I discussed the question of improved machinery : If we secure improved machinery, every other nation must obtain it. Then, too, I discussed the price of money, and pointed out that it is not only very unlikely, but that it would be a sad thing if money were as cheap a commodity in a young country as it is in the older countries of the world. ThenI proceeded to discuss the important question of rates of wages. Instead .of viewing the higher rates of wages which exist in Australia as a curse, I always referred to them in this work as the greatest possible blessing and sign of prosperity. I put the question of wages in this waySo long as Colonial labour is in demand at its present high rates, and works eight hours a day only, we cannot hope, and are foolish if we try, to compete in the vast majority of the branches of manufacturing industry with countries far more favourably' situated for such industries, that is to say, where labour is less valuable, wages lower, work longer, capital more abundant, and markets larger and more accessible ; and we have tried to show that those who attempt to neutralize the prosperity of the working men of Australia by heavy protective duties betray surprising ignorance of the real nature of wealth, and the true sources of national greatness. These views are shared by such honourable members as the honourable and learned member fer West Sydney, and no one would say that he is anxious to pose as an enemy of Australian labour. He holds these identical views, which may be right or wrong, and I think I may say that, in his case, as in mine, the desire is tb study the interest and welfare of the great masses of the people. r shared by the honourable member for Barrier. member for Canobolas, the honourable member for Maranoa, and others.

297,Mr Reid,"I do not wish to suggestme that I should send for it. Having done so, I was horrified to discover that a forgery had been perpetrated. In the case of spoken utterances, all sorts of mistakes may occur through misreporting, without there being any deliberate intention to deceive. But no man can sit down in a public library, or elsewhere, and omit words from, or put words into, a passage which he is copying without a deliberate and wicked intention to injure some one. It remains to be seen whether these tactics will help the cause in which they are used. I shall very soon have an opportunity to visit a large number of centres in Victoria, and I shall then expose, as I have a right tb do,, the wicked means which have been usedby the Melbourne Age to discredit me. I hope that the tactics of that newspaper will have the same result as similar tactics had in regard to Senator Trenwith. tf the pamphlet, to which the honourable member for Dalley referred, has been issued by the Protectionist Association, the blame must fall upon the proper shoulders. These quotations have been made time after time in the Melbourne Age, and it it stated in that newspaper this morningAs to the .accuracy of the quotation made by Mr Haekeld, there is not the slightest doubt the passage appears in Mr Reid's volume of free trade essays, a copy of which any one can obtain in the Melbourne Public Library. It is there stated that the passage has been correctly quoted, and that the accuracy of the quotation can be verified on reference to the book in the Melbourne Library. That statement is absolutely false. It may have been made carelessly, the writer relying on the accuracy of some other publication ; but if it appears in any publication of the Melbourne Protectionist Association, and was not taken from the Melbourne Age-becaus e no one could blame the association for regarding the Age as accurate-if those responsible for sucb. publication have invented this wicked wrong, the blame will fall on them. That is a point which I hope will be cleared up. f ma$e the discovery to which I have referred only this evening, and I hope that honourable members will feel that I was therefore justified in saving what I. have said. I am much obliged to the honourable member for Herbert in kindly giving way to me. should not have spoken to-night but for the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot. As a rule, the members of the Opposition who represent the Tasmanian electoral divisions, when they speak about the sugar duties, set up a wail as if Tasmania were paying an undue amount. They lose sight of the fact that, prior to Federation. Queensland paid practically no duties on sugar, the amount so paid in 1899 being only £ 9 2 , and in 1900 £ 1 0 6 . Last year, however, the people of that State paid over £80,000 in Excise and Customs duties, the amount paid in duty being very small; while this year it is estimated that they will pay about £ 8 r,ooo. In Tasmania, however, prior to Federation, the people were paying more in sugar duties than they are paying now, the amount so paid in 1899 being £46,200. and in 1900 £47,066, whereas last year the people of the State paid only £34,202 in Customs, Excise, and bounty, and their estimated payment for this year, is only £39,492, or £8,000 less than was paid prior to Federation. in regard to the loss by the Treasury. members speak as though the people of Tasmania were paying more now in connection with the sugar industry than they were paying prior to Federation, whereas they are paying £8,000 a year less, the position of the people of Queensland being relatively worse than their position prior to Federation, and the position of the people of Tasmania being better. I do not think it fair that this wilful perversion of facts should be persisted in so continually. It has also been made to appear that no benefit has resulted from the payment of the sugar bounty ; but that is not so. The figures put before us by the Treasurer show that the position of the sugar industry is better now than it has been heretofore. Not only has the number of white farmers increased, but the acreage under white labour has also increased. It is estimated that, of 131,000 acres under sugar this year, 96,000 acres, or 70 per cent., are being cultivated by white labour; while about the same percentage of the sugar produced is being produced by white labour. Therefore, it is wrong to say that no benefit has accrued from the sugar bounty. I wish now to sav a word or two in regard to the proposed land tax. The honourable members for New England and Lang, who are professed single-taxers, condemn the proposal",54,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The honourable member for New England said the other night that it is silly to think that the proposed tax would break up the large estates, because it would be inefficient and abortive. leader of the Opposition, however, and some of his followers, have objected to our proposal on the ground that it is the introduction of the thin end of the wedge, and, as such, it should commend itself to the honourable members to whom I have referred. newspapers of two consecutive days contained two very remarkable statements. It was stated, in the first instance, in the Argus that the estates belonging to Sir .Rupert Clarke at Keilor Plains, Sunbury, and another the name of which I forget, comprising over 100,000 acres, had been offered to the Victorian Government, and these estates were valued' for taxation purposes at £ 9 8 , 0 0 0. ever, it was stated ir. the Age that the land in question is estimated to be worth something like £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Those two statements show, first, that land is being held im very large blocks, so that many who desire to settle upon it are unable to do so, and, secondly, that the country is being defrauded of legitimate revenue because taxation is not paid upon fair valuations. Some of this land is worth from £ j 5 to £ 2 0 per acre, and the whole of it is good land. The honourable member for Wilmot claims to be the son of a pioneerone of those men who, during the time that the blacks were very aggressive, carried their lives in their hands. No doubt they had to put up with many hardships, but they have had the advantage of a very good thing for a sufficiently long time, and should be content to let some one else have a. look in. The Labour Party have put forward their land taxation proposal, because the States Parliaments have not the courage to legislate in the desired direc, tion, or have not the power to do so. So long as the States Legislative Councils are representative of the propertied classes, it will be impossible to carry through a reasonable measure of land taxation, and it, therefore, rests upon this democratic Parliament to fill the breach. Thirty years ago there was a much larger population in some of the western counties of Victoria than is to be found there to-dav. In the interval, millions of pounds have been spent in building railways and affording' better means of communication and improved facilities for the carriage of produce. The honourable member for Wilmot says that if we need the land now held by private individuals, we should pay them the market price. I would point out, howThe ever, that the additional value has been given to the land by the construction of railways and other public works, and the people are asked to buy this land at a high price, the added value being created by the people themselves. For example, who created the City of MelOnly recently the Melbourne bourne and the high values of property in that metropolitan centre to-day ? When the site of the city was first sold, the land realized £273,000. To-day it is valued at between £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £10,000,000. Who gave it that added value? Not the people living on the land, not the purchasers of the property, but the general public. Next day, howtax varying according to the area of land helda progressive land tax is not justified from that point of view. the honourable and learned member can take that view. ber is arguing for the nationalization of land. ber never heard me mention anything about nationalization of land. not have said it, but that is what it meant. gentleman is now doing that which he strongly objects to on the part of others.

But that is all a matter of pure speculation. At the same time, I cannot see why we require a High Commissioner in London if he is not to be vested with power to deal with the debts in Australia. The more honoured and capable he is, the more desirous will he be of obtaining powers the exercise of which are essential to his high office. His most important function will be to deal with the finances of Australia. But I rose chiefly for the purpose of referring to the Labour Party. The le?der of that party, in the course of his remarks upon the Budget, declared that a Federal progressive land tax was not intended to raise revenue, but was designed to burst up large estates, so that the landclared himself in favour of a progressive less Door might be afforded an opportunity of coming into their heritage. I am one of those who believe that the land question is at the root of the industrial troubles of Australia, but I am not prepared to accept a scheme of that character as a solution of the problem. The Labour Party propose to exempt all lands the unimproved value of which is less than £5,000. It seems 'to me that their proposal is merely a revival of the old scheme in reference to land values taxation, with evils which did not attach to it when its adoption was advocated in New South Wales. Upon estates the unimproved value of which is more than £.5,000, and less than £10,000, a tax of i d . in the £ 1 is fo be levied. Thus £10 8S. 4d. would have to be paid upon an estate the unimproved value of which was £10,000. The honourable member for Bland wishes the country to believe that the luckv holder of such an estate would relinquish his holding rather than pay that amount. leader says that our proposal amounts to confiscation. Partv affirms that the effect of the operation of such a tax would be to burst up large estates. This afternoon the honourable member for Canobolas raised a pitiful wail on behalf of the landless poor of New South Wales.. I am endeavouring to show the absurdity of the idea that an annual tax of £ 1 0 8s. 4d. would compel the holder of £10,000 worth of unimproved land values to sacrifice his holding. does not think that that is confiscation?

If the expenditure of the Federation continues to increase, it will cause the electors of Australia to feel more convinced than ever that we have too many Governors, too many Governments, and too manv Parliaments. surer) [10.28] I regret that I am called upon at this late hour to reply to the debate, but as it is the desire of the Government that the debate shall conclude tonight, I shall endeavour to so condense my remarks that I will occupy the attention of the Committee for only a very short time. I thank honourable members for the way in which they have criticised the Budget. I think that the statements which have been made as to increased expenditure, and in regard to supposed extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth, are not well founded. A great deal has been said about the estimated increase of £525,374 in the expenditure this year, but when honourable members analyze the figures, they will increases are justifiable. mated expenditure this year is £413,942 in excess of last year's estimate. We have to remember, however, that we saved last year £111,000, and that, as has been the case every year since the establishment of Federation, we mav find at the end of the Nnancial year that our estimate has not been reached. The estimated increase of £525,374 is made up as follows:-Suga r bounties, as provided by law, £130,394; defence-owin g to changes in the cadet system and increases in other directions£ 7 2 , 4 5 1; new works, defence material, & c, £16.0,004; elections and electoral expenses, which do not How would the honourable memoccur every year, £S5,9°o; repatriation of Kanakas, which is new expenditure, £25,000; increase in the estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department, set off by increase of revenue, £68,714; and difference between, sundry increases and decreases, £12,911. None of these items could have been avoided, and the charge of extravagance cannot be applied to anv of them. For my own part, I think that the more closely honourable members examine these figures, the more readily they will agree that the increase is what might have been expected. The debate has centered principally round the proposals of the Government in regard to penny postage and the taking over of the debts of the States. With regard to the former, it must be remembered that more than half the population of Australia already enjoys penny postage to a limited extent. Except in South Australia, where the rate is uniformly 2d., the people living in most of the cities and towns of the Commonwealth are charged only id. for. the delivery of letters within those centres of population, while the rate is only id. throughout Victoria. We have already made uniform and reduced our telegraph rates, with the result that the community has benefited, and the revenue has been increased. To those who say that we cannot afford penny postage, I would submit the following figures :c 3 c for V <a ci 33 enn y Stateh -a a Ol cs> -W rH -=1 g g 1=1 .1=1 rt g -43 T-* +1 £+3 EH Sop£ 1 £ £ < £ NewSouthWales 1,014,000 1,075,000 --(-61,000 ssjooo recognise that all the Victoria Queensland . . 096,000 336,000 751,000 347,000 +55,000 +11,000 14.000 29,000 The estiSouth Australia 276,000 2S4.000 +3,000 28,000 West Australia 247,000 245,000 -2,000 19,000 Tasmania 113,000 111,000 -2,000 14,000 Totals. . 2,CS2,000 2,813,000 131,000 157,006 Thus it will be seen that, after allowing £157,000 for possible loss of revenue by the adoption of penny postage, the estimated revenue for this year is .£131,000",60,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I wish I had more time in which to reply to the criticisms levelled against our proposals for taking over the debts of the States, and particularly to deal with the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. In my opinion, he has, to a large extent, ignored the provisions of the Constitution. If we were the members of a Convention, engaged in devising a scheme for the taking over of the debts of the States by the Common[111]2 wealth, untrammelled by the provisions of the Constitution, we might be able to act on different lines from those proposed' to The be followed by the Government. But the Constitution will not allow us to take over all the debts of the States, and section 94 of the Constitution to which the For the financial year 1906-7 honourable member for Mernda referred as being of a temporary character is of a permanent character, and will have to be Then, again, the honourable member proposed that we should at once arrange to return a fixed sum to the States; but that can only be done after the 31st December, 1910, because section 87, the Braddon section, meanwhile stands in the wav. Unless the Constitution is amended, that section must continue in operation until the date mentioned, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. Then, again, the Constitution makes provision of the most definite character, in section 105, as well as in section 87, which the honourable member for Mernda seems to have ignored. It is there laid down in the most absolute terms that each State shall pay its own debts and the interest due upon them, and shall indemnify the Commonwealth for any payments made by it in respect to interest or principal in connection with such debts. The honourable member for Mernda seemed to infer that I wished to take over only £103,000,000 of the States debts I have been misunderstood by him in this matter, and the press seem to have also misunderstood me-althoug h paragraph 8 of my memorandum reads as follows:I recommend that legislative provision be made for taking over by the Commonwealth of the whole of the existing State debts, why=h amounted in the aggregate on 30th June, 1905, to ^236,680,739; but, as by section 105 of the Constitution only the State debts "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" which on the same date amounted to can be legally dealt with, and, as it must take some time to obtain an amendment of the Constitution, I advise that the legislation should provide for dealing with the ^201,983,386 at once, and that the balance of ^34.6g7.3S3 be d e a l t with so soon as the required amendment of the Constitution is obtained.

384,Sir John Forrest,"My desire isJanuary, 1901, lo the necessary amendment of the Constitution), by such successive operations as may be thought fit. It is also objected that the proposals of the Government are of a temporary, and not of a permanent, character. I am personally concerned, I am quite willing that they should be made to extend, if not indefinitely, at any rate for a long period; but I still think that it is unwise to make any such provision. It is not in the interests of the States that any permanent arrangement should be made now. The limitation as to time is in the interests of both parties, and especially in the interests of the States. I think that .fifteen years hence we shall be in a far better position than at present to finally deal with this matter. we shall be working under the plan proposed, and shall have opportunities to judge as to its suitability or otherwise. My own opinion is that it will work well, and continue in operation for many years. At any rate, this Parliament will retain all its powers, and will be able to deal' with the whole question far more effectively, and, I believe, far more wisely at the end of 1920 than at the present time. The proposals of the honourable member for Mernda and of others who have been good enough to criticise the proposals of the Government, are that the Commonwealth should at once take over the whole of the States debts, and-become at once responsible for the payment of interest and the repayment of the principal. This proposal would confer upon the present holders of stock any profit that might arise from the transfer. In mv memorandum I expressed my matured opinion on this proposal, after having consulted eminent financial authorities in England, in the following terms:The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State stocks before conversion, as such action would prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any increase provide for the maintenance of law in price caused by the additional Commonwealth security. might, but how could we obtain the profit? likely to derive a profit, because the holders of stock would come to us. It is always better to be sought after than to go seeking If , when the existing State bonds are approaching maturity, or even when they are a long way off maturity, the bond-holders find that the Commonwealth stocks of the same denomination and currency are more negotiable, and are bringing a better price than similar Statesi So far as stocks, they will come to us and seek to exchange stock for stock, vide paragraph 6, sub-paragraph 6, of my memorandum. Should this occur, we shall then be in a position to indicate the terms on which we would be prepared to exchange Commonwealth stock for the State stock. for £3? attentively to the honourable member, but his observations, I regret to say, did not In the meantime, carry conviction to my mind. I think that the authorities whom I consulted may be relied upon in this matter., I have had in writing from the Secretary of the Imperial Treasury the very substance of the paragraph which I have last read, and I fully rely upon his great knowledge and experience on this matter. In my opinion until we convert the loans, we should not pay the interest, but should leave that responsibility on the shoulders of the States. That is a far better plan than for the Commonwealth to pay the interest and to look to the States for the money. Difficulties might arise if we attempted to do as has been suggested. When one person has to find the money for another, difficulty sometimes arises in procuring the necessary funds at the proper time. On the other hand, if persons have to find inoney for themselves they generally do it much more readily. It has been complained on several occasions during this debate that the proposals of the Government are too liberal to the States. I am glad that our proposals are considered liberal to the States, as I recognise most thoroughly that this is a time when we should treat the States as liberally as possible, and recognise also to the full the great obligations that rest upon them. They have to and order, and Courts of Justice, for the development of the land and mines, and Of course, it for all kinds of settlement. Thev have to make roads, and construct tramways and raihvays and other means of transit; they have to provide for water supply and harbour works; and, in fact, for everything connected with the every-day life of the people. All these matters necessitate a large expenditure, and in these early days we",62,Thomson I T Would Be ^201 983 386 Vide Tables D And F Herewith

388,Sir John Forrest,"I listened verymust do our ibest to assist the States in every way that we can. A great deal has been said by the honourable member for Mernda and the honourable member for Bland regarding what would happen if, after the Commonwealth had guaranteed the return of a fixed sum to the States, the revenue declined so that we had not the funds to permit us to carry out our compact. I would like to ask them what all the States have to do-and they have obligations to meet amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds-whe n bad times come upon them? They have to effect all sorts of economies, and to furnish funds for their needs. The Commonwealth will have to do the same. If hard times come upon us, we shall have to curtail our expenditure, and to provide other sources of income. The argument that having guaranteed the return of so many million pounds to the States we might not be able to pay it, has no weight with me. If we undertake to provide a certain amount we shall have to find it in the same way that the States have to face their obligations. AlthoughI do not anticipate any difficulty in that direction, I say that we should occupy exactly the same position as is occupied by anybody else, whether a private citizen or a Government, who enters into an obligation. It seems to me that I put the position very clearly in paragraph 12, which readsThe effect of this plan would be that the Commonwealth, having arranged its taxation so as to provide sufficient funds to pay annually the required contribution to the States, and also suffitheir population will have greatly incient to provide for all its own general and special expenditure, would then be free from any further financial obligation to the States. States, on the other hand, would be free from uncertainty as to the amount they were to annually receive from the Commonwealth, while both Commonwealth and States would know their exact financial positions and obligations, and would have the burden separately placed upon them, of making both ends meet. This is not the case at present, since any extra expenditure by the Commonwealth means a diminution of the amount returnable to the States. Some honourable members have asked, "" What is the object, of taking over the States debts? Why should we be in a hurry to take over their obligations, especially when the States themselves do not seem anxious for us to do so"" ? My reply is -that it was part of the understanding upon which the Federation was established. We believed then-and we still believe-that a great saving would result to the people of Australia if such an undertaking were properly managed. To my mind, the object which we should keep in view is that of affording relief to the States as soon as possible. That can best be done by applying any savings which we may make to a reduction of the annual payments by the States. The honourable member for Mernda is of opinion that any savings which we may effect should Le devoted to a sinking fund. My idea is that what the people of the States require is early relief. They desire that as a result of the taking over of the States debts they should pay less interest than they are at present paying. It must always be remembered in connection with this matter that the Commonwealth would derive no benefit from any such saving. Every single sixpence of profit which might be' made would be placed to the credit of the particular State concerned. That was the intention of the Constitution, and was the main reason why provision was made for the transfer of the States debts to the 'Commonwealth. The honourable member for Mernda, under his scheme, hopes to make a large profit, but instead of devoting that profit to the particular States concerned, he would hand it over to the other States. I submit that that is not only unfair, but is not in accordance with the iConstitution. the profit should be applied to paying off the debts of the other States. creased ? The States debts have been paid he does not say what will happen, but the assumption is that nothing whatever from Customs and Excise revenue will be returned to the States. But he proposes that in the interval any piofits which might be made should be devoted to paving off the debts of the other States. In effect, his proposal broadly is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue for ever, and in return should assume responsibility for and pay off the States debts, amounting to £236,000,000. In fifty or sixty years after their taking over those debts would be liquidated, and then the Commonwealth would have all tbe Customs and Excise revenue, and return none of it to the States. I would point out that even in Canada the return to the States of a per capita amount is secured",63,Thomson I T Would Be ^201 983 386 Vide Tables D And F Herewith
