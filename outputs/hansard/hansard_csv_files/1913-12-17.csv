These two answers are seemingly contradictory, and I therefore ask the Prime Minister to call upon the Public Service Commissioner to explain the position, and if the reply of the 2nd December is incorrect, to withdraw it? consistency. The reply given by my honourable colleague is quite correct. The law debar3 temporary employee's from receiving more than is paid to permanent employees who are doing the same' work. The second reply was, in effect, that in spite of the law, temporary employees are being paid the rates fixed by Wages Boards or other industrial authorities when these are higher than the rates paid to permanent employees. if a trade unionist in the temporary employment of the Commonwealth ia paid' the trade union rate of wages, and that happens to be higher than the wages received by a permanent employ! doing similar work, the law is being broken ? orable member to read the section of the Act for himself. formed that several persons at Stanley, in the Darwin division, have been heavily fined for failing to enrol, solicitors hav17 December, 1913. ing been employed in the cases.

Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [11.14] I am disappointed at the progress made in another place. I thought we should be able to conclude the business to-day, and get away without any trouble, but owing to the delay there we are not able to do it. The business remaining to be done here is the Oommittee of Public Accounts Bill, the Old-age Pensions Billi f we can manage it, a Bill to rectify the trouble in the Public Service in connection with the transfer of the lighthouse officers, and another measure made necessary by the elimination of the item of £300,000 from the Loan Bill for the purchase of land for defence purposes.

I take this course because there is no time to deal with the measure, and a difficulty which I did not anticipate has arisen in regard to the States. The States require to be consulted. I thought we had had enough consultation, but I find that we have not. We propose to have a conference as soon as we can with the State Ministers, so as to leave them no reason to think that we desire to force this matter upon the country without conferring again with them. A Bill has been prepared by myself and the Treasury officials. as I am concerned, but in deference to Trade and Customs seen an interview the desire of the State Governments, and which a newspaper in Queensland had in view also of the fact that there is no with Sir George Reid regarding the Beef time to deal with such an important matter this session, I am prepared to withdraw it. Can .the right honourable gentleman say, before the close of the session, what the proposals are which are to be discussed between the Government and the State Governments? That is a fair question to ask. If the Commonwealth Government are going into a conference with the States on an important subject like the State debts, the questions to be discussed should not be regarded as private, because this is not a party or political matter. If the Government have made up their minds as to the policy they intend to pursue, they should be perfectly frank with the country, and so should the States, because there cannot be a satisfactory remedy of this anomaly unless the people are taken into the confidence of their leaders. Treasurer) [11.18] I at first intended to introduce a measure and place on record the views of the Government, but when I found the States wished to have a conference, I thought it far better not to make a statement until the conference had taken place. I do n'ot think anything would be gained by doing it . Perhaps a good deal of controversy would take place in the press and elsewhere on matters upon which we might be often inclined to change our opinions. We are not prepared, at present, to make a statement, and will not be prepared to do so until after the conference. Question resolved in the affirmative.

MrM c WILLIAMS to the Minister of Home Affairs a further question on the same subject, but not arising out of the question I have just put. The question is, whether it is a fact that the Western Australian Government had a period of thirteen months within which to supply sleepers before the honourable member's question is not in order. Home Affairs state whether it is a fact that a contract was entered into with the Clyde Engineering Company for the manufacture and supply of a certain number of trucks with a view to facilitating the construction of the transcontinental railway; that the trucks were not supplied within the time fixed by the contract, and that an extension of that contract has been allowed ? that tliat is a reason for trying to insist upon the proper observance of contracts, and not an excuse for any delay. ask the Prime Minister whether, in considering the question of cancelling the contract for the supply of sleepers which the Western Australian Government entered into with the Commonwealth, he will have regard to the fact that the whole of the transcontinental railway is depending upon the railways of Western Australia; and, further, whether it would not be wise for him to consider the question of transportation before he takes such action ? member may rely upon the Government H a v e the works been degiving the Government of Western Australia justice in regard to this matter.

I hope to invite tenders shortly for further supplies, which may induce Australian tenderers to come forward.

72,(By Mr Joseph Cook) Pro,"the public accounts oi the method of keeping them, or in the mode of receipt control issue or payment of the public money. In passing, I may say that this last -duty will include the power of making suggestions in regard to practically everything that comes under the Auditor General's Department. Mr W. H . IRVINE -This is a purely investigatory and informative Committee, but the scope of the subjects it may investigate and report on includes the whole frame of the Estimates, for instance, 'and any matter that arises out of the Estimates, and the whole machinery pf, and any matter that arises under, the Audit Act, whether belonging to the Audit Act or not, as to the "" mode of receipt, control, issue, or payment of the public money."" (c) to inquire into and report upon any questions in connection with the pub! lie .accounts which are referred to them by either House of the Parliament ; (d) any other duties assigned to the Committee by ' joint standing orders aploose a phrase to be incorporated in a Bill proved by both Houses of the Parliament. When the previous Bill was before the House, I pointed out, in the course of the discussion, in answer to a criticism that was addressed to the fact that it did not contain any indication of the duties of the Committee, that it was not a Bill enabling a Committee to be appointed and to fix the duties, but a Bill merely empowering the Committee when appointed, and when its duties had been Allocated, to sit and call evidence. The Etill before us, however, is an enabling Bill for the creation of a new Standing Committee, and, therefore, it is appropriate that it should set out the main jSuties of the Committee, leaving it , if necessary, to the Houses, by Joint Standing Orders, to enlarge the duties if they $hink fit, and to refer to the Committee ?>ny matters regarding which they desire investigation and report. like a Public Works Committee, which has a direct control, and without whose report certain works cannot be carried out. A Public Works Committee has an actively restrictive function, whereas we now propose a purely informative Committee. The powers embodied in clause 3 are taken almost verbatim from the Standing Orders of the Victorian Legislative Assembly of 1895. Those Standing Orders include one or two things, such as inquiry into the investments of Savings Bank Commissioners, that are not embraced in our provision, but which may be referred to the Committee by either House, or by a joint resolution of both Houses if thought necessary. The Victorian Committeehas been in existence for a large number of years, and as it has done very excellent work under these Standing Orders, it is thought der sirable to start our Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts with the main powers fhat were granted to the Victorian Standing-Committee. The Bill, as I read it , is intended to provide statutory powers for a -Committee that might reasonably have been appointed under our own Standing Orders. The clause proceedsI direct the attention .of the AttorneyGenera} ,to .the use of the words ' ' bring under the notice of both Houses of Parliament "" in .clause 3, whereas elsewhere the words employed are "" shall report tp Parliament."" I think the words "" bring under the notice of both Houses'' are ton that deals with finance. I should think that these words would permit any member of the Committee, without the authority of the Qommitt.ee, to bring certain things under the notice of Parliament. Mr ^V. H . IBVINE -On e member of the Committee may be asked to inform Parliament. The provision was made as wide as possible for that reason. especially in regard to financial matters. There should be no loose method of making any statement to Parliament, because that would be the beginning of trouble, and possibly lead to the dissemination of misleading statements. It is better to bind the Committee to a report, either a majority report or a unanimous one. No statement should come down' from individuals of the Committee through our employing the words ""bring under the This is not notice of Parliament."" Again, it is not advisable to use varying terms in the one measure, because the Committee might reasonably say, '' All we are asked to do in this matter is to bring it under the 'notice of Parliament, and our work is done.""

As a matter of fact, it may be found much more economical to do the work by contract, or as, I think, is done in connection with the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway, to do some portions of the work by contract.. If this amendment is agreed to we shall be absolutely in the hands of the labour itself as to the terms and conditions of employment. I ask the Committee to disagree with it, as whatever is most economical and best in the long run both for the Government, and for every one employed on the railway, who will, of course, get his standard rate of wages, will be done. I move That the amendment be disagreed to. I regret the Minister's attitude. I took occasion, about two months ago, to lay before the House the report from the Minister of Railways, Mr Paget, in a Conservative Government in Queensland, who showed clearly that since the in auguration of day labour in that State the Department have practically saved £1,000,000 sterling, and got better work. Mr Paget went into the matter hostile to day labour. date-no t ten years old. to date, extending over a period of ten years of railway work. It was proved that 12 per cent, actual saving was made, and Mr Paget added frankly that not only did the day-labour system save money, but that their permanent-way was better than it would have been if the work had been done by contract. I appeal to honourable members not to act on prejudice in this matter, because day labour properly organized in the Northern Territory will undoubtedly be less expensive than contract.

It is quite true that in the old days of the contract system we were not moving on economical lines, and that when that system was superseded by day labour there was a considerable saving for some time, but there is as much difference between the contract system to-day and ten or fifteen years ago as there is between darkness and light. tion's illustration is no proof, because there is, and can be, no test unless the principle adopted by South Australia is brought into force-that is, to submit public works to public tender, and allow the Department to tender. partment's tender is lowest then the Department does its own work. In the case cited by the Leader of the Opposition we simply have an estimate of the responsible officer of the Department. I know that is so, because the system of having the estimate of fhe responsible officer was tried in the case of many public works i u South Australia and other States, and you cannot be sure that the estimate is a correct one, because there is no check on it .

In the case cited by the Leader of the Opposition, we have simply the estimate of the public official, who has to provide a margin to cover contingencies. T would remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh of a case in our own State, when Mr Verran, as Leader of a It is ten Labour Government,"" was adopting the day-labour principle. He made the statement to the men, and to the public, that the men made it almost impossible for him to carry out the work, and he had to send for a contractor and give him practically his own price. To-day we have the east to west railway as an example. The honourable member for Herbert only the other day made a scathing and absolutely correct statement in this House, The Leader of the Opposiwhich I defy anybody to answer. His allegations must be investigated, arid will, I am certain, be found, if anything, to be understated.

I shall not weary the Committee by reading the statements made by the contractors, honourable members may read them for themselves; b u t may I read the reply made by the Minister? master builders requested that certain public works should be carried out by contract, and made statements damaging in their criticism of the day-labour system.

Tins was the reply made by the Queensland Minister of Public Works to the deputationT h is is an adIn the past the officers had been careful to make their estimates, and if the lowest tenders It was stated a minute ago were higher the work was taken up by the Department. Often fresh tenders were invited. Personally, his inclination was in favour of tender. But he was face to face with the fact that the officers' estimate of day labour was sometimes much below the contract prices. There was no other course, therefore, in the public interests, but to go on with the work. He had no right to let his own desires weigh in that regard, when public duty stood in the road. Sof a r as the Department was concerned, the. great bulk of the work was carried out by public tender. He was quite free to admit that very often the lowest tender was less than the The honourable official estimate. They had reminded him of the high' cost in New South Wales of some of the works recently carried out in that State. But there were no such figures available in connection with his Department. So far as he knew there was no such thing in existence as the "" Government stroke."" He quoted a few cases to support his view. On the new refreshment rooms in the gardens, though the work had been increased on the original plan by £200, they had still saved £270. In a Lands' Department: job the lowest tender was £484, but they carried out the work for £286. In the Geological! branch they saved £234 on a job, as compared to the lowest tender. It had been said that inI n the these works no charge was made for the work, of the officers engaged, but that was not so.. Everything was properly apportioned. Some-thin"" had also been said about work at Goodna,. which was being carried out by day labour, but they would save something like £9,000 on the job. If they thought the specifications werenot adhered to he would be glad to drive aparty of them out to inspect it . It was only fai r to the officers to say that many thousandsof pounds had been saved by the system at present in force. One. big work had been menThese tioned, which he would refer to. That was theRockhampton Technical College. The estimatewas £12,733, a n d lowest tender £15,703, and it was expected that f u l l y £3,000 would besaved on those figures. At Goodna the estimate for one ward was £16,621, and the lowest tender £20,790, and they expected to considerably cut under the estimate.",21,Foster I Am Wheneve R This Question Is Mentioned

The Queensland evidence, to which I have referred, is of to-day, and not years ago; and I think that our distinguished and learned friend the Attorney-General could tell us something about the price of locomotives in Victoria under the contract system. Of course, I do not deny that day labour under a weak Government, with poor organization, may prove expensive; b u t in Queensland, and, as matters wore in South Australia, for in stance, there is every guarantee that the taxpayers' interest is conserved. The assumption of the late Government, in instituting day labour, was that the work # would be properly organized. Another example of a saving under day labour is presented in the Commonwealth Officesi n London. out what the cost has been. there would he any difficulty in finding out; and I have no hesitation in saying that, when the accounts are produced, we shall find a similar result to that obtained in Queensland.

The contention that day labour is unsatisfactory is all nonsense, for the simple reason, as I have pointed out before, that it all depends on the organization; and it is an insult to the Government, and to the army of trained engineers who are at their service, to suggest that they cannot successfully carry out public works. We all know what happens when, under private contracts, the specifications are departed from ; and in this connection alone there must be great savings under the system of day labour, which permits variation as the circumstances demand. prevent a modified contract system, which I do not think was one of the suggestions I made.

In Victoria some years ago, after the appointment of the Railways Standing Committee, certain railways were, on the recommendation of that body, constructed by day labour, but the whole administration, through the investigations of the Committee, was revolutionized, so that there can be no analogy drawn, or com; parison made. day labour having apparently proved so beneficial in Queensland, it seems to me that there is good reason for giving the Queensland Government an opportunity ito tender for this railway. member suggest that the Queensland Government will tender ? in South Australia the Government tender for Government work. work; but would the Queensland Government tender for Commonwealth work ? ber for Brisbane suggested that we should get the Queensland Government to construct this line. thing.

I do not intend to talk There about the element of "" Government stroke "" ""referred to by some honourable members; but when we eliminate competition we set up an expensive system of carrying out works, whether under private or under Government supervision. In my own district, postal work has been done by day labour, and it has been fairly expensive. I quite realize that there are small works that may be carried out by the Government under the Under the circumstances, day-labour system, because the Government have their own plant, and contractors cannot be got to tender for work in every part of the country. anything but an occasional reference to matters outside railway construction. the outside work as an illustration. I was saying that the day-labour system may be employed by the. Commonwealth in certain small works; but I hold that important public works, involving the expenditure of hundreds of thousands, should be treated in a different fashion. The Commonwealth Parliament, as trustees of the public money, should not spend that money in the way it thinks fit, or as a matter of patronage, or at the dictation of any section of the community. It is our duty to spend the money of the public to the very best advantage, and, in accordance with our wisdom, to devise means of carrying out public works in the most economical way. We are not justified in introducing a system which prevents the Government carrying out those works with the elimiI n the case of the nation of those elements of competition that are necessary to bring about the best results from the expenditure of public money. will look at this question from a different stand-point. If we are to invite contractors to submit tenders for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, quite away from regular supwhat extras plies and from bodies of men, they must add to their prices a very large margin.",25,Foster I Did Not Amendment Of The Seuate Ought To Be

I resent the aitacKS ""that havo been made on working men. It is said that because men work with picks and shovels they go in the former for the Government stroke. I resent tMs slander upon them. Workmen have done the supervision is just as good work for the Government as has been done for private contractors. The Prime Minister will remember that when he was Postmaster-General in New South Wales he carried out that splendid work of constructing telephone tunnels through Sydney. He increased wages to the men, and tlte tunnels were made three inches iarger, necessitating the use of think millions of bricks more, yet ""the whole work was done under the day-labour system in better style and at a saving of £29,000.

198,Mr West,"Whethe r the Senate, i uabaurd to attempt to construct the proposed railway by contract. tractor would tender for the work except at an extravagant price: Por one thing, the proposed line begins at a"" place 150 miles away from Port Darwin, able for railway construction between Port Darwin and Pine Creek, so that practically all the material required would have to be carried over the existing railway. Again, were a private contractor to tender for the work, he would have to make a heavy charge to cover contingencies. handicapped in the obtaining of labour. The .nearest place at which he could get the necessary labour would be somewhere in Queensland, and it would cost a good deal to take men to the Territory, even from Queensland. would require some security, and it would be much easier for the Government to obtain labour than for a contractor to do so. The proposal of the Senate is one whose adoption would serve the interests of the taxpayers. We are told that the measure is urgent because it is desirable to proceed with the making of the railway at once. But if the contract system be adopted, there, must be delay, because no contractor will tender until he has gone over the route and carefully considered the specifications. There are not many engineering difficulties along the route. The country is level, so that there would be no grades of more than 1 in 200, and not many bridges will be needed. The McDonald, the Mclntyre, and the Perguson Rivers will have to be crossed. to be made for crossing the depressions which in the rainy season become watercourses. The honourable member for Riverina has spoken of the need for supervision, but, if the work were done by contract, the Government would have to employ an army of supervisors to see that it was being done properly, and these men might equally well be employed in directly supervising Government employees. The plant required would not be very expensive, and could be used afterwards for the maintenance of the existing line, and for carrying out extensions. The honourable member for Wakefield is always in a state of excitement, and seems to lose his reason when he speaks, but he makes statements that No conalmost compel an answer. The saving on the Queensland railways by the adoption of day labour in their construction has been from £900 to £1,200 a mile. The Queensland railways that were conand there is no timber suitstructed by contractors were for 8-ton axles, whereas those which have been made with day labour are for 12-ton axles, as are also those of New South Wales, where the saving has been from £1,000 to £1,900 a mile. The present Secretary for Public Worksi n New South .Wales was forced to adopt the' day-labour sysHe would be greatly tem in the public interest on one line, for which the lowest tender was £300,000 above . the estimate, a saving of 33 per cent, being made by the adoption of the day-labour system. The States are all adopting that system Men going there now, not only for railway construction, but also for the building of railways and rolling-stock, and we should follow their example. The railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek was constructed with Chinese labour, a fact that accounts for the presence of so many Chinese in the Territory. The contractors employed that labour because they said that, it was more certain than white labour in the Territory. It being one of the principles of tbe Liberal party to encourage the contract system in connection with the Commonwealth public works, we on this side naturally fear that it will apply that system to the construction of the proposed line, and therefore we are making a fight for our own views and our own opinions. The majority in the Senate is sure to insist on this amendment. If there were twenty-nine Liberals in the Senate, they would turn down every proposal made by a Labour Government, and this Government, although Ministers may dislike it , must recognise the position. In the present position of parties, we on this side cannot be expected to forego our principles. What has kept us in power so long, and has made our supporters so loyal, is that we hold our political principles as sacred as our religious beliefs. If there were any disagreement between the Department and the contractors at that distance from the main centres of population, the cost would be enormous. There will be no loss of dignity to the Ministerial party in accepting the amendment.

Provided thai any person in the Professional or Clerical Divisions of the Public Service of a State may be appointed to the Administrative Division. I understand that the B ill provides that men transferred from State Services to the Commonwealth shall be put in the same position as those who were transferred at the beginning, of Federation. It is proper that the accrued rights and privi leges of transferred officers should be preserved, but we ought to take care not to make it possible for men to get into the Commonwealth Service through the State Services more easily than they can get into the Commonwealth Service direct. It may be that entrance to some of the State Services can be obtained without passing an examination, or by passing an examination which is easier than the Commonwealth entrance examination. plied only where large bodies of men are transferred, as in the present instance, Its introduction has beor in odd cases.

W it h regard to the questions how it may. affect the rights of persons in a State Service having accruing pension rights, and to what extent the Commonwealth incurs any responsibility with regard to those rights, and whether they will increase under the Commonwealth r&gime, we have nothing to do so far as this B ill is concerned. Probably there will be no pensioners taken over, but let us assume that some are.

If does not deal w it h transferred Departments. The Lighthouse Department has not been transferred, so that that section does not apply, and there is no constitutional or statutory provision giving these officers who come over any statutory pension rights whatever. The question is what becomes of any pension rights they have. them to enter the service of the Commonwealth. TheB ill merely renders them eligible should they desire it . Supposing we take over in this case a public servant who is already entitled to accruing ension rights, the question is what is to ecome of those rights, and who is responsible. That must be entirely a matter of agreement. The man need not come over. Supposing he has a pension right worth a capitalized value of £200, whab becomes of it? We may say we invite him to apply, with others, to enter the service of the Commonwealth, but he need not if he does not like to, and he still has his existing Public ServiceA c t of the State. State is bound under the Public Service law still to provide him a place, unless it abolishes his post. If ifc does, the State has to make provision to do what is just regarding any accrued rights. We are not compelling him to come over, but if he chooses to come, he must make his own arrangements with the State Government. We shall be prepared to give opportunities for such arrangements being made, but shall take no financial responsibility. He w ill enter our service as a newcomer. The only thing that will differentiate him in any way from a man who enters the Commonwealth Service for the first time is the provision in this B ill which brings him under section 61 of the Public ServiceA c t . That section is quite general in its terms. Taken by itself, however, it would not apply to such a man, because it deals obviously with those transferred under section 60. Buti t is expressly made applicable by this B ill , and we have to see what it means.

The honourable member for Hume dealt with this B ill from the scientific aspect. I shall not say anything about it from that point of view, but I would inform the honourable member for Capricornia t h a t ' this kind of legislation cannot be called Socialism and an aid to the farmers and stock-owners in New South Wales. They are very heavily taxed by the Pastures Protection Board for the prevention of stock diseases, and the whole community benefits; but even if it be so called, farmers and stock-owners are the pioneers of the country, and it is due to their efforts that the towns exist, and, therefore, they are entitled to some consideration. owners of Australia give the city workers all the monetary assistance they can by supporting a protective policy, and all they ask for now in return is an expenditure in the shape of higher research in agriculture and stock diseases, which will have the result of bringing about a large national production and tend to cheapen living. As a matter will also help to do .away a great deal of the Socialistic legislation that is now necessary in the form of direct aid. The State institutions can still continue their experimental farms, while the Federal Bureau of Agriculture can pursue research work. So far, the As there is nothing State institutions have done very little for agriculture. They have certainly of superphosphates, but the use of these superphosphates was not the result of their original research, because they were well known in England before they were spoken of in Australia. There is the necessity for increasing the yield of our primary products because of the increased cost of government and production, and because of the claim for higher wages. If the producers have to meet these demands they must have increased yields, and they can only be obtained by -applying science to production from the soil in a greater measure. Iu the past, Australia suffered, as America did some time back, from having too much land. When' land is plentiful and cheap the farmer is not obliged to put the labour into it that he must when he has to adopt intense culture. The State institutions are really draw attention to the very little ahead of the methods of the [Quorum formed.] Romansi n what they recommend to the farmers. Virgil mentions the necessity for hand picking to get clean seed, and also the need for thoroughly working the land after ploughing by harrowing, and fallowing, and the rotation of crops. According to the Encyclopasdia Britannica, there are sixty institutions in the United States of America. Fifty-five receive Government aid, and they employ 795 , people, including seventy-one directors and 163 scientific chemists, who deal with all phases of agriculture and diseases in stock. They have men going all over the world looking for plants and seeds which may improve their own production. By the The farmers and stockimprovement in seed alone, the farmers in the cotton belt of the United States of America have been raised from absolute poverty to plenty.

Let me give one Illustration : In the State of Illinois they were producing about 15 bushels of wheat to the acre. Six counties in the M u l t i nomer district joined together, and the United States Department sent out to them a professor, who, crossing a wheat brought from A f r i c a , or Siberia, with an American wheat, in three years in creased the yield to 27 bushels an acre. The crop grown on 200,000 acres is thus increased by 12 bushels an acre, and, as wheat was worth 4s. 2d. a bushel in America then, the wealth of those six counties 2,'o00,000 dols., or £500,000. That happened in districts where the land has been deteriorating through continuous cropping.

Men can sit round a table, and agree on certain things, but they soon get into diametrical opposition if not asked to take part in what is being done. The wonderful success of the LabourT h e y were party is due to the fact that every member of it has a voice in the government of the country. I have never heard of any of our State bureaux finding a cure for the diseases which affect stock in this The Agricultura l country; but I well remember that when we used to send cattle across from the Panhandle country, to ship them at Kiawa, for Chicago, and pleuro-pneuTo visit monia, and other diseases, broke out, scientific men were immediately sent down by the National Government to prescribe The Washington cures. This was done at the expense of the nation. We did not pay a penny for . it . But, of course, the nation profited by the industry. If you had 20,000,000 head of cattle in the Northern Territory, even though they were all owned by the Beef Trust, they would create wealth for Australia. But I do not wish to talk out the B ill .

A t the basis of this B ill is the desire to preserve what we have in the plant and animal life of Australia. We propose to establish a Bureau of Agriculture whose primary object will be research and the scientific investigation of the diseases which affect our animal and plant life. We have already taken action through the Quarantine Department to keep out of Australia many of the diseases which are to be found in other parts of the world. Thati n many countries is part of the work of an agricultural bureau. have also a Commonwealth Meteorological Department, and, in the United States of America, meteorology is part of the work of the Agricultural Bureau. Thus, we have already made a start. As regards the investigation of diseases, that is being asked for by persons in nearly every part of Australia. When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was Minister, I visited with him the sugar-cane growing districts of Queensland, where we were in formed of a pest that diminished the cane crops. The Minister was asked to put money on the Estimates for its in vestigation with a view to prevention. That pest alone has cost the sugar industry thousands of pounds. toria, the fruit-growers asked for the in vestigation of the disease known as bitter pit, and my predecessor in office, by cooperation with the States, appointed Mr McAlpine to conduct investigations. Some very high tributes have been paid by persons outside Australia to the work that he has done. agriculturalist in the United States of America says this of his workI secured the loan of a copy of your Handbook of Fungus Diseases of the Potato in Australia, plete chart, showing tlie whole scope of perused it carefully, and find it to be the best treatise on the diseases of potatoes I have ever the different Departments of Agriculture, seen.

ExcelWe lent as his work is, yet what Professor McAlpine is doing is only a small contribution to the great work that has yet to be done. The States have done splendid work, but so far have not been able to take up the work on an adequate scale. For instance, Queensland covers an enormous area. We have the possibility of all sorts of diseases springing up through all the industries in that State ancl going across into New South Wales. It would be infinitely better for Australia to get three or four highly-paid scientists to make a thorough investigation of these questions, and reWe port for Australia as a whole. for that in this B ill . orable member has not read the B ill . That is the intention, as the B ill says distinctly, "" the investigation of pests and diseases affecting animals, plant l if e , "" and so on. We have many of these arising throughout Australia. The idea of this B ill is not to supersede or do away with the existing State Agricultura l Departments. You can divide the work being done by those Departments into three or four different functions. There is the administrative work, educational work, In Vicexperimental work, and research work. A great deal of the administrative work will have to be continued to be done by the States, such as appointing inspectors of orchards and stock. The educational work will continue to be done by them through their agricultural colleges aud high schools.

Mr Swinburne, speaking on behalf of Victoria, pointed out that the Commonwealthcould with advantage confine its attention to research rather than administrative work. At present each of the States maintained a staff of experts to conduct research work. These experts included entomologists, vegetable pathologists, and veterinary officers, who were inquiring into many problems of vital importance to the producers of Australia. were rust in wheat, bitter-pit in -apples, and stock diseases, for which no scientifically-based cure had yet been found. Were the Commonwealth to assume control of this work much good could be done. Instead of half-a-dozen States working for the same ends along different lines with expensive staffs, the Commonwealth would be able to co-ordinate the work and secure for its advancement the very best scientific and practical experts that the world offered. The bureau could be maintained by contributions from the States and the Federal Government, and its establishment would open up a new era in production. T h a t was in 1908.

I asked Professor H . A . Woodruff, of the Veterinary School of the Melbourne U n i versity, to tell me to what extent scientific research work is being carried out in Melbourne, and he wrote as followsThe original research which is being carried out at this school has reference to two diseases of considerable economic importance, namely contagious pleuro-pneumonia of cattle and bovioe contagious abortion. The former is of particular importance in connection with the export of any ""live stock from Australia. The latter is chiefly of interest because of the great loss it entails to dairymen. What is being attempted is to discover more exact methods of diagnosis, and then, subsequently, improved methods of immunization. The scope of this work is necessarily limited by the fact that the staff is engaged primarily in teaching work. For special research it would Among these problems be necessary to retain one or more skilled persons to do nothing else, and little extra in equipment would be required. Experimental animals would from time to time have to be procured. .The two items requiring money are (i) the salaries of the men set apart for the work, and (2) purchase of experimental animals. . It appears to me that the best and most economical method of conducting pathological research is to appoint the most suitable person available for a stated period to investigate the particular problem in hand, and not -to create a permanent staff. The work of this school is fairly well defined, and in so far as investigations were on a large scale and called for by the Federal authorities W h e n the Scottish (Agricultural Department) that special staff and extra cost would have to be met from Federal sources. So far as I am personally concerned, every effort would be made to co-operate. No doubt you would be able to secure the consent of the In t h e i r r e p o r t , a t page 172, ment. I think Australia will find, as the United States of America has found, that it will be a benefit for us to take advantage qf the work of the scientists There are many wherever they are throughout Australia. It may be necessary to subsidize and assist them, so t h at our experiments may be carried out on as wide aud extensive a scale as possible. I want particularly to emphasize the fact that the scope of this B ill is not intended to supersede the State Departments at all, but is to undertake a big branch of work that is absolutely vital to Australia's production. I believe that if this B ill is carried, we shall have the same experience as the honourable member for Darwin said that the United States' Department has had. Many discoveries have been made in the United States of I America, the results of which have been to save more money to the producers than would pay for the cost of the equipment of the whole of the Department for years. The appointment of scientists is not a",43,Joseph Cook

325,Mr Groom,"The States w ill havemere useless expenditure. Scientific in vestigation has to be made, and althougn the first stage may appear to produce no material advantage, experience has shown that in the long r u n the result has been greatly to the benefit of the producers in the country concerned. Science is coming more and more into play in every department of life. Agriculture is one of the oldest callings in the world, and yet no calling is so dependent upon every advance and discovery in science. Every latest discovery is being turned in some way to the improvement of agriculture. The two great problems before us are to cheapen the cost of production and to increase the output. If we take advantage of scieuce to increase the production of material wealth in Australia, the national wealth will increase, the higher standards of civilization that we desire to see throughout Australia will be made possible, and the fuller development of a greater Australia will be realized. sorry I have not heard all the speeches of houorable members representing the agricultural portions ol the Commonwealth, but I havo had the pleasure of hearing one speech to-night, and am not too well pleased with the effort that the honourable member made to convince the Chamber that he was in favour of the B ill .

I can speak from experience, because I was living at the time in a dairying district. ing a dairying district in the New South Wales Parliament.

Since then, however, dairymen in the South Coast district, fro m which Sydney draws its milk supplies, have expressed their regret that the inspection was not continued, for if it had been they believe that there would have been healthier and more profitable dairy herds in the country. Do the Government propose, under this B ill , to provide for the inspection of stock?

Professor Harrison Moore deals with a similar position in Canada, which has also expressed powers, and on the following page he saysThere is, moreover, what appears a vital distinction between the United States and the Commonwealth Constitutions in that, in the former, the proceeds of taxation are the unqualified property of the Federal Government, subject to no claim by any one else. Professor Harrison Moore points out that in our Constitution there is a claim which the States may have on the surplus revenue, and that, therefore, there is somebody, or there was before the Financial Agreement came into operation, who could make a claim if tbe money were spent for purposes other than those specified in the Constitution. pated by the Financial Agreement?

Many farmers in my district send potatoes to Deniliquin. These potatoes have to pass over the Victorian railway system to reach .Echuca, where they recross the border, and are forwarded to their destination. A t the time that Irish blight was prevalent in the Commonwealth, New South Wales was not quarantined, but Victoria was, and though potatoes on the way to Deniliquin could cross the border from New South Wales into Victoria, when they reached Echuca they were classed as being affected by blight. It would be well if we could havo effective legislation dealing with this matter, so that a particular disease might be confined to a portion 'of a State irrespective of State boundaries.

We must be very careful before we interfere with the splendid work they are doing. This department of activity, while highly important, is non-revenue producing, and we have seen a good deal of readiness on the part of the States to hand over all their non-productive Departments to Federation. The States may be only too ready to hand over this matter, which is costing, in the aggregate, for their six Departments, over £751,000 a year. In order to save cost, we must see that efficiency is maintained, and it would be a retrogressive step for the Commonwealth to attempt to centralize the work altogether. This could not be properly done, as means of communication are not too easy. A farmer at Swan-Hill sends down to Melbourne for a regular supply of seeds and information, but a farmer in Queensland would not be so ready to send to a central bureau in Melbourne. I do not know that the Minister has shown that there has been any neglect by the State Departments of necessary work. am inclined to resent the implied reflection on the States and the work they have been doing, either expressed or implied. cation that some work is neglected; but the States have not neglected any of the things which the Minister has mentioned.

I do not think he will find that any one of them can tell us more about diseases in stock or plants than the Australian-trained men can. The Australian is the best of the lot. .Some of our weeds are indigenous to Australia, and im ported men have to learn all about them when they come here. It is time we set to work seriously to encourage our own men. tralia has sustained was in the death of the late Mr Farrar. I am glad the honourable member for Calare has given him i It would be credit for his magnificent work. I have mentioned Mr Greig, and there are others whom I know. Mr Greig and Mr Farrar were friends, and co-operated largely. One took up the investigation of saltbush and grass, and the other wheat. Some of my Such constituents who met Mr Farrar have continued experimenting with different kinds of wheat in the dry area, and are doing valuable work that is unknown to the general public. This work ought to be appreciated and encouraged. 1 am not in opposition to the measure, because, probably, the Minister will find some work to do in addition to what the States are doing when he starts the bureau. He has not told us anything that he is going to do that the States have neglected. I do not know how the Commonwealth is going to carry out its experiments. We have not found the States too ready to grant land for Commonwealth purposes, although they will probably sell it if the Commonwealth is willing to buy it . I do not think we shall reap the immense gain that the Minister seems to think. I have a very high opinion of the work being done so well and quietly by the various State Departments, and if we can help them it will be a good thing. The modern farmer, to be successful, must be scientific, and the Australian farmer is I getting away from that old conservatism which thought that what was good enough for a man's grandfather must be good enough for him. The fact that he is abandoning those ideas is due to the educational methods now adopted. The record shows that 95 per cent, of those who have passed through the Hawkesbury A g ricultural College have either gone on the land or taken positions associated with the land, many in other parts of the world. I hope the Minister will realize that we have plenty of trained men of our own to do experimental work of this kind miles ahead of any persons who can be brought from other parts of the world. cordially endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Darling with regard to employing our own talent where it is available.

He saysAs in Washington, a Federal Bureau here bers opposite, I think it must be admitted would include an economic entomologist to that the wool-growing and meat produccope with the many insect pests that are coming interests of Australia are of the utmon to all the States of the Commonwealth. most importance. This is one of the questions that will have to be considered by the Federal Government, as it has already formed an agricultural branch in the Northern Territory, with an experiment farm. If we had nothing else to deal with, the Commonwealth Parliament has at least the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory, which should give any amount of scope for all the experiments that we can call on our authorities to make. Mr Froggatt goes on to sayAmong the questions affecting the whole of Australia may be noted the following :-First, the locust, or grasshopper, plague. That is a growing plague, increasing i u intensity every year, most federal in character, and knowing no boundaries. The time is coming when Australia must treat the matter seriously, as they do in South Africa. Mr Froggatt saysThe time is rapidly approaching when Australia will have to deal with the locust question. tified its existence. The productions of The locust plague is growing every year, and whereas a few years ago we used to look on a visitation of locusts as a matter of merely a few days and some slight trouble, when they come into a district now we know they will not leave it until a considerable amount of damage has been done. Mr Froggatt mentions one of the most i m portant matters with which Australia has to deal-the fly amongst sheep. sheep have practically ceased to increase. All over tlie world there has been a great decrease in the number of sheep, but we in Australia have been priding ourselves on the fact that all along ours have been increasing. There can be no doubt, however, that unless we take steps to cope with the pests that trouble ourflocks we shall have before long a positive decrease. The fly pest is causing more destruction amongst our sheep than is anything else. as the result of the laying of poison for rabbits largely accounts for its existence. Mr Fleming. I have here some reParliament is the right authority to deal spite what may be said by honourable memmust be reducing our flocks. not so much to the lamb exports as to* the fact that we are not getting nearly so high a percentage of lambs as we used to obtain. The falling off is largely due to the f ly pest. Mr Froggatt saysIt has been estimated on good authority that this new and increasing pest has costthe sheepmen of Australia nearly ,£1,000,000 annually in loss of wool, sheep, and lambs, not including the increased expenditure m station management in dressing the blown sheep. In my estimation, Mr Froggatt has understated the position. As he points out, this is an Australian rather than a purely State matter, and if the Bureau of A g r i culture does no more than enable us to get r i d of those two pests it will have justhis country need to be fostered, and I hope that a Federal bureau will soon be established. Whilst the honourable member for Darwin was speaking, an honourable member of the Opposition inquired whether the Bureau of Agriculture in the United States had lowered the price of wheat. That has nothing to do with the question now' before us. We are face to face with the seriousfact that our productions are not increasing at anyOur thing like the rate at which our markets are extending. It is surely essentia l for Australia, if we are to keepup the balance of our exports over imports, that our production shall be in creased. In that way alone can we hope tomaintain the high standard of civilization and living which we enjoy, and which We all hope will improve rather than decrease. I trust that this bureau, which will extend its operations all over Australia, will do much to help our producers, and that it will so increase our production that we shall not only overtake our markets, but have more than",53,Robebt Best Th E Honourable The Charges And Liabilities Imposed By This Con

407,Mr Fleming,"The trouble is duesufficient to pay the annual amount of in terest on our public debt. I was very much struck by a paragraph, which I made prisoner, setting for th a statement made by Professor Watt, of the Sydney University, that I f all the dairy herds in the State were as good and as well cared for as the best, the output of butter would increase 50 per cent, without an additional acre ofland being utilized for the purposeA n d further, that I f all the wheat farmers in the State were farming to the standard of the best the average yield, would be increased 50 per cent, with very little increase in the cost of production. Those are weighty words. I find that if we could improve the average to the extent suggested by Professor W a t t , our annual wheat yield would be raised from 92,000,000 bushels to 184,000,000, representing an increase of £13,000,000 to the wheat-growers of Australia, whilst our yield of butter would be increased from 187,000,000 lbs. to 374,000,000 lbs., or an increased value to our -dairy farmers of £9,350,000. In addition to this, there would be an increase in the returns from milk, cream, and cheese. I know something of the butter industry, and I do not hesitate to repeat the statement which was questioned when I uttered it the other day, that the return from our dairy herds is only about one-half what it ought to be. The honourable member for Corangamite seems to be surprised, but we have to remember that he resides in a dairying district where the farmers get a return of from £ 1 3 to £ 1 4 per cow per annum. Those figures show how low must be the average in respect of some of our dairy farms, inasmuch as we are not getting throughout Australia to-day more than £ 7 per cow per annum. In Denmark the average return is £ 1 3 10s. per cow per annum. they get. well cared for, but as against that, feed has to be imported for their use. They have to be housed for the greater part of the year because of the severity of the climate. In Australia, however, we can leave our dairy herds unrugged for nine months of the year. D r . MALONEY districts that our dairy cattle are rugged at all. vide proper protection for dairy cattle during the winter months is responsible for heavy losses to our dairymen. The figures I have given should be interesting to honourable members, and if the Federal Bureau of Agriculture helps us to increase our average returns to the extent mentioned by Professor Watt, it will have achieved something of which we may well be proud. I wish now to quote a few figures showing what the States are doing ' for the man on the land by the employment of experts to assist him. According to a paper laid on the table of the House by the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales employs the following officers:-Agriculture , 405; forestry, 125; stock, 205; and botanic, 147, making a total of 882. The annual expenditure is £273,916. In the Victorian Department of Agricultur e the list of officers is as follows:-Head office, 3 2 ; agriculture, 50; stock and dairy, 83; export, 65; or a total of 230 officers, the cost being £154,858 per annum. In Queensland 336 officers are employed by the Department, and the cost is £100,857 per annum. In the South Australian Department of Agriculture the experts employed are as follow -Agri culture, 128; stock, 24; produce, department, 179; total, 331. The cost of the Department is £125,019. A Liberal Government in South Australia some time ago established a Produce Department in connection with which the largest butter factory in the State is conducted. It receives cream from the farmers, manufactures butter, and exports any surplus over local requirements, thus setting a very excellent example to the dairymen of the State. ciency of about £350,000 in connection) with that Department.

Care must be exercised that we do not overlap. harmony with the State Departments, and should make an effort to branch out upon new lines of investigation. Another matter which should also receive the attention of the bureau is the underground water supplies of Australia. We have far more water underground than we have in sight. Our artesian water supplies are the greatest we have. Mr Symonds, an agricultural chemist in the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales, said some time ago that if we could extract from these artesian supplies the minerals that are so destructive to vegetable growth and life, we should be able to open up millions of acres in the western and north-western divisions of that State, and to profitably cultivate them. I hope that the matter will receive the attention of the Commonwealth bureau, for if experiments in this direction proved successf u l we should be able to open up new country, and settle many people upon it . I heartily favour this B ill , and would like to see a really live Department of Agriculture established in the Commonwealth. There is a general consensus of opinion that the Federal Bureau of Agriculture is to be endowed with functions that are highly essential to the advancement of the agricultural section of the community. Anything that will tend to increase primary production should command the hearty support of all honourable members; indeed, there is no room for any opposition. The only question is, how far the States are prepared tb relinquish some of their present functions in order that a Federal Bureau may have f u l l scope for its activities. My idea is that this bureau, instead of being established for research work only, should be a practical as well as a theoretical institution. Comparisons have been made between the proposed bureau and that of the United States of America; but, as a matter of fact, there is no analogy between the two. The United States Agricultura l Department covers a wide field of research, exwork, such as we cannot possibly undertake. In the first place,'we have no command of the public estate, while the American Department has been enabled to achieve the great results it has, simply by the fact that, in the early days, two-thirds of the public lands were vested in the Government. This great distinction This bureau should work in between the two Constitutions ought to be borne in mind in discussing these matters. In America, the Bureau of Agriculture has the advantage of liberal financial support from the revenue raised by the sales of the public estate to cultivators. the state of the House.

I trust that this bureau, as a central body, will follow the splendid example set in the United States. There any farmer or settler, on written application, is supplied with a small booklet, and sometimes a large one, informing liim how to cultivate any special products. An in teresting fact is that, great as the value of the wheat harvest of America is, it is now second to that of the poultry industry. Some fifteen or twenty years ago, Australia lost a very valuable customer for her wheat in the French Government, because the article supplied was not up to sample. In other words, the wheat did not contain enough gluten; and the French have always been very particular in this regard, whether the bread be for their citizens at home, or for their convicts and soldiers in New Caledonia.

Over 20,000 varieties are planted at Dookie every year; and I may refer to the success that has been met.with in connection with what is known as macaroni wheat. Eveni n Italy, the white of an egg has to be added to the flour in order to in the case of the wheat grown at Dookie, the flour alone is sufficient. That needs only to be known to create a demand for our seed from all parts of the world. In this connection, I wish to pay a compliment, not only to Mr Potts, of. Hawkesbury, but also to Mr Pye, of Dookie, because these colleges, and others like them, are engaged in friendly rivalry that must prove of benefit to the whole community. best asset that a country can have is the scientifically trained farmer. compare the farming methods of England generally with the farming as carried on in nearly every part of the Continent, we realize that the old-fashioned ideas must give way to the advance of science-. It has beeu said that Denmark takes more sovereigns from England for her proauce than are represented by all the gold produced in Australia. they have learned to develop what are known as the heath lands, which, after twenty years' work, have been rendered f r u it f u l . If we are going to import specialists, I should say we ought to get them from Denmark or Holland, but only to supply us with information in branches regarding which Australian-trained men have no experience. We have university men now teaching, not only at Dookie, but at Hawkesbury; and they have, beside the necessary brain power, opportunities for acquiring knowledge to the same extent as workers in the same directions have in other countries. I look forward to the time when every young Australian, who has passed a certain standard of education, will have the right to choose his agricultural college, if he wishes to become a farmer.
