0,"Jtouse Of Ueprcseutatibcs. Friday, 30 July, Loop. A.m., And Read Prayers.","An article, written by some person connected with this House, has just been published by the South Australian Advertiser. In it my name occurs frequently, and most of the references to me are absolutely incorrect. I shall not refer to these passages in detail, but I refuse to allow misstatements to go uncontradicted. Whatever is written about me, the truth will ultimately be known. The article is headed,,. "" A Great Speaker,"" and begins in this wayI t was at the time when every one was wondering what was going to happen after Lord Hopetoun had sent for the Premier of the senior State, Sir William Lyne, to form the first Federal Ministry that two men were waiting on the North Melbourne platform for the express to arrive from Adelaide. These two were Mr Deakin and Sir George Turner, then Premier o i Victoria. I believe that, so far, it is correct. Subsequently it is stated that certain things were said to the late Sir Frederick Holder, and that the gentlemen .who met him tried to dissuade him from promising to join me in the formation of the first Commonwealth Ministry. The statement as to the communication from Sir Frederick Holder to myself is not correct. It is absolutely untrue that he declined to join me. Although, when it was found that he could not be stopped at the North Melbourne railway station, Sir George Turner was sent after him to get him to promise not to join me,' he agreed to join me, and we had a discussion in which we tried to arrange matters regarding the Tariff. He then came back from Sydney, to see two gentlemen in Victoria on my behalf, to get them to join with us. As he arrived on a holiday, they were out of town. I have little doubt that otherwise the Ministry, would! have been formed. I do not wish to enter into small details, and did not intend for some time to come to publish the early history of (Federation, though I got the consent of the Marquis of Linlithgow, before he left Australia, to do so when a suitable occasion presented itself. I am forced to do so. by this article, which, it is said, was written by a very close friend of the Prime Minister. I shall not mention the name until I am positive that my information is correct. pretty well guess who wrote the article. garbled statement, much to my disadvantage, has been published, and therefore I think the time has come for me to give the history of what occurred. That history will bring into prominence names which their owners would, I think, like to see left out, and other information which must ' sooner or later come to light. I regret very much that Mr David Syme is not now living, because he took my part; but there is a gentleman in Melbourne now through whom everything was done, and others, including a Judge on the Bench iii South Australia, who will be able to testify that my statement regarding the transactions of the time is correct. the subject? the matter to be treated lightly. It is a serious one. should always be treated seriously. An honourable member who thinks that he has been misrepresented is entitled to have his explanation' heard sympathetically. There are limits beyond which a member-making a persona] explanation may not go, and I am sure that the honourable member for Hume recognises that. I ask honourable members to permit him to .make his statement in his own way. weary the House with a long statement now, but shall content myself with giving reasons why I think the time has arrived when I should put myself right with the public in this matter. My actions have been misrepresented, I fear with the object of making political capital. I had intended",14,Setup

There are those alive to-day who will be able to prove my statement. I telegraphed to Sir Langdon Bonython on Wednesday night or yesterday morning, asking who the writer of the article was, but, following the usual practice of newspaper proprietors, he declined to give me the information. to know who prompted the article. idea. Sir Langdon telegraphed that he could not furnish the name, and added. Knowing Holder's version, can say article incorrect in parts. Did not see article prior to publication. The publication of this article must draw from me the full history of what occurred in connection with the formation of the first Federal Ministry.

AmI to be blackguarded without reply? I do not think that what occurred was confidential. I mention the matter because Sir Frederick Holder was a known Free Trader, and I a known Protectionist. The Tariff was the only thing that we ' really argued about. We came to the conclusion that we could harmonize our views with regard to it, and when that decision was arrived at, the difficulty was over, and be agreed to join me, and came to Melbourne with a message to two' gentlemen in Victoria. ter) [10.40] -My name having been associated with this matter by the honourable member for Hume,' I may say that I have no knowledge of the article, of what prompted its reference, or of anything connected with it -those of. the Government, has Colonel FoxSir assurance. in a position to say when he will propose an adjournment to enable Ministers to be present at the Premiers' Conference?

48,,"Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin)1 Five honourable members having risen in their Question proposed. nation of private banking institutions has announced that from the ist August next -they intend to charge i d . on each postal note or money order banked, and I claim -that, if this is permitted, it will seriously decrease Commonwealth revenue. I -desire to review the great powers with which the people of the Commonwealth have endowed the banking corporations. In 1908 the banks of issue of Australia made a net piofit of over ,£2,400,000 on a paid up capital of £18,000,000, or 13^ per cent. A financial man looking into those figures will see that the gross profits could not have been less than between ,£5,000,000 and ,£6,000,000. Those profits were made, not in the process of developing Australian industries or creating wealth, but in the process of enabling the producers and traders of the Commonwealth to exchange their property and products. The producers have had to pay to foreign banking corporations between £5,000,000 and ,£6,000,000 sterling for the right to exchange their own property and products, after furnishing the capital to those institutions In other words, gauging the gross profits, based on the net profits, the banks made £ 1 5s. per head of the whole population, and ,£2 13s. per breadwinner. Every man, woman, .child, and infant in its cradle gave .them a profit of 25s. per head for the right of exchanging his or her own property and products. -Commonwealth furnish the banks with ^46,526,971 of deposits not bearing interest, which the banks have the use of daily. ing in a bank knows that in the great cities that amount is paid over the counter_ fifty -or a hundred times, but it is all back"" in the banks, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for balancing, to be loaned out again next day. The deposits bearing interest amount to £71,218,463, so that those corporations have the joy of having ,£ii7>745>434 of -the people's money which they can utilize -to make profits on their shares, yet they are not satisfied, but want to drag the last penny out of the producers and traders of the Commonwealth. asked for order, and honourable members for you used some other bank as a bank of a moment appear to comply with my reexchange. The quest, but then they completely forget it. I hope I shall not be compelled to take other -places, steps, but I can assure honourable members that I shall do so very soon if disorder does not cease. listen to finance in this House, so I often wonder what is the good of bothering about it. the banks hold against those deposits? the gold of'Australia is only ,£24,000,000. There are deposits of ,£117,000,000 in the banks, and only ,£24,000,000 of gold. Therefore ,£93,000,000 must be balanced by paper against paper. against most of it. there was not? I am simply showing what benefits the people are conferring upon these corporations, which, nevertheless, want to destroy the little currency that the poor working man has as a medium of exchange. The highwaymen of olden days could not have done a worse thing. I am sorry to think that I was trained in institutions which would be guilty of trying to destroy the people's currency. Every time a man knows that he has to pay this charge he will write: -""Don' t send me a postal note, send a cheque, it is easier to negotiate."" I have had many letters lately to that effect. Every cheque that one gives on any bank in Australia will be exchanged between the banks. In Melbourne the banks will exchange each The people of the others' cheques. You can draw a cheque on one bank, and some one else may draw one on another bank, but there is no money taken out of either bank; Every man who has had a trainthey simply liquidate obligations, like the great clearing house of. London, by offsetting indebtedness. I hope honourable members will understand that there is never any money used in proper banking. It is only the poor man that uses money. No rich man ever carries money. The whole of the exchanging is done by offsetting indebtedness, and that is what is called international or local exchange. To talk about money is good enough for outside people who do not understand the question. Many years ago the Rt. Hon.

55,Mr King O'malley,"Who saidoperate a banking corporation without gold if it asked the Bank of New South Wales or the Commercial Bank to act as a bank of exchange for it, .letting that bank keep the gold. There is no need for honourable members to try to tell me about the business. I was reared as a child in it. I ask honourable members to study the question before they tackle it. I confess that I do not like moving the adjournment of the House, because I do not wish to take up time; but let me put another question. The banks pay taxes on about ,£4,000,000 of their note issue, but they issue ,£8,000,000. ,£4,000,000 of notes are in circulation, on which they pay-2 per cent., amounting to about ,£80,000 a year. My object is to show the tremendous privileges that we bestow upon the banking corporations. Another £4,000,000 of their notes lie in their branch banks as reserves, which they can utilize whenever they want to. Those reserve notes are the capital of the branch banks, and enable the institutions to take the whole of the gold away from their branches and operate in the big cities with it. I wanted to see if Australian ""banking was run in the same way as American banking, and I find that there is no difference in the basis. While the banks do not make a large profit on the circulation of their notes on which they pay the States2 per cent., yet they make an immense profit on the notes which are not circulated. member think the Commonwealth should work upon the gold reserves of the banks ? want to touch their gold reserves. Let me manage a Commonwealth bank for two years, and I will give the Commonwealth a gold reserve of its own without charge. I do not want any more money, so honourable members need not bother themselves about that. I am simply pointing out that the people of Australia are to-day living in a fool's paradise so far as finance is concerned'. They are running into debt year after year, and making no provision to repay. Australia in that sense is a "" ne'erdo-well,"" and it worries me. Every man to whom I speak says, ""Oh, the public works, if they were sold, would pay the whole debt."" What nonsense that is ! I shall have something to say about it on the Budget. The number of postal notes paid during 1908 was as follows :-Ne w South Wales, 2,700,000; Victoria, 2,091,119; Queensland, 500,000; South Australia, 421,783; Western Australia, 349,877; and Tasmania, 454,410, or a total of 6,517,189 postal notes cashed for the whole Commonwealth. bother to ascertain the value, because the banks propose to charge i d . per note. If they took the value as the basis I should not mind so much. With regard to money orders, New South Wales cashed last year 630,000; Victoria, 318,365 ; Queensland, 165,000; South Australia, 81,115; West Australia, 136,595; and Tasmania, 66,537, or a total of 1,397,612 money orders cashed for the whole Commonwealth. Adding the two together gives a total of 7,914,801 postal notes and money orders. A charge of i d . on each of these means that the banks are grabbing £32,978 from the people of Australia-fro m the poor. That is to come out of the pockets of people away in the back blocks. The small note will pay as much as the big one. The poor man if he owes money and has a postal note, pays it with that. note. He never goes to cash it himself. The poor man would not be poor if he were trained in finance. Not being trained, he goes to another man who is trained,, and gives him a profit for looking after his affairs. No man ever made money by working; men make money only by learning how to gather the profits of the work of others. As the honourable memthe honourable ber for Maranoa pointed out on Wednesday, the banks are now issuing to customers postal notes that have been used for the purpose for which they were originally issued by the Department. Many of these are being sent to Tattersall's. They are being used over and over again, but the Postal and Telegraph Department receives nothing in respect of them, save the fee charged on them when they were first issued. Is it right that such a practice should be allowed to continue at a time when the Treasurer does not know where to look for monev for defence purposes, the payment of old-age pensions, and various other matters necessary to a progressive community? Although we have £[24,000,000 of gold in the Commonwealth, the gold actually in circulation is only about .£5,000,000. The banks are allowed to have the use of enormous gold reserves on which they do not pay a penny. It is true that as soon as they put their notes in circulation, they have to pay a duty upon them, but bank notes, after all. only represent gold reserves. In this age of",18,Adjournment Formal Postal Notes And Orders Bankin G Charge

59,Mr King O'malley,"I did notprogress very little money is required for trading purposes. The great medium of exchange is not money, but fructifying indebtedness, or reinforced credits. Banks issue their credits in exchange for the credits of producers and traders, and these become transferable media of exchange, until they are finally redeemed by cancellation. We have a banking aristocracy which is a world unto itself. The people who are able to regulate the movements of the money volume-wh o are able to regulate the operation of the credit volumehave the power to raise or lower prices whenever it suits twenty or thirty of them to do so. They can by their operations affect the value of every property in' the Commonwealth, and it is amazing to me that an intelligent House like this is not prepared to seriously discuss these finanto virtually filch from the people ,£32,000 cial questions. It will be little short of an act of Divine Providence that will cause the House to discuss the financial question free from political partisanship and sectional bigotry. It is impossible to. accurately estimate the total loss of revenue resulting from the system to which I object. Buti f we were to introduce tomorrow a system that would make the Standard Oil Company pay a tax amounting t 0 £ 3 i ° ° ° per annum-and the re2 venue of that Trust is nearly three times as great as is that of the Commonwealth Mr Rockefeller would hurry to New York, and devise a scheme by which that loss would be transferred from the Trust to the Commonwealth. The banking corfeller, and if they are going to tax the people to the extent of £32,978 per annum, by this charge on postal notes, the Commonwealth will have to bear the loss in the shape of a depreciated revenue. that will force on a national bank. act on the part of the banks as the great hammer of heaven falling on the heads of the boodleiers. Why should we not offer Mr French, of the Bank of New South Wales, or Mr Everest, of the Commercial Bank, or the manager of some other banking institution, a big salary to take control of a national bank, in order that the Commonwealth may successfully carry on such an institution, and derive large profits from it? Just as the railways of the States are departmental concerns, so I would make a national bank a department of the Commonwealth. Since my fellow countryman, Mr Tait, has assumed control of the Victorian railways, they have been paying. going to quarrel with any one in regard to these questions. I repeat that Mr Tait is an able railway man, and that we must be prepared to pay for trained technical brain power. Last week the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out that the banks made £250,000 per annum by charging their customers ios. a year for keeping their current accounts. That is. another item which the people of Australia had not to pay until a few years ago. That charge is made, although the banks have the use of their customers' credit balances, and these institutions are now going per annum in respect of this impost on postal notes. That must be added to the £250,000 per annum they secure by means of a charge of ios. per annum on current accounts. is the amount derived by only one bank. The total in respect of all the banking institutions is £250,000. to that amount the £[33,000 which they are now making by means of this charge of one penny on every postal note paid in, we find that they are deriving from the producers of Australia, £[283,000 per annum, for which they give absolutely no service. be taken from about 500,000 persons. the number is less. I do not think that there are 500,000 producers in Australia. I trust that the Government will take steps to make postal notes a legal tender. if they do, they will immortalize themselves. Only such an action as that will make them live in history; they have done nothing yet to cause posterity to remember them. They should take steps to make postal notes a legal tender, and so teach the great corporations-thes e wolves-that they can no longer fleece the lambs of Australia. [11.27] I have one or two suggestions to offer the Government, with a view to a settlement of this difficulty. This tax affects not so much the large traders as those who are in a small way of business.

It would be an unhappy thing for us if we did not. But some of his serious remarks were received with levity. This is one of the most important questions with which the House can deal. those who, like the honourable member for Darwin, have studied matters of finance, know how far-reaching in its influence the action of the banks will be, though, of course, no estimate can be very accurate.* I was delighted to hear of the large increase in the issue of postal notes, but if the practice which has been objected to is allowed to continue next year, there will be a falling off,and we cannot afford to lose a penny of revenue.

One would expect in a debate of this"" kind to hear those who have been connected with financial concerns for many years, and who must know something of banking usages. We have the chairman of the Employers' Federation here, and he is associated with large moneyed interests in the country. Why is he not taking the floor on a question of the kind, and helping to assert the rights of the common people as against the great banking institutions? Then there is the honourable member for Parkes, than whom no one is better qualified! to inform us, associated as he has been for many years with all sorts of boards of control in financial concerns. Yet we never hear these gentlemen speak on the subject they are most qualified to deal with. The Treasurer has asserted his knowledge of finance; and it would not be overstating the case, I think, if I said that he regards himself as a financial expert. Yet we never hear that honourable gentleman taking part in a debate which may be of assistance to the people. There seems to be a conspiracy of silence amongst honourable members opposite'the moment a question is raised affecting great financial institutions. they have not had permission. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not know whether the interests of those honourable members are so interwoven with the interests of financial institutions that they dare not assert themselves here in their representative capacity. They ought, however, to remember that they do not come to this House as the representatives of their own interests or the institutions with which they are connected, but as representatives of the people who are affected by such actions as that contemplated by the banks. In the Melbourne Age of the 8th of this month, the following appearedThe report noted the success achieved by the deputation from the Employers' Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the Labour Government, and which resulted in the appointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question, while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions. That shows that the Employers' Federation, with, the moneyed interests behind it, is exerting pressure on the present Government. In the same report we are told that the Postmaster-General, after listening to the representations made to him regarding the very matter under consideration by the secretary of the Associated Banks, and representatives of other institutionssaid the explanation given showed the subject in a new light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders' association made further complaint. Is it not a ridiculous attitude for a Minister to take up, that he should, when asked to conserve the rights of the people, take his instruction from the secretary of the. Associated Banks and from the Employers' Federation? I had no desire to take part in this debate; but I think we are indebted to the honourable member for Darwin for bringing the subject up. That honourable member is one of the few who make an earnest attempt to deal with financial questions which affect the people. I do not pretend! to have any great qualification to speak on the subject, but, as a young man who is endeavouring to learn something about these great problems which I know vitally affect the people, I feel, as I say, that I am deeply indebted to the honourable member for Darwin for placing such proposals before us from time to iime with the view to conserving the interests of the rank and file, as against those of the great financial institutions-the money bags of Australia. Notwithstanding the fact that, on a capitalized value of about £[18,000,000, the banks hadi a profit of £[2,400,000 last year, they are not satisfied, but desire now to impose a tax on the postal notes and post-office orders of the poorer classes, to the amount of nearly £[33,000 per annum. It is said that this tax will not affect the poorer, people; but, as a fact, anything which depreciates the currency of the poorer people must affect them. currencv out of use. Mr J. H .

CATTS -According to ""the returns the banks have 500,000 accounts, and, although all of them may not be very much in credit, they practically supply the floating capital on which the banks operate their business.

Mr J. H . CATTS -The banks have the benefit of all these current accounts, out of which they make huge profits, and still are fifty they make a charge of ios., simply and solely because they have a monopoly-because there are no other means open to ihe traders of the community. If we had a Commonwealth bank, there would be no talk of a charge of the kind. The banks, having obtained this £[250,000 per annum from the small traders for keeping their accounts, now go a step further and make a charge on postal notes and post office orders, with the effect of placing another £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 in their already overT h e banks have overfilled coffers. If we sit down and permit this, what will be the next step? The banks have it within their power to extend credits and limit credits, and by that means to tighten or loosen the money market which in turn largely influences the prices of property, lands, and commodities, and thereby increase or decrease the purchasing power of wages. We hear a lot said about arbitration and other industrial Courts raising the value of comJOH N FORREST -I s it a common modities, and we are told that, on account of the Tariff, £[ 1 will buy only as much now as 16s. would ten years ago; but, from my study of the question, the expansion and contraction of credit has JOHN FORREST:-Then the honormuch more to do with decreasing the purchasing value of money than has the action of the Courts.

96,Mr Wilks (Dalley) [11.58],"Therewho, under cover of the motion, has presented to the House, in a sort of axiomatic manner, a knowledge of banking science, for which, probably, many members did not give him credit. I take the liberty of saying to members of the Labour party that, judging from certain scholastic training I had in my earlier life, the honourable member is absolutely sound in the ideas he has expressed this morning; and honourable members on this side, who have practical experience, cannot dispute his contentions, more particularly those in relation to banking corporations. We have also to thank the honourable member for Balaclava, who admitted the weakness of the banks' position, and suggested how it should be altered. His suggestions were those of a shrewd business man He realizes that the banking people have bitten off more than they can chew; and, speaking from his experience, he has advised them to back down under cover as quickly as possible. But the matter has gone a little too far for us to allow them to take cover under the honourable member's wise advice and suggestions. Personally, I thank him for his keenness and shrewdness. His speech was an acknowledgment that the banks have, gone beyond their functions, and apparently he has pointed out to them ti.e dangerous path that they are now treading. This debate has drawn attention to a neglected power of the Commonwealth under the Constitution-the power to pass banking legislation for the whole of Australia. The banking corporations, by their greed and avarice, in trying to get a poundage on postal notes, have really awakened this Parliament to the necessity for introducing banking legislation, and so exercising a power which has lain dormant too long. Some honourable members say that the honourable member for Darwin puts the subject in a humorous manner; but it is one of that honourable member's characteristics to illuminate his addresses by a certain amount of personality. Certain other honourable members are so intensely respectable and dignified that I believe they would play the Dead March, and palm it off as a wedding march. Thev try to pass through the .world as knowledgeable men by clothing themselves with a serious air, and a mien of ultra-respectability, to conceal their begin reprisals upon the banks, a readv lack of knowledge. member is very severe. honourable member for Parkes was so sensitive. He is one of the striking examples of whom I am thinking, but I thought his epidermis was more like that of a rhinoceros than the tender covering which it now seems to be. peculiarities or distinguishing characteristics of honourable members have to do with the question before the Chair. crowning disgrace that you do not possess a sense of humour. If the honqrable member for Darwin wrapped himself up in the air of a bank official, walked slowlv to the table, joined the digits of each hand, and took a quarter of an hour over each argument, he would probably pass for a serious and well-advised man like the honourable member for Parkes. The question before us is the invasion by the banks of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament. To show the importance of it, I would draw attention to the general use of postal notes in the daily life of the Commonwealth. In 1901 there were issued in the whole Commonwealth 3,516,908 postal notes of a value of .£1,293,039. In 1907, the most recent year for which complete returns are available, 6,077,237 postal notes were issued, of a value of £2,271,155. There was, therefore, in six years an increase both in volume and value of nearly TOO per cent. In New South Wales, to show what a ready medium of exchange they have been made by the people, the total number of postal notes issued in 1906 was 2,161,069 °dd, of a value of about .£808,759. By T907 the number had grown to 2,436,085 of a value of £887,105. These figures show to what extent the interests of a large section of the public are involved. The notes are a public convenience. The honourable member for Wentworth pleaded that the banking authorities had a lot of trouble with regard to the matter, and that it involved a great deal of clerical work. He forgot to point out that the banking institutions are presented with the use of a number of facilities at the cost of the Commonwealth, without anv charge for them. Take the circulation of cheoues as an instance. If the Commonwealth wished to means to hand would be to treat all cheques going through the post as registered letters.

100,Mr Wilks,"Then, sir, it is your£[33,000, and lessen the value of a public convenience, they will be met with reprisals like that which the honourable member for Darwin said that skilled financiers in the Old World resorted to. If the Postmaster General desires to regain any ground in this matter, I make the suggestion to him to treat cheques passing through the post as registered letters. The Post Office is becoming a larger and larger concern, and it is performing banking business in the interests of the general public. The growth -in the number of postal notes is an evidence that that work is valued, and taken advantage of by the community. The honourable member for Wentworth, when he argues that :we are only fighting on behalf of people in a large way of business, does not go far enough, because the class of people who use postal notes is mainly the industrial class, and by far the larger proportion of the -notes are for amounts of £ 1 and under. In many parts of Australia they are not even conveyed to a bank, but are passed from hand to hand like bank notes as an ordinary medium of exchange. The difficulty in the way of making them an actual medium of exchange is that certain clerical work with regard to signing them would have to be got over; but that could be done. The bank officials, who are generally well advised! and shrewd, have overstepped the mark on this occasion. I am not surprised that the bank managers, who simply work on routine lines, knowing their banking science and insolvency laws, but not knowing the world beyond, should have recommended this step; but I am surprised that the bank directors, who are men of the world, did not see that they were arousing the dormant power of the Commonwealth to establish a national bank. This discussion has done a lot of good. When banking legislation is brought before the House, the banks will undoubtedly ask for many -conveniences and facilities, and. out. of the -mouths of those who have been silent today, there will proceed many respectable and heavy speeches in the interests of the banking corporations. No attempt will be made in those addresses to depart from -stereotyped phrases. They will be uttered slowly,' and will sound well. Commonplace generalities will take the place of originalside. So far no Minister has taken any ity, and because they are spoken slowly, an -opportunity will be given to the reporters to record them, and to the House to accept the instructions which they will be intended to convey. But one happy feature of this debate is the evidence that the Labour party, or any other advanced party, will now give more attention to the immediate necessity of introducing banking legislation. I believe the shrewd suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava will be acted upon to-morrow morning by the banking authorities. He has simply said: "" Get cover as quickly as you can, boys; the lions are roused. You have gone too far; it is not worth the risk; stronger measures will follow."" I am surprised that the Postmaster-General has. not already made a suggestion similar to that of the honourable member for Balaclava. When legislation is introduced honourable members will be found to be much more versed in the higher branches of banking science than other people think. Because a man betrays his individuality and makes his points in a characteristic manner, it does not follow that he is ill informed on these questions. I admit that the banks have a perfect right under the present system of private enterprise to do the best they can for themselves. I do not blame them, but I do blame the authority which allows them to impose a fresh tax upon one of the conveniences of the people, when they have already a large number of facilities given to them free. Let them demand their pound of flesh if they like. Thev have a perfect right, as a business concern, to make a charge to meet expenses for clerical labour. I do not ask them to be charity-mongers or philanthropic institutions ; but I do say, as a representative of the public, that the Commonwealth must wake up, and, in turn, make its proper charges upon the banks for the free facilities which it now gives them. It will be a fair go, and the question will not stop here. I do not suppose it can be done during the life of this Parliament, but I hope that whatever Government is in power in the next Parliament will be forced to bring in banking legislation, and that the outcome will be the utilization of our postal service to form the nucleus of a national bank. seems most peculiar that when any proposition emanates from any honourable member on our side of the Chamber, so little notice should be taken of it upon the Ministerial interest in the debate. I look upon this as one of the most serious problems that the Postmaster-General has to face. I suppose, as there are no chambers of commerce, or chambers of manufactures, or banking institutions on this side to wait upon the",25,Adjournment Formal Postal Notes And Orders Bankin G Charge

Always attribute motives. has been taken in this debate by any Minister in the chamber? I am not imputing motives, but stating facts. Nine-tenths of my constituents use the postal note service. Hardly a mail comes from Queensland in which I am not asked to induce the Postmaster-General to afford facilities for getting postal notes. To people living in the bush a postal note is practically currency. No one can bear me out more strongly than can the honourable member for Darling Downs, because the same thing happens in his district. The Postal Department in Queensland) gives every possible facility to people to get postal notes, and the Deputy Postmaster-General in that State has, since he went there, opened more offices for the sale of postal notes than have existed before. He is increasing the facilities for that purpose every year, and postal notes are practically becoming the currency in Western Queensland. People in far back portions of that State find it easier to obtain goods from Brisbane and to send postal notes in payment for them than to obtain their supplies from the nearest town; it is easier to forward postal notes through the post-office to BrisAustralia, and I speak with more knowbane business houses. They, now find that on every postal note which they use for the payment of services rendered, or goods supplied, they are to be penalized by the banks to the extent of i d . This question is of great interest to the people generally; and particularly to those who reside in the back places of Australia. If there is one section of the community to whom my heart goes out more than to any other, it is that section which resides in the to stand out against the proposal to make back-blocks of the different States, for I have lived in such places, and know the disadvantages under which they labour. If it is possible for the Postmaster-General to make their lot a little easier than it is, I hope that he will do so, and I am sure that any such attempt on his part will receive ithe cordial assistance of his colleagues. It is imperatively necessary that action should be taken at once. Notice has already been issued by the banks that the charge is to be levied as from ist proximo, and I ask the Treasurer, in the absence of the Postmaster-General, to take this matter in hand without further delay. If the banks are not prepared to accede to our request, I am satisfied that the Government will be able, within twenty-four hours of its introduction, to pass a Bill that will give effect to our desire. As a one-time bank clerk of seven years' experience, I wish very briefly to put the views of the bank clerks in regard to this question. Their contention is that there is more trouble involved in entering up a post office order than there is in entering an ordinary cheque. I dare say that the average amount of the cheques that are drawn by customers of banking institutions in Victoria is considerably over £ 5 , whereas the average in respect of postal notes is probably 5s., or even less. A great deal of work is involved in dealing with these small notes. to put in his six or seven hours a day.

150,Mr Groom,"Quite so, but Queenshad seen. Mr A. C. Gregory, another explorer, had also been across the Territory; and he, and all acquainted with the facts, spoke highly of this portion of the continent. Some correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Governments of Queensland and South Australia took place in regard to the disposition of the Northern Territory; and the request of Queensland was not that it should be attached to that State-it was felt that Queensland had enough territory to develop-bu t that it should be annexed by South Australia. The South Australian Government asked for the annexation, and in the year 1863 the annexation was made. failed to settle the Territory. ously attempted to settle the Territory. English settlement there to-day. tempt at colonization, or to govern the Territory in an administrative way. By letters patent on the 6th July, 1863, the Northern Territory was annexed to the province of South Australia. That was in pursuance of two Acts of Parliament; one, passed in 1842 for the government of New South Wales and Van Diemeri's Land, giving authority to erect into a new colony any territories within New South Wales, and the other, passed in 1861, dealing with the Legislature of Queensland, and containing a clause, enablinjg the Imperial Government, by letters patent, to annex to any colony in the continent of Australia any territory which, in pursuance of the previous Act, might have been created a separate colony. Mr W. H . IRVINE -There is no constitutional difficulty raised, is there? been only suggested. The substance of the letters patent has accordingly been set out in the memorandum I have circulated. As I say, this Territory was annetced to South Australia by letters patent. Australia. the acquiescence of. Queensland. letters patent, while they contained a clause enabling the annexation of the territory to South Australia, also gave power, at any time, to revoke the annexation. In 1882, the South Australian Government sought to have that power of revocation withdrawn, and to have the Northern Territory permanently annexed'. That request was refused by the Imperial authorities, but, as we know, under the Constitution Act, the Northern Territory was incorporated as part of the province of South Australia. Therefore, South Australia has power to deal with the Territory-to surrender or dispose of it, just in the same way as New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland may deal with any portion of its territory. It is in pursuance of that power, which is undoubtedly possessed under the Constitution, that we are asked to-day to accept from South Australia the transfer of the Northern Territory. ister account for the paucity of population, when there are such fine rivers and lands ? the honourable member to the report of a South Australian Royal 'Commission of 1895, a portion of the report of which appears in the memorandum, showing the causes suggested for the failure. No doubt mistakes have been made in the government of the Northern Territory; but has any State governed the whole of its territory without error? South Australia, according to the best of the financial ability of those in power, attempted to deal with a serious problem. I ask honourable members to remember that had South Australia been completely successful in its dealings with the Northern Territory, and succeeded in settling it with a population of, say, 500,000, the Territory would to-day have been a separate State. What, then, has South Australia done in the past? In her attempts to settle-the Territory, she landed herself in heavy financial obligation. To-day the State has a population of 398,093, but for the whole of the period of forty-six years a small population took upon themselves a great burden of taxation, until now, I believe, South Australia is the second most heavily taxed State in the Union. any alternative? tive of abandoning the Territory, but South The Australia has acted according to British tradition, and borne a great burden rather than sacrifice the Territory.

Northward from the Jervois range a that estimate is a somewhat conservative great tableland stretches for hundreds of miles. one. The southern limit is 2,500 feet above the sea; the map is in itself almost a province. thence it gradually falls until it meets the coastal ranges bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean. Owing to the eleland. vation above the sea, the climate is perfect, and there seems no reason why agriculture should border, and the Cloncur-ry railway line not flourish, the rainfall gradually increasing could be extended into it.

Then again Mr Winnecke, another explorer, Springs, saysreportedMy experience of the Northern Territory extends over 35 years. I have been astounded at the frequent mention of desert country. My experience is that some of the finest pastoral country in the world is to be found in Central Australia. Water, principally artesian, is more abundant than supposed. . . . Another, who has had great experience in the north, Mr Giles, saysFrom the northern base of the MacDonnell Range to the west range (Hann) is a distance of 70 miles, the whole of which is magnificently grassed, although timbered thickly in places by mulga (acacia). At 25 miles from the MacDonnell Range are rolling downs thickly grassed and equal in richness of soil to any in South Australia, being inundated plains of rich black and red soils, fit for the growth of wheat. This excellent country extends east and west for considerable distances, also to the north-east and north-west. Mr John Costello, of Lake Nash, in giving Mr H. Percy, a Queensland stock-owner, evidence before the Royal Commission, gave evidence thatsaidThere is a large area of country from Newcastle Waters and the head of the Roper to the Queensland border at Cammoweal. This magnificent belt of country known as the tableland may be said to be the cream of the pastoral land of the Territory. greatest faith in the future of squatting in it. I have travelled over most sheep raising country in Queensland, and I can safely say that in no part of that Colony have I seen country better adapted for wool growing than this splendid Mr Groom. obtained in this country at a depth varying from 150 to 250 feet. sonally informed me that it would carry at least 10,000,000 sheep, whilst the more on the opinion expressed by men who have travelled over the country again and again. The enormous tableland, shown on raising country, Mr E. S. Flint, of Alice Cattle and horses thrive well, especially the latter, which in dry seasons are able to travel farther from water to feed. He was speaking then, not of the tableland to which the honourable member for Kennedy has referred, but that part of the Territory, which is often referred to as desert countryI am of opinion that Central Australia will be the chief horse-producing district of Australia. Its contiguity to the tropics renders horses more hardy, and better able to cope with the heat and other drawbacks attaching to a tropical country than animals bred further south. Professor Spencer, who, in 1901, visited the Territory saidI saw wide areas of magnificent stock country which only requires water to make' it habitable. And the needful water can be obtained partly by artesian boring and partly by conservation. I have seen nearly all the best coast country in Queensland, and I can safely say I have seen none that I like so well. I was surprised to find it so good, as, previous to my visit here, I had heard the Northern Territory so often run down that I looked upon it as a foregone conclusion that I should see inferior country; I have the fullest and but it is nothing of the kind, and it is destined sooner or later to be made use of for agriculture and to carry a large population.

Mr David Lindsay, than whom no one has a better knowledge of the Territory, and' who those who have met him will admit, may be relied upon to give a judgment based on experience in summing up the whole position in regard to the Territory, saysThus we have a country capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of cattle and horses and millions of sheep; extensive agricultural areas which will produce sugar, 'rice, coffee, cotton, and nearly all other tropical and sub-tropical products necessary for our use; and the wonderf u l mineral wealth of gold, silver, tin, and copper, all combined, will make the somewhat despised Northern Territory of vast importance, and place it in the front rank of the Australian States. By glancing at' the map which I have caused to be exhibited in the Chamber, honourable members will obtain an idea of the extent of the area, concerning which these opinions have been expressed by practical men. The areas at present occupied under lease are coloured pink on the map, and perhaps at this stage it may be well to give honourable members some figures as to the actual occupation. The total' area of the Northern Territoiy is 335,1.16,800 acres, and of that only 473,809 acrescoloured green on the map-hav e been alienated in fee-simple.

Honourable members will find in the memorandum I have circulated a complete list of the lands held under lease. The leases extend over periods ranging up to fortytwo years; but a portion of the time of some of them has already expired. of the occupation and settlement of the Northern Territory, the question that will confront us in regard to the large areas, totalling 99,740,068 acres, held under the long leases, is a serious one. long. twenty-five years to forty years. that the leases have been in existence. to the best land in the Territory. from the evidence, they relate to some of the best land in the Territory.

Some of the best lands in the Territory are to be found in the Victoria River district. purposes, but not for all. country comprises good agricultural '-and pastoral land. As honourable members are aware, the coastal fringe contains agricultural country.

When the Northern Territory is taken over by the Commonwealth, it will be open to the Government, if they desire to acquire some of the better lands now held under lease, to exercise their power of resumption with compensation.

The officer in charge of the botanical station considers the Territory suited for such productions as maize, tobacco, rice, palms, fibre plants, arrowroot, spices, sugar, rubber, and tropical fruits. His experiments with upland rice have been so satisfactory that he is confident that the crop will be as valuable to the Northern Territory as the wheat crop is now to South Australia. been grown successfully, and is beginning to be planted for commercial purposes. He looks for a great future from it. With regard to the mineral resources of the Territory, let me read the opinions of experts, who speak very highly of its possibilities. The Rev. J. Tenison Woods saysI confidently assert that the Northern Terridroughts do not periodically occur there, tory is exceptionally rich in minerals, only a as elsewhere in Australia. small part of which has been made known to consider the matter impartially, will be the public.

On Monday last the Soutli Australian Government received a telegram from Mr during the summer months, yet the annual range Brown, the Government Geologist, reporting a very important discovery of Mr Groom. gold in the Northern Territory, at a place about 400 miles south of the Vic-; toria River, and at no great distance from the border of Western Australia. In regard to this, Mr Brown telegraphedI am of opinion that this gold discovery is an important one, and that the rich stone found on the surface and in the lodes will continue in depth, and can be followed down by proper prospecting. The rock formation of the district examined by Mr Murray and myself, and noted above, is typical auriferous country. Altogether the prospects are sufficiently good to warrant every arrangement by the Government in well Sisal hemp has also sinking, as the want of water is the greatest drawback to development and prospecting generally. There is a report from the Minister of the Northern Territory, in which the same mine is also referred to.

As to its It will be noticed by reference to the figures, that while temperatures are hotter in Australia is considerably in excess of that of more equatorial latitude, and, consequently, from this. point of view, is more endurable for the permanent white settlement,' year in and year out, than is either Cevlon or the Malay Peninsula. The humidity and wet bulb results give also a like verdict. Tropical heat, when associated with high relative humidity, is muggy and oppressive, has an enervating effect, physical and mental action is considerably reduced or becomes even impossible; these conditions undoubtedly exist in the northern parts of the Territory for nearly six months of the year. The winter months in this area, however, enjoy a climate which should render mental and physical effort distinctly possible, if not enjoyable, by reason of the dryness and comparatively cool nights. Notwithstanding the high temperature, the general dryness of the interior should cause the expenditure of energy to be possible all the year round, and the climate should not have a ""deteriorating effect upon a white population. This fact has been demonstrated in Western Queensland, South Australia, the northern parts of Victoria, and the western districts of New South Wales, where temperature records in excess of those experienced in Central Australia have been registered by many degrees. Captain Barclay, F.R.G.S., who has lived there for years, saysIt is true the climate is tropical, but, at the same time, it is, without doubt, the healthiest tropical climate in the world. Experience has amply proved that settlers from Northern Europe can live, work, and thrive, evxai in the town of Palmerston on the shores of Port Darwin. Many instances can be pointed to where three generations lived, strong and healthy, two having been born within its limits; whilst the average children about the streets are at least as rosy and chubby as any in the Commonwealth. 1 frankly admit that there are contrary opinions, and these are set out fairly in the memorandum. But experience has shown that the northern districts of Queensland can carry a white population, and that the legislation which was passed with a view to promoting white settlement there has been successful. It must be remembered that the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory vary considerably. On the coast, the climate is humid, but inland it is drier and cooler. Emphatically, the Northern Territory is a white man's country. In return for the surrender of this Territory, and all the State property, what does the Commonwealth undertake? the covenants in the order in which they appear in the agreement. The Commonwealth, in clause (1) (a), covenants with the State of South Australia to become responsible for the State indebtedness in respect to this Territory. The loans outstanding, on the 30th June, 1908, amounted to £[2,768.062, less £[16,169 unexpended; and a sum to the credit of the sinking fund amounting to £26,132. total of £42,301, the indebtedness comes to £[2,725,761. In addition, we undertake to be responsible for accrued deficits amounting to £602,222; the total obligation being, therefore, £3>327»9 38 clude all deficits f scription in connection with the administration of the Territory by the State of South Australia. The annual interest will be £110,999; a r , d t r i e annual payment to the sinking fund £[6,963. As regards, the dates of the redemption, honourable members will find a complete list in the memorandum. The figures I have given have been supplied by the South Australian authorities, and have been provisionally checked by the Treasury; but, of course, should the Territory be taken over before the Bill is proclaimed law, the figures will be subject to exact revision. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The expenditure, exclusive of interest and sinking fund, is given for 1907-8; is there an estimate for the preceding years? looks at page 33 of the memorandum, I think he will see the figures for five years set out. Paragraph b of clause .1 of the agreement sets out that the Commonwealth undertakes toConstruct or cause to be constructed a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which railway with the 1 ail way from a point on the 'Port Augusta railway to connect therewith is hereunder referred to as The Transcontinental Railway). Then, by paragraph d of clause 1 of the agreement, the Commonwealth' undertakes toConstruct or cause to be constructed as part of the Transcontinental Railway a railway from a point on the Port Augusta Railway to connect with the other part of the Transcontinental Railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. At the present time, there is a line from I will take Palmerston to Pine Creek, a distance of 145 miles. This small line has a small surplus in earnings over expenditure. In 1907-8 it was £[402.

However, that is a question for the Parliament in the future. Supposing that the gold-field referred to were to prove a second Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie Coolgardie, all right! must not despise Coolgardie. If the goldfield should prove a second Kalgoorlie, and attract a large population, it may be necessary to have railway communication from quite a different direction. I think I have made it quite clear what our position is under the agreement. Mr W. H . IRVINE -In any case, the line constructed must connect with the Port Augusta railway? nect at some point on that railway; but, as I have already shown, we are not bound down to any time at which the line shall be constructed.

What can happen is that the Queensland people may push their, system right up to the border, seeing that it is now within 150 miles of it. get from it exactly the same communication I have figures here showing the distance of the Queensland railways from the border. From Cloncurry, the distance is about 150 miles, from Winton it is about 300 miles, from Longreach it is about 360 miles, and from Charleville about 480 miles. It will be seen, therefore, that Queensland is already stretching her railways in the direcnaturally flows from the Northern Territion of the Territory. best position in relation to the Territory. that the eastern State must be connected with the Northern Territoiy line. Until [69] the railways are so connected in such a way that we can gather military strength in the shortest possible time from the different centres of population, we cannot regard the line as complete. However, these are glimpses into the future. Then, under the agreement, we undertake to acquire the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta; and I think that the acquisition is perfectly justified. The Commonwealth will then control the whole of the railway traffic on this line across the Continent from sea to sea. traffic. able traffic. railway be made? railway over, and pay for it at its cost price j and that is only fair, because it represents the expenditure of the State. If the Western Australian line be completed, the Commonwealth will have complete control of railways extending from Port Darwin, and from Port Augusta, to Kalgoorlie. that this Northern Territorv line will be constructed before the Western Australian line. honourable member is quite fair in making that suggestion. I never hinted at such a thought; on the contrary, I think the honourable member will admit that I have fought continuously and strenuously for the rights of Western Australia, as I know the Treasurer also has. The honourable member must realize that when we are dealing with national problems, it is better not to suggest that this or that State may reap particular benefits. So far as Australia is concerned, we want both lines. If this railway is constructed, South Australia will with the north as other States can have under the agreement. The agreement has no clause preventing other States from being connected with the line. South Australia will get no more benefit than any other State. If the trade naturally flows to South Australia, she will get it. If it tory to Queensland, Queensland will get it.

All we ask is that the route shall be decided in such a way that we shall get the communication with the north that historical associations and geographical relations entitle us to have. I have dealt with the Commonwealth obligation, so far as the liability upon that line is concerned. The total capital liability on the Port Augusta railway will be .£2,242,342. In addition to that, there is a sum of £29,292 in connection with the construction account, and the annual interest amounts to ,£84,688. The line shows a surplus of £1.2,000 in earnings. this for a deficit of .£77,694, made up by deducting earnings and adding sinking fund contribution. we are under in respect of this part of the agreement.

In addition, it covenants to give consent to the construction of the Western Australian railway through its territory. One other matter respecting the liability connected with the overland telegraph line, must be mentioned. In the keeping of its accounts, it has been debited to South Australia alone, and not to the Northern Territory.' -We have made an arrangement with South Australia, to be carried out under this Bill,, by which we agree to compensate the State for so much of the line as runs through the Northern Territory, as transferred property.

In addition to that, we become This is the liability liable tor the loan amounts which I have already stated. There are two points in which we criticise the Act which the South Australian Government has passed. Section7 seems to us to impose a restriction upon our power to deal with the lands in the Territory. The South Australian Government have promised to amend that section if our Act is passed in its present form. We contend that if the Commonwealth takes over the whole Territory, we should be free and untrammelled in dealing with the lands as we think fit. That condition is set out by us in clause 10 of our Bill. We shall recognise all estates and interests which are held at the time of transfer, but we reserve to ourselves full power to deal with them as we think fit. The only other point of difference between us is whether, according to their Act, we are not bound by certain conditions of South Australian legislation with respect to railway construction. On that point also the South Australian Government have promised to meet us, if we pass this Act. pear in the South Australian Act? with raihvay construction.

235,Mr Henry Willis,What about the,41,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill Second Reading
236,Mr Groom,"That is a matter for theis inevitable. We have to decide whether we shall face the question of the settlement of the Territory seriously or not. My hope is that the Commonwealth will do it. It will be, of course, for this Parliament to decide its own policy in that regard if it takes the Territory over. One thing is clear, that if the Territory is to be developed, the backbone of any policy to secure its settlement must be railway construction. Side by side with railway construction there will have to be? an immigration policy, and an exceedingly liberal land policy, by which people can acquire land on the easiest possible terms. There will also have to be liberal mining legislation to assist in the development of the mines, and the people will have to be prepared for measures providing for advances to assist agriculturists and other settlers to occupy the land. There will have to be. generous assistance in the shape of experimental farms to test the possibilities of the soil, and to give instruchave, at all times, to defend, and possibly tion and help to those who are prepared to undertake this great work. Every encouragement will have to be given by Parliament to assist pastoralists and others to market their produce, and to discover new markets for them. Water supply and conservation will have to be undertaken on a large scale. Those may, or may not, be matters of proper State action; but my own opinion is that this Parliament will have to adopt them, if it proposes to approach the question seriously. We can no ionger stand idly by and see the small population of the Territory getting smaller every year. We must regard it as a national obligation to do all that we can to develop, not only this, but all the other portions of northern Australia. Mr W. H . IRVINE -No time is fixed in the agreement for the construction of the new railway, but I suppose it is understood that it shall be proceeded with practically immediately. standing, but what is contemplated is that, if the Commonwealth takes over the Territory, it will seriously face the question of developing it. Parliament will first have to be guided purely by national considerations. It will then have to be guided also by what is best in the interests of developing the Territory itself, and, further, by what is best in the interests of Australia in promoting Inter-State trade and commerce. We may build 100 miles or more of the proposed railway this year, and so many [69J -2 miles next year. We may concurrently build in another direction, to open up another part of the Territory. But, clearly, the understanding is that the objective shall be the construction of the transcontinental line connecting Port Darwin with Port Augusta. doubt upon that point. the objective clearly contemplated by a fair and reasonable interpretation of the agreement. This is not a matter affecting South Australia only. The security of all the States of the Union from attack in the north is a matter of Australian concern. It is, perhaps, more important to Queensland than to South Australia that there should be a large and prosperous population there. It is important to New South Wales, because, if an alien race did get a footing, and gradually moved south, Australia would have a frontier which it would at enormous cost. Therefore, in the interests of the preservation and occupation of the Commonwealth as a whole, we ask honourable members to pass the Bill, and to affirm the desirability of taking over the Northern Territory. adjourned.

In the early days of Federation, Sir George Turner, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, instituted the practice of remitting to Lon1 don almost simultaneously with an order for works or supplies being placed there, the moneys which had been appropriated for the year in respect of them. That practice has been continued up to the present time, so that work may be paid for as soon as it is completed.

Balances have remained in the hands of the London Agency, but have been treated in the public accounts as if they had been expended within the year for which they were voted,' although they were not actually paid over until some time after the close of the year. The Auditor-General has demurred to this procedure, and has said that balances so remaining at the endj of the financial years should have been taken into account in the distribution of our surplus revenue among the States. form really part of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth? moneys not having been actually paid in the year in respect of which they were voted, the Auditor-General contends that they form part of what we call our surplus revenue. In order to get over that difficulty, this Bill is submitted. Honourable members will recognise that if the existing system is to be continued, it is necessary that this Bill should pass, and that it is well that we should remove all dbubts in regard to the matter. contention is that until the money is actually paid away, it should not be treated here as having been expended. and he desired that legislation should be passed to remove all doubt in the matter. I do not think there can be any objection to this Bill. It is designed really to carry out what, I am sure, is the desire of the House : to validate the custom that has hitherto prevailed in regard to the expenditure of votes beyond the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, I am sure the Opposition will facilitate its passing. [3.36] -The Minister did not say whether this Bill would be retrospective.

Hansard is set up for members, and for distribution by members. It is stereotyped by the Government Printer, and it does not matter how many copies he rolls of f . Especially in view of the action of the press in refusing to publish the utterances of certain honthe House and reported in Hansard they 'orable members, .Hansard is the only means by which the majority of honourable members can reach their electors. If they are prepared to pay the extra cost for cross headings, which do not go beyjond the speech itself, the Government Printer loses nothing, the Government lose nothing, the country loses nothing, and honourable members have an opportunity of placing before their constituents speeches which otherwise they could not afford to print and circulate. Every convenience should be given to honourable members to let their electors and the public generally know what happens in this Parliament. I shall shortly move for the establishment of a daily Hansard. I have all the particulars of Committees that have sat in other States, and my object in moving in that direction is that the electors may know what takes place in this Parliament. They cannot learn it at present from the press. The Treasurer, if he looks at his own speeches, will find that he stands at the head of all honourable members in altering and embellishing speeches, and putting cross-headings to them. orable members were debarred to-morrow from making use of Hansard, the right honourable member could go to the most expensive printing establishments and pay them to do the work. The cost would be Sir William a bagatelle to him; but other honourable members are not in the same fortunate posiThat has tion. The Treasurer and the Ministry should be the last to restrict the rights of honourable members, or to prevent the electors from knowing what goes on in this House. They should rather be the first to give honourable members all the facilities possible for distributing their speechescheaply and effectively.

I hope that there will be no curtailment of the privileges of honourable members in'this regard. As long as the cross-headings inserted are in reality part and parcel of the speech delivered in ought to be permitted; but I disapprove of the introduction of outside matter in such reprints. the premises of the honourable member for Hume's argument were correct there would be little to object to in the conclusion at which he has arrived; but I take it that Hansard is not published for the benefit of honourable members.

The Treasurer has been accused of inserting cross-headings in reprints of his speeches from. Hansard, but I know him well enough to believe that now that it has been pointed out to him that it is wrong to do so he will not sin again in that. respect. I believe, too, that honourable members on this side of the House, realizing the false pretence of publishing as a reprint of Hansard what is not an exact reprint, would be very loth to interfere with the publication of reports of proceedings in. this House in the way now asked for by honourable members opposite. intervene in this interesting discussion chiefly to point out that the difficulty which has arisen may be overcome by the omission -of the words, "" Reprinted from the Parliamentary Debates,"" from the cover of -speeches issued in pamphlet form.

Surely the Government will not be so unfair as to prevent the republication of speeches that are informative to the public. If so, the only inference is that they fear the light which we are throwing on their actions. But passing from this incident I must compliment the Government on the fact that two Ministers are now present in the Chamber. It is a truly marvellous spectacle. Wlhen important private business was being discussed in the House yesterday, there was not one Minister present, and there were only two or three of their supporters in the Chamber. I tender them, and particularly the Treasurer, congratulations on their persistent attention to business in the Chamber. But there is a point beyond which they ought not to go. They are treating the House with a degree of contempt that certainly ought to earn them short shrift. party were in office they were always away. apologize for to the honourable member for Bourke in respect to our actions as Ministers. for Bourke has made a wild statement.
