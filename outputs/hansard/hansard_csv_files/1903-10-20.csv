Mr O'malley","I desire to ask the Prime Minister, withont notice, whether, in view of the fact that the House of Representatives has selected Tumut, and the Senate Bombala, for the Federal Capital Site, while the members of both Chambers are in favour of having a Federal territory of not leas than 1,000 square miles, the Go: vernment will bring in a short Bill to provide for the submission of the question to a referendum of the people at the forthcoming general elections? site is fixed with sufficient precision to enable such a referendum to be taken with advantage.

Should not the collection of such duties, except in regard to Western Australia, have ceased on the 8th October? member was good enough to inform me this morning that duties were being.collected at a certain township on the border,.and I at once had a telegram despatched to the Customs officer there to ascertain the truth of the report, The officers of the Department have no. authority for collecting Interstate duties now, because those duties ceased to have force on the 8 th of this month. There has been some little 'trouble in adjusting values in regard to the consumption in each State, so. that we have not yet been able to make an alteration with regard to Inter-State certificates. Action is, however, being taken with a view to arrange, if possible, some easier method of ascertaining the amount to be credited to each State than that of preparing and forwarding InterState certificates.

In Tasmania boats are hired by the Department, and in South Australia a launch is hired. In New South Wales three men on the average are employed on Sundays, fche duty being performed alternately by the boatmen. In Melbourne five are employed.

31,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Minister forPatents Acts, and would confer no substantial benefits upon applicants."" Thus three objections are urged to the provision in question. The first of these I venture to think, evinces a misunderstanding of the intention of the whole of that part of the measure which relates to the Commissioner's appointment. From the information which has been supplied to me, it. appears perfectly clear that his appointment must precede, by a considerable time, the f u l l commencement of this Act, inasmuch as in bringing into force a single patent system which shall replace the six systems at present existing in the States, it will be necessary for him, not only to organize the new Department ancl consider all applications, but to take the necessary steps-as I frequently explained -to have the registers and indices of the States revised and brought up to date. It has often been assumed in this House that perhaps as long a period as a year must elapse between the appointment of the Commissioner and the actual commencement of the Act in its full sense. I do not know how far that estimate is well founded; but, probably, it may prove to be not excessive. Therefore, I am quite at a loss to understand the objection which is expressed in this particular reason of the Senate. The next reason which is urged by the other Chamber, that the clause would tend to conflict with the States Patents Acts is not, I think, well founded, because provision is made in the Bill by which applications may be registered, both under the Commonwealth arid the States laws, by any who desire to do so, and who consider that by so doing they will obtain an advantage. They can persist with either or both of their applications should they determine to pay the fees. Under the circumstances, I fail to see where any conflict will arise between applications which are made under the States laws and those which are made under the Commonwealth Act. 1 have never disguised from the Committee, however, that the clause must be fraught with difficulty in it s . working, and that many problems may arise in giving effect to it. However, it was strongly pressed upon the Committee, on the ground that it would convenience inventors, and that by its insertion the indefinite delay in conferring the advantages which are offered by this measure would be avoided. A t the same time, those who for any reason distrust this procedure, are still given an opportunity to proceed under the States laws. inconvenience to which the Prime Minister alludes ? aboutfcopass a Commonwealth Patents Act. That Act cannot commence until many investigations have been made and a new patent system has been prepared. In the interim inventors who wish to protect themselves throughout Australia are required to lodge their applications in every State and to obey the requirements of the States laws in fact,fcofollow the same course which they would have followed prior tofchepassing of this Act. We offer them fche means by which they can lodge an application for the whole of the Commonwealth-a n application which will be inquired into by us at our expense in all the States, and for which a patent will be granted in order of priority, though it will date only from the complete commencement offcheAct. By that means we thought we had successfully bridged the interregnum. The third objection which has been urged by the Senate is that the clause would confer no substantial benefit upon applicants. To that I have already replied. Only to-day I received a telegram from an Adelaide patent agency which in somewhat excited language protests that the effect of this provision would be ""dangerous and misleading,"" that it would cause "" endless litigation,"" ""conflict of concurrent State applications,"" and "" irremediable chaos."" Indeedi t contains quite a number of patentable phrases. centralization in the applications. they need be. analyze what these fiery phrases really mean. Probably they are aimed at fche words "" according to the time when they were so lodged."" Possibly the authors of fche telegram have in mind the facb that there are time zones in Australia, and that a question may arise asfcowhat allowance ought to be made-althoug h I think that there is a strictly fixed difference-as between an application for a patent which is lodged at Perth, in the extreme west, and another which is lodged at Sydney, in the extreme east, at approximately the same hour.",15,Court Senate S Message Amendmen B Disagreed To

37,Mr Deakin,"I have endeavoured toways arise under the Bill. have enacted a provision which will prevent that difficulty when the measure comes into f u l l operation. But I suggest that if we omit the words "" according to the time when they were so lodged,"" and substitute for them the words ""asprescribed,"" we can then, by regulation, define precisely-or , at least, with as nearly as possible astronomical accuracy-the manner in which priority shall be settled when conflicting applications have been almost simultaneously lodged at widely distantplaces intheCommon wealth. When we have done that, it appears to me --afte r re-reading the clause and admitting the practical difficulties which will arise in its working-that we have inserted a provision which may prove very serviceable to inventors and one which does not present the possibilities of disaster and even chaos pourtrayed in the telegram to which I have referred. the honourable gentleman affect the second paragraph of the clause ? The authors of the telegram fear that an application which is lodged in the central office will always obtain priority. by regulation we may remove all ambiguity. We seek to make it quite clear that we have the same power in regard fco the second paragraph of the clause that we possess in respect of the first paragraph, hence I submit the amendment indicated. That, I think, will remove the difficulty which has caused the senders of the telegram to which allusion has been made so much anxiety. I therefore move That the amendment be insisted on, but that tbe clause be amended by the omission of the words ""according to the time when they were so lodged "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" as prescribed."" I can scarcely understand how "" irremediable chaos"" will be brought about by the operation of this provision, although fche phrase in question is very suggestive of South Australian language. The senders of the telegram have not indicated what part offcheclause they consider may lead to ""irremediable chaos,"" and I think that in the circumstances we shall have to be content to remain open to that contingency for all time. I should not be surprised, however, if their difficulty were in regard to the dating of the patent. A I do not think so. We patent, of course, cannot be dated except as from the commencement of the Act;, but if two patents were granted as on that date, there being no guarantee of novelty, how would the question of priority be determined 1 received first on thafc date would receive priority. in making grants of patents to record the hour at which the application is made. minute. not yet seen the telegram, the contents of which have rather astonished the honourable and learned member for NorthernMelbourne; but I think that the difficulty is that the agents in question fear that under this provision agents in Melbourne would obtain priority over agents in fche other Statesi n respect of applications lodged by them. When the suggestion was made that provisional applications might be lodged under fche States Acts and regarded as applications for Commonwealth patents, no objection was offered, the opinion being held, apparently, that such applications would have absolute priority in the States in which they were made, and that no question could arise as to priority having been given by any central office. No opposition was raised to that proposal, which was designed to accomplish the very object which this provision has in view. I think thafc fche objection in this case is that the clause would enable patent agents resident in Melbourne to make applications which would have priority over those made in the other States. I do not consider thafc the clause would necessarily have that effect; but thafc is apparently the reason which has caused the agents in question to oppose it. If the regulations are carefully drawn up, the amendment should allay their fears, and in the form now pro posed, the clauseought to be insisted upon. support the amendment proposed by the Prime Minister, for I believe that when the matter is thoroughly investigated, it will be found by another place that their objections fco the clause are not substantial.

47,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I desire to the appointment of a Commissioner under this Bill should precede by any considerable interval the date of proclamation. According to those who have an intimate knowledge of the working of the States Patents Offices, some twelve or eighteen months will elapse between the passing of the Bill, and the date ©n which the new system will be complete, and in order that the whole of the necessary machinery may be brought into perfect working order as early as possible, it is necessary that the Commissioner should be appointed without delay. It is probable that the full difficulties associated with the transfer of the Patents Offices from the States to the Commonwealth have not yet been fully realized, and that they will occasion considerable delay. That being so, unless this clause be agreed to, inventors will be placed in a very awkward position. To my own knowledge several inventors have been holding back tlieir applications for patents in order to secure the benefit of this legislation. Some of them are not in a position, while others are not prepared, to incur the very heavy cost of registering throughout the States under the existing systems, and they hope to secure material relief by the passing of this Bill. Unless this clause be agreed to, however, they will not be able to test and perfect their inventions until the Act is actually brought into operation. Isi t desirable that inventors should be denied the encouragement and relief which we propose to give them under this clause 1 It seems to me that the Senate has overlooked this phase of the question. Ifc is also complained by another place that this provision would conflict with States registration. I do not think that that would be possible. If an inventor desires to register under the States laws prior to the coming into force of this Bill he will be able to do so, and to complete his application as soon as the Commonwealth system is in proper working order. If an inventor is given a free hand in this respect no doubt he will choose the course that seems to him fco be the most advantageous. It is said further fchafc this provision would confer no substantial benefit on applicants for inventions. Those who are anxious to take out patents at fche present time hold an entirely different opinion, and they desire that this clause may be inserted in order that they may have some guarantee fchafc whilst fche preliminaries incidental tofchebringing of the measure into operation are being disposed of they will be able to lodge their applications and have them registered as soon as fche new machinery is in working order. This clause will give them that guarantee. There are stringent conditions in the Bill as to fche time within which an application for a patent must be completed, and as to the non-disclosure of the nature' of an invention in respect of which a patent is sought. A complete specification must be lodged within nine months after fche date of the application, and those who propose to secure patents under this measure are not, sure that, in the absence of this concession, they will be able to comply with that provision. If this measure does not actually come into operation for twelve or eighteen months the Commissioner will have to disallow their applications, inasmuch as, in fche absence of a provision of this kind, the conditions cannot be complied with. The clause will give a sense of security to inventors who are in that position. I feel satisfied that when another place views fche question from this standpoint their objections will be removed; particularly as the Prime Minister proposes to eliminate some words, and to make the intention of the clause clearer by substituting others. I hope that the Committee will agree to send the measure back to the Senate with good and substantial reasons why the amendment now before the Committee should be adopted. think that the various firms of patent agents in South Australia, who joined in sending to the Prime Minister the telegram which has been read, have been well advised. They have put the matter strongly. The term "" irremediable chaos "" has evidently struck terror into the hearts of the Government, who, not knowing precisely what it refers to, proposefcomeet an objection which they presumefcobe made against fche clause. ThoughI do not like leaving too much to regulations, and though admittedly the fixing -of priority amongst applications for patents is an important question, still, in a matter of this sort ifc is, perhaps, just as well fco make fche provision prefcfcy elastic, as is done by the amendment proposed to be made. I shall, therefore, support it . regnum.",17,Court Senate S Message Amendmen B Disagreed To

49,Mr Deakin,"It applies only to an intervery short interregnum. is that as to priority. important that it should be fixed by Parliament, but I see no objection to regulations, particularly in view of the strong language used by the South Australian patent agents. I may here say that I know that the patent agents in South Australia'who have been mentioned, as well as other patent agents who might be mentioned, have gone to a good deal of trouble in connection with this Bill. publicly to acknowledge here the assistance rendered by various patent agents in the different States. They undoubtedly applied themselves keenly to the problems dealt with in the Bill, and they have displayed a public spirit in connection with it that does them every credit. I should also like to say that I am not at all satisfied that there is a necessity for any considerable postponetwo or three applications may be made in ment of the commencement of this measure. I know that stress has been laid on the suggested necessity of postponing for some period the coming into operation of the Bill. that any such necessity exists. I believe that the Patent Offices of the different States are in fair working order, and, with an intelligent appreciation of the position on States for a Federal patent there may be a the part of the Federal officers, and a deterquestion as to priority. I , therefore, think we mination to make the inconvenience to the public as little as may be, the Bill may be brought into operation without considerable delay. I fully believe-o r rather I have the impression-that it was the intention of the Government to consolidate not only the Patent laws of the States, but also the States laws relating to copyright and the laws relating to trade marks. I know that a general Bill was prepared, but that it was thought to be too huge a measure to be introduced into Parliament this session. I think, further, that it is advantageous to separate the two or three questions I have mentioned, and to provide for them by separate Bills, rather than to cause confusion by consolidating legislation that is not so intimately associated that it needs to be included in one Bill. But I am sure that bhe Government will be well advised-and I am hopeful that it is their policy-a t the earliest possible time during next session to introduce the necessary Bills relating to copyright and trades marks for the consideration of the Legislature. They will find a mass of material already prepared and practically settled. The recess, however short, will enable them to put the finishing touches upon theBillsI have mentioned; and I think I do but express the feeling of the Committee when I say that honourable members will welcome the introduction of such measures, so that they may be passed into law, and so that the questions of. patent, copyright, and trades marks may be covered by a Commonwealth law perfected and enacted at the earliest possible moment. Motion agreed to. not sure that a similar amendment ought not to be made in the second paragraph, which provides thafc applications may be made before this measure comes into force to a State Patent Office, and that such application may be regarded as equivalent fco an application under a State patent law. It may be that different States on the same day. The question of priority will then arise. When an application is made for a patent under a State Patent Act the question of priority is But I do not believe determined. There is no question about it , because whichever application was first in receives priority; but when there are two or three different applications in different should put in similar words to meet the contingency I have mentioned.

Both this amendmenb and the following one relate to the requirement inserted in this Bill that all patentees may be called upon within five j'ears, if the invention patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia, to commence its construction or manufacture here. the Senate for objecting to the clause is thisBecause the desirability, if any, of the clause is obviated by the succeeding clause No. 83. Clause 83 does to a considerable extent provide for a similar contingency. It provides thatAny person interested may, after the expiration of two years from the granting of the patent, allege that the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to a patented invention have not been satisfied; and pray for the grant of a compulsory licence. The Commissioner considers the petition, and if he is of opinion that a prima facie case is made out, he refers it to the Supreme Court. He may, if not satisfied, dismiss it himself. If it be referred to the Court, and the Court is convinced that the reasonable requirements of the public have not been satisfied, the patentee may be ordered to grant a licence, or the Court may itself grant a licence for the manufacture of the patented article. that extent clause 83 covers the same ground and meets the same set of circumstances. The Senate, when the measure was introduced, struck out the provisions with which we are now dealing, and which were then more absolute in their terms than they are at present. It was with a view to endeavour to win the approval of the Senate for these clauses that I introduced amendments which the Committee will recall, and which, in cases where it was desired to require a patentee to manufacture in the Commonwealth, threw on the person who moved in the matter the burden of satisfying the Court that the patent was reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured in Australia. These were safeguards which do not exist in the Acts from which the proposals were copied. I had hoped thafc, mitigated ancl safeguarded by these conditions, the Senate would see their way to accept the provisions. The members of another place, however, are still adverse by a considerable majority, and they point out-as , indeed, was pointed out in this Chamber that the same urgency does not exist for these provisions as would have existed if clause 83, with its elaborate provisions which may be brought into play after two years, had not existed. ""Under the circumstances, it rests with the The reason given by Committee either to repeat their recommendation once more, or to recognise that even if ifc be repeated ifc is very unlikely to be accepted.

64,Mr Deakin,"The section in CanadaB ill generally, I suggest to the Committee that it might be advisable at this stage not to insist on sending these clauses back to the Senate. After the two considerations they have already received, I have little hope of the opinion of another place being altered. I move That the amendment be not insisted on. glad the Prime Minister has taken the stand which he has indicated, and I hope the Committee will adopt his suggestion. The provisions are not essential to a Patents Act, but deal with production, and really affect the fiscal issue. Unlike clause 83, the provisions under consideration are not a part of the policy of the patent law itself. Clause 83 covers much wider ground than is covered by the English provision from which it is adopted, and which has been in force only for about twelve months. It was regarded as a very far-reaching provision, and was the result of a good deal of deliberation. I mentioned when we were discussing the Bill that, although a similar provision had found a place in the Canadian Act, it had not been enforced-that it was a dead letter. I am glad that since our previous discussion, the Prime Minister appears to have been informed that the statement. I made then was correct. I had very good authority for stating that the Canadian provision has never been enforced. Under regulations, some declaration has to be made in Canada that the patent has been worked, in order to take it from outside the operation of the section; but, like many other similar declarations, these are made as a matter of course. show honourable members correspondence in which it is made clear that in Canadai t has tion. I have a strong feeling against the become almost a recognised practice to make those declarations. officials or agents who will make the declaraaltogether a wrong principle to ask for the rations by the dozen if they are adequately paid for the trouble. I am informed of one case in which £ 1 0 was paid for the making of a declaration, and in which part of that amount went to the local agent, part to the Canadian agent, and the balance to the man who made the affidavit. I hope honourable members will adopt the suggestion of the Prime Minister. agree with the honourable and learned principal inducements to honourable members member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, than this is not a proper provision to insert in a Patents Act. have more to do with production than with patents. has that aspect; but, in my opinion, it is a provision which strictly ought to come within the purview of a patents law. Certain privileges are given to a person outside Australia in return for some benefit conferred on this country ; and it is proper enough to ask that, within a reasonable time, the manufacture of the patented article shall begin within our borders. It is curious that we should insist on extending such great liberality to people in other parts of the world, who do not usually extend a hand to us. article, surely they are benefiting us 1 in some cases; but the question is whether they are benefiting us sufficiently, or to a degree commensurate with the protection or monopoly granted. In some countries there is a similar provision to that now under consideration ; and there, evety person who chooses to come along is not granted patent monopolies at a very low price, and without any subsequent licensing conditions. In this regard we are, I think, unwisely liberal to the people of other countries. I quite agree, however, with the Prime Minister that, in view of the attitude of the Senate, there is little use in our pressing the clause at the present time. It is a matter which, very probably, the Commonwealth will have to regulate later o n ; indeed, the whole measure will require radical amendment before it can be regarded as anything like a permanent settlement of the patents quesmethod employed under the Billi n conThere are regular nexion with the payment of fees.

73,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"Ito pass an Australian Patents Bill. is no reason to think that on reconsideration the matter may not elsewhere be regarded in a different light. The importance of the clause seems obvious, and I am surprised at the view ©f the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that it is not a proper provision for a patents law, being, as he contends, a part of the fiscal issue. It is .nothing of the sort; and it would seem as though the fiscal issue is the only issue which is ever before some honourable members. The Bill provides for the granting of a monopoly for a period on certain conditions; and, if the conditions are not his plant may have the effect of increasing fufilled, we are surely entitled to say that we will notgrantthe monopoly. If a patentee will not comply with such a provision within five years, why on earth should he still hold his patent to the exclusion of somebody else who may be prepared to fulfil the condition t be allowed to import his patent. granted an Australian patent unless he manufactures the patented article in Australia. This has nothing to do with the fiscal issue. It means simply that we refuse to give patentees a monopoly except upon certain terms. W it h respect to the argument that a similar provision is not used in Canada, who is to say when a whip is used ? You have a whip and the horse knows it. You may not require to use it once in a blue moon; but the knowledge that you have it is a very important incentive to the horse to go; and the fact that a clause of this nature is in the Canadian Act leads to the development of Canadian industries. I hope the Prime Minister will not give .up this clause, which a great many of his followers are anxious to see incorporated in the first Australian Patents Bill. I regard this Patents Bill as one of the principal industrial measures brought before the Commonwealth Parliament, and I should feel greatly disappointed if we did not let it be clearly known from the very inception that we will not give an Australian patent unless the Australian public are to have the advantage of it by the manufacture of the patented article here. thoroughly agree with the remarks of the honourable and, learned member for Northern Melbourne. I am not in favour of the shepherding of rights in Australia to the There prejudice of the public. I do not care whether it applies to the locking up of land which might be utilized, or to patents. A patent is given with the object of enabling some one to work an invention in the Commonwealth, and to prevent any one else working it without his authority; but it was never intended that a patent should be granted for the purpose of enabling a man to enjoy a monopoly and to leave it entirely unutilized-to sleep on his rights and prevent any one else manufacturing the patented article within the Ccmmonwealth. . the price of the article tremendouslv. learned member says that we may increase the price of the article by causing the inventor and manufacturer to double his plant. We have hedged this provision in every conceivable way. I take it that it was an important principle as originally introduced, and it commanded the acceptance of this House in the first instance. When objection was taken to the clause by another branch of the Legislature the Prime Minister went out of his way to meet the difficulties then raised, and in doing so he met the very difficulty suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, by providing that this provision should come into operation only when it was clear that the patented article was capable of being commercially manufactured within fche Commonwealth. Here is the clause as we have it before us and as objected to by the Senate. It providesThat if the patented article is reasonablv capaule of being commercially constructed or manufactured, or the invention patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia, the patentee or some person authorized by him shall within five years after the date thereof commence, and after such commencement continuously carry on in Australiafcheconstruction or manufacture of the patented article, or the working of the invention patented in such a manner thafc any person may obtainfchepatented article or the use of the invention afc a reasonable price. Ample time is given in the clause, and surely in connection with a matter of this sort, the establishment of a 'monoply, we are asking nothing but what is fair and right when we claim that if the patented article is capable of being successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth it should be manufactured here.

As regards the inventor, it is surely right that we should say to him' "" Exercise your right; we do not require you to do so as a condition to the preservation of your patent unless the patented article is capable of being commercially manufactured here."" I ask honourable members to look at the further qualification and say what possible mischief can arise under this provision in view of clause S2B; which provides thatNo proceeding shall be instituted forfcherevocation of a patent for any breach offcheprovisions of the preceding section except in the High Court and by the Attorney-Generaland I direct the special attention ofhonorable members to what followsand then only in case the Attorney-General is satisfied thatfchebreach is injurious to the traders orfchemanufacturers infcheCommonwealth. This provision proposes to give a great power to a trusted officer, the chief law adviser of the Crown, and a Minister responsible to this House and to the public for its fair and judicial exercise. The matter must be looked afc in this way: Ifc being proved on the certificate of the that the omission to work the patent is detrimental to the traders or manufacturers of the Commonwealth ; proved, also, in the terms of the previous clause, that the invention is reasonably capable of being manufactured successfully in the Commonwealth, is contained in this Bill withoub these then, in the event of the continued refusal of clauses. the patentee to exercise his right under fche patent, what is the right course for us to the Prime Minister will not be moved from adopt 1 I believe that no Legislature of bhe his purpose by the hysterical observations of Commonwealth can be advised to say any the last speaker.

A similar provision exists in Canada and also in Germany. It is said that this power has not been exercised in Canada. It is suggested also that one reason why it has net been exercised, is that declarations have been made in fraud under provisions of this sort. If that be so, let us profit by bhe Canadian lesson. If tbe laws there are drawn on such lines tliat a coach and four can be driven through them, let us be caref u l in this respect. I say that this clause as originally framed, and particularly as modified by the Prime Minister, is fair in itself, and necessary for the protection offcheindustries and manufactures of the Commonwealth. It can only be enforced when fche Attorney-General has expressly certified that its enforcement is necessary in the interest of our trade and manufactures. It seems to me, under all fche circumstances-considerin g that patents are granted for their exercise in the country and not to the injury of the interests of the country in which they are granted-that if ifc be proved bhab a patented article can be made in the country in which the patent is granted, that the country is suffering from bhe nonuse by the patentee of his patent rights, there should be power to declare the pabeub void in addibion to the power which under bhe Bill may be exercised by privabe individuals of obbaining a compulsory licence to manufacture.

80,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I hope thatMelbourne are very emphatic in disclaiming the idea that any question of Tariff is involved in this proposal. Buti t seems to me that all their arguments point to the conclusion which they disavow. The last i speaker pointed out the injustice of allowing an inventor to withhold from Australia the manufacture of any article. It would have been much more to the purpose if he had named any article which could be commercially manufactured in Australia, but which is not. Out of the wide range of human requirements he has failed to instance a single article which could be manufactured here, but which is not being made here, and is at the same time being sold here at an unfair price. I suppose that if the old order of things had been continued and he were in the Parliament of South Australia, he would insist upon putting in its Patent Act a provision that the article must be manufactured in the State even if it were being manufactured well in Victoria. Isi t reasonable to suppose that an inventor or a manufacturer would not do the best he could for himself and for his customers ? Take any complicated machine-the linotype, for instance : Does anybody mean to tell rae that if the American Linotype Company were compelled to put up a plant in Victoria, they could afford to sell the machines at the present price to Victorian customers ? Nothing of the kind. The price would be increased by at least 50 per cent. There is so limited a demand for such machines in Australia that the output would be small, and it would be impossible to secure any outside market. So that the Victorian user of that, or any other machine of the kind, would be compelled to pay a much larger price than he is now asked to pay. Sir paragraph 6 a machine could not be imported after four years. General certify that the absence of manufacture would be injurious to public trade? learned gentleman has, in clause 83, all that he and those who think with him can legitimately claim. If a commodity were not being sold at a reasonable price to the consumer a person could get an order from the Court authorizing its production in Australia. session I hope that the Committee will concur in the action of the Senate. I may say that a few years ago, when this project was originally mooted, it did seem to me to wear a somewhat reasonable aspect, but on going more fully into the matter, and ascertaining the cost of producing, for a limited market, any of the complicated machinery which is being manufactured under patent, I came to the conclusion that it would be disadvantageous, not merely to the consumer, but to everybody connected with the industry, to establish that principle here. I hope that the course suggested by the Prime Minister will be adopted. -The honourable member for Coolgardie has spoken under a misapprehension. The case of the linotype would not come under this clause at all. It is obvious that as the the market is so very limited, no Attorney General would dare to certify that he was satisfied thafc fche breach was injurious to the trade and manufactures of the Commonwealth. commercially manufactured here. honourable member for Coolgardie was that the linotype could not be commercially manufactured here, and thafc, therefore, the patent ought not to be revoked, but if he will look atfchesafeguards in the clause he will see that there is no such danger as he anticipated.

We are asked to place in the hands of the Attorney General for the time being a weapon by which he could coerce the patentees of particular articles. Of course, if we place in his hands a weapon by which he could terrorize the owner of a patent and say"" Unless you come to me and settle things I shall bring an action for the revocation of the patent,"" well and good ; but no honourable Attorney-General would like to have such a power placed in his hands, because he would see the use which might be made of it against him, even under ordinary circumstances. A power like this ought to be conferred after full debate in Parliament. Are we going to hand over the powers of the House to an Attorney-General who might institute an action at law. which, in nineteen cases out of twenty, would be initiated before we should know anything about it. A t the time it was inserted in the Bill one naturally that the absence of an honest copythought that it was a monstrous provision, which could have been carried here only because honourable members had not thoroughly grasped the use which might be made of it as against individuals. This Parliament is, of course, one of the most honest that have ever existed ; but it is quite within the region of probability that we might have an Attorney-General who might use this power for his own advantage. In the State of New South Wales a recent Minister for Lands was compelled to retire from Australia, because of the manner in which he exercised in his own interests certain powers intrusted to him by Parliament. learned member refers to a corrupt exercise member has misunderstood me. I never of power. is generally believed to have been guilty of absolute corruption. A very strict Attorney-General would decline to have a power like that contained in the clause intrusted to him. It is proposed to give to the Attorney-General the power to determine whether action shall be taken for the revocation of patents. I say nothing about the dishonesty of such an arrangement, though, in my opinion, it is an infringement of the law of nations. We know what has happened in Canada under a similar provision. There one or fcwoMinisters have been absolutely open to corruption. Why should we give this power to a Minister? Why should not Parliament deal with the matter itself 1 Even from the protectionist point of view, it must be wrong to deal with the matter in the way proposed. A clause like this will not benefit Australian inventors. So far as they are concerned, there are very few patented articles which can be sold in Australia in such numbers as to permit of their manufacture here. It is necessary, however, to give a monopoly to the patentees to encourage invention.' There could not be a better illustration of the manner in which a departure from a sound principle like this carries with it its own condemnation than the effect upon American literature of the American departure from the paths of common honesty in the matter of copyright. different now. opinion of men well qualified to judge right law was of the greatest disadvantage to American authors and to American literature. No Parliament should leave it to an Attorney-General to say whether an action at law should or should not be brought. These matters should be determined by Parliament after a special consideration.

That is undoubtedly due to the protection which has been afforded to manufacturers and others within the State. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa said that it would be unsafe to invest the Attorney General with power to bring into operation such a clause. I have, however, more faith in the honour of the members of the legal profession than has the honourable and learned member, and I cannot conceive of such dreadful things as he has pictured happening'in connection with the Commonwealth Government.

I think that by ordinary administration, all that this Bill aims at accomplishing could have been easily accomplished. I would point out to the Prime Minister that the measure contains no definition of the term ""public body."" Is there such a definition in the Acts Interpretation Act? fine the right of suggestion to public bodies, we shall require a definition of that phrase. A t the same time. I am not at all satisfied that we should limit that right to public bodies. It is proposed to publish these statutory rules for public information. Therefore, I say"" Let &ny one who chooses to do so send in any suggestions which he may desire to offer."" It is quite possiblethatsomeof thesuggestions may prove extremely valuable, even though they do not emanate from public bodies. In my judgment we should make the power of suggestion general. There is another provision here to which I desire to call the attention bf the honourable member for Melbourne. I know that he used to feel very strongly upon the propriety of some notice being given before any statutory rules could become operative-that he disliked provisions under which they could be brought into operation forthwith. Subclause 2 of clause 3 declares that these rules "" shall come into operation forthwith or at such time as is prescribed."" Under that provision power is given to bring rules into force at a later date than that upon which they are made by the rule-making authority, but power is also conferred to make them retrospective. I suggest that it would be better to make the clause read "" either forthwith or at such later time as is prescribed in the rules."" I confess that I am not impressed with the necessity which exists for the introduction of this measure. Certainly English legislation was recently enacted upon the subject, but I am satisfied that everything necessary could be accomplished by discreet administration. pared this Bill with the English Act of : of forty days, which is prescribed in 1893, and I find that it is practically framed | sub-clause 2 of clause 3, will be found upon the lines of that measure. The House, therefore, need entertain very little hesitathe present time we tion in assenting to it. The English Act has been found very useful, and has been the means of obviating a very great deal of inconvenience and annoyance. The objection which has been urged by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, in regard to the term "" public body "" is, to my mind, a sound one. In the Acts Interpretation Act that phrase is not defined. The measure, however, sets outIn any Act, unless the contrary intention appears-(a ) "" Person"" and "" party "" shall include a body politic or corporate, as well as an individual. There is no necessity, therefore, to define the term ""public body,"" because we can achieve all that is required by substituting for it the word ""person."" I shall support the second reading of the measure, especially in view of the fact that legislation upon similar lines has been found very beneficial in England. The Prime Minister has also assured us that the Crown Law officers consider this Bill a necessary one. They must entertain the opinion that it will prove extremely useful at the present time, otherwise they would scarcely ask Parliament at this late period of the session to assent to it . that honourable members should have been furnished with some explanation in addition to that which was given by the Prime Minister in support of this Bill. Certainly if its passage were a matter of urgency it should have been presented earlier. I confess that I was unable to obtain from the Prime Minister's speech a fair idea of the scope of this measure. It seems to me that there is no reason whatever why its provisions could not have been incorporated in the High Court Procedure Bill. to other matters. and regulations which are made under any Act of the Commonwealth. to courts, but to the Inter-State Commission when it is appointed, and to Government Departments.

Almost the same length of time must be absorbed in obtaining a reply. The public should be allowed a longer period in which to consider rules the effect of which may be very important to them. These are merely the observations which occur to a layman upon reading the Bill for the first time. Legal members will be better able to say whether this measure is absolutely required at the present time; but I trust that the Prime Minister will consent to so amend clause 3 as to extend the time within which objections to draft rules may be lodged.

In the first place, clause 2, which, as it l e f t this Chamber determined t h a t the seat of Government should be afc or near Tumut, has been amended by the substitution of the word "" Bombala"" for "" T u m u t ,"" while other provisions have been omitted, so t h a t it now readsIfc is hereby determined thatfcheseat of Government; of fche Commonwealth shall be at or near Bombala, and the territory granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth within which the seat; of Government shall be should contain an area of nofc less than one thousand square miles.

Bondi is in New South Wales, about 8 miles from Victorian border, but below the main range ; hence it was selected as junction for line, Bombala to Eden, to avoid two crossings of range. Elevation of Bondin substitute Bombalaf o r Tumut, to remove the requirement as to the extension to the RiversM u r r ay and Murrumbidgee, which, : of course, would be meaningless in the case I of Bombala, and also to remove the provision as to the altitude at which the site I is proposed to be situated. My colleague, I the Minister for Trade and Customs, w ill j explain the amendments in detail. I Sir WILLIAM LYNE ( H u m e M in is t e r j for Trade and Customs) -Considerin g the [ length of the debate which took place on the previous occasion, I do not t h in k it is necessary a t this stage to enter in to details at any great length.

Bombala has been subsbibuted for T u m u t . There was a long debate in the Senatei n regard to the matber, and one sbatemenb made was to the effect that, if Bombala were selected as the Eederal Capital site, and if a railway were constructed from Bairnsdale to Cooma, it would shorten the distance between Melbourne and Sydney by 100 miles. I . t h in k thafc t h a t statement was made in error, because I have obtained from the Engineerin-Chief to the V i c to r i a n Railways a statement of the distance thafc would be covered if any surveyed railway route were extended as described.

Then theMinisterfor Home Affairs apparently took a similar view, because he submitted a further amendment, limiting fche site of the capital city to within twenty-five miles of Tumut.

Other measures may be resorted to under the Constitution, and, with a full sense of the responsibility of my utterances, I say that, if the public have the impression created in their minds that there is an attempt on the part of members of the Federal Parliament to jostle them or humbug them, the people of New South Wales will be found fighting for separation from the Commonwealth at no distant date. That is the feeling in New South Wales. AA hen I am asked for reasons I give my 7 reasons, and the most powerful one is that the Prime Minister himself knew that these suggestions would irritate New South Wales and engender suspicion, and fche Minister for Home Affairs, in an endeavor to allay that suspicion, submitted an amendment, declaring that the Federal Capital should be within twenty-five miles of Tumut.

Federal Capital site should be in the vicinity of Tumut. view for a broad-minded representative to take? are dealing with over suspicious persons it is necessary that we should make it perfectly clear that our intentions are strictly honourable. Therefore, if there are any number of people who assert that by taking the Federal territory as distinguished from the Capital site itself down to the River Murray, we are taking the Federal Capitali n the same direction, it is certainly wise to insist upon this restriction fixing the Federal Capital within twenty-five miles from Tumut. A t all events, the condition is inserted in the clause, and it is therefore distinctly provided that the Federal Capital shall be within New South Wales territory, and at least thirty miles on the New South Wales side of the border. I feel that it is not at all unfair on the part of representatives of other States to ask as a concession that there shall be a right of way into the Federal territory and to the Federal Capital independently of any single State. That is not an unfair request to make. right of way, and so long as that only is asked for I refuse to believe that the people of New South Wales as a body will raise any veiy great objection to such a concession. able member should have voted for Bombala, which has a port. way will be sufficiently attained by access from the Victorian side of tlie border. It is not necessary to fix the Capital at Bombala to insure a right of way. I do not desire to discuss Bombala, as I have a number of reasons against the selection of that site, which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would not be likely to controvert. The people of New South Wales certainly do desire that the Capital shall be within the borders of their own State, not with a view to any material gain, but in order that such honour as attaches to the location of the Federal Capital and the Eederal territory should be associated with W h y was that condition in-, the mother State. That will be secured by the decision arrived at by this House if it is afterwards given effect to in another place. The question of material gain is not one which largely influenced the people of I s not that a very narrow New South Wales. People in New South Wales, in districts bordering upon the Federal territory, will have the benefit, to some extent, of Federal expenditure. AVhen we are dealing with an area of 1,000 square miles, fifty miles by twenty miles, or thirty-two miles, by thirty-two miles, it must be admitted that the expenditure of a large sum of money in the development of that area, whether by the Federal Government or by private enterprise encouraged by the Federal Government, will confer some benefit upon the surrounding territory of New South Wales. If the Federal Capital be situated near Tumut, even though a means of access from Victoria is given, it will for many years draw all its supplies from Sydney, and will send whatever it has to export in the same direction. From that point of view, Sydney has nothing to lose by this suggestion, and I have every confidence that when the people of New South Wales are appealed to upon this question they will be quite willing to grant the reasonable and just concession asked for by the poople of the more southerly States, that access should be given to the Federal territory from more than one State. cerely trust thafc fche Committee will strike out the words proposing that the Federal territory should be extended to the Rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee. I am not influenced in this matter by any parochial motives or any motives of concern for the interests of Victoria or New South Wales. I am influenced purely by Australian motives. I cannot perceive the consistency of any honourable member who uses the , argument of the right-of-way as a reason I why the Federal territory should be I extended to any particular river.

That is not my idea of what the Federal territory ought to be, nor is it fche idea of a majority of members of this House.

I do not quite see that the amendment of the Senate is simply a consequential one, and that we have nothing before us to show its opinion as to these proposals in connection with Tumut. A t the same time, I would only repeat my protest against the insertion, at this stage; of these conditions, whether they favour New South Wales or Victoria. If anything was needed to make evident the absurdity of those conditions, it was the speech of the Minister for Defence. He showed clearly how ridiculous the proposition is, and no doubt it is receiving his support, notwithstanding all its ridiculousness, in the hope that delay may ensue, and something arise to favour another site. What are these provisions that we have to Holding consider ? One is that the Federal territory should be a narrow strip extending from the Murray to the Murrumbidgee, and cutting off the State territory on either side. available, that that proposal is altogether undesirable, and that we can give, in another",39,William Lyne Th E Senate Has Been Told That Polite Language Must Be Used

254,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"Iwith the Federal Capital. With regard to the question of altitude, there might be a desirable site at an elevation of 1,400 feet, and a much less desirable site at an elevation of 1,500 feet. Yet it is suggested by our proposal that the less desirable site should be selected. Then we have the provision for a radius of twenty-five miles from Tumut proposed, simply to salve the feeling of New South Wales. twenty-six miles distantfrom Tumut might be much more desirable than a site within the radiusof twenty-fivemiles. All this shows the absurdity of our acting in the dark, and seeking light after we have acted. Our first step should be to enter into negotiations through Ministers, who know the views of honourable members generally. conduct the negotiations with a desire to meet the views of this Parliament, and, at the same time, with a desire, as far as possible, to fall in with the views of New South Wales, and then come down with a proposal. By taking this course we should not abandon our rights. AVe should have the means of exercising our rights when we were supplied with all the necessary information. We are trying to do something when we know nothing. This is most undesirable, and the exhibition of feeling which has been provoked is calculated to breed discontent and annoyance, and to hamper our negotiations with the Government of New South Wales. Eor these reasons I objected to the amendments made .in the Bill when it was last before us, and I again protest against them. I think that they were entirely wrong. As to the question of access to the Federal territory from the various States, whilst every convenience in the way of railway communication should be given, it is almost misreading the intention of the Constitution to endeavour to provide for an absolutely separate territory. territory, wherever it may be planted, will be, not only a part of the State in which it is placed, but a part of the Commonwealth. The fact that it is entirely surrounded by the territory of a State, or by the territory of two or more States, will not prevent it from complying with the spirit of the Constitution. possession, not of a State, but of the whole people of Australia. be impossible to get to it without going over the soil of a State, or of other parts of Australia, it will not fulfil the conditions of the Constitution, is to treat the States as Mr Thomson. though they were foreign countries, and the people of the States as aliens. It is as if we were to say that we are afraid of them, and so much object to mix with them that we are unwilling to cross a yard of their territory if we can avoid doing so. Surely no honourable member holds those views. opinion. vincial opinion. The Federal Capital will be the capital, not of the State, but of Australia. In going through the territory of a State or States to reach it, we shall be showing that we do not regard the people of the State as separate but as members of the one Commonwealth. ber think that New South Wales would allow a A ictorian railway to D6 extended to r the Federal Capital if necessary ? right a Victorian railway would have to enter New South Wales. If the honourable and learned member means a railway in New South Wales connecting with a Victo.iian railway, then, speaking for myselfand I am not able to speak for the whole StateI should be prepared to allow a connection to be made from a Victorian railway terminus at the border to the Capital by the most direct route possible. I would allow the Victorian railways to connect with our own railways at any point on the border. in spite of New South Wales construct such a line as the honourable and learned member for Corin refers to. of those who wish to drive traffic in a direction in which it does not naturally go. AVales and Victoria have tried to do so in the past. I am against such a policy, and now that we have Federation I hope we shall see a difference in this respect in the action of all the States. of ifc yet. but I hope thafc a better spirit will arise.

Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I thoroughly endorse the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney. His address was an extremely reasonable and an eminently honest one. It seems to me that there has been an effort fco make it appear that the people of New South Wales are contending for somethingfcowhich they are not entitled. That accusation cannot be rightly made against them or their representatives any more than the reverse could truthfully be said of the people of Melbourne and their representatives. All we desire is the reasonable fulfilment of the compact contained in the Constitution. To my mind, fche amendments made in the clause largely interfere with fche contifcutional rights of New South Wales. I agree with the honourable member for Bland that if we could acquire 1,000 squaremiles for the Commonwealth territory in a suitable situation it would be wise and right for us fco do so, but it is eminently wrong and opposed to the Constitution to insert in the Bill a provision demanding the 12 I 2 1 : 1 not alter the boundaries of a State without the consent of that State.

To take a piece out of the middle of it would be fco alter the boundaries of the State, because it would' then have not only an outside boundary but an inside boundary as well. From what I know of the people and the legislators of New South Wales, I feel certain that they will meet us in a reasonable and liberal spirit, and give us as much land as we require for our purpose; but we are manifestly wrong in demanding territory of the State. when we have no constitutional power to do so. The amendment to which we are asked to disagree is consequential upon the previous amendment. The Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, while they might form the boundaries of the Tumut site, could not form the boundaries of the Bombalasite.

The facts, however, are all against him, and the absurdity of his statement is shown by the difference in voting at the referenda.

The honourable member knows why the State Government have not enough money to spend. They never will have enough money whilst the party with which the honourable member is associated holds the reins of power, All that, however, is beside the question. The people of New South Wales knew very well that they would have to submit to very heavy extra taxation, and that they would in all probability have to surrender their old established free-trade policy, and it was as a subaccessible than any other spot that could stantial set-off against these sacrifices that the people of New South Wales accepted the Capital. trade for a miserable Capital. that. ling a long way from the amendment. so. I think that the amendment cuts across the spirit of the provision in the Constitution regarding the Capital site, and that therefore it should be eliminated. Would honourable members regard it as a substantial concession to New South Wales if the Capital site were selected just within the borders of that State? Where would the concession be in such a case ? The site at Tumut would not be so near to Sydney as to Melbourne, and if the people of Victoria could reach the Capital site by merely crossing the River Murray, the location of the Capital within the territory of New South Wales would no longer be a concession to the mother State. That was not the concession that New South Wales thought she was securing when she agreed to the Constitution as finally drafted at the Premiers' Conference. If the stipulations now made in theBillhad been embodied in the Constitution in the same way as the 100-mile limit, the result of the referendum would have been much less favorable. My point is that the provision which it is sought to retain in the Bill is foreign to the compact and entirely opposed to the spirit of it. The representatives of Victoria urge that they should have an independent right-ofway to the Capital without being required the to pass through New South Wales territory. That point should, however, have been The State Government raised at the Premiers' Conference. The compact with New South Wales will nofc be kept if fche Capital is less accessible to her own people than to the people of otherStates. Capital within New South Wales be less accessible to the people of that Statethan to residents in other States. The honourable member is speaking as if Sydney constituted New South Wales? honourable and learned member that if accessibility had been the principal consideration, Sydney would have been more be selected as a site for the Federal Capital. The port of Sydney would have been open to all. The representatives of Victoria, however, insisted fchafc Sydney should be excluded from the selection, and that the Federal Capital should be nofc less than 100 miles from Sydney. In dealing with this question we should consider, not the bare terms of the Constitution, but what is implied in the bond ; and I venture to suggesb very respectfully that when the Premiers agreed to the 100-mile limit they agreed also to allow New South Walesfco have the < Capital site as near as possible to Sydney beyond that limit. The 100-mile limit was the only bar which they placed upon the possession of the Federal Capital. Therefore,fcheywould be most honouringthebondbyestablishingtheCapita l as near as possible to that limit. That is the stand-point from which we ought to consider this matber, and nob from bhab of whebher bhe Capital would be accessible to this or that State. Of course, the more accessible we can make it to the other States consistently with honouring the spirit of the bond the better, but we have no right to consider the question of, accessibility by deliberately closing our eyes to the spirib of the bond. We ought to eliminate from this Bill the boundaries which have been placed in it at the instance of honourable members whose only desire seems to be to establish the Capital as near Victoria as possible, and incidentally as near to their own electorates as possible. quite as fair as was the statement of the honourable member for Bland.

331,Mr Joseph Cook,"Bub I do nob riseSir remarks be better if delivered upon the hustings ? in the Commonwealth who will make better use of the hustings than will the Minister for Trade and Customs. When the time comes he can be depended upon to shed crocodile tears with any man in this House. There is a feeling of intense irritation in New South Wales. It is useless to attempt to blink at it , because it is widespread, and any honourable member representing thafc State who endeavours to make .it appear thafc no such feeling exists, misrepreState Government might impose all kinds of sents public opinion in New South Wales at the present moment. The people of that State are irritated because they do not think thafc they are being fairly treated in the matter of the choice of fche Federal Capital : and I should like to know what is to be gained by the insertion of all these irritating provisions in the Bill. Has there been any desire manifested so far on the part of the people of New South Wales to treat fche Commonwealth unfairly ? Has there been any expressed desire on the part of that Statefcoadopt a cheeseparing policy with regard to the cession of land ? I submit that the Government of New South Wales have from the first treated the Commonwealth Government with the greatest consideration and fairness. The friends of the Federal Government are now in office in New South Wales. Time and again fchey have shown their complete sympathy with this Government, and I am, therefore, at a loss to understand why we should endeavour to place within the four corners of an Act of Parliament all these irritating provisions. A strong feeling is manifesting itself throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales in regard to this the latest proposal of the Commonwealth Parliament. Since this Parliament is supreme -sinc e the Federal Government have power underfcheConstitution to take what land they like-ther e is no need to adopt any course which may appear to be irritating. Let us treat New South Wales fairly in this matter, negotiate with her openly, and without binding ourselves beforehand, and, in my opinion, she will treat the Commonwealth fairly and generously, and give us every reasonable concession. The situation, however, is quite different when fche Commonwealth seeks to negotiate with fche Government of New ment in its hands. It is very like placing a pistol at the head of' the State Government while we are negotiating with them. Thafc is the position of the matter which I would submit as strongly as possible to honourable members. During this debate we haveheard the most astounding assertions made by honourable members representing Victoria. One of them went so far as to say the other night that the Commonwealth could not trust New South Wales with regard to the question of a right of way to the Federal Capital. He asserted that theirritating and harassing restrictions on our trade-that fchey might apply the State laws, in such a way as to prevent Victorian produce from being introduced into theCapital. Why are assertions of this kind constantly made! As I have remarked before, this Parliament is supreme^ and can always protect its commerce. Ifc can acquire as much land as ic wants for the mere asking and paying for it . Why, therefore, is this Parliament so anxious, beforeentering into negotiations with the New South Wales Government, to tie its hands in such a way as to cause irritation to the mother State? Either the compact embodied in the Constitution meant that there was to be a substantial concession toNew South Wales or ifc did nofc, and I venture to assert that, had ifc not been considered that a substantial concession was fco> be given to the mother State, she would not now be a member of the Federation, and the Commonwealth would not be an accomplished fact. honourable member mean by a substantial, concession ? the compact was made it was intended that New South Wales should have the Capital,, with all its commercial as well as its. sentimental advantages. regard the question of the Capital site as being merely a matter of sentiment. ber mean to say that fche bargain was; that the Capital should be near Svdney? conveyed by the bond was that it should be as reasonably near the 100-mile limib",46,William Lyne Th E Senate Has Been Told That Polite Language Must Be Used

346,Mr Joseph Cook,"I do not intendrefrained from taking part in the general debate on this Bill when it was before the House some time ago, because of my desire that we should come to some determination in regard to the site of the Capital before the close of the present Parliament. But, having foregone my right on that occasion, only to find that the question still remains unsettled, and that, judging by the speeches made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro and others, there is apparently a desire not to allow it to be dealt with finally during the present session. I feel it my duty to protest against the absence of good faith shown by those who wish to defer the selection of the site. That desire is due evidently to the belief that at the next elections a majority will be returned to this House pledged to do nothing in the matter. It is hinted at very significantly that certain members of the Parliament supported the selection of Bombala in another place for the reason that they did not think that that site would be accepted, and because they believed that they were in that way adopting an easy method to stave off the determination of the question. ber must not discuss the several sites. He will have an opportunity to do so at, a later stage. desire to discuss the merits of Bombala. I could possibly say as much in favour of that site as has been said by many other honourable members ; but I more strongly favour the selection of what I consider to be the best site in Australia. I refer to Lyndhurst. able member's back door. the selection of that site conscientiously believing that it was the best site that could be obtained. member permit me to remind him that the question before the Committee is whether we should agree to the Senate's amendment, eliminating certain words from the clause. That is the only question before the Committee. which you have referred, Mr Chairman, contain some reference to the question of locality, and believing that Lyndhurst had a very strong bearing upon that question, I was referring to it in reply to the interjection made by the honourable member for New England, who asserted that that site was at my back door. It is not at my back door. It is the natural centre of New South Wales, and is, and will be the centre of settlement in the Commonwealth. If in making a selection we had had regard to accessibility, climate, and altitude, Lyndhurst would not have been overlooked. It is the most central site of the Commonwealth, and the most suitable place at which to establish the Capital. able member must see that he is transgressing the rules of debate. The debate must be confined to the question immediately before the Chair. I have already informed the honourable member that he will have an opportunity in the House to refer to the several sites. avail myself of that opportunity. When the original draft of the Constitution was before the people of Australia theelectors of -New South Wales voted very strongly in opposition to it, because they were not in favour of certain provisions. It was enacted by the Parliament of New South Wales that there should be a statutory number of votes recorded in favour of the Bill before it was accepted by that I have no State. That statutory number was not obtained, for certain reasons which I shall not enumerate. But I shall state one of them. There may appear to be very littlein it to the bulk of those people who favoured the first draft of the Constitution, but the majority of the people of New South Wales who opposed it because amongst other provisions the Eederal citywas not to be in New South Wales. say that. W ill the honourable tution Bill did not say that, but it enacted that the Capital city might be in any part of Australia.

I wish to refer to the unwarrantable remarks made against the people of New South Wales by certain honourable members who preceded me.

There is no reason why he should reply to them. that it is most disorderly to interject. I -was about to remark that Ballarat is an excellent place. RecentlyI took the opportunity of visiting that locality. It would have been a very suitable, place indeed for the Federal Capital if New South Wales and Queensland were not in the Union, but not otherwise. Probably the reason why the people of Australia, apart from those in New South Wales, had a leaning towards Ballarat was, because it was much nearer to the capitals of some of the Is he States honourable member will not force me to take stronger measures. I have no desire to do I am sure that the so, but I must again remind him that he is going outside the rules of debate. how far I can go. It is, however, impossible for me to allow the people of New South Wales to be deceived without exposing the deception. I should like to point out one of the reasons for New South Wales being in favour of the Capital city being I regret very established nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne. ber will not be in order in doing that.

To my mind it shows a very unfederal spirit when representatives of one State hurl scornful expressions at representatives of another State; and we have too much talk from the Opposition benches about Victorian members. Eor my part, I know no State members in this House. I was under the impression when we entered into Federation that this House did not in any special way represent State interests, but; simply represented the people for the benefit of all Australia. I have always been of opinion that there should never have been any compact in regard to the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Parramatta said that the New South Wales people gave up their vaunted policy of free-fcrade forfchesake of this miserable compact j and I regard that expression of opinion as an insult to New South Wales. It is absurd fco suppose thafc New South Wales would in this way sell her birth right fora mess of pottage; and I firmly believe what has been said by the honourable member for North Sydney, namely, that the Federal Capital will bring little or no special advantage to that State. The Eederal territory is not likely to contain a vast population, and the slight advantage which would accrue to a few residents of Sydney by the importation of goods required forfcheCapital is surely not worth the giving up of a fiscal policy. New South Wales voted for Federation because she believed in Federation, and would have voted for it without that compact, which most New South Welshmen deplore. If the leader of the Opposition had not insisted on laying down honourable member to comply with the rules a personal explanation. I intend to reof debate. the speech of the honourable member for as fco the Federal sites, I entered the Parramatta, who travelled over a very wide House just as honourable members were ground.

On two or three occasions, when the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking, I asked that honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Committee. I have done fche same with every honourable member who has spoken, and I am sure the honourable member for New England, with, his long parliamentary experience, will assist the Chairman. to do so. I notice, however, that the honourable member for Parramatta, when called to order, goes on with his speech and manages to say what he desires. I repeat that I deplore the provincial spirit which is so rampant, not only amongst certain members of the House, but also in the press of a certain city. In regard to the particular amendment before us, I am thoroughly in accord with the selection of Tumut, and also in accord with the expression of opinion by this Chamber that the Federal territory should consist of something like 1,000 square miles. We have nofc said in fche Bill that the territory must be 1,000 square miles, but have merely expressed the opinion that we should like to acquire that area. honourable member that that question is not open for discussion, the Committee having already arrived at a decision. The only question is as to the elimination of certain words respecting the Rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee. passing, that I am thoroughly in accord with the opinion that we ought to have a fairly-sized Pederal territory, and I think I am in order in associating the proposal for an area of 1,000 square miles with the I bust ask the amendment before us.

Though1 had some sympathy with the honourable member for Grampians in the suggestion which I was under the impression he made, I have since found that the provision, as he submitted it, is mandatory. It is an absurd proposition as it stands now, and is creating jealousy and discord between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. I hope the Commonwealth will acquire an area far in excess of the minimum of 100 square miles laid down in the Constitution ; but if we do not secure 1,000 square miles, I shall be satisfied with are supporting the Government in their prosomething less.

410,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I thought thatby the Government with respect to this question was the correct one. They introduced a Bill to fix the Capital site, leaving the question of the territory to be dealt with by a subsequent Bill. It was in that subsequent Bill that conditions affecting the Eederal territory should have found expression. But the Government have managed this affair in such a supine and unsatisfactory way that the whole question has been complicated by conditions. First of all there was the condition that the Federal territory shall embrace 1,000 square miles of country; then there was a further condition agreed to that it should extend from Tumut to the Murray, and, further, that it should extend from Tumut to the Murrumbidgee; and then there was a further condition introduced, setting aside all the information which guided this House in the decision in favour of Tumut, to the effect that the site should not be at Lacmalac or Gadara, but that it should be anywhere within twenty-five miles of Tumut. All these conditions have been agreed to since the decision as to the site was arrived at, and they tend only to make the settlement of this very important question more difficult. They have already created some amount of friction between the Eederal Government and the Government of New South Wales. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No t the slightest. in charge of the Bill may have some information which honourable members generally do not possess; but if he will look at the reports of the debates in the State Parliament of New South Wales, he will find that members of the State Ministry have given expression to opinions with respect to this proposal that point strongly to the existence of veiy great friction. The Minister for Lands in New South Wales has indicated that there is no hope of the Federal Government ever getting the maximum area we are asking for in this clause, or an extension of Federal territory down to the banks of the Murray. Trade and Customs might have talked New South Wales Ministers back to "" sweet reasonableness "" in the meantime ; but so far as honourable members generally are aware, the position between the two Governments is one of extreme friction, and it has been brought about by the proposal of conditions which should not have found a place in this Bill. I am as strongly in favour of an area of not less than 1,000 square miles as any other honourable member can be, but a great deal depends on its shape and the character of the land which it embraces. I should not like the Federal territory to he of those dimensions, with the larger portion of the land unsuited for any form of occupation. We should consider the nature of the country within the area, and whether it could be profitably used or not in carrying out this scheme. But-wh y I cannot saywe are needlessly creating friction, if not between the Federal Government and the State Government, certainly between the Federal Government and a very considerable section of the representatives, and probably a big section of the community of New South Wales, whom we want to hear on this very important subject at one time or another. Where was the need to create this friction? This matter should have been left to negotiation, before it was embodied in legislation. I undertake to say that if the State of New South Wales had been approached in a proper spirit, the same amount of consideration which it has already given to the Federal Government would have been extended in this particular. But this Parliament put itself in the position of practically approaching the State Government with a demand that so many thousand square miles of territory should be ceded, in a particular shape, which meant that it was to be ninety miles long, by twelve or fourteen miles broad, and to run right through the centre of the State. That position is, I think, not creditable to the Government, or to the Parliament. We ought to endeavour to consider the wishes of New South Wales, and if we can arrive at an understanding by a proper method of negotiation, and avoid a lot of friction which is now seething in that State, and possibly may lead to considerable difficulty in settling this question, we ought to try to do so. For some unaccountable reason the Ministry, instead of showing their sincerity in the stand which they originally took and indicated as the correct one, sat behind The Minister for the members who sought to introduce these unwise, and, I believe, impossible conditions, into the measure. Take the question of the means of arriving at a settlement. If we turn to the records, we shall find that only eleven members voted for Tumut from Start to finish, while fourteen members voted for Lyndhurst, and a similar number for Bombala.",54,Willi Am Lyne Woul D Nofc These South Wales With An A C T Of Parlia

It was desired therefore that, apart from any construction we might be disposed fco place upon our powers under section 125, we should approach the New South Wales Government not with a demand, but with an indication of our wishes. The word ""should"" implies something that ought to be done, and not anj'thing sought to be enforced. In an earlier part of theclausewe replaced the word ""shall"" with the word ""should,"" in order thafc we might be able to approach the Government of New South Wales-as they must be approached before we finally determine the site of fche Federal Capital-in a manner appropriate to the occasion. It was thought that we should be in a better position to open negotiations if the word employed were not peremptory, and did not indicate force or coercion; that, in other words, it should convey a desire and nofc a command on the part of this House.

We do not even know that there is a decent site to be obtained anywhere near Tumut, at an altitude of not less than 1,500 feet.

Surely we can trust to the common sense of the Government and of the Parliament to select a site at the most desirable altitude, if other things are equal. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the honourable member has moved his amendment, because it will only lead to further debate. If the honourable member had been present when the measure was previously discussed, he would know that it was not the desire of honourable members tofixupon any particular site. recommended by the Commissioners, which of these details will require to be the subject they stated was at an altitude of 1,050 of negotiation.

468,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"I think the House has decided that Tumut another place quite a number of honorshould be the site. that any honourable member will deny that the two Houses are in direct conflict upon the question of site, and unless we intend to proceed further with the matter, we shall only be wasting time by once more sending this measure to another place. I should like to know whether there is anything in our rules of procedure or in the Constitution that would prevent the Government from straight way requesting another place to meet this House in conference ? The issue between the two Chambers is now clear enough, and there is no possibility of altering that issue. Tradeand Customs, it is true, has chargeof the certainly entitled to hold individual opinions Bill, but his colleagues, the Prime Minister, as to the most desirable site to select; but a the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for pledge was given by the Ministry that Home Affairs, are in deadly conflict with the question should, if possible, be settled him so far as the question of site is conthis session. cerned It seems to me that the vote given country as a whole. The question is no in another place conveys to us the clearest longer one as to the most desirable site, but indication of its opinion, and that the Gowhether we should have the matter settled vernment ought not to consider any longer during the present session, or whether it their own individual and conflicting views. should be held over perhaps even beyond They should take up the cause of this House the life of the next Parliament. in its constitutional relations with another knows what is likely to happen when the Chamber.

If we are to to a successful issue, this Government will arrive at finality we shall be able to do so be held responsible if they make no effort only by compromise. I therefore submit on the present occasion to secure a settlethat the question is no longer one which ment. the Government should treat in an independent way, but that they should rather lead the House in its negotiations with another place for a final settlement of the question. Having regard also, to the fact that the present Parliament is about to expire, the Government should no longer stand upon ceremony. They should not wait for the Senate to again return this Bill, as we know it will, but should at this stage open up negotiations with another place by a respectful address from this House asking for a Conference, so that the matter may be finally determined. which have just been put forward are ticular site, but against that selection-it is worthy of the attention of the Governwell known that five honourable members ment, because I believe that there, is in who were prepared to vote for Bombala able members who honestly desire to see tills matter settled at an early date. It is true that the large majority of members of another place have taken a view different from chat expressed by this House as to the most desirable site; but that attitude is quite compatible with a wish to settle the question within a reasonably early date, and also with a possible alteration in the attitude of some honourable members with a viewfcothat end. After the decisive vote given by this House on two occasions I think that it is more than likely tliat if a strong effort were made by the Government to arrive at a settlement some good result; would be the outcome.

Had those six voted, twenty-one votes would have been cast in favour of Bombala. I am told that the reason they stood out was that they were requested to pair with other honoi-able members who were absent. They were not advised that there were many other honourable members absent who were well known to be in favour of Bombala, and with whom the absentees on the other side might have been paired. Consequently, I say that the vote given to-night is not a true index of the opinion of the House. given some days ago ? that at the first ballot on that occasion Bombala headed the list, and that it was only by a combination of members against the selection of that site, and the sudden conversion of quite a number of honourable members who had previously voted for Lyndhurst, that the supporters of the Tumut site were enabled to secure a victory by the narrowest of majorities. As the ballot proceeded, Bombala was for a long time either at the head of the list or tied with some of the other sites. Quite a number of honourable members who are in favour of Bombala were absent from the House on that occasion, and we are all aware of the feverish haste with which even the honourable member for Bland urged that the House should go to a division. I do not blame him for doing so. Perhapsi t was good tactics for -him to urge honourable members to rush to a division when he knew that some of the supporters of the site which he opposed were absent; but the most serious feature Associated with the pairing which took place in connection with to-night's division relates to the vote of the leader of the Opposition. I wish to know on whose authority an honourable member, who was in attendance this eyening, left the Chamber in order to pair with the right honourable member for East Sydney. order. I would ask you to say, Mr Speaker, whether the honourable gentleman is in order in discussing the question of pairs on the motion for the adoption of the report ? but I think that the honourable gentleman is referring to a matter which took place in Committee, and the report from that Committee having been brought before the House he will be quite in order in calling attention to it . He will not be in order, however, in referring to some other matter which took place outside the Committee. ferring, Mr Speaker, to a matter which took place in Committee. I heard the leader of the Opposition declare that whilst he favoured Lyndhurst, his second vote would be for Bombala. I have known the right honourable member on so many occasions to explain away what he has said that I should not lay much stress on any statement but for the fact that I have it set out before me in cold type. I find that according to the Sydney Aforning Herald and the Sydney DaUy Telegraph, he said able gentleman not to discuss that matter. wish to discuss it further than to state that the right honourable gentleman said at Bombala that he was prepared to give one vote for his choice-Lyndhurst ; that he gave that vote, and that he said further man is not now discussing anything which took place during the Committee stage. to discuss the right honourable member's vote. Minister is now discussing something which did not take place in this House-that he is discussing, not a vote that was given, but a vote which he thinks ought to have been given. Is that so ? WhatI desire to say is that on the ballot which took jplace a few nights ago to determine the site of the seat of government, the leader of the Opposition voted for Lyndhurst, and that I heard him at Bombala say that his second vote would be for Bombala. I am informed that to-night an honourable member who favours the Bombala site was requested to leave tbe Chamber, in order to pair with the leader of the I rise to a point of Opposition as a supporter of the Tumut site.

It Cannot even be claimed that a majority in the House has decided to-night in favour of a particular site. It is a question whether Bombala has not a majority of supporters. that, although Bombalai n fighting against the combination which it has had to meet has not secured a majority, it obtained a majority of No. 1 votes at the first ballot. I wish only to put facts against mere bald assertions. I am told, and I know it to be a fact that, so far as this question is concerned, quite a number of members' votes have been influenced by the statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs that no trees are to be found at Bombala. That statement has been spread broadcast all over the country, and if I shall be in order. I wish, in reply to it , to read a letter which recently appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. The letter is as follows :To THE EDITOR or TILE ""HEKALD."" Sir,I noticed in to-day's issue of the Herald that much dissatisfaction is expressed at Bombala over Sir William Lyne having said that wheat or trees would not grow at Bombala. Well, sir, I would much sooner Sir William undertake to clear or grub one acre of some Bombala land than I , for any one who has ever been to Bombala can plainly see how thickly timbered most of the land is ; and as for wheat, Bombala and surrounding districts produced this year some of the finest wheat that any one could wish to see. And taking into consideration that many of the great wheat-growing districts of this State failed to produce wheat at all, owing to the drought, we find Bombala farmers in many cases having a yield of 30 bushels per acre, while the lowest yield per acre was 18 bushels. This wheat was an excellent sample, and included the following varieties :-Whit e Tuscan, White Lammas, Purple Straw, Rattling Jack, and Manitoba. The average weight per bushel of this year's wheat at Bombala was 64 '5 lb. per measured bushel. The Manitoba was a splendid sample, and surpassing most samples grown in Australia, and the 3'iold per acre of some was from 28 to 30 bushels. Taking these facts into consideration, Bombala people have good grounds to complain about Sir William Lyne's utterances, which I think were uncalled for and not founded on facts. Sir letter ? signed by MrJ . J. Flynn, of Murrumburrah, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the honourable gentleman's electorate. Besides porters were away. that, we have the statement made by the members of the Commission appointed by | very well. Why were some of the Bombala the Minister for Trade and Customs. He should have every confidence infchemembers of that Commission. Every other gentleman who has reported with regard to Bombala has testified to the same effect. Mr G. B.

Mr G. B.

I simply indicate what is to be said in favour of the site which I advocate, and honourable members vote with their eyes open.

If there were to be pairs why should not the Bombala supporters, who were away, have been paired with Tumut supporters who were away ? It is not fair to Bombala. I think this fact requires some explanation. I also desire to place it on -record that with all this pairing there was only a difference of fourteen votes, not between Bombala and any particular site, but between Bombala and all the sites that were opposed to it-and that in a very t h in House. It also has to be remembered that in the Senate an absolute majority of members voted for Bombala as their first choice against all other sites.

Honourable members may laugh, but the representatives of Tasmania and Western Australia will hold with me when I say that their States are not to be down-trodden, but will insist that their claims shall receive consideration. That is why equal representation in the Senate was given to all the States. But I have only to answer for my own votes and speeches, and there is no occasion for me to question the votes and speeches of other honourable members ; though on so important a question as is now before us, I am justified in thinking that the circumstances require that the pair recorded in the name of the right honourable member for East Sydney shall be explained. orable gentleman to refer to a vote that Bombala was 16, and there were 14 for was not given.

Therefore, I fail to see why the Minister for Defence should make any complaint. If he looks at the record of the previous voting he will find that the leader of the Opposition voted for Lyndhurst right through.

It shows the underground engineering that went on in connection with the various sites. During the course of the debate, reference has been made to the fact that there was a strong combination of the New South ""Wales members in favour of Lyndhurst. But the fact is that iffcheNew South ""Wales members had voted solidly for Lyndhurst that site would have been choseu. Lyndhurst would have had thirty-two votes as against twenty-nine for Tumut. But no less than seven New South Wales members-namely , the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Cowper, the Minister for Trade and Customsj the honourable member for New England, and the honourable member for Bland, voted solidly against Lyndhurst. I cannot understand in the face of these facts any honourable member making the statement; that there was a combination of New South Wales members to secure the selection of Lyndhurst. I am sorry, in the interests offcheCommonwealth, that such a combinafcion did not take place, because then I am satisfied that we should have secured a Capital site thafc in regard to accessibility, climate, and other advantages would have been the best place for the purpose. pleading for delay ? showing the advantages of Lyndhurst, as I have a right to do.

AVe could have manoeuvred our votes if we had cared to do so; there is a way of manipulating these matters, and it was quite possible to strengthen the position of Lyndhurst. But we felt it was our duty to give a straightforward honest vote, and no one can reproach us in connection with ifc. Therefore, I regret that the Minister for Defence should have made any statement concerning fche pair recorded in the name of the leader of the Opposition in the absence of that right honourable gentleman.

From the very onset, from the troublesome time when I had to bear the whole of the attacks made upon me for giving the members of the Federal Parliament an opportunity to visit the various sites, in order to prepare them for a consideration -of the question, it cannot be said that I have shown any laxity in my desire to have the Capital site chosen as early as possible. If other measures of grave importance were in hand so that this question could not be taken up at the moment the reports of the Commissioners were received, that may have been unfortunate, but neither I nor the Government was to blame for it. The ex-Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, was verj' anxious to have this matter settled, and he took the earliest opportunity afforded by the state of business in this House to endeavour to carry the matter through.

The matter has been gone into previously, and at this time. I desire only to point out that the question appears to be getting into a very unsatisfactory position, which I for one do not desire it should get into. I . have no desire to see it brought to the fighting stage when other important business of the Parliament may be constantly interfered with by the introduction of this question, when angry feelings may be aroused, and when Parliament may under stress have to deal with the matter, which may be much better dealt with in the .absence of that stress. I desire to reply to the objections of the Minister for Trade and Customs to making this Bill what he -calls a party measure, that there must be a stage at which, if the Government are in earnest, it must become a Government measure. The Government are the leaders of this House, and whilst it might have been quite right, and I am not taking objection to it, for the Government to leave to the House in the first instance the selection of the site, after the site was selected by the House and inserted in the measure, I consider that the Government were bound to recognise the decision of the House as one to which they must adhere, and to subsequently deal with the B ill as a Government measure.

562,Mr Kingston (South Australia),"I was intended. There was no intention to give any particular part of New South Wales any particular interest in this matter. It was stipulated as clearly as could be that a certain part of that State was to be excluded, but that the Federal Parliament was to have the fullest power to determine a site anywhere else within its borders. about putting the Federal Capital on the border 1 was suggested at tlie time, and what has been continually suggested. earliest gatherings in connection with Federation was held at Albury, and the talk was of Albury being the Federal Capital. Naturally, attention has been directed to the position of Albury as half way between Sydney and Melbourne. But I think that Bombala was also mentioned at the Premiers' Conference. These matters were in our minds. The Premiers were, so to speak, bargaining on the subject. The chief item of interest was the position of the Capital. It was discussed mainly between the representatives of the two States which, in the natural order of things, were most interested, which had, as it were, the chief claims to the selection of the Capital. It was an arrangement made between Victoria and New South Wales, and endorsed by the remaining States. But nothing was said or dreamt of about excluding a border site such as Albury or Bombala. about including such a site ? at large. All that was agreed upon was that the site should be within New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. bala are near the border. party to an arrangement which "" kept the word of the promise to the ear and broke it to the hope."" But nothing of the sort suggested was intended. I do not believe that the leader of the Opposition would support such a suggestion for a moment. He has not hitherto mentioned it, and he is not one to forget a point which could be made on behalf of the State over whose destinies he so long presided, and which, with his fellow members, he so adequately represents. He would, on the contrary, have spoken from the fullness of his knowledge. It is because the honourable member for Parramatta has not had an opportunity to become precisely acquainted with what happened at the Premiers' Conference that he has given expression to the suggestion that there was an intention to secure forSydney the trade of the Federal Capital. There was no such intention. The utmost liberty was conceded on both anything said sides. If the Federal Parliament chose a site within 105 miles of Sydney, its decision would hold good, and if it chose a border site its decision would equally hold good. The one arrangement would be as honourable One of the and as permissible under the compact made and ratified by inclusion in the Constitution as the other. I thoroughly sympathize with the criticisms to which the honourable member for North Sydney hassubjected those who urge the plea of delay in order practically to enforce a denial of the rights of New South Wales. I shall be no party at any time to anything in the nature of cheating that State out of its undoubted rights in this matter. There is the bond. We are honourable men, and I hope that neither because of journalistic promptings or for any other reason shall we be induced to follow a line of action which will expose us to shame, as the practical repudiation of the undoubted rights of New South Wales will do. Let us select the site at the earliest moment, and make the best selection we can under the circumstances. I rely upon the promise of the Government, because when we spoke of the matter before we proceeded to the consideration of the question in detail, it was stated that they would spare no pains to bring about an agreement between the two Houses on the subject -before the session terminated. I do not like to give way to the other House. But I am a strong believer in the advantages of the Bombala site, partly' because of its port, and partly because of its climate. I have listened with amusement to the suggestion that it is too cold. Of what part of Australia can the general complaint be made that it is too cold 1 I wish that a vote could have been taken on the subject on a day like last Sunday week. The suggestion that Bombala is too cold would then have been repudiated as absurd. Australians require cold. They are generally suffering from too much heat. Let us in this world, when we have a chance, try to obtain a moderately temperate climate, and not be frightened by the suggestion that a certain climate is likely to make us shiver.

"" The Minister for 'Trade and Customs pointed out that the number of people represented by the senators who voted for Bombala, was equivalent to only three-fourths of the number represented by those who voted for another site. If we apply the same test to the constitution of the Ministry, and to the votes recorded by Ministers, we find that the majority is three to one in favour of Bombala. The votes recorded by Ministers show that they are almost unanimously in favour of Bombala as compared with the other sites. Under these circumstances, is not their duty clear t Here is the position : The Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Defence, and the Postmaster-General are in favour of Bombala.

But the time within which they can be corrected is extremely short, and therefore I deem it to be my duty to again call attention to the question. There is one matter in particular which strikes me as being capable of amendment. Under present arrangements the Revision Court for any electorate can sit in one town only. I am afraid that it will be impossible for the Revision Court sitting in any one town to deal satisfactorily with the requirements of a whole electorate. The number of anomalies which exist are great. We cannot expect men and women to travel from distant quarters of a large electorate to one town only. person. be decided judicially, and I find upon reference to sections 77 and 82 of the Electoral Act that the Court must be satisfied that applicants who desire to have their names inserted upon the rolls are entitled to exertion will require to be given before that tribunal can satisfy itself that the names of those who claim the right to vote at the coming elections have been improperly omitted. I do not think that the Court in a perfunctory fashion will grant all applications which may be made to it . While I am satisfied that it is not necessary for every applicant to attend in person, ifc is unat any considerable distance from the town in which the Court, meets does not know what objections may be raised to his or her claim, and is unable to answer any such objection because of the travelling that would be necessary to enable that to be done. In the past every facility has been given for the holding of Revision Courts. They have even sat at night in order that the workers might attend and see that mistakes which had been made were corrected. A t present electors in the country experience very great difficulty indeed in obtaining their rights. the difficulty comes in.

I find that in Victoria a new regulation has been brought into force, which provides that where arrangements are made for delivery by letter-carrier, no letters shall be delivered at the post-office. I am told that the regulation has been introduced for revenue purposes, inasmuch as any one who desires to obtain his letters at a post office may do so on paying a rental of one guinea or two guineas per annum for a box. I would point out that in Victoria a recent disarrangement of the railway service has taken place, and that a large number of countiy districts are now served by trains which carry mails and leave on the return journey soon after their arrival. Thus, unless business people in these districts are able to obtain their letters at the post-office as soon as they are sorted, they are unable to catch the return mail. It is a matter of the utmost importance to them, and I consider that it is unnecessary that such an arbitrary regulation should be enforced in the smaller centres of population or that the names of as rigidly as at present. In the ordinary course of events, many people are unable to pay the fees demanded for the use of boxes. stranger in the town. districts, the postal walks are very much larger than are those which have to be traversed by letter-carriers in large centres of population. In some cases it takes a letter carrier four hours to complete his walk, and consequently a number of people are unable to obtain their correspondence in time to answer ifc by the return mail, although the letters are actually in the possession of the postal officials. They are nofc permitted to intercept the letter-carrier. He is compelled to deliver them at fche address given on the envelope, and many people are put to I much loss and inconvenience through the application of a regulation, which, if it ever existed in the past in Victoria, was more honoured in the breach than infcheobservance. indorsefcheremarks which have been made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, with regard to the position in A different statement which many electors are likely to find themselves at the ensuing elections.

I submitted to-day to the Minister for Home Affairs a letter, which set forth that at one of tlie post-offices an elector inspected the rolls for a division numbering 2,000 electors, and found that, in the first instance, there were only six applicacation forms available. The postmaster could not say whether more would be forthcoming. We know thafc if the average elector can obtain a form on which to make his application he will use ifc, but that as a rule he does not care about writing letters to officials.
