Has the matter yet been decided, and, if so, is it intended to increase those rates'? been finally decided. for some time past the Postmaster-General has had under consideration the advisability of doing something to assist the mail contractors, who are passing through a very trying time just now, owing to the drought. If the honorahle gentleman's consideration has matured, I ask him to place before the House his proposals for affording relief. to several questions that each case must be considered on its merits.

I have no knowledge as to the accuracy of that statement, and I do not think it is correct.. If there has been any increase it must be due to the increased Customs and Excise duties recently imposed in the Tariff. There is no other reason, and, if there has been any increase, I think it is coincident w it h the increases that have taken place in other parts of Australia. External Affairs tell us whether tlie Government have power to at once take over the works erected by Vestey Brothersi n the Northern Territory, or whether the agreement extends for a period ? memory, I think the late Government, which entered into this agreement, did not provide that we could take over the works at any time.

It is a magnificent country for the raising of in horses and cattle, while millions of sheep Territory, with provision may also be depastured there. I should and the training of like the Minister of External Affairs to carefully consider what he should do to In the Northern Territory we develop the Territory. I know that he has ideas of his own concerning the matter, but one suggestion that I would make to him is that he should enter upon a vigorous policy of railway construction. As Sir George Reid once pointed out, dePoor country can be found anyvelopment rapidly follows the pushing out of our railway systems. I had the honour of meeting Lord Kitchener when I was in the Old Country a little while ago, and We cannot expect people to inhe expressed to me his delight that the Commonwealth Parliament proposed to as the Northern Territory construct a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek.

The Northern Territory can be made a magnificeut national asset if we develop it along the right lines. It is a beautiful country, needing only the attention of pioneers. We want to settle there a body of men like the grand old pioneers who did so much to develop Australia. stock it .

It would seem that a debate on the Northern Territory is likely to become a "" hardy annual "" in this Chamber. member a policy ? have some suggestions to make, but the doleful note struck last night by the Minister of External Affairs was very discouraging. I regret that the honourable gentleman spoke as he did, since I have a profound feeling that the Northern Territory offers exceptional opportunities. It has been under the control of a succession of Ministers for nearly half a century, yet practically nothing has been done with it . Some of those charged with its administration have been mere cyphers. They have come and gone, and have left no mark. Others have made some efforts to develop it ; but it has remained for the present Minister of External Affairs to take some definite action. I am reminded of the old motto, "" Veni, vid:, v i c i . "" The honourable gentleman has done something which he may think creditable and likely to mark his administration, but to my mind, and I am certain to the minds of thousands of the electors of Australia, it is the biggest blot that has yet been made on the administration of Many years the Territory. I refer to the nationalization of the liquor traffic up there. MrJ . H . CATTS -Does tlie honourable inember say that it is not an improvement on what was taking place? ister seems to have some doubt as to wheThis ther it is a good policy, since he is prepared to put it into effect in regard to only ten out of the sixteen or seventeen hotels in the Territory. MrJ . H . CATTS -But the country was alive with sly-grog shops. for the honourable member to make an in telligent reply to ray argument unless he Let them take up the land and listens to what I have to say. There are some sixteen -or seventeen hotels in the Territory, and the Minister has decided that the Commonwealth shall take charge of ten of them. The reason given for If they be this action is that the men up there have been served with f r i g h t f u l l y bad grog, which has been described as ' ' chain lightning. "" The Minister is so convinced of the devastating results of this bad grog that he is going to take over ten of the hotels, leaving the remaining six or seven to continue to sell liquor of this particular character. The honourable gentleman maj' be carrying out a rather cherished principle of his own, but I am satisfied that it will not be conducive to the results he is anxious to obtain. I am I have, and I entirely with him in his desire to curtail the operations of hotels in the Northern Territory, and particularly to prevent them from supplying the men with an adulterated and destroying article. Buti t is not a very enticing prospect that the Commonwealth coat of arms may now be painted over the doors of liquor saloons. This great democratic nation of the southern seas has decided that one of the grand things it can do to develop the Northern Territory, and to fill up its empty spaces, is to enter upon the sale of grog. I suppose that a short time hence we may be edified by hearing of the "" H o t e l Fisher"" in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister, being himself a teetotaller, will hardly consider it an honour to have his name associated even with the Government sale of grog.

I can trust the people there to do what they think is right, though what they think is right may from my point of view be wrong. Not only has the Minister of External Affairs violated a distinct promise made by his predecessor, but he is also discouraging in regard to this question a democratic ideal, which is accepted by every Government in every civilized community. He proposes to improve matters by nationalizing the hotels in the Territory, but the facts of history are against him in every direction. There is no precedent in history showing that the nationalization of hotels or the bringing of them Under municipal or State control has improved the position. A few years ago we were told that temperance people were talking foolishly when they claimed that prohibition had proved a success. Wc were told that prohibition did not prohibit, that there was no argument in favour of prohibition, and that prohibition only encouraged sly grog selling and all that sort of thing, but during the last few weeks the world has been making history in regard to this question, and has proved quite the opposite. railway at either end, and see what prohibition is doing there in the shape of slygrog sheds. member's argument is entirely against what he is endeavouring to maintain. I am digressing from the general argument which I wish to establish, but the interjection is worthy of reply. If the argument that prohibition encourages sly-grog selling be true, the logical reverse side of present case. the picture should be that there can be no sly-grog selling where licences exist; but, as a matter of fact, we know that where licences mostly abound there is more slygrog selling than in any other part of the country. There is more sly-grog selling in Melbourne than in any prohibition town. As a matter of fact, where licences exist, sly-grog selling is encouraged. The liquor trade is tlie most law-breaking and vicious in the country. It violates the law at every opportunity, and breaks it at pretence every turn; it defies the law and laughs licensing; laws. As a matter of fact, two at law makers-ha s nothing but contempt for them. The example of New Zealand is quoted, but talking of prohibition where there really is no prohibition is foolish.

I was in Great Britain some years ago when the municipalization idea was strongly in evidence, when Earl Grey commenced his agitation in regard to the public house trust system, by which profits from hotels were to be devoted to the encouragement of temperance societies and the provision of bowling greens and libraries, and the managers of the hotels were not to be given any interest in the sales of liquor, their sole profits outside their salaries being derived from the sale of temperance beverages, and where at all times, night or day, temperance beverages were to be obtainable by those requiring them. On paper it would seem that this system was to be a very fine thing. The churches blessed it . Ministers of the gospel consecrated hotels in some cases.

The grip which alcohol gets on a man is one of the most; fearful and saddest features in connection with it . I hope that the Minister is open to conviction on this matter. During the last few mouths the world has been making history on this question more than on any other. , Temperance advocates who have been scorned, jeered at, insulted and reviled, are now finding that the very things they claimed all through the past years are' the accepted results and facts of to-day. Every statement and every challenge made by the temperance people in regard to the liquor traffic has been substantiated by the experience of the nations in Europe during the present crisis. nation of Russia nationalized the spirits traffic of that country, and immediately closed 100,000 spirits shops.

He is nob acquainted with the history of the movement. should like to read to the Committee a passage from Prohibition Advancei n all Lands, by Guy Hayler, a recognised authority on the matter. The. member's time has expired. Tlie Northern Territory seems to be cropping up as a hardy annual in our debates, but I was on the tip-toe of expectation when the honourable member for Brisbane rose that he was about to settle tlie whole question, because he took to task categorically all Ministers who have ever had tliis problem in hand, passed them all out as of no consequence, referred to some as probable triers, and then lef t the present Minister to justify himself. The honourable member said that he had a policy for the Northern Territory, but he devoted the whole of his remarks to the liquor question. An y sane man who has the welT h a t resistance fare of the Northern Territory at heart, knows that the manner of regulating the liquor traffic is not going to settle the great problem of developing the Territory, and I shall not delay further on that subject beyond saying that it is a surprise to see a member of the Labour party trying to show that the general policy of his party, namely, the nationalization of the liquor traffic, is a false one. However, it is for the honourable member to justify that attitude to his party. The development of the Northern Territory proved a proposition too big for South Australia, although that State pluckily, and by the expenditure of a considerable amount of money, endeavoured to do its best for the immense area that was committed to its charge. The Commonwealth took over the In . 1894 the great Territory, which to-day provides evidence of the fact that, while Australia may be regarded as one of the most prosperous colonies of the British Empire, we have signally failed to effectively handle the question of that country's colonization. I think the Minister is entitled to the respect of this House for the candour with which he faced the question.

It is not yet proven to the satisfaction of Australia that the white child will prosper in the Northern Territory as well as in other parts of Australia. The home life is a consideration which wil l be found to influence very largely the policy of getting bond fide permanent settlers for the Northern Territory.

Pirst of all, it is essential that there shall be rapid and effective transport. The question of whether the means of access shall be by way of the north-south railway, as suggested by the honourable member for Grey, or along the route suggested by the right honourable member for Swan, is a matter that will have to be determined. For the present my mind is open on the question; w h a t -» ever route will best suit the Territory , and most quickly develop it , and at the same time not put this Parliament in the position of abrogating any bargain that has been made, I w ill support. But if any policy means that an honourable bargain made at the time of Federation is to be repudiated* I will not be a party to it . It has struck me that i h order to make the Territory something of a success the lines that have been followed in the past are not those to be pursued in the future. I rather favour the appointment of a permanent Commission to accomplish what the honourable member for Barker indicated as necessary, namely, a continuous policy. Changes of M in istries bring, about changes in ideas as to the policy of land settlement. We have had the attempt at the cabbage garden method of developing the Territory, and that has proved to be a failure. To-day the Territory is saddled with a debt of £6,000,000, which is a pretty big handicap for any Ministry or any permanent Commission to face, and at the same time make a success of the Territory. One essential to the success of any territory is that it shall proceed along the lines of self-support. I would suggest that .the present debt of the There we have one of the Northern Territory, other than the debt on the railway system, be funded, and the Territory relieved of it ; that a permanent Commission be appointed with power to borrow money from abroad or internally for the development of the Territory ; that the money so borrowed be earmarked for the Territory alone; and that, as far as possible, the burden of developing the Territory be removed from the ordinary taxpayer.

A number of honourable members here are opCommonposed to what they term Socialism, but I say that if we wait until men with capital, large or small, go to the Northern Territory, we shall wait in vain for its development. One honourable member has recommended the offering of grants of land, and the Leader of the Opposition, with the Territory, in his policy speech, recommended the adoption of the freehold principle. He would allow a reasonable living area, not exceeding 2,560 acres, to 'be granted in about the freehold. He has stated that he regards matter. that as necessary for the development of the Territory. Before stating the principles at which I have arrived, I wish to show what the freehold system has done for the settled States, and particularly for New South Wales, with whose I conditions I am most conversant. No doubt, Sir John Robertson, when framing his Pree Selection Act, considered that sufficient safeguards had been provided. Pree selection was the first step towards the acquirement of freehold, and is so still in most of the States. There have been countless amendments of the land of the problem which conlaws of New South Wales; men of varyus, and it will secure, not ing degrees of intelligence and honesty interest, but also having thus endeavoured to safeguard the local interests of the States. interests of future settlers by preventing land monopoly, and to establish a prosperous peasantry on the soil. Yet, in 1887, it was possible for the late Sir William Lyne, by a question addressed to Our land a Ministeri n the Legislative Assembly, to elicit the information that, although 230,000 selections had been taken up in PerhapsI come into this debate th© State to date, only 28,000 of the original selectors remained on their blocks, so fast was fhe aggregation of years, large estates proceeding. Our party has proposed an expedient which it considers the true corrective of this evil. AlthoughI support ifc, I regard it only as an exof State pedient, which will ultimately be supplanted by a higher and truer system, under which the principles of broad justice, which have been outraged under the State systems, will receive recognition. Notwithstanding the direct opposition of the Liberal party of New South Wales to the leasehold policy of the Labour party embodied in the Act of 1912, an Act Without the institution which the Liberals passed in 1908 conwe tains so many safeguards against the.evils arising from freehold, that one of the most distinguished supporters of the Liberal Government-Dr. McLaurin, a member of the Upper House-sai d that it gave only an illegitimate kind of freehold. TheA c t of 1908 provides that, even after a selector has paid the whole of the capital value of his land, and a deed of grant has been issued to him, he may transfer only with the sanction of the Minister, and a transfer to a person holding in the district more than a living area, counting the area applied for, canaot be sanctioned. Thus the real essence of freehold is eliminated, and, except for differences which I shall define, the tenure under the Act of 1908 is similar to the perpetual leasehold system provided for in the Act of 1912. If the Labour party were willing to drop the condition of perpetual residence appraisement, its tenure would be almost the same as that given by the Liberal party in the Act of 1908. I hope that the system of freehold will not be perpetuated by the Commonwealth, and that we shall profit by the mistakes of the States. shall show how the Act of 1908, which provides for a tenure from which the essence of freehold is removed, has failed in the object which its framers had in view-the prevention of land monopoly. As a practical man, who has had large experience, and has listened for weeks at a stretch to evidence with regard to what is a living area, I say that the meaning of "" living area "" must constantly change. If a man is within a decent rainfall, and the land is good, doubtless, before railway facilities come, it is necessary to have a sufficient area to make a living by grazing. And even when a railway does come, agriculture in the beginning is carried on by slipshod methods, and we are in a great measure now suffering from the careless, improvident system adopted in the past. However, all this is being gradually altered. The development of inventive genius, of agricultural chemistry, and so forth , not to speak of new markets, is tending to make one man's labour more effective than it was in the past; and we have the phenomenon that land, which, twenty-five years ago, was scarcely able to keep its owner out of debt, can now keep, perhaps, four or five families in a state of well-being and prosperity. I admit that the leasehold system is subject to similar disabilities; and the leasehold system I re[ 9 5 ] -* gard as merely an instalment or step towards a better one. In the case of leaseholds, however, it is recognised that the land belongs to the State, and there is a clumsy method of re-appraisement in order that there may be returned some of the enhanced value brought about, in a great measure, by the advantages afforded by the State. It is possible that the freehold areas of 2,560 acres spoken of may in the future he the sites of cities w it h teeming population. titled to the reward for the risks he takes ? scientific system to provide these ""bonanzas"" for one section of the community, and enable that section to secure and periodical rea mortgage over the labour and production of their fellow creatures. Such a system and such a result are a blot on our civilization, and a reflection on our intelligence. I would apply to the development and success of a business. A careless and improvident man may start a distributing or manufacturing business at one corner of the street, and later be met with the competition of an up-todate man in a similar business at the other corner, with the inevitable result of the ruin of the business of thecareless or weaker competitor. But that does not. apply in the case of land. A man may own 1,000 acres, and use it merely for raising a few ill-bred sheep, and for the careless and perfunctory cultivation of 100 or 200 acres, making as a result, perhaps, £200 or £300 a year, and managing to pay the interest on the mortgage. Another piece of land of exactly the same quality and area in tlie neighbourhood may be purchased by a capable, up-to-date agriculturist, and put to its utmost uses, as I have seen done in New South Wales by settlers from Victoria and South Australia. Better stock is introduced along with modern methods, and an income, not of £200 or £300 , but possibly of £1,200 or £1,500, is secured as a return. But does this capable competition ruin the incapable and careless neighbour? Not at all, for the effect has been merely to demonstrate that the land of the incapable man is worth not, say, £ 2 an acre, but £ 6 or £ 7 an acre; and he .,! is enabled to sell out at the liigher figure",17,Chairman Th E Honourable Is To Be Said On The Matter We Are Not

Census returns in New South Wales show that ten districts in the rain zone, and well calculated to support have lost population during the last ten years; aud this means that our cities are becoming more swollen than ever with what may be described as an artificial population. We have at this time, in the case of the Northern Territory, the finest opportunity to show the world that the principles of justice and equity can 0 be firmly established and maintained, when, as it were, we are relieved from the trammels of the older systems under which monopoly was fostered, perhaps unwittingly, by men to whom we handed the care of the community. hold system, and it has not borne f r u it . has not yet been really tried. We are a handful of people, less than 5,000,000, with 3,000,000 square miles of territory; and the net result of all the work of the past is that we are reduced to the p it if u l expedient of buying back a little of the lost heritage in order to settle a few willing workers. As the Minister pointed out, hundreds of people rush to the land ballots, whetlier freehold or leasehold, because they have the proverbial "" Buckley's "" hope of acquiring land by purchase. who have aggregated large estates, to keep the bulk of the productive energy of the country cap in hand under some system of tenancy or of share farming, of which I am an opponent, but which I am compelled myself to use. As a practical man I warn the Commonwealth of the danger of allowing the thin edge of the wedgethat is, allowing freehold tenure side by side with leasehold in the Northern Territory. Human beings, of course, always tend along the line of least resistance, and make for the highest profits. We have been taught in the evolution of the race that the easiest and most effective method of becoming great and prosperous is, not to bend our back oi our mind to drudgery in order to produce, but to devise some system by which we can yoke Every person in the our fellow creatures to work for us, and this idea is effectually and firmly entrenched behind the ramparts of freehold. PerhapsI ought to give some authority I regard land taxation as for the arguments I have advanced. No one would accuse the late W . E. Gladstone of being a Socialist or. Labour man whose utterances might be regarded with some suspicion, and we find him sayingThere are some persons, for whom I have a large numbers of people, great respect, who think that the difficulties of our agriculture may be got over by a fundamental change in the land-holding system of our country. I mean those who think that, if you can cut up the land of a country into a multitude of small properties, that of itself will solve the difficulty. To a proposal of that kind I for one am not going to object that it would be inconsistent with the privileges of landed proprietors if it is going to be for the welfare of the community at large. The Legislature is perfectly entitled to buy up the landed proprietors for the purpose of dividing the country into small lots. In principle no objection can be taken to it. Those persons who possess large portions of the earth's space are not altogether in the same position as the possessors of mere personality. Personalty does not impose limitations on the action and industry of man, and the well-being of the community, as possession of land does, and The leasehold system therefore I freely own that compulsory expropriation is a thing which is admissible, and even sound in principle. Proude, the historian, was even still more emphaticOf all the fatal gifts which we bestowed upon our unhappy possession (Ireland), the greatest was the English system of owning land. Land, properly speaking, cannot be owned by any man-it belongs to the human race. Laws have to be made to secure the profits of their industry to those who cultivate it ; but the private property of this or that person, which he is entitled to deal with Doubtless it would suit people as he pleases, land never ought to be, and never strictly is. I shall give one other authority to show that the Labour party a.re advocating no wild-cat scheme, although I admit their policy is imperfectly expressed in their land legislation. However, that legislation and policy are based on the imperishable principles of truth , which those great men recognized in their day, but had no opportunity to carry into effect. John StuartM ill saysReturning nothing to the soil, they (the landlords) consume its whole produce, minus the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of famine; and when they have any purpose of improvement the preparatory step usually consists in not leaving even this pittance, but turning out the t",19,Chairman Th E Honourable Is To Be Said On The Matter We Are Not
126,Mr Rougebs,We have had the lease,20,Chairman Th E Honourable Is To Be Said On The Matter We Are Not
127,Mr Lynch,"people to beggary, if not to starvation. When landed property has placed itself on this footing, it ceases to be dependable; and the time has come for making some new arrangement in the matter. When the sacredness of property is talked of it should always be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property. No man made the land; it is the original inheritance of the wholo species. Its appropriation is a question of general expediency. When private property is not expedient it is unjust, it is no hardship to any man to be excluded from what others have produced. That is what we are trying to affirm in our policy. I am a freeholder myself, and had I not been capable of taking advantage of the system that I am inclined to decry and destroy if possible, I should be spoken of as a TradesH a l l advocate. But starting as I did, with twenty acres twenty-five years ago, I have gone on in creasing my production of wheat until this year I hope to have 1,000 acres in crop. I have the capacity to employ the system, and have secured opportunities to enjoy it , perhaps through luck, and because of tlie assistance of others, which I gratefully acknowledge. If I had not that capacity, if I came here merely to deride such a system, people would say that it was but another instance of those who have not, wanting to take from those who have. Some of those who were breaking stones with me on the road-side t h i r t y years ago, are still following the same occupation. They did not have the opportunity to go to a land ballot that I had, and the good fortune to draw a 1,000-acres block. Buti t is an unscientific and false system of production under which I am able to go on the land and to obtain the services of four or five good men to work for me. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN (Dr. time has expired. to bring before the Committee a matter relating to the meat works tliat are being erected in the Northern Territory by Messrs. Vestey 'Brothers. The honourable member for Wannon complained bitterly this morning of cattle being driven back to the more sparsely settled portions of Australia. We admit that they are being rapidly driven back, but Australian consumers of meat are not likely to benefit much by the cattle we have there at present. Federal Government should retain large areas in the Northern Territory for the breeding of cattle in sufficient numbers to supply the people of Australia with meat. We have been warned against the Australian Beef Trust, which is buying meat from every available meat works in the Commonwealth. We also have Vestey Brothers carrying on operations here. That firm is an extensive one, with its headquarters in London, and we cannot say whether or not it is associated witli the American Beef Trust. It is financially very strong, and is building extensive works in the Northern Territory. I hope that tlie Commonwealth Government will take over those works in the near future if it has the power to do so. Messrs. Vestey Brothers have purchased four of the best stations in the Northern Territory, together with about 240,000 head of cattle. We know that these people are practically going to control the whole of the output of meat and cattle from the Northern Territory. Australia at present, with the exception of the State of Queensland, is not raising sufficient cattle to feed her own people. As a matter of fact, the beef now being raised in Queensland is of very little use to the people of Australia. Many of us are of opinion that action should be taken to control these large concerns. The Constitution is very weak in many respects, but we are sufficiently powerful to bring forward legislation that will effectively control the Meat Trust as we know it in Australia. Mr Justice Street, who was appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust, reported that it is operating, in Australia as well as in America and in England : that Swift and Company, Armour and Company, and Morris and Company were acting in combination in tlie United States of America and England, with the object of fixing the prices of live-stock, and that they were also operating in conjunctionin the retail markets of those countries. I put certain questions in the House this morning with the object of showing honourable members what these firms exercise in other parts of the world, and what they will exercise in Australia if the opportunit y is afforded them. The Commonwealth Government would be acting in the best interests of the people if it imposed an export duty on all meat over and above a certain quantity slaughtered at any I was very anxious that the works. In that way alone can we hope to control the operations of these people.",20,Chairman Th E Honourable Is To Be Said On The Matter We Are Not
128,Mr Sharpe (Oxley) [12.35],"I wishThe Government, I understand, are prepared to give reasonable consideration to this question, recognising that the price of stock is very high, and will be much higher in the near future. The retail price of meat is steadily rising all over the Commonwealth, and more particularly in the Statei n which the largest number of beasts is slaughtered. In the northern parts of Queensland meat is probably dearer than in any other part of Australia. pending an amendment of the Constitution, probably nothing can be done, save in the direction I have mentioned, to prevent a still further increase in prices. Until quite recently the Northern Territory supplied the Queensland market with many head of cattle, but that source of supply has now ceased. Stock raised in the Territory is being sent to the new works. Trust in Australia, cattle were slaughtered on a most extensive scale, and the price of cattle increased to such an extent that, prior to the outbreak of the war, many of the meat works were fast approaching a point at which tbey would have been forced to suspend operations. During the last six or eight months, the meat works in Queensland have been slaughtering on a scale more extensive than was ever known before. enormous demand from Great Britain? of war we have not been exporting meat to America. . gone to America since the outbreak of the war. member suggest that we sliould not have the benefit of the American market? benefit of every market, but, at the same time, we should take care that the big firms operating here do not secure control of our local market. We have no desire to prevent these big firms coming here from oversea. They might be regarded as welcome guests; but we certainly do not desire that they shall obtain complete control of the local trade. Mr Justice Street has distinctly stated in his report that there is strong evidence that these people will assume control of the trade before very long. said. He said that there was a danger that they might do so. That is quite a different matter. evidence given before the Commissioner, Messrs. Armour and Company have been buying the whole of Messrs. B i r t and Company's output from their' works on the Burdekin River, and also the output of the Ocean Beach works, in New ZeaNothing has been done, and, land. Evidence to that effect was given by the manager of B i r t and Company. It was also stated that they had been purchasing the whole of the output of Mr. Rosewarne's works at Brisbane, John Cooke and Company, Baynes Brothers, the Queensland Meat Export Company's works at Brisbane, at Ross River, and at Lakes Creek. Swift and Company are also slaughtering on an extensive scale W it h the arrival of the Beef at Brisbane. They have completed their Alligator Creek works, which they purchased for £40,000, and on which they have expended from £200,000 to £250,000. Mr Sims, of Messrs. Sims and Cooper, gave evidence that practically the whole of the output of the Geelong Meatworks passed into the hands of Messrs. Swift and Company through their London agency. Mr Justice Street found that these firms were practically controlling the whole of the meat trade in Australia, and it is reasonable, therefore, to ask the Government to take whatever action is open to them, in order to cope with the difficulty. Messrs. Morris and Company have, so far, not done very much business in Australia, but they in tend in the very near future to operate upon an extensive scale. They have purchased land on the Brisbane River, and are about to enter upon the erection of honourable works. As soon as those works have been erected, I am confident that very few of the opponents of these people will be able to withstand the operations of such a combination. Mr Justice Street has reported that the three firms to whom I have referred are working in conjunction in America and England, and it is hard not to believe that they will fail to act in conjunction in Australia. ber quote the paragraph in the Commissioner's report?

138,Mr Sharpe,"I do not think thatto a report of the Board of Trade Committee in 1909In the year 1908, a Committee was appointed by the Board of Trade in England to inquire how far and in what manner the general supply, distribution, and price of meat in the United Kingdom were controlled or affected by any combination of firms or companies. was alleged that, though the American firms engaged in the trade in England were apparently competitors, they were in fact acting in combination with one another, and that the object of that combination was to obtain control of the market for beef in the United Kingdom. In dealing with those allegations, the Committee said in the course of its reportAnd then follows what took place at that inquiry. This is sufficient evidence to prove that these people who are acting in combination in other parts of the world must also do so in Australia. Another paragraph of the Commissioner's report which is of material value to those people in Australia who hold the opinion that the American Beef Trust is not operating here, appears on page 23, and saysI t does not seem to have been without reason that the writer of the Review for 1912, commenting on the situation, remarks"" South America is undoubtedly the key to the situation as regards Britain's supply of imported meats, and for better or for worse, the key is already largely in foreigners' hands."" Another paragraph deals with the sums of money expended hy these people on works. I quote these extracts in order that honourable members may be satisfied as to the presence of these people in Australia. On page 27 of the Commissioner's report we have a few lines dealing w i th the negotiations between Armour and Company and B i r t and Company, and it is advisable to read them. They areAnd it may be that, in establishing relations with Birt and Company, it is aiming ultimately at some sort of control not only over Birt and Company's output, but also over that of the Burdekin River works, of which Mr coming forward to give evidence. Cox is the managing director, and over that of the Ocean Beach works in New Zealand, which are the property of the Federal Company, a company associated with Birt and Company, and represented by Birt and Company in Australia. The acquisition by an American company-especiall y if acting in combination with other companies-of a control over supplies by acquiring the output of an Australian works is, as Mr Cherry points out in his report, a matter requiring serious consideration. A paragraph on page 30 of the Commissioner's report establishes the fact that some people in Australia did attempt to secure an option over unborn stock in Australia. ago in this Chamber, I said that some people were trying to secure an option over unborn stock for several years ahead honourable members who were then sitting on the Government benches, were rather inclined to ridicule the idea. ber then said that it had been done, and that people had paid £1 a head for unborn stock. people ? that the American people were associated with the transaction. transaction ? on page 30 of the Commissioner's report deals with the purchase of unborn stock by the Beak Pastoral Company, and saysThe rumours as to the purchase of unborn stock had their origin, I have no doubt, in the following facts. In June, 1913, the Rockhampton branch of the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company, acting on behalf of the Beak Pastoral Company, sent out a circular in the following terms to a number of pastoralists:We have a buyer prepared to purchase now No. 3 steers for delivery between June and December next year at £3 per head, and so on for two or throe years ahead. If you will therefore give us by return mail a firm offer of the whole drop of your No. 3, 4, 5, and 6 steers for delivery between June and December following the year they are calved, we expect to be able to do business for you without our buyer even inspecting. large buyer of stock who had made purchases under these conditions, avoided of the Commissioner on the point? was an attempt to engage in this class of business, and only after these American people had come to Australia. w ill see that the Commissioner gave no finding on the point. tions is a very difficult matter; but I hold the opinion that those who originated the idea were the people who have lately come When some twelve months to Australia.

Tho Royal Commissioner saysThe fact that, as Mr Sims says, a great proportion of tlio output of his firm has gone to Swift and Company may have led to a misconstruction of the business relations between the two firms, and may have led to an inference being drawn of a closer relationship than in fact exists. Sims and Cooper are selling their output to these people. Some influence must be behind them, assisting them in some way, and enabling them to compete in the market to a greater extent than can older established big financial firms in Victoria. They will soon get control of the trade here by paying a price for stock no other meat works in Victoria can pay, and thus drive other people out. are large buyers of stock in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria; and when we know that they are able to operate so successfully, and that their London office is merely a branch office, we can only conclude that their works are influenced in same wayI do not say exactly controlled-by Swift and Company. Swift and Company over Sims and Cooper ia sufficient to prove that they are associated with the business of the firm in every way. A paragraph on page 32 of the Commissioner's report dealing with the advantage of control over Australian supplies says: The suppression of competition and the control over supplies is not only a matter of serious concern to Australia, but it is also a matter of Imperial concern. It is improbable that the American companies have any intention of engaging in the distributing trade in Australia. Their object in coming here is to obtain supplies for their trade in the United Kingdom, and in the United States, and, assuming the existence of a desire to exercise a determining influence on prices in the markets of the United Kingdom, the advantage of a control over Australian supplies is obvious. Theu further on, on the next page, the Commissioner says: If facilities and opportunities for effective combination exist it is not improbable that Mr Sharpe. they may be made use of. In his recent report Mr Cherry says that in the United Statesi t is fairly evident that the representatives of Armour and Company, Swift and Company, and Morris and Company, have at least a mutual understanding as to prices. Mr Cabburn is The rapid of opinion that the American companies already fix the price of meat in all the markets of the United Kingdom. When we know that, and when in . his summary the Royal Commissioner, after collecting evidence in four States of the Commonwealth, shows thab he is absolutely satisfied that Armour and Company, Swifb and Company, and Morris and Company constitute the American Beef Trust, and are operating in America both in live stock and dead meat as regards prices, and are in a position to arrange and fix prices on the London market, we must have some fear that the same thing w ill occur in Australia in the very near future. This morning I was not! permitted to conclude a paragraph on which I wished to bas© a question to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I take this opportunity of doing so for the information of honourable members who are not prepared to believe that tlie American Beef Trust is They in our midst at the present time. This is what the Royal Commissioner says in his summary: The three English companies representing the three American firms most prominently identified in recent years with the so-called Beef Trust are extending their activities to Australia(a) The Swift Beef Company of London, A t any rat© the influence of under the guise of the Australian Meat Export Company, a company registered in Queensland, has established works in tliat State, and has begun exporting. (6) The Morris Beef Company of London has purchased a site on the Brisbane Eiver, in Queensland, with .a view to the establishment of the meat works. (c) Armour and Company, of London, is purchasing frozen and canned meat through the agency of Birt and Company and otherwise. It has also been in negotiation for the acquisition of an interest in the output of more than one meat works, and it has purchased 5,000 cattle on the hoof, which are being treated and shipped on its behalf by the Government Produce Department of South Australia. Thus the Judge finds that the people who constitute bhe Beef Trusti n other parts of the world are here; and, seeing that they are raising the price of meat to the consumer, making the price almost prohibitive, I hope the Commonwealth Government will take immediate action to deal with them in whatever way is at their disposal. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. Trust, aud also Vestey Brothers and the Union Cold Storage Company, have attempted not only to capture the meat trade of Australia, b u t also to control the industrial movements in that industry.

I do not propose to discuss at anj length the subject of the Beef Trust, which seems to be always in the mind of the honourable member for Oxley, but I desire to make just a few passing remarks on the subject. In the last Parliament, the honourable member was continually hammering into the then Government his contention that if something were not done to check the operations of the Beef Trust in Australia the whole meat trade would be ruined. Now the honourable me""mber has a Government from his own party in power, and the best thing he can do is to convince them of his view when they are sitting in caucus upstairs. The honourable member has an opportunity of ramming this peril into the ears of the Government in the party room, and giving us a little peace in this chamber. Let him and the Government devise some scheme to save the meat trade of Australia. My principal remarks to-day will relate to the development of the Northern Territory. I regard this as a matter which should be dealt with by the House as a whole, and not by any one party. The Minister of External Affairs, in replying to the remarks of honourable members, practically told the House that he was new to his position, and was in such a fog that he did not know how to develop the Territory. Let me put this point to the Committee. The present Government have been in power for a considerable time, with the exception of a slight interval when the Cook Government held office, and if it is not possible for them to devise a scheme for the development of the Northern Territory, tl"".e best thing we can do is to get rid of it altogether. That is the only sensible course to be followed. that one Minister of External Affairs is to experiment with his pet scheme for the opening up of the Territory, and, when a change of Government happens, the next Minister is to try to upset everything done by his predecessor, we shall make no real progress. It is absolutely necessary that this matter shall be put under the control of some person who will have a permanent policy for the opening up of the Territory on the lines which the people of Australia expect to see adopted. I quite agree that it will honourable be impossible for a new Minister, on coming into power, to shut down works that have already been started, and say that the schemes introduced by his predecessor were to cease. We cannot decide whether such schemes are good or not until they have had' a proper trial. Any private business man knows that if he starts an enterprise, and finds after it has been in operation for twelve months, that there has been a little failure, he does not abandon the enterprise. On the contrary, he says, "" I will give the scheme an opportunity, and see if it is going to do any good."" I do not think that schemes like the Batchelor farm and the dairy farm are going to develop the Territory at all, but I quite agree with the present Minister of External Affairs and his predecessor that those schemes are on trial, and that we must wait to see what development results. It would be only foolishness if , after one Minister had started a dairy farm, his successor immediately decided not to allow the experiment to continue. If such a policy as that is to be adopted we might as well throw straight into the fire the money which the first Minister has expended. The main fact we have to look at is that until we get the Northern Territory really developed we have to devise means of getting the produce to market. That is the experience in the development of other parts of Australia. If a country, or a portion of a State, is without railway facilities, it is useless to go there to grow sheep if it is going to cost more to get the wool to market than to grow it ; it is of no use growing pigs if it is going to cost more to get the pigs to walk through the mud to the markets than it costs to raise them. Until railway facilities are provided, the pioneer If it is to happen must grow something that will walk out of the country. We have the illustration of experimental wool-growing in the Territory. Something like 1,000 ewes have heen purchased for this experiment, which will be all right if the books are properly kept, so as to show whether, in the event of the price of wool going back to normal, there will be any profit from the enterprise. The honourable member for Grey referred to the Avon Downs station,",25,Australian
156,The Chairman,Tli e,26,Australian
157,"Mr Manifold (Corangamite) [2.20],","from which those sheep were purchased. They are very good sheep, and that is ahout the only sheep station in the Territory. All sorts of propositions have been -put before people who have money to invest in the development of Australia. I have seen splendid propositions put forward; any one would think that they are most wonderful undertakings to put money into; the leasehold is to be bought at a cheap price, the sheep gave fine percentages of wool, and in some cases the percentage of lambs was very good. The whole thing looks like a scheme for picking up money. But we have to remember that as soon as the price of wool gets back to normal, although there is a profit to-day, it is going to cost the whole value of the wool to get it to market; the propoportions of Australia. That was found to sition becomes no longer payable. Take the case of Avon Downs station. To get the wool down to the river, and thence to the seaboard, costs something like £10 per ton. I do not know what the distance is, but I know that that was the contract price in connection with that little steamship enterprise which the Commonwealth Government undertook, and which proved a failure. But, having got the wool to the seaboard, the owners had then to bring it to one of the big cities of Australia or ship it to London, and all that carriage was only profitable while wool was bringing the price which it is worth to-day. freight cheaper by the Government service? same as the prices charged by private enterprise. The wool had to he stored at the riverside for a considerable time, waiting for the Government to do their part as contracting carriers, but eventually the Government boat failed, and the owners of the wool have had to fall back on private enterprise. freights on those boats were less than those charged hy private enterprise. whether the Government made any profit out of the service, but they failed to carry out their contract, and if I had been the owner of the wool I would have shown them up, and called upon them to complete the contract to carry the wool to the seaboard, which they could not do. Where the grower has to pay enormous freights to get his produce to market, a policy for the development of the Northern Territory by sheep farming and that sort of thing is not likely to be a success. Many mistakes may be made in the development of any country. Mistakes were made in the development of Australia generally. They were made in Queensland, and we may expect them in the Northern Territory, and we may expect that the people who go tliere first, like the people who went into central Queensland, will lose money through not understanding the country. We know what happened in Queensland. First of all they tried the ordinary dam system which had been used in the development of other be absolutely useless. Then there was the experiment of making an overshot dam, where there was a hole in a creek. When the overshot was running over there was plenty of water in the dam, and this was looked upon as a means of combating drought. But tlie result was that with the tremendous silt which takes place in that portion of Australia, when a 60-ft. dam.was full it contained 20 feet of water and 40 feet of silt. That, like the ordinary dam, was a failure. Then there was the circular dam built up on the banks of a creek. This was supposed to be the best scheme possible, and it was a good scheme up to the point that it would carry on over two years without rain, but the end of the second year there was not a drop of water left in this dam. These are three schemes for the supply of water that absolutely failed in central Queensland. right as a dam\ long as there was not continuous evaporation, and it could be filled every year. But in a country where there may be year after year of drought, and the circular dam cannot be filled, it naturally becomes empty. Mr J. H .

164,Mr Manifold,"I am not an authothis side say there are not. Now we come to the question of fencing. Fencing has to be done in the Northern Territory. The mistake made inQueans! and was that wooden posts were adopted. thunderstorms, lightning set fire to everything, and the wooden fenoes went. They were absolutely useless, and they will be absolutely useless in the Northern Territory. in the Northern Territory now. develop the Northern Territory the people must fence, and I am pointing out the mistakes which are likely to be made there unless the settlers know absolutely what they are doing. Queensland has had to do away with wooden fencing on account of fires and white ants. I am in formed that in the Northern Territory there is very little timber to be got, and people going in for fencing to any extent find that the carriage of wire is a tremendous cost. Then again, I would ask if sheep in the Northern Territory are going to produce anything like a reasonable percentage. A r e they going to do better than in central Queensland ? On paper, sheep-breeding sometimes looks a very good proposition, hut in central Queensland, w i th two lambings a year, the average amongst merino sheep is not much more than 45 per cent., putting the rams in twice. Are we going to have the same experience in the Northern Territory? If so, it will be a great drawback to sheep-breeding. I cannot understand this low percentage in Queensland in regard to sheep. Experts will tell you how this kind of thing ought to be improved, but the practical man doing everything that it .is possible for him to do has that experience. In the southern portions of Victoriai t is found tliat merino sheep will remain together in th© flock. If they were put into a paddock they would remain there, but in central Queensland they are apt to roam all over the place. People who have properties up there say the only explanation is that the rams cannot find the ewes. If that is the case, the ewes w i ll have to be put into smaller paddocks. That is a workable arrangement in good seasons, but sheep cannot be kept in small paddocks when there is no rainfall. That experiment has heen tried, and proved to be a failure also. I want to draw the attention of the Committee to the only way in which I consider it is possible to develop the Northern Terri tory. I am not going to take any notice During of the little dispute which crops up every time this question is mentioned between the memhers for South Australia and Western Australia. Referring to the railway connection, the members for South Australia say that the only possible way of developing the Northern Territory is by a railway system running from north If we are going to to south. The honourable member for Grey states that if we run the railway up along the route of the telegraph line fro m South Australia ws are going to have a backbone to start with. My view is that it would be a backbone without any ribs, and such a railway w ill not do much by way of development. Western Australia, we are told, only came into the Federation to secure the building of the east-west railway, while South Australia informs us that it only handed over the Northern Terri tory conditionally upon the north-south railway being built. Dealing w it h the Western Australian railway, the right honorahle member for SwanI do not know that any agreement was actually entered into-ha s always told us that it was the price paid for Western Australia coming into Federation. In my opinion-and I have always stated it-if either of these big railways is to be built, then that to the Northern Territory should be started first. The line from Western Australia should wait, because the Northern Territory is the most serious problem the Commonwealth has to deal with. lation. able member for Swan says they have the population. If they have, then they are developing their country, and they do not want the railway. They can travel round by the sea, but, in my opinion, the east-west railway should have waited u n t i l after that to the Northern Terri tory had been built. That should be the first, but honorahle members fro m South Australia realize that, while an immense expenditure is going on on the east-west railway at present, they have not much chance of their Northern Territory r a i l way.

168,Mr Manifold,"The right honorinformed us that the reason why the northern railway cannot be proceeded with is that the plant is not available, and I gathered from his remarks that as soon as the east-west railway is finished that plant w ill be released and can go on to the northern line. I think, therefore, that the only possible way to deal w it h the Northern Territory at the present time is to connect it with our railway system through Queensland. When the time comes we may be able to develop it by the backbone line which the lionorable member for Grey refers to. argument, I never used the word ""backbone "" in my speech. thc word ""backbone,"" and I say, if we build that railway, it w ill be like the backbone of a barracouta; there will be plenty of backbone, but no ribs. I would like to see a scheme brought out for the development of the Northern Territory, w i th a commissioner appointed to control it. I clo not care whether it is developed under the freehold or the leasehold system. It does not matter very much what tenure is used. one that w ill enable them to spend their inoney and see something for it before their lease expires, well and good. wrong end. member is quite right. I think it is very littl e good starting to develop the Northern Territory at Darwin, which is absolutely shut off from the rest of Australia. I think it is very little use start-, ing at Darwin to develop a country which is absolutely shut off from the rest of Australia, hut I should like to see a man in charge who understands his business, and who w ill start the work of development on sound lines. We are absolutely certain to make mistakes, but do not start sheep-breeding or dairying and give it up before you have tested the possibilities of the country. Give the thing a f a i r trial, and by all means start at the right end. That end is not at the northern coast. Progress reported.

If military officers, in the discharge of their duty, do wrong, it should be possible to bring them to book. Military officers, in carrying out their work, sometimes do unfair things.

WhatI desire is that provision shall be made in this Bill for the ventilation of military grievances before a civil, and not merely a military, Court. We were told recently that the House of Lords had caused certain provisions to be inserted in the Britisli Bill with the object of protecting the rights of the people. I marvelled at the time that any member of ithe House of Lords could be so democratic as to desire to secure the civil rights of the people. I find that the civil Court is only for civilians. cession that is! A man enlists for the defence of his country, and goes to the front to protect civilians, and for doing so he is asked to give away his rights. The men who go to the front should have more, and not less, rights than the men who stay at home. tary, and the volunteer, by enlisting, accepts the provisions of the Defence Act. our bosses used to tell us when we asked for more money"" If you do not like the job you can leave it.""

I can quote the case of the son of a policegating and of ordering punishment is man here, who, in a letter, complained of the food he was getting while in the hospital. If this Bill were passed, and I mentioned these facts outside this House, there would be nothing to prevent the military people coming down upon me and arresting me for telling the truth. I hope that the Government will assist me to secure the appointment of a Board for the investigation of these matters, quite apart from the military people. A soldier is supposed to be an exceptionally good man, and I cannot see why he should not have the same right to justice as a man who is not a soldier. My generation of our family is the first for seven generations that has not been represented in the British Army. My father brought us out to Australia so that we should not join the British Army, because of what he and those with whom he associated were subjected to in the Army. I am appealing to the people of Australia to remedy the old order of things. Honorahle memhers have read of the mutinies that have taken place in the British Navy and Army, and we know that they were brought about by the practice followed of treating men as things, and uot as human beings at all. Here we are being asked to pass provisions which will enable the military to treat us as people are treated by the military in Prussia. If a man going down a street in Berlin bumps against a soldier and does not immediately crawl upon his stomach in apology to him, the soldier my run his bayonet into him. If a man is sitting at a table in a restaurant, and soldiers come in, and there is no room at the table for them, he has to get up, and let them sit down. We do not want that kind of thing here, but we shall tend to bring it about if we place tliese extraordinary powers in the hands of the military, authorities. orable member describes prevail in Germany in times of peace, but this Bill is intended to apply only during the term of the war. admitted that inquiries are to be made concerning the treatment of men in hospital at the Mena Camp, and there are many who can give information on the subject.

There were some cases of measles in a camp, and to prevent the spread of the disease about 300 men were removed to an isolated camp. One night two of these men committed a nuisance. The whole of them were paraded next day, and the offenders asked to step out. They would not do so, and the whole crowd were punished by twenty-one days' confinement to barracks. That was the military wayI confess it was an effective way-of punishing the innocent in order to get at the guilty. These men, although they are soldiers, at heart are civilians just as we are, and when they are going to do their duty to their country, why should they not have the means of getting redress that we civilians have? give up the two "" blighters"" who put them in that position? able member was at school he did not care to be considered a sneak or a skunk.

291,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attort r i a l by court martial are inevitable consequences of the militarism imposed upon us hy inexorable circumstances. notorious that the ideal and basis on which Democracy rests are incompatible with militarism, and where they co-exist mili tarism is a menace to Democracy. But these questions are not now before us. We are discussing now a question relating to the war and the conduct of the war alone. We are not proposing to impose upon any soldiers or sailors or any persons in the Defence Department greater disabilities than those from which they now suffer, whatever these are. Such a proposal as the honourable member has outlined-the establishment of a Board capable of trying military and civil causes-canno t be introduced in this B ill . TheB ill , so f a r as it touches the matters referred to by the honourable member, deals with two classes of persons-traitors , whether of alien or British descent, and persons guilty of such careless or criminal negligence as to imperil the safety of the Commonwealth. Under the B ill all offenders are liable to the same punishment, whether they be civilians, soldiers, or sailors. The only distinction lies in the tribunal which tries them. submit, not only justifiable, but necessary. I am not going to say anything in support of courts martial, but shall refer the honourable member to some observations I made when introducing the principal Act, and w ill ask h i m to listen carefully to what I say, so that he may know exactly the position in which the soldier, sailor, and civilian in this country, under this law, w ill stand, and the attitude of the Government on the matter. thenThe Bill is retroactive, but it is not the intention of the Government to so apply it unless in regard to an offence so v.ank in character as to justify recourse to such an unusual remedy been made very wide, but the aim of the Government will bo to use it as little as possible, and to as limited an extent as possible. . . . . I do not believe that we shall need to have recourse to courts martial other than those within the ordinary control of the military, and provided for under the Defence Act. It is quite certain, however, that all cases cannot be dealt with by the civil law. Meaning the civil law as it then stoodThere is about the civil law a majestic dignity and circumlocution which unfit it to deal with espionage and treachery in a time of national danger. It is for that purpose, Mr Hughes. and that alone, that we desire a sharper and readier instrument, and to it we shall resort only in the very last extremity. The PrimeI t is Minister has given the honourable member his positive assurance, and I give him mine, that this power will be used only when absolutely necessary, and only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. I said also that all cases tried by court martial under the War Precautions Act would be referred to me, as representing the civil law, before the sentence was executed. I referred honourable members to section 99 of the Defence Act, which provides "" that the proceedings of a oourt martial other than a regimental court martial shall, after promulgation, be forwarded to the Minister for transmission to the Attorney-General for record."" AndI gave my assurance, and I repeat it , that all sentences by court martial w ill be forwarded to me as representative of the civil law, and may be re viewed by me if necessary. From this it follows tliat persons tried by court martial under this B ill are as much under the atffis of the civil authority as those tried by the ordinary tribunals. In effect, this is a B ill to confer on the Executive Goverument power to deal And this distinction is, I directly with offences which ordinarily come before the civil Court. That assurance, I submit, is an adequate and f u l l answer to the honourable member's objections. It is a positive assurance that all law in this country proceeds from , and is dependent upon, the w ill of the people as expressed through their representatives and the Government. And although some of these powers may be executed by military tribunals, these t r i I said bunals are subordinate to, and cannot act save by the authority of, responsible M in isters. I come now to sub-section 8 of the proposed new section 6, which is the only This clause has portion of the B ill to wbich m y brief explanation is not a sufficient answer. Sub-section 8 readsIn the event of any special military emergency arising out of the present war, the Governor General may, by proclamation, forthwith suspend the operation of sub-section 6 of this section, either generally or as respects any area specified in the proclamation, without prejudice, however, to any proceedings under this section which may be then pending in any civil Court. Sub-section 6 provides for civil trial in the ordinary way. In regard to that, I wish to repeat, first of all, the positive assurance I gave in introducing the original measure, that this power is only intended to be used in those cases where the position of the Commonwealtli stands literally trembling in the balance. does not refer to an emergency which arises out of any circumstances mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but to rank and wholesale treachery, or such an attack on the very vitals of the nation as would render anything less than the sharp sword of martial law impotent to deal with it . This new sub-section 8 affords no more cases where the death penalty is in power to the Government than it already has. Every Government has, and must have, power, in a case of extreme urgency, tlie right to suspend the civil law Government will use its great powers and substitute mstrhial law. All that this without regard to persons; the guilty amendment docs is to express this in will be punished, butjustice w ill be done statutory form .

297,Mr Hughes,"The GovernmentI f the Government will not adjourn the debate, I am prepared to oppose the Bill to-day. This measure was put into the hands of honorahle memhers a short time ago, and we have not had an opportunity to peruse it. The Government are expecting too much in asking the House to swallow a Bill of this character without an opportunity to discuss it. hurriedly through the Bill, I find, on page 2, the words "" to prevent the spread of false reports,"" and the Bill continues to the effect that any man writing in a newspaper what the military authorities consider to be a false report, will be liable to trial by court martial. should not allow any Government to get a Bill like this passed in a hurry. Honourable members have a right to go on the public platforms of the country in order to -voice their grievances in regard to any action of the naval or military officers, and this may interfere with that right. As the measure now stands, if my honourable friend for Melbourne Ports drew attention from the public platform to the matter referred to yesterday, he would find himself in the hands of the military authorities at once. I am afraid that the Government are in a funk over this matter. One would think that the country was .'nil of enemies, when really there are no enemies here. In tlie Old. Country, trading with the enemy is met with a fine of from 5s. to 20s., but here, although we are 12,000 miles away, the Government are trying to get very heavy penalties. I am not prepared to put the liberties of the people in the hands of the military authorities. Now that the Prime Minister has returned to the chamber, I ask him, does he think it fair to try to force this Bill through with less than an hour for discussion? I , for one, if it goes into Committee, will do my best to prevent it from passing until members have had an opportunity of discussing it. Surely the matter is not so urgent as to prevent the Government from allowing it to stand over till Wednesday next. There are several memhers of the House who want to speak on it. I think it is a trick on the part of the Government to bring the matter on at this particular time. on the part of the Government to try to force the Bill through like this. able member is not entitled to say that. isters should give us an opportunity to discuss the Bill.

I want to say that we will take the War Precautions Bill first thing on Wednesday next, and I hope that members will give it their close attention, and not delay its passage. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [4.11] I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the War Precautions Bill if he will have the original Act printed, with the amendments inserted, so that we can follow them. This is a technical Bill, and it is impossible for honourable members to know what the amendments mean in their present form. I think that in other cases besides this the course I am suggesting ought to be followed. ister of Defence) [4.12] I will be pleased to comply with the honourable member's request. [4.12] I wish to ask the Prime Minister when we may expect a report with regard to matters brought before the House yesterday by the honourable member for Bourke. A painful shock was caused to the whole community by the publication of that speech, and the public mind should be relieved as early as possible. Besides the general public, those who are more intimately concerned-the members of the Forces themselves-desir e that the imputations which have been cast upon Australia as a whole should be removed as early as possible.

The public of Australia know that they can trust the honourable gentleman. We refuse to believe that any oflicer who has committed a theft will not be punished equally with a man of the rank and file. If , in the Australian Citizen Forces, we can eliminate this kind of thing, we shall be advancing civilization in a greater measure than any other nation. It might be that our men have not come under the influence of discipline to the same extent as their fellows in the Mother Country; but I want an authoritative statement from the Leader of the Bouse that whenever crime is proved against an officer he shall not escape while men of the rank and file are punished for a similar offence. Minister and Treasurer) [4.14] IJ I answer to the request made by the honourable member for Grampians, and the statement by the honourable member for Melbourne, I desire to say that, immediately the charges were made, I took steps to ascertain the facts. I go further than the honourable member for Melbourne, and say that an officer who offends in the way that has been alleged has committed a crime f a r . greater, in my opinion, than would have those who serve under him had they been equally guilty. I am not here to give judgment on the matter at present. I am not here to say whether the allegations are true or otherwise, but I do say that the evidence in .the possession of the Department is sufficient to demand that a thorough investigation of the whole proceedings shall be entered upon speedily and determined quickly. This is the position of the Government; and neither eminence in the Public Servioe of the Commonwealth nor any other influence will deter the Government from sifting this matter to the bottom. idea when we may expect the report! to say that, nor is the Ministeri n charge of the Department able to do so; but I say that, unless those immediately concerned can accelerate their pace, it wil l probably be taken out of their hands.
