House that members of the Select Committee on Election Laws of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, Canada, led by Mr current policy of the Board is unacceptable E. Dunlop, are at present in fhe gallery of the House. On behalf of the HouseI extend to members of the Committee a very cordial welcome. Annual Leave and Equal Pay ter a question about the Public Service. The Governnient has received another deputation from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations asking for 4 weeks annual leave, as has applied in all New South Wales State and local government employment for nearly 6 years, in lieu of the ceiling of 3 weeks leave which the statute has ordained since Federation and which is now below the standard in all State Public Services except the Western Australian. Since it was the right honourable gentleman who in another place 3 years ago rejected the last such application on behalf of the Holt Government, I ask him whether his Government has made a decision in the matter and when it will be announced. I also ask him when the equal pay decision, which the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission gave over 3 months ago, will be implemented in the Commonwealth Service. of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I inform him that the introduction of equal pay is a matter for the Public Service Board which, according to information given to me, is negotiating, is in discussion or is initiating action along those a particular matter in respect of the cirlines. In saying 'initiating action', I am not cumstances of an industry it does this not indicating that it has yet done anything, but it is directing its attention to the methods of doing it. On the first part of the question, there is nothing I can add to what is already known. to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Has his attention been drawn to the request by business leaders that he write to the Tariff Board directing attention to his previous statements that he believed the to the Government? This request appears to follow the statement of the Senior Deputy Chairman of the Tariff Board on 29th July, at the industrial chemicals inquiry, that the Board had received no ber is now giving information. I suggest that he ask his question. ment, which indicated that the Board had received no direction in the broad concerning a new policy. I therefore ask the Minister whether he will accept the industry recommendation and write to the Board repeating what he has previously said in this Parliament and elsewhere and advise the Parliament when he has done so. cedent for the Minister responsible for the Tariff Board writing to the Board and instructing it or seeking to influence its judgment. The historic policy of the Government stands; it is our policy to accord appropriate protection to industries which the TarirT Board itself adjudges to be economic and efficient. The great bulk of the Tariff Board references are in that form. The Board, as an advisory body, makes its recommendation to the Government and the Government regards itself as unfettered in making its own judgment about accepting the recommendation of the Board, or rejecting it, or referring it back to the Board, or perhaps amending it. The record shows that overwhelmingly the Government accepts the recommendations of the Tariif Board, but there are exceptions. When the Government wants the Tariff Board to take into account by writing a letter to the Board but within the terms of the reference to the Board.",7,Setup

8,Mr Mcewen,"There would be no preThese are the property not only of the Board but also of the public and of the industries concerned. This happens only on rare occasions. I think the reference that the honourable member made to a statement by a deputy chairman of the Tariff Board referred to the chemical industry. IfI may take one moment to refer to this matter it will illustrate completely the relationship between the Government and the Board. The chemical industry is operated overseas in gigantic complexes, often involving the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in one plant. History shows that if, through some circumstance, the market for that production tends to fall away, almost without exception the industry prefers to continue production and sell at whatever price it can get. Australia really is the only counby an answer I made to a question yestertry which relies only upon a tariff to protect its industry. Therefore, subject to the tariff, said, I am satisfied that the House of this is one country which is open to a vast inflow of a particular product. This happened in respect of the chemical industry. In a chemical industry reference we asked the Tariff Board to take this factor into account. The Tariff Board in that case did take it into account and made a recommendation that in addition to the normal ad valorem tariff percentage prescribed there should be a system of support prices. If the imports fell below support prices prescribed by the Tariff Board the effective duty would be higher than the normal ad valorem rate to meet that circumstance. That arose from a reference to the Tariff Board which I took to the Cabinet and cleared before it was sent to the Board. External Territories: Are witnesses before tiie committee of inquiry mto the recent events in the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain covered by parliamentary privilege? If they are, is this immunity being made clear to them? In view of the House of Assembly's lack of perception recently of the signiing. I hope that it was an effective action. ficance of the freedom of the Press and its sensitivity to Press criticisms, will the committee's advisers make clear to members of the committee the right of witnesses to say Education and Science a question. Has his what they really feel, even if it should be attention been drawn to statements that hostile to the House of Assembly and to the have been made concerning the cost of Administration? In view of what has happened in other emerging countries, can steps be taken to bring home to the House of Assembly the significance of the freedom of the Press, the immunity of witnesses and the independence of the courts in safeguarding human liberty? suggests that witnesses appearing before this commission of inquiry in the Gazelle Peninsula should have some sort of protection. I would agree with him because it would be a complete farce if a witness was unprotected. I am not aware of the circumstances of this particular case. However, I would agree with the point that the honourable member made. The honourable member seemed to cover another area in his question and this no doubt was prompted day on the freedom of the Press. As I Assembly accepts the importance of the principle of the freedom of the Press. This is a very important principle in a free democratic country. The honourable member also mentioned the judiciary. If we do not have a free judiciary, unfettered by any influence of Parliament, then we do not follow the other important principle of freedom of the judiciary. This also must be protected. As I pointed out yesterday, I have some sympathy with the House of Assembly. Yesterday I pointed out the misrepresentation by the Press of Australia of the circumstances of the Territory. One of the greatest dangers to the Territory is the build-up of opinion in Australia which has no regard for about 95% of the people of the Territory. Because people do not come down here to be interviewed at Press conferences their views are disregarded. This is a most serious situation for the people of the Territory. I mentioned yesterday that the Press was free to express its views. The action taken by the House of Assembly to exclude journalists was its only way of protesting at what was happen-",12,Tariff Board

11,Mr Pearsalli Ask The Minister For,"building schools in the States as compared to the cost of building schools in the Australian Capital Territory? Would the Minister care to comment if his attention has in fact been drawn to this statement? ment has been conducting an exhaustive inquiry into the cost of school construction in the Australian Capital Territory. It is difficult to make precise comparisons with building costs in the States because the things included in building costs in the various States and in the Australian Capital Territory are not always the same. Therefore, in many cases we find we are not comparing like with like. However, the examinahelped in the Government's scheme of tion we have conducted has shown that with advances in modern school design which have been taking place in parts of Australia and overseas, there is a high likelihood that in future designs we will be able to save on capital costs of schools without any reduction in quality and perhaps even with an improvement in quality insofar as the actual design of a school from an education point of view is concerned. Substantial changes in design of the kind we have in mind are unlikely to have an impact on schools for about 2 years because it will take time to adopt the designs which are now coming forward and in any case the construction always takes some time. But we will be seeking to establish closer liaison witb architects and the constructing authorities to make sure that educascheme for special drawing rights. I refer tion requirements are maintained at a high level and kept up to date with the most modern designs ih Australia and around the world. In doing this, I believe we will be able to save funds. dressed to the Minister for Social Services. In view of the numerous promises of nnancial assistance that have been made to State governments, to the wool industry and to various organisations in the past few days for the purpose of placating some unhappy sections of voters, will the Minister undertake to do something for another discontented section of the community which is much more deserving than some of the groups which are being helped, by granting an extra week's pension at Christmas time to all pensioners in Australia? 21050/69-K-[66 1 This could be paid as a special gesture by the Government to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing in Australia. that the honourable member's request will receive consideration, especially as it is in line with requests which he and other honourable members have made in the past. I cannot, of course, hold out any promise or commitment with regard to it. I would ask the honourable member to reconsider his remarks and not repeat the derogatory implications he has made about certain charitable organisations which have been social services. We intend progressively to make more and more use of these charitable organisations, both church and lay, in the application of funds and policy. I ask the honourable member to bear this in mind and to help us in what I am sure is the best way of using our funds both for the material benefits that they bring and the associated non-material benefits which sometimes go with them. Treasurer refers to the 1969 annual report of the International Monetary Fund and the setting up of a facility for the deliberate creation of international reserves through a also to the fact that the forthcoming fifth quinquennial review of the Fund quotas will provide a welcome opportunity to enlarge tbe Fund. Will the Treasurer inform the House of Australia's position regarding the special drawing rights scheme and the review of the Fund quotas? Australian Government has been pressing strenuously to have special drawing rights created and then what is called 'activated' -that is, that the amount of drawing rights should be ascertained and the allocations fixed so that countries may take advantage of this new facility. Three years ago at tha Rio de Janeiro meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund Australia took what I would regard as a leading role in working for the creation of these funds.",13,Education

At this meeting two very important decisions will be made. Thefirstis to ensure that the funds are activated, then that quotas are fixed and that the amount of funds to be made available is determined and available for use. It is understood that the recommendation from the Chairman of Directors of the Fund will be for the creation of $9,500m of special drawing rights-$3,500 m this year and $3,000m in subsequent years. Of this amount the Australian Government-the Australian people to put it more accurately-wil l be entitled, on pregoing to do something about it? sent quotas, to $225m. That in the initial stages is a big addition to our overseas reserves. After the difficulties we have faced what has been said or does not understand in recent years, with money crisis seeming to follow money crisis, the completion of the agreement first of all to activate the scheme then to allocate the drawing rights will, I think, be of enormous benefit in the improvement of world trade and the facilitation of the means by which world trade may be carried on. The last part of the honourable gentleman's question referred to the quinquennial review. A decision to review quotas will be made at this meeting. I hope that the Australian quota will be looked at favourably by the other countries. We shall be seeking an improvement on the present quota. to the Treasurer.

27,Mr Andrew Jones,"Will the MinisDr FORBES1 have not seen the specific articles to which the honourable member refers. If they follow the lines of articles I have seen elsewhere they will be complete misrepresentations of the position. I have seen a paper which was circulated by the Director of the Mutual Hospital Association Ltd in South Australia. I believe it to be an extremely accurate and fair representation of the situation in South Australia. It completely disproves allegations which have been made by the Labor Party in relation to South Australia. I shall be pleased if the honthat nest egg once a year in their tax ourable member will supply me with copies of the actual articles to which he refers in order that I can provide him with a reply in the terms he has requested. to the Prime Minister. In view of the reported announcement that the Federal Government could offer Victoria $40m for Melbourne's proposed underground railway as an election gimmick, will the Prime Minister also give consideration, when preparing his election policy speech, to providing a similar sum to the State of South Australia to enable the building of the Chowilla Dam? member's question is based entirely on a Press report which 1 am quite sure he cannot substantiate because I am quite sure nobody else can substantiate that Press two grounds. Firstly, question time is for report either. to the Minister for Health. Has a proposal been put forward for a compulsory health scheme under which thc Leader of the Opposition has claimed that people on average incomes would contribute about half as much as they now pay to the voluntary funds? Is this factual? Will all persons with a taxable income of $2,000 per annum or more pay less or more under the Labor scheme, and will the single male on an average income pay twice as much as he now pays, not 50% less? tion. The honourable member worked it out for himself. As the Prime Minister told the House some time ago, from the point of view of gross contributions under the two schemes the break-even point is $52 a week or $2,700 a year for a single person, and SI04 a week for married couples. That is not the full story, because the Labor Party scheme involves the loss of the present tax concessions for contributions. So many ordinary people in the community rely on refund cheques to buy important things. If net contributions are taken into account, the break-even point, that is the point at which people will commence to pay more under the ALP scheme, will be reached by a single person when he earns $39 a week. That is the $2,000 a year suggested by the honourable member. A married person earning S62 a week or $3,276 a year will pay more under the Labor Party's compulsory scheme. The honourable gentleman referred to the average income earner. I am informed that the present average income is $71.40 a week. Under the Labor Party's scheme the net contribution would be $45.80 a week for a single person, and under the present scheme the net contribution would be $22.70, so that the honourable gentleman is quite accurate in saying that the contributions under the Labor Party scheme for this person would be twice what they are under the present scheme.

My attention has been d$awn to the fact that in some instances in Victoria the Country Roads Board allocation to shire councils for road building and maintenance is less than the sum allocated last year. As this is the first year of the new Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement, I ask: Is there anything in the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act that would in any circumstances cause a reduction of grants to councils? Aid Roads Act provides for specific allocations to four categories. One of them is the category to which the honourable member referred in his question. There is no requirement by the Commonwealth that a State allocate funds to any particular authority for it to expend. The only requirehe in a position to inform the House what ment is that the money be spent on certain categories of roads. Money that was allocated under the old Act for roads other than highways, main roads and trunk roads is allocated under the new Act to roads in areas other than the statistical divisions of the capital cities or the urban areas designated in tbe Act. Those roads specifically attract an escalated amount of 5% compounded per annum over and above the amount allocated in 1968-69 under the old Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement, but there is no requirement that that escalated amount should be necessarily spent by any particular body. Accordingly it could be that in a State the amount allocated to local government is in fact less than the amount allocated in the previous year. It is not the intention of the Commonwealth that this should be so, but it is the intention that the money should go in increased allocations to that old designated category of roads. directed to the Prime Minister. I remind the right honourable gentleman that on 26th August1 asked him why Commonwealth departments refused to co-operate with public servants who are members of credit unions and who wished to have deductions made from their salaries. The Prime Minister replied that he had no information but would obtain it and advise me. In view of the considerable interest evinced question is by public servants in the thrift and loan finance advantages offered by credit unions, when may I expect an answer to this important question? has not been supplied to me. I will follow it up and see where it is. The honourable member can be assured that as soon as I get it be will get it. the Treasurer I refer him to the recently closed Commonwealth cash loan. Does the right honourable gentleman regard the result as satisfactory, bearing in mind the as yet unknown final result of the associated conversion loan and the present state of the Australian money market? Ts factors have been responsible for the remarkably strong support given to the short term securities maturing in November 1970? of view and also from a Government point of view I regard the loan as outstandingly successful. I say that for these reasons: Firstly, the money has to be obtained in order to support the loan and housing programmes of the States and to permit the Commonwealth development programmes to continue. Secondly, the loan before this was not the outstanding success that we would have liked. When looking at the",18,Superannuation

61,Mr Mcmahon,"From a national pointquestion of interest rates we also had to take into consideration the fact that the May 1971 and the May 1972 maturities which had market yields of 5.3% and 5.4% respectively, could not in fact be sold by the Reserve Bank of Australia on the open market. We therefore had to look at somewhat more attractive rates in order to ensure that we got the kind of subscription that we needed. Another very important fact associated with this matter is that we have, as I said in the Budget speech, a problem of excess liquidity or excess money supply. Therefore the more money that we can sop up at the moment the more it permits us to control the money supply and to make some impact upon inflationary forces. The amount of money directed to the 1970 loan was of the order of $157m. The loan maturing in November 1972 was for only $3.8m. That indicates, I think, that the Government, in deciding upon the 14 months security and the interest rate that was provided, made a very wise decision and an excellent contribution towards ensuring the satisfactory results of the loan. AGED PERSONS HMS ter for Social Services)-Fo r the information of honourable members. I present a list of homes subsidised under the Aged Persons Homes Act 1954-1969 as at 30th June 1969.

A full report setting out progress and activities for recommendations from the advisory comthe first year of the scheme will be made in due course as required under the States Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Act 1968. However, at this point I would like to let honourable members have some further details of progress made. The Commonwealth libraries programme provides a total of $27m over the period of the three calendar years 1969, 1970 and 1971. The general allocation of funds available is shown in the following table which, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard.

For the most part this expenditure has been on books, library materials and equipment. As far as library buildings are concerned all States are engaged in planning the facilities they propose to erect with Commonwealth assistance. In some cases the buildings have begun and are expected to be available for use early in the 1970 school year. I am not in a position now to indicate the individual government schools being assisted. The full lists of government schools assisted under the programme during 1969 will be made available when the report on the first year of operation of the programme Considerable progress has also been made in implementing the programme for independent schools. Honourable members will recall that for these schools I have the assistance of two advisory committees in each State, one representative of Roman Catholic schools and one of other nongovernment secondary schools. These committees recommend priorities among applicant schools and the amounts of individual grants and I have now received mittees in respect of almost all of the schools which will be assisted with library faciUties in 1969. Two committees have yet to advise me on schools within particular dioceses, and I expect a few additional",19,Commonwealth Loans
62,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar,Minis,20,Libraries Programme
63,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon,"recommendations to come forward shortly where committees have not yet allocated all the funds available to them. The attached lists set out by States the independent schools receiving grants in 1969 together with the amount of the grant in each case. The grants are for buildings, books, furniture or equipment or in some cases a combination of these purposes as recommended in each case by the appropriate advisory committee. J expect that all the advisory committees will be meeting later in the year to prepare recommendations for allocations for the year 1970, and all schools which have already applied for assistance will be reconsidered automatically for 1970 grants. I have written to more than half the schools on the attached lists to make formal offers of assistance in accordance with the recommendations of the State advisory committees and I shall be writing to the remaining schools in the very near future. I shall also be informing all the independent secondary schools which applied for assistance of the 1969 allocations. Many schools have in fact already been informed of these decisions. I have already approved the library building plans of a considerable number of independent schools. This means that these schools can go ahead with their projects with the knowledge that they will qualify for Commonwealth assistance. Some building projects have commenced and I have authorised the first payments to schools concerned. I expect this aspect of the programme to accelerate considerably in the next few months. In my statement of 17th AprilI informed Sydney honourable members that a number of short specialist courses in school librarianship had Tamworth Church or England Girls' School been arranged in co-operation with the Woodstock Presbyterian Girls* School .. State education departments for teachers New England Presbyterian Ladies College, from both government and independent schools. These courses were very successful and further sums have been set aside in the 1969-70 Budget to sponsor additional courses. My Department and State education departments are now planning these funds courses. In July of this year a 2 day seminar for architects interested in school library planning was held in Sydney. The Library Association of Australia organised the seminar in co-operation with my Department and the success of the seminar has led to the planning of a second one to be held in Melbourne next month. The Library Association is again undertaking the organisation on our behalf. There is no doubt whatever that the very great co-operation given by State and independent education authorities has enabled the Commonwealth libraries programme to get away to a very good start. 1 am confident that this level of co-operation will ensure the ultimate success of the scheme. With the concurrence of honourable members 1 incorporate in Hansard tables showing grants to independent schools under the Commonwealth secondary schools libraries programme.

66,Mr Hughes (Parkes) [11.26],"I haveimportant issue of defence. Here the Government and the Opposition are, unfortunately, not of the same mind. As we go to the polls it may fairly be said that the defence services of this country are growing in manpower. They are better equipped than ever before in the nation's history. The structures of defence organisation have been greatly strengthened. This is the heritage bequeathed to the country by the present Government. It is legitimate in the present context lo ask ourselves, on the eve of an election, to consider what fate would befall this very fine heritage if the Oppositime of undeclared war is not a palatable tion party were elected to government. Considered merely as a piece of paper enunciating ideals, some parts of the Labor Party's policy on defence constitute very fine words-quit e a good piece of workbut it is the work, I believe, of a dishonest showman. If you go behind the facade of words, Labor's policy on defence is nothing but a false pretence. Let me illustrate. If one goes to the platform enunciated at the Melbourne conference of the Australian Labor Party, held last July, one finds that this Party pays lip service to thc principle that Australia must have strong defence forces, properly equipped and provided with modern weapons of war. You cannot have strong defence forces unless you have sufficient manpower. Manpower is the base of defence-the co-equal base with equipment. (Quorum formed). When the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) obligingly decided to give me the audience he thinks I deserve, I was saying that, whilst of the Opposition, the Labor Party does not paying lip service to the ideal that Australia pose any viable or effective alternative to must have strong defensive forces, the Australian Labor Party is committed to a policy which would result in the de-gutting or the evisceration of a vital component of our defence forces because, if it conies into office, the Labor Party is committed to the abolition overnight of national service trainSingapore. When the Government formuing. The strength of the Australian Regular Army now stands at 48,000 men, of which 16,000 are national service trainees. I have not heard any honourable member on the other side of the House argue against the proposition that Australia needs a regular army of its present size. I pay tribute to the policies, as it did in Melbourne in July at its Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Federal Conference, its policies are formuBarnard) for his sincerity on defence matters. He has never urged that we can afford the risk of a smaller regular army. The Labor Party will not face up to the question of how to provide in peacetime a regular army of the present size without resorting to national service training as an essential ingredient of our defence programme. It is plain beyond any doubt that, in a situation such as we enjoy today of rising living standards and great opportunities for young people, we wili not get by any means at all-economi c inducement or otherwisea regular army of the strength needed without resorting to conscription. Conscription in what is in fact a step for any government to take, but it is a step which this Government took in 1964 and it is a policy to which this Government has since adhered out of a sense of national responsibility. What does the Australian Labor Party pose as an alternative to national service? It is idle to advocate the theory that voluntary recruitment will give us a regular army of the strength we need. Nevertheless, the Labor Party goes into the forthcoming election bent upon a policy which will result in the destruction of the Australian Regular Army as an effective fighting force. It is not just a question of our commitment in Vietnam or in Malaysia. Were those commitments to evaporate overnight-and they will not-it would still be necessary for us to have a regular army of the present size. Whatever may be said in all sincerity by men of good intention on the other side of the House, such as the Deputy Leader national service. The consequences to Australia of such a situation should not be left out of mind. 1 want to say a few words about Australia's military assistance to Malaysia and lates a defence policy it does so on the advice of military experts. Unfortunately, the same thing cannot be said about the formulation of a defence policy by the Australian Labor Party. It may have resort to a good deal of military advice, but the unfortunate, melancholy fact is that when the Australian Labor Party formulates lated without any regard to proper considerations of military security. I think 1 can make my point fairly effectively in this way: When the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr not believe that the people of Australia think Whitlam) returned in January of this year from a tour which took in Asian countries he said that the Labor Party would be prepared to keep Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy units based in Malaysia and Singapore. He was prepared to pledge himself to do that as short a time ago as the end of January of this year. While one may be fully entitled, as I think I am, to criticise the Leader of the Opposition for having said in the same breath that he saw no need for stationing Army units in the Malaysia-Singapore area, one must at least give him credit for having proposed the retention of an air and naval presence in an area which is so important to our security. It is perhaps a pity that the Labor Party's policy on defence cannot be formulated by the parliamentary members of the Party because, if what the Leader of the Opposition said in January represented the policy of the parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party, there is a relatively narrow area of difference on this aspect of our defence posture. But this is not so. At the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party in July the principle was propounded that Australia's armed forces should not be stationed anywhere overseas. Honourable members will recall that in a speech on defence in February of this year the Deputy Leader of the Opposition adumbrated the theory that it would be proper for Australia to provide specialists to train the Malaysians and Singaporeans to achieve an indigenous military capacity. But what I want to point out to the House, and I think it is something that should not be left out of account in the coming weeks, is that if the policy of the Labor Party which sible government, whether it be a Labor was formulated at the July conference is adhered to it would not be possible for a Labor government, consistently with that policy, to station any Australian troopsspecialist, general purpose or otherwise-in any overseas country ih a situation short of declared war. It is therefore true to say that while the Labor Party, as well as the Government, recognises that the part Australia should play in regional defence is to develop the indigenous capacity of our friends and neighbours, the Labor Party will do nothing to help develop that indigenous capacity short of selling arms and equipment, which I do not think is enough. I do it is enough. If the Labor Party came to power the consequences which would be reflected in the adoption of its policy in relation to national service and to the stationing of Australian forces overseas would put us in the position of being a nation whose word is not its bond. I do not think that that is a fate which the people of Australia would want to wish upon the nation. with a great deal of interest to the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes). I acknowledge that any discussion in this Parliament on defence matters is one of very great importance not only to the members who constitute the Parliament but also to the people of Australia as a whole. It is a great pity that the honourable membei for Parkes did not have more support. Not one member of the Cabinet considers this matter to be of suflicient importance to be present in the House. Where are the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall), the Minister for the Army( Mr Lynch) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr Kelly)? The only minister who listened to the honourable member for Parkes submit a case on behalf of the Government was the Minister for Air( Mr Erwin). This is a clear indication of the importance that the Government gives to the subject of defence, but I am glad to be able to spell out to the Government some of the Labor Party's defence policies. I have said publicly on a number of occasions that I regard the question of defence as one of crucial importance to this country. I do not believe that any respongovernment or a Liberal government, wouid want to neglect the defences of this country because of the critical position that this could create and because of the position in which it could place Australia at some time in the future. As shadow Minister for Defence in this Parliament, I have said on a number of occasions that I certainly would not want to be elected to the position of Minister for Defence to preside over thc disintegration of the armed forces. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr McLeay), who is seeking to interject, will not be here long enough to see the changes that I envisage take place.",25,National Service
67,Mr Barnard (Bass) [11.39],"I listenedIt is quite remarkable that the Government back bench should be taking the initiative in proposing matters for discussion Despite the announcement of further as matters of public importance, even at this belated stage. From memory, in the first session of Parliament the Opposition raised some twenty matters of public importance. In comparison, the Government raised one. It is commendable that Governmeut members should be trying to improve this dismal record in the last week of Parliament. In particular, it is comforting to see the honourable member for Parkes, who has not previously taken a great deal of interest in the innumerable defence debates in this House, suddenly finding hidden dangers in Labor's policies. The two specific policies the honourable member chose to deal with were the stationing of Australian servicemen overseas and national service. Apparently the honourable member still clings to the policy of forward defence, although it has been completely discredited. The central point of this policy was the commitment of Australian uoops to Vietnam. I think it is now generally accepted by the majority of Australians that this comthe Government will ultimately be forced mitment was a mistake. Tbere is also widespread evidence and acceptance in thc electorate that Australian troops should be withate before 25th October how it intends to drawn. This has been reflected in the public opinion polls and in most of the responsible editorial opinions of the Press. Unfortunately, the Government has got out of step with changing opinion trends. Certainly, there was a majority support for fhe war before the 1966 elections. This feeling has gone full circle until now there is an atmosous consequences flowing from Labor's phere of disenchantment with the war. The honourable member for Parkes had nothing to say about the situation in Vietnam. This disenchantment has been the inevitable result of the great re-thinking of the Vietnam issues which has gone on in the United States. The process of United States disengagement has begun; it will not be slowed down or reversed. Thailand and the Philippines have indicated that they want to withdraw their units as soon as possible. The Prime Minister of New Zealand has expressed his willingness to consider withdrawal of that country's commitment. The other major participant, Korea, is in Vietnam largely in a mercenary role, and presumably it will remain to the end. Only the Australian Government has refused to accept the realities and plan a phased withdrawal. United States troop cuts and the inevitability of heavy withdrawals next year, the Government remains recalcitrant. However, this is a situation that must be faced. It may have been possible for the Government to avoid fixing a withdrawal timetable on the grounds that United States troop cuts only bring its forces back to the level of 1967, when the Australian commitment reached its peak. But even this subterfuge will become increasingly untenable as the pace of United States withdrawal steps up. The Government may be able to side-step until the election, but if it is returned it must face up pretty quickly to setting a time-table for withdrawal. If a Labor Government is elected there will be no uncertainty about the course of events. We will withdraw all Australian units as quickly as possible, allowing time for alternative arrangements to be made, and for Australian troops to be disengaged without danger to them. This is the course to take; it would be an honest approach to face this issue squarely and tell the electorwithdraw. Government policy will be forced by the train of events to move in the direction of the consistent and principled stand which has been taken by the Labor Party. With regard to Vietnam, I see no dangerpolicy. It is a policy the Government will be forced to adopt if it is returned. It is purely a question of degree whether the troops are withdrawn early in the new year by a Labor Government or at the end of tbe year by a Liberal-Country Party Government. The troops certainly will be withdrawn; it is blind folly to pretend otherwise. The other aspect of Labor's policy on stationing troops overseas, and which was referred to by the honourable member for Parkes, relates to the Malaysia-Singapore region. The Labor Party has always recognised that Australia has a special interest in the security of this region. However, the party's attitude is that this security can no longer be assured by the stationing of token forces in the region. Under present Government policy an army battalion is stationed in western Malaysia; it will be moved to Singapore with one company posted on a rotating basis to the Penang region. The Labor Party believes that a continued presence in Malaysia-Singapore does nothing to assure the security of the region. The Government has insisted that Australian troops would not be involved in the internal affairs of the two nations. The Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) is insistent that Australian troops must be kept out of any conflict over Sabah. The Malaysian Government with an army of sixteen battalions has the capability to handle guerilla insurgency from the remnants of Communist forces around the Thai border area. In these circumstances what is the Australian commitment expected to provide, apart from showing the flag and bringing some minor economic benefits? It is a commitment of quite remarkable military irrelevance. It has not served to improve our relations with Malaysia; rather it has produced considerable bickering and misunderstanding. Against this background the return of Australian troops from Malaysia-Singapore is both desirable and necessary. The Labor Party believes that Australia's regional responsibilities can best be assured by flexing from this policy. It is a valid alternative ible and highly mobile troops with the capability of striking rapidly from the mainwith the trend of events than the Governland to assure Australian security or to fulment's responses. fil treaty or United Nations obligations. Accordingly a Labor Government would scrap the sterile and discredited forward defence concept and replace it with a policy of regional defence. The basis of this policy is that the armed forces would be reorganised and re-equipped for maximum mobility. They would be based on the Australian mainland and in New Guinea. Under this policy, an active role would be pursued in training with regional partners. Britain has set the pattern for the sort of training exeron 25th October the conscription process cises we envisage by its rapid transfer of mobile forces from the United Kingdom for training exercises in Australia and South East Asia. Further five-power exercises are planned for the training area in western Malaysia next year. It would be much more meaningful and realistic for Australia to participate in exercises of this sort on a mobile basis from the Australian mainland than to adopt a static approach based on conventional posts in Malaysia and Singapore. It has been suggested by Government members, principally the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), that Labor's policies would confine activity to the Australian mainland with the Navy locked up within our harbours. This is an absurd misinterpretation. What Labor policy envisages is a creative co-operation witn regional partners in training of all elements of the. forces-land , sea and air. This active programme of regional training would be supplemented by the provision of specialist and technical assistance to regional partners. Under such a policy, assistance would be given to train and assist the development of the air defences of Malaysia and Singapore for which Australia has accepted special responsibility. AgainI believe this is a more rational and responsible approach to Australia's defences than a continued token presence on the ground. The commitment to Vietnam has added not a jot to Australia's ultimate security. Rather, it has associated this country with a policy abhorrent to most of the nations of the world. The commitment to Malaysia contributes nothing positive to the defences of either Australia or Malaysia-Singapore. AgainI see no dangerous consequences flowand I suggest that it is much more in accord The other subject of concern to the honourable member for Parkes was national service. This is directly related to the Vietnam war. Conscription was quite blatantly introduced by Sir Robert Menzies with the Vietnam commitment in view. As an instrument of policy it cannot be divorced from the Vietnam war. The Labor Party has always been most vehemently opposed to conscription for this war. If we are elected geared for the Vietnam war will cease immediately. We have said to the people of Australia that we believe there is not necessity for the conscription of Australian youth, particularly in the circumstances under which this Government carries out its conscription programme, unless there is a state of national emergency. I do not want to retreat into history to remind the Government of the responsibilities that were accepted by the last two Labor governments, particularly the Curtin Government, when Australia was involved in a global conflict. No other Australian government has accepted responsibility in the way that Labor governments accepted responsibility at that time. With withdrawal from Vietnam and some are in Papua and New Guinea mainly re-organising and re-equipping the forces on as support elements to the Pacific Islands the lines I have indicated, there will be a Regiment and the Citizen Military Forces complete transformation of the existing component there-the Papua and New military structure. This will take place in a Guinea Volunteer Rifles. context in which even the Prime Minister concedes there will be no threat to Australian security for at least 10 years.

69,Mr England (Calare) [11.54],"In 10 Society in Victoria in August. WithoutIt is interesting to note that one of our top experts, the Chief of the Air Staff, has spoken of the F ill aircraft's being deployed either in our north or west or, in certain circumstances, at Butterworth. This is forward defence as envisaged by our top Air Force expert. There are other planks in the Labor Party's platform that I have not time to deal with at length but they deal with the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the alternative arrangements for the Fill-and that egg will be hard to unscramble now. I confine myself to the first three salient factors as they relate to the matter before us. In his speech the Deputy Leader of the Opposition used the term 'the discredited military strategy of forward defence'. I ask: Discredited in whose eyes? Certainly not in the eyes of the skilled expert, not in the eyes of the Australian military mind and not in the eyes of our top advisers who gain their experience not just from the training they receive in Australia but from training at the top military academies and staff colleges throughout the world. These are the experts, the men who are advancing this concept of forward defence, and it is not for the politician to come here as a military expert. These men have devoted their lives to the study of these particular problems. Judging from election results and from what I can gather in my area, I disagree with the previous speaker. This is not a discredited policy in the eyes of the Australian public. We could argue about that all day, but we will hear the answer to that on 25th October next. It is certainly not discredited in the eyes of our allies, our partners in the most powerful ANZUS treaty. It is not a discredited policy at all. It is not discredited in the eyes of Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore, or the Malaysian people, the people of the Philippines, Borneo, Thailand or any of the other countries for which we have feelings of friendship, and with which we desire to trade and to have closer relations in the cultural field. It is not discredited in their eyes at all. It is discredited a form of national service existed without only in the eyes of the isolationists. That is the only place in which forward military defence is discredited. I do not mind delving into history and I by the Liberal Government for the think that we can take lessons from history purposes of the Vietnam war. So that if it is applied to the future. I well rememyour belief or non-belief in the present ber tbe screams that came from the Western part of the world, and from some quarters in this country, against the isolationist policy of our great ally, America, in the last war. WheneverI hear talk of isolationism and of Fortress Australia it brings to mind what I read in one of Churchill's books on the Second World War. The theme of this volume was how the British people had held the fort alone till those who hitherto had been half blind were half ready. 1 think we should be careful that we do not put ourselves in that position. I submit that if Australia were to follow the Australian Labor Party policy it would act as if it were half blind, and certainly we would run the risk of being militarily half ready. I could go on at length but time is against me in this debate. It is interesting to ask: Why are our troops overseas? What dangers confront us in the short term and the long term? I see Communist imperialism as a threat to Australia in the future. This is manifested by quite a number of things. I could refer to a number of manifestations as they apply to Russia and to the Chinese People's Republic, but there is insufficient time. I sum up my remarks by saying that these troops in the main are there in a forward position mainly because of out treaty obligations and at the request of our allies. I think any talk of unilateral withdrawal is not in the interests of this nation. your attention to the state of the House.

72,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [12.5],"Fo rstate of national service depends upon your belief or non-belief in the Vietnam war. If the Commonwealth Government had any purpose of trying to win the Vietnam war or to achieve anything in Vietnam one could begin discussing the case for it and therefore the case for the national service that is associated with it, but the Government has no purpose in Vietnam. My son is one of those who has drawn the marble. He is not a conscientious objector. He believes in obeying a legitimate government of the country. When his university course expires, if he passes his medical tests-and I anticipate that he will -presumabl y he wili go in. If the Government is still in office and is still running its statement about that when he said: perpetual war in Vietnam he will no doubt go there, but neither he nor I has any belief that the Government has any purpose in Vietnam except sheer expediency. This was brilliantly summed up by a lecturer at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, who said that the Government's policy towards Vietnam was Danegeld to the United States of America and beyond that it did not want the subject mentioned. I exempt from some of the strictures that I am going to make the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) because the honourable member and the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) with some sort of logic and belief in the war in Vietnam asked the Government to protest about the fact that ships of British registration were carrying arms to the port of Haiphong for the purpose of killing Australian and allied soldiers. We saw the reaction of the Government to the motion that they moved. The Government was simply embarrassed. But the habitual low posture that non Labor parties have always adopted to the UK, even when it is governed by a Labour Government, has caused this Government to do nothing, and say nothing publicly. So there is a tacit agreement between the US and the Soviet Union that the port of Haiphong remains open and British ships .carry the North Vietnamese and Vietcong supplies. When the Soviet Ambassador was responding to the sympathetic noises-sympatheti c major explanation he gives for the failure towards Soviet policy-that were made by of volunteers to come forward. Honourable the Minister for External Affairs( Mr members opposite suggest that a Labor Freeth) the Ambassador chidingly and gengovernment would not have any chance tly said: 'Of course, we had one field of of getting any recruits for the Regular disagreement still, and that was Vietnam.' In the supplies that go to North Vietnam the Soviet supplies the 'champagne' and China supplies weapons which might be classified as the ginger beer. The weapons that are being used for the destruction of Australian troops in Vietnam come from the Soviet Union and some of them are carried in British ships. If Australia ever had done that against Britain during a UK war we and the world would have heard a good deal about it. But the whole thing adds up to this: Why are we in Vietnam? The answer is that we are in Vietnam because the Americans are there. Why are the Americans there? I think that C. Northcote Parkinson made a fair enough In its foreign policy the United States is somewhat hampered by the US system of education in which ideology is strong and geography weak. A policy of containing Communism everywhere may be theologically admirable but it is geographic nonsense. The United States cannot hold territory in Asia without appalling and useless bloodshed and expenditure. Strategically, the long term purpose is and must be to prevent the Chinese occupying Australia. A war for this purpose would be fully justified, but no American in his senses should want, for this purpose, to give battle north of the Philippines and the Isthmus of Kra. And granted that such a conflict is inevitable (as it probably is) the time chosen is no more suitable than the battlefield. For the Chinese move southward has not even begun. The present American policy is thus to waste resources on a local conflict, forgetting that the main enemy is not in the field and may have no immediate plans relating to the area in dispute. It is possible to exhaust one's ammunition before the battle begins. That is a perfect summary of the reasons why the United States is seeking to withdraw from Vietnam. People who believe in a continuing war in Vietnam believe also in the present form of national service. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) who launched this debate, spoke about expert advice. The Government had some expert advice on recruiting and it has been made public. It is the advice of Admiral Becher, the Director-General of Recruiting. He said his problem in recruiting men for the Army, Navy and Air Force stems from the hatred of Australian youth for the war in Vietnam. This is the Army. But this is a purposeless war in which quite clearly we are betraying our own forces because we are not trying to win it. Our forces just stand around in the last presence of Australian troops in Malaya. analysis as targets while they engage in some mythical form of 'containment'.

I for my part have a singular reluctance to indulge in any partisan activities, as we are on the threshold of an election campaign. I am constrained and 1 hope that my constraint will shine through, beckoning him on, step by step. 1 want to come back to Labor's assumption. It is a fallacious assumption, it is a misleading assumption and beyond that it is a dangerous assumption. It is all very fine for the Australian Labor Party, in Parliament and out of Parliament, to say: 'We will support the ANZUS agreement'. But if no goodwill has been established with the United States of America, what summons do we give to it in a time of stress, strain or difficulty? The simple truth of the matter is that it is not possible to call for the specific people all over the world. He would have performance of the ANZUS agreement. We shouid reflect upon the observation passed by the present President of the United States of America, President Nixon, when as a private citizen he wrote on foreign afTairs2 years ago. He pointed to the malaise now affecting the American society, and that is tbe extreme reluctance of the people of the United States to become involved in any disturbance anywhere in the world. My honourable friend and the Leader of the Opposition will recall that the President went on to sayI give an approximate paraphrase-that even at the request of the host government the United States would not unilaterally intervene if asked to do so. That remark carries the most significant meaning for this country. I go to the subject of Vietnam and I say to my honourable friend from Fremantle that here is an illustration of the building up of goodwill. I indulge in no humbug about Vietnam. My complaint has been about the way that the Vietnam war has been conducted. It could have been won and it should have been won years ago. If the proposition had been put years ago that there would be a build up to 600,000 troops in Vietnam, it would have been described as a massive escalation. The war could have been won and it should have been won. Today the unhappiness and the misery that grip that part of the world would not have been present. Where would Labor stand in relation to Vietnam if Australia had said: 'Under the tocol country, but you will excuse us from accepting our obligation under that treaty'? obligation. I hope that is clear, although I have the gravest of doubt as to whether it is clear to the other side of the House. There is a joint and several obligation. What would have been the feeling of the United States of America towards Australia if this country, referring to its obligation to you will excuse us from any involvement'? Then the Labor Party would have turned to the ANZUS Agreement. Could it in those circumstances have called for specific performance under the ANZUS Agreement? Let us put ourselves in the position of an American citizen, an American taxpayer who has been paying high taxes for years and is being kicked in the shins by said: 'Very well, if this is to be the attitude of Australians and there is to be no response from them, then there will be no response from us'. The policy of the Labor Party is lit up when one looks at article 2 of the ANZUS Agreement which deals with the parties maintaining and developing, by means of continuous and effective self help and mutual aid, their individual and collective capacity to resist armed aggression. It is the clear policy of the Australian Labor Party to renegotiate, for example, the North West Cape communications base agreement. What does renegotiate mean/ To my mind at least it means that they want to get something which, in their judgment, is far more favourable to Australia than is the case at the moment. What happens if the Americans say: 'No, we will not renegotiate'. Do they pitch the agreement out? Do they say to the Americans: 'Take your junk and go home'? Let the Leader of ihe Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) answer that question. Will he say to the Americans, with respect to the Pine Gap and Woomera joint Australian and American bases, two more bases contracted under the ANZUS Agreement: 'Tear them down and get out of the",33,National Service

77,Mr Killen,"That is a typical remarkcountry'? I would like the honourable gentleman, whom I understand will be on his feet in a moment, to answer these questions. What is the policy of the Australian Labor Party with respect to these three oases in Australia? Are they for dismantling them or are they for the assumption of a reasonable and respectable degree of responsibility under the ANZUS Agreement? Sir, 1 come to the last thing I want to say. The honourable member for Fremantle said-and this also was said in a different way by the Deputy Leader of the OpposiSouth East Asia do not want AustraUan troops in South East Asia. That was not the experience of the honourable member for myself when we spoke to the Singaporean leaders and the Malaysian leaders. These are the people who live in that area, the people who have assumed responsibility for government and defence in the area. They stated-and ] hope this is no breach of confidence-in the plainest possible terms that they welcomed an Australian presence there. My colleague from Robertson and I could not find one politician in the entire area who was moderately antagonistic to an Australian presence in South East Asia, t suppose this would account for what was stated on 27th January 1969 by Dato Donald Stephens, the High Commissioner for Malaysia. I refer to the following newspaper reporr: Confidence in Australia by the Malaysians would be badly affected if Australia withdrew its defence forces from Singapore and Malaya, the Malaysian High Commissioner, Dato Donald Stephens, said in Canberra on Saturday. What do my honourable friends opposite say to that? Is Mr Stephens in error? If so, let us hear from the Opposition. Sir, this debate has been a useful exercise because I think it has pointed up, in the way it should be pointed up before the electors of Australia have their say on great issues, that there are significant differences in opinion between those who sit on this side of the Parliament and those who sit on the other side. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in bis Fabian Lecture, spoke about a Labor government being in the saddle and with the whip drawn by lst November. That is the sort of language that I appreciate very much indeed but I am bold enough to point out to the honourable gentleman that as I see the Australian Labor Party it is standing at the barrier flatfooted and does not even have a bridle on. the Opposition) [12.24]Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) is a chastened man after yesterday. This was to be his great week. He is preparing for opposition. I do not underrate his gifts as an oppositionist. For 14 years he has sat behind the Ministrywell behind it. He once in fact rose to the giddy heights of Deputy Whip but he lost that position or gave it away. I should not imagine that, if he survives as a member of this House on 25th October, he would aspire to be Leader of the Opposition or Deputy Leader of the Opposition; but this week he has been making his run for the position of Whip. Yesterday, after 14 years, he showed a sudden interest in Queensland hospitals and raised the subject. Of course he was well and truly chastened. Today we were expecting, not the honourable member for Moreton's maiden speech on health, but the swan song of the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) on this subject which has been raised by the Government Parties. The Government is panic stricken. This is the first government in memory which, in the last week of sittings before an election, has rehearsed the arguments it will put in opposition. Imagine Sir Robert Menzies admitting defeat in advance. Imagine Sir Robert Menzies, who, admittedly, regarded the honourable member for Moreton as magnificent have thought that the honourable member was one of those magnificent men in his flying machines that he ordered, the Fit Is. Mr Minister, in your own words. But imagine Sir Robert Menzies allowing this paltry tactic in the last week of the shortest Budget session on record.

There are twenty-one Ministers in the House of Representatives and the senior twenty are absent. The junior Minister, the Minister for Air( Mr Erwin), is keeping house. In the absence of so many eminent gentlemen I cannot be expected to take this matter seriously. If the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) can spare time to speak to the House on defence, as he did last February, I will lead the debate in reply. If the Minister for External Affairs( Mr The platform continues: Freeth) makes a speech on international affairs-h e did so a month ago, the first Government statement on international affairs since autumn last yearI will lead the debate in reply.

Deputy Speaker, tp the honourable member for Moreton for describing the honourable member for Evans (Dr Mackay) as 'His Oiliness'. I want to pay tribute to the aptness of phrase of the honourable member for Moreton. In case the honourable member for Moreton or the honourable member Berowra, if he gets over the Liberal independent's opposition-decide s to quote from today's Hansard, let me put on record the Australian Labor Party's policy on the matters which are the subject of the urgency motion as circulated. I will state my Party's platform, as reiterated only at the beginning of last month, about mutual defence systems in our region. As my deputy has said, the Labor Party's attitude on these matters concerns regional defence, regional development, regional training and regional procurement. I would now like to read the platform of the Australian Labor Party on defence, as reiterated at the beginning of last month. Our platform states: A mutual defence system should be developed among nations within the South East Asia and Indian sub-continental areas and beyond, consistent with the requirements of the United Nations Charter and with the general provisions of Australia's existing defence treaty commitments. Provision of strong defence forces: (a) Properly equipped and provided with modern weapons of war. (b) Capable of great mobility in areas necessary for Australia's defence. (c) Having sufficient range and strike power to deter aggressors. (d) Capable of being used for maintenance and supervision of peace as part of the United Nations forces or for carrying out international peace keeping agreements. The honourable gentleman for Parkes who interjects and who originated this debate referred to our attitude towards Malaysia and Singapore. He did not, in fact, quote fore, let me put this in the record. The Britain has announced her intention to have forces available for use if required in the area. Australia must recognise Britain's intention and co-operate with it. Australia must develop of ensuring Australia's security as well as cooperating with allies in the area. Australia should be prepared to provide assistance to train military forces in Malaysia and Singapore and to make Australian defence facilities available to Britain. Australia must work to form a mutual defence system, including all her neighbours. No defence unless they include Indonesia. Indonesia should be encouraged to participate in regional arrangements for the development and security of the area. The honourable gentleman omitted to quote these matters which I have now put in the record. I do not say that he did not accurately quote some matters. The honourable member for Moreton, however, attributed many statements to the Labor Party which are not to be found in any of our publications.

89,For Parkes ( Mr Hughes),"o r perhapsOn the very matter which the honourable member for Parkes raises, might I ask him: What does he believe are the facts upon which a fortnight ago I put the following questions on the Notice Paper for the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall): (1) (a) When did the Royal Australian Air Force units depart from Ubon and (b) What governments were consulted before and about their departure. (2) (a) What governments are being consulted about the departure of the troops from Terendak and (b) What arrangements have been made for their departure. (3) When is each battalion in Vietnam due to complete its tour of duty in that country. The fact is that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), my deputy and 1, over repeated visits to all those South East Asian countries in the last 5 years know the attitude of these countries. We have conducted discussions on terms of personal intimacy with the leaders of their governments. WhatI have said on the four occasions which I have cited stands and in fact accords with their wishes. After looking at the disastrous Five-Power Conference in Canberra a few months ago, which was conducted under thc present Prime Minister, it will be a breath of fresh air in this area and in this country to have a change of government; to have my deputy as Minister for Defence and Supply, to have in him and the honourable member for Fremantle, who would be in charge of Territories, and myself people who know the people and governments of the region and know what they require and desire. a personal explanation. 1 claim to have been misrepresented in an outrageous fashion by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). During the course of his speech on defence he described me as being a debutant speaker on health. Yesterday he said, with respect to health and he said again todayI want to be quite precise on this-that it was the first speech I had ever made on health in 14 years. T picked up at random a Hansard dated 23rd September 1958. It contains a powerful forward-looking speech on the National Health Bill. The speech was made by myself and it concludes: A single doctor, like a sculler plies, The patient lingers, then slowly dies. But two physicians, like a pair of oars, Shall waft him swiftly to the Stygian shores. I think the two doctors, politically speaking, will do exactly that to the Leader of the Opposition. discussion is now concluded.

This involves a detailed comparison of the standard and claimant States' budgetary revenues and expenditure. From 19S9-60 the standard States have been New South Wales and Victoria. However, subject to any developments arising from the forthcoming review of the financial assistance grants arrangements, the Commission intends, as from 1970-71. to base its recommendations on a standard derived from the experience of all non-claimant States. This is the new feature in this legislation. The legislation widens the field of standard States. In the long run this could be a good thing.

The Commonwealth Grants Commission was originally set up away back in 1933 during the depression and it has been very good. It has done a lot to help the economies of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely and I am convinced that the increased power given to the Grants Commission over the years caused it to become an economic father or dictator to the claimant States-in this instance Tasmania. The claimant States could not disagree with the Commission, in this instance the Commission has recommended a special grant to Tasmania of almost $22m. One does not argue with Father Christmas. For this very good reason Tasmania is not arguing with the Grants Commission because it is being helped to a very large extent. ButT do not think it is right that Tasmania should be forced to cut expenditure on vital services because of some economic theory or formula worked out by the Grants Commission. AlthoughI am critical of the Commission on this aspect, at the same time T appreciate the work that it does under its charter. The Commission has been a great worker. It has been interested in the development of the claimant States. It has made a thorough analysis of the situation which exists in a particular State and has travelled everywhere to see the development-hydro electric, public works, forestry and so onin that State. The Grants Commission is acquainted at all times with what is going on in Tasmania. I cannot criticise it for the way it goes about its duties. My criticism is the principle under which the Grants Commission is forced by the Government to work. Naturally it would be a wonderful thing for Tasmania if it did not have to rely on the Grants Commission for assistance but could work, out its own economic salvation entirely. However, that day is a long way off yet. I do not want to speak at length on this Bill, although I could speak for the half hour allotted to me because the Bill concerns every phase of Tasmania's economy. The amount of almost $22m which is to be provided under this Bill will be spent, as the State Government sees fit, in every phase of Tasmania's economy. A portion of the amount will go towards roads, the administration of the State and ordinary, every day services. The sum of almost S22m is quite a lot of money for a State the size of Tasmania. In conclusion, I wish to comment on the roads system in Tasmania. The annual grant to Tasmania under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement was increased earlier this year. Under the legislation-on e could almost call it a national roads plan-the total grant to the States over the next 5 years was increased to $1,250m. The proportion is worked out in accordance with a certain formula. Tasmania was to receive something like $50m more over the next 5 years, but the Goverament introduced the new category of urban roads. This measure will help the development of the urban roads throughout Australia, particularly the mainland States. Hobart and Launceston are the only places in Tasmania which are deemed to have urban roads. In this sense there will be rivalry between the two cities as to which one will get the greater proportion of money. The former Premier of Tasmania, Mr Reece, asked the Commonwealth Government to include the north-west coast roads in the category of urban roads. This would take in the roads from Devonport to Burnie. These towns, which are very close together, are in the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies). The area is well' known to everybody in Tasmania. A beautiful highway has been built there. Mr Reece asked the Commonwealth Government whether it would include this section under its urban road category because its inclusion would take the drain off main roads expenditure. Up to the time Mr Reece was defeated he had not been informed whether the Commonwealth Government had agreed to his request but since then the Commonwealth Government stated that it is against such a move. This has been a blow to Tasmania. The Commonwealth Government has allowed the road system along the Gold Coast of Queensland to be included in the urban roads category. There is no difference between the two sections of roadway, except that more money has been invested in the Gold Coast area. Although there is no difference in the miles of road and although both areas are beautiful, the Tasmanian request has been refused and its section will not be included in the new category. The second category in the roads legislation is the main roads-trunk roads systems. The third category is council or municipal roads. We are all familiar with these roads, especially honourable members who represent country electorates. The Tasmanian Minister for Lands and Works has been sending out letters to the local councils in Tasmania informing them that in some cases they might get as much as they received last year under this grant but in other cases they will get less. In some instances the amounts provided by the State Government for certain road projects will be halved. These letters have caused quite a revolution throughout the States. It is a wonder that the councils have not marched on Hobart en masse because they are so upset and angry about these letters from the Tasmanian Minister. I suppose he is only carrying out the instructions he received from the Commonwealth. I asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr ironed out between the two Governments so Sinclair) yesterday whether he was aware of the anger of the councils. I went on to ask: Is it not a fact that the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill reduced Tasmania's total share of Federal Government moneys from 5% to 4£%? Will the Government review the legislation in the light of the unfavourable impact of it? Especially its unfavourable impact on Tasmania. Let us be quite frank about it, the Minister's reply puts the Tasmanian Government on the spot. He said: I am aware that the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement is out of its swaddling clothes. 1 am also aware that it is going to make a notable contribution to the improvement of the Australian road systems. As to the other suggestions, I inform that the marriage has turned into a long the honourable member that these have not been brought to my knowledge. I am not aware of any concern felt by local authorities in Tasmania as to could well have been cupid's bow and not the level of funds they will receive under the next the shotgun as suggested by the honourable S-ycar allocation. However, the honourable member will be aware, as we all are aware, that Tasmania received a 50% increase in its allocation over the 5 years of this Agreement by comparison with the 5 years of the earUer Agreement. He will also be aware that for all the local authorities which ucder the old Act received a 40% allocation For years local government authorities have been allocating 40% of the grant for rural roads made to the State Government under the Commonwealth aid roads grants. . . there is provision within the new Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement for an increase of 5% above the amount that was allocated for roads in the last year of the previous 5-year Commonwealth Aid Roads period. This 5% per annum compounded increase of funds should ensure that all of those roads that were previously designated as roads other than highways, main roads and trunk roads That is municipal roadswill receive an increased allocation, and consequently should ensure that in Tasmania and every other State of the Commonwealth there will be an enhanced road construction programme for ihe ensuing period. The last sentence is significant. It states: Certainly there should be no reduction. Yet the councils have been informed by the State Minister in Tasmania that there is to be a reduction in many of their yearly allocations. So somewhere the lines have crossed between the Commonwealth and the State in what we call the 'implementation of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act'-bot h in the spirit of the Act and in its practical application. I hope that this matter will be that local authorities in Tasmania will not be penalised under the new Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, because when the Bill was introduced in the autumn session of Parliament these local authorities were told that they were to receive 5% more than they received previously. My colleague the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) will be following me from this side of the chamber, and anything which I have omitted he will take up. to support the Bill, and would simply comment, in respect of the statement made by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) concerning a shot gun marriage, and happy affair.

It is hard to take. mania.",39,Tasmania Grant Bill 1969

102,Mr Duthie,"You had a long time in Tasperience. So far as the grant to Tasmania is concerned, perhaps there is some degree of probing inquiryI would not call it embarrassment-mad e by the Commonwealth Grants Commission into the activities of the State Government, particularly regarding the proposed expenditure of grants which may from time to time be made to the State. I do not feel that a grave problem is facing the Tasmanian Government. Perhaps the situation could impede certain progress in some directions along the road which the Government ought to be taking as compared with the decision ultimately reached by the Grants Commission. But I believe that generally speaking the people who carry out this inquiry are competent, tolerant, capable and understanding. Usually the grants which they recommend for the State are fair and equitable. We realise that the inquiry could bring into stark reality some of the problems which are not common in a continent the size of Australia. In Tasmania we have some problems which are of a seasonal nature and which perhaps do not occur in the State of Queensland. For instance, under the very heading of 'welfare', to which the honourable member for Wilmot referred, we find that over the years the Tasmanian government, at the insistence of the then Opposition, finally granted a heating allowance to age pensioners who live alone. I should imagine that this allowance is unnecessary in a State such as Queensland, but it is one which takes a considerable amount of money from the welfare grant to Tasmania. When we look to the magnitude of the continent of Australia we see that there must be great variations, yet in the determinations of the Grants Commission there is a levelling could well come within the ambit of this or an averaging of what is happening in legislation, but 1 do not propose to canvass every State. I wonder in what situation the State of the grant which it receives fairly and justly, Tasmania would find itself, from the and if the requirements of the areas to point of view of the Grants Comwhich the honourable member for Wilmot mission if, for instance, it were to has referred-the north-west coast citiesmanage without a deficit budget. Since are such that they warrant a priority in every other State finds it necessary preference to other parts of the island, then or fashionable to budget for heavy deficits, tbey will get it. But my experience has been if the State of Tasmania were not to budget that over tbe years the northern part of for a deficit, would it incur a penalty from the island has been so thoroughly spoilt the Grants Commission? I do not believe in this matter that it is about time some that this is situation which could or should of the money was expended in the other not be tolerated in the event of the State end of the island, and I am looking forward managing to balance its budget. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that some of the States are finding it necessary to have deficit budgets, particularly in the proportions which deficits are reaching at the present time, because it is eating into the next year's taxation revenue, and each State is finding that it must borrow money in order to liquidate interest which is owed from the previous year. So to this extent there is a degree of crippling of incentive by the averaging system. This fact was recognised by the Grants Commission some time ago, because there was a period during which Tasmania, as a claimant State, was compared with the standard or larger States of New South Wales and Victoria with whom Tasmania had perhaps less in common than it had with any of the other States. Probably Tasmania has a great deal more in common with Western Australia, in terms of terrain, exports, and the need to develop because of the smaller population in those States. SoI believe it is an advantage that Tasmania is to be considered in the light of the average of all the other Australian States. So long as Tasmania's incidence of taxation does not fall, by comparison, below the average of the other States, and so long at its standard of expenditure is not unduly high under any of the headings of expenditure, then Tasmania will be conceded the benefit of a grant. The system seems to have worked reasonably well over the years, with some of the limiting factors which do and in fact bave applied to it. Some of these factors have been mentioned by the honourable member for Wihnot. The Commonwealth aid roads agreement that matter, except to say that I believe the present Tasmanian Government will expend",41,Tasmania Grant Bill 1969
103,Mr Pearsall1 Had A Similar Ex,"to seeing this happen under the present Government. Responsibility has been transferred from the shoulders of one Minister to the shoulders of another Minister who, perhaps, will recognise the needs of the other parts of the island and will not forget that there is such a thing as the southern part of Tasmania. At present I believe that Tasmania is reasonably well satisfied with the Grants Commission. But perhaps I should not let the moment pass without saying to our bigger brothers and sisters in the mainland States: Thank you for the contribution that has been given to Tasmania from your taxation. It is gratefully received, and I am sure it will be faithfully applied*. machinery Bill which is designed to implement payment to Tasmania of a special grant of $21,900,000. As my colleagues from Tasmania have mentioned, it is part of the traditional process by which assistance, as recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, flows to the State of Tasmania. The Minister for Civil Aviation and Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr budget remains subject to the surveillance Swartz), in his' second reading speech, pointed out that the Grants Commission's thirty-sixth report had been tabled in the House. I want to lodge a protest about this, because ever since the Minister said that I have been trying to obtain a copy of the report. I understand that there are only four copies available. On repeated occasions I have been to the various parts of the House where it is normally possible to obtain copies of reports, but these four reports are like gold dust. It is impossible even to get a look at one of them. We from Tasmania are at a very great disadvantage here today discussing the recommendations of the Grants Commission that have been accepted by the Government when they are contained in a report which we have not yet seen. There are many parts we are eager to look at. There are many comments carried over from year to year that we want to see and which are in this report. As I say, we are at an extreme disadvantage. The same applies, of course, to the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr employed effectively in transforming TasDuthie), because we have not been able to sethis report. I understand that it is being comparatively poor State into the much printed in Melbourne. So, as I indicated, it is not possible to consider the legislation in the context of the report as we had hoped to do. This report is significant because Tasmania is the only remaining claimant State. The purpose of the grant is to put the State of Tasmania in a position of fiscal equality with the mainland States. As the honourable member for Franklin pointed out, we have to maintain at least until next year a standard of taxation comparable with that of the two standard States of Victoria and New South Wales.. If we go ahead of them and provide more in the way of social services, essential services and social welfaie we are penalised and get an adverse grant. I will have more to say about that later, because this has always been a bone of contention with mc. For many years there were three marginal States which received this form of assistance. They were Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. As we all know, South Australia withdrew from its claimant status several years ago. Western Australia broke the chains last year and has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal independence. Only the Tasmanian of the Grants Commission. The broad intention of the special grants procedure is to ensure equitable standards of attainment in a number of areas of State spending. I indicated some of these, such as social welfare, health, education and public transport. Tasmania is the only survivor of this traditional process of equalisation. The former Grants Bill has dwindled to a Tasmania Grant Bill. Despite the substantial economic and industrial progress that has been made hy Tasmania in recent years, there is little prospect of its being able to shake off its claimant status. The island still suffers from many economic and social disabilities. Irksome though the supervision of the Grants Commission may be, Tasmania will remain under its wing, we feel , for many years 1 yet. Undoubtedly the system has brought many benefits to Tasmania. These were referred to by the honourable member for Franklin. Commonwealth funds have been mania from a predominantly rural and a more balanced and prosperous State that it is today.",42,Tasmania Grant Bill 1969
104,Mr Davies (Braddon) [2.29],"This is aHowever, there are still inequalities between Tasmania and the mainland States. For example, personal income per bead is generally lower in Tasmania than in the rest of Australia. This is one of the factors River, which have been carved out of the taken into consideration by the Grants Commission and, I must repeat, it is a pity that we did not have the report because we are eager to have a look at it and see how it carried forward from the thirty-fifth report. In the year 1967-68 personal income per head in Tasmania was $177 below the average for the whole of Australia. During the past 20 years personal income on this basis has been consistently the lowest in Australia. The pattern of employment in Tasmania is particularly subject to seasonal influences, and in addition fluctuations in the building industry tend to be more marked than in the mainland States, and inevitably this has a distorting effect on economic activity. The pattern of industrial development has moved strongly towards heavy industry with a relative lack of success in stimulating light manufacturing. We have recently gone through a tremendous mining boom. It has been a great thrill to Tasmanians to see the tremendous mineral development that has been taking place on the west coast of Tasmania and the expanded programme of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. In only recent years the expected life of the mine at Mount Lyell was no more than 10 to 12 years. With the discovery of another ore body, and as a result of the visit overseas by the General Manager when he successfully investigated modern methods of underground mining and introduced them at Mount Lyell, it has now been forecast that the life of the mine will be some 25 years. Of course this is based on the known deposits at present. This is great news not only for the people who live there but also for the State Government and the Federal! Government because they have invested money in this area. Further north from Queenstown is the great tin mine at Renison Bell. It was wonderful to read in today's Press that following research into the recovery methods employed, the recovery rate has been improved and Renison Bell is assured of a very bright future. Then there is Rosecredits having regard to the amount we bery, the old faithful. The Electrolytic Zinc spend on the importation of brimstone from Co. of Australasia Ltd which operates the mine at Rosebery is spending a fantastic amount of money on a new shaft in order to get to new ore bodies. Further north are the new townships of Luina and Savage rain forest by the mining companies in the last couple of years. I must pay a very great tribute to Cleveland Tin NL which developed the tin mines at Luina and developed a very fine town there. The difficulties the company was experiencing in recovering tin on the tables have been overcome and it has made a very good profit in recent months. The future for Cleveland Tin is very bright indeed. The story of mineral development at Savage River is indeed a very fascinating one. Iron one is being mined at Savage River, and again in a typical rain forest area on top of a plateau the mining company has carved out a town that has all modern amenities such as a school, a very fine hotel-motel, hospital facilities and very fine homes for its employees. The iron ore is mined by open cut methods. It is crushed and pushed by water through a pipeline just under the surface of the ground which goes 70 miles over some of the most difficult country in the world down to the coast at Port Latta, where the slurry is treated with bentonite. It goes through a process in the furnaces and is converted into pellets. Here again we had teething troubles, but it is good to know that these have now been overcome, and there is a continual turnround of ships from Japan taking the pellets away. All this helps the general economy of Tasmania, and we have seen wonderful development. I mention with great pride the fact that two Tasmanian companies, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd have jointly put up $14m to build an acid plant at Burnie. They will be contributing 150,000 tons of pyrites from Queenstown and the f same quantity from Rosebery, and out of this 300,000 tons of pyrites, which was previously a waste by-product, they will now be able to make 420,000 gallons of sulphuric acid. This will save the Australian economy a considerable amount in overseas the gulf ports of Mexico and from Canada. Tasmania has had a great deal of success with heavy industries. 1 sympathise with the honourable member for Franklin who complains that this has not generated much activity in his area in the southern part of the State but it certainly has done so on the west and north-west coasts of Tasmania. The domestic market has been small because we have a population of only about 330,000 and this has had a detrimental effect on the development of the domestic economy. The home market is always best but if there is only a small home market goods must be exported and Tasmania is at the behest of the people who control freight rates. Freight rates militate against the development of sales interstate and overseas. We have extreme freight cost difficulties, but these are the forthcoming review of financial assistassociated with all islands and Tasmania is no exception. We recognise that fact. We appreciate what the Australian National Line has done in introducing the roll-on roll-off and door-to-door method of sea-road transport, but we need more ships. The 'Australian Trader', the magnificent vessel that came into service in June, must be duplicated immediately. The Government should place an order with an Australian dockyard for the duplication of this type of vessel. This ship, which came on tbe run in June, is fully booked out for the next 12 months. On 20th January last, before the ship was in service, it was impossible to book before January of next year. This gives some indication of the popularity of the service, but this situation should not be happening. We should be able to tell passengers, tourists and manufacturers who want to freight goods to the mainland markets that there is no difficulty in booking ship space. It is up to the Commonwealth Government to see that Tasmania is not at any disadvantage and that there can be a free flow of exports interstate. We should have the same facilities as those that exist on the mainland, particularly as on the mainland one can have recourse to road and rail transport, which are facilities that we do not have. Freight costs and difficulty in obtaining accommodation on vessels form a significant part of Tasmania's disadvantage compared to the mainland States, particularly New South Wales and Victoria. I mention those States because these have been the standard States with which Tasmania is compared when it comes to the allocation of special assistance. The Commonwealth Grants Commission relates financial assistance to Tasmania to expenditure in New South Wales and Victoria. The Minister, in his second reading speech, referred to the adoption of a new concept of standard States under which special grants will be determined. In earlier years when there was more than one claimant State, New South Wales and Victoria were the standard States. This, of course, was when Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania were claimant States. It is proposed that from 1970-71 recommendations for the one remaining claimant State, Tasmania, will be based on a standard derived from the experience of all non-claimant States. This is subject to any developments arising from ance grants in Australia. It is not possible to predict with any accuracy what the effect of this change will be but I read with some concern a report that working on the formula that is likely to be used whereby Tasmania is compared to a four-State pattern, Tasmania will be adversely affected by the best part of $2m which is a considerable sum. Tasmania is proud of its education system and of the educational facilities and services it provides. We would resent being compared with Queensland where the educational system is run down and where money, which should have been spent on education-and I am not talking politicshas been used to bolster up the public hospital system. Queensland's educational services are among the worse in the Commonwealth. If Tasmania is to be compared with that State it is going to be penalised. It has been estimated by experts in this field that Tasmania could be penalised to the extent of Sim in the amount it would have to spend on education in the future. This is a matter of great concern because Tasmanian authorities at the Hobart meeting of the Grants Commission and at other meetings have consistently advanced the view that Tasmania should not be compared on a four-State basis. We do not mind being compared with Victoria and New South Wales but we certainly should not be compared with Queensland. We object to this proposal strongly. I feel sure that the Premier and the Treasurer of Tasmania, and the incoming government, will agree that our services should not be compared in this manner. We are very proud of our educational standards in Tasmania and it is a matter of concern to everyone interested in this field to learn, fromfiguresthat have been produced, that we could be disadvantaged to the extent of Sim in the funds that would be available for us for education. I appeal to the Government and to the Grants CommissionI understand the direction came from the Treasury-to look again at this suggestion of comparing Tasmania with Queensland. Wc have nothing against the people in the north. They certainly got an additional grant from the Grants Commission a few years ago. They got the treatment to which they were entitled because they have a scattered population and a large area in which to provide essential services. But, for goodness sake, give Tasmania a little bit of a go considering that it is an island State. Do not compare the great strides that we have made in the fields of education and hospitalisation with places like Queensland. Australia come from Tasmania. honourable member is saying. I stress to the Parliament that we are pleased with report of the Commission, but of course the assistance that has been given to us by this is not available as yet. I wanted to find way of the Grants Commission through its out about a matter on which I spoke 2 or recommendations to the Parliament, and we 3 years ago, concerning the observations of are grateful that the other States and memthe Commission regarding the introduction bers from both Houses of this Parliament of totalisator agency betting in Tasmania. have endorsed the recommendations of the This is a burning question in my State.

If this is to be the continuing pattern of financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, then the people of Tasmania make a plea to the Government for more consideration to be given v/hen these grants are being made. The Government has gone into the field of rail standardisation and it has made large sums of money available to the States on the mainland, but Tasmania has not been able to participate in that. The Government has also assisted with port development. The Savage River mines conveyor belt that goes out about 1 mile into Bass Strait off Port Latta is used to export a large number of pellets to Japan and brings in a huge amount of export earnings; Tasmania will be exporting from the port development at Burnie $420 million gallons of acid a year; thousands of tons of copper concentrates are being sent to Japan for refining. All this port development is being undertaken by Tasmanian State instrumentalities without one penny from the Commonwealth the time has been reached when such matters should be given more consideration.

I join with the honourable because of the peculiar topography of the member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall) in State.

I think the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) was under a misunderstanding when he referred to recommendations which will from 1970-71 be on the basis of all non-claimant States. He quoted ngures to indicate that there could be a disability suffered by Tasmania as a page 1767), on motion by Mr Gorton: result of this. I refute any figures that have been quoted.

Last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) drew attention to statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and myself from time to time about the nature of the threat that faces this country strategically. We have indeed pointed out that a threat is unlikely in the immediate future. But two points arise here. We made a reservation, and the reservation is that we would be completely unwise not to allow for the possibility of rapid change in the strategic situation. AfterI leave that matter there. all, we are not so far away in terms of years from confrontation. Who knows what the future may hold in our sphere of interest? Nor do we overlook our obligation to come to the assistance of our neighbours uuder pacts if they should be threatened. As we have stated repeatedly, to plan on the assumption that there is no threat and that there will be no threat for 10 years or any other period would be completely suicidal. Our whole policies are directed against a threat ever arising. It is certainly in any kind of weather, its capacity as an one thing to say that a threat is unlikely; it is a different proposition to say that there is no threat, and the Government has never done that. The odd thing about the situation is that the Opposition always talks about collective defence, about entering collective defensive arrangements with our neighbours, ft is notable that Labor always talks about this from a safe distance and would not equip this country to participate actively in those arrangements should a threat develop. Therefore Labor's policy must and indeed does appear meaningless in the eyes of our friends and neighbours.

We will not see this country defenceless. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that the F ill is not versatile enough. This aircraft was bought for a particular purpose. It is a strike aircraft and it meets in every respect the Air Staff requirement and therefore meets the advice given to this Government by the same kind of military advisers as would undoubtedly be advising the Opposition if it came to power. One has to assume, therefore, that Labor would fly in Ihe face of the best military advice available to it. But The Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out that fighter bombers with superior performance to the F ill are available. I would like to see a precise comparison, if that were not completely unobtainable because of security, with those matters on which the F ill certainly stands alone and without peer in the world today. In terms of range, payload. its outstanding navigational capability, its bad weather performance, its bomb accuracy on target electronic counter aircraft and more besides, the F ill stands above any other aircraft now available or likely to be available in the reasonably near future. As we have said from time to time, this is not merely an aircraft that we are talking about. We are talking about a complete weapons system of the most extraordinary capacity. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that there are better close support aircraft available. TheF ill was never designed to be a close support aircraft. It was not bought to be a close support aircraft. So where is the validity of this argument? The honourable gentleman pointed Phantom for deployment in Europe merely says that they do not have Australia's long range requirement. The honourable member for Bass went on to point out that Israel had bought the F4. That is quite true. Israel has the job of defending only its own country in the rather narrow confines of the Middle East where once again long range is not required. Japan has bought the F4. Once again, Japan is restricted to a force for home defence of the Japanese islands and why should she want range? Sir, none of these comparisons is valid in relation to the F ill . The honourable member for Bass went on to introduce a completely new note, one we had not heard from him before. He pointed out that tankers and supporting aircraft would be required with the F ill . But as I have pointed out, the very essence of the F ill weapons system is its capacity to do without supporting aircraft and tankers. The testimony given by the pilots who have flown the F ill in Vietnam, published in, I think, 'News and World Report', or one of the other leading international news magazines, pointed out the F ill ' s peculiar capaaircraft and that therefore there would be city to approach a target under the radar, in all kinds of weather, to drop its bombs with complete accuracy and to disappear from the scene before the enemy is even aware that it has been there. Because of its range it does not need tankers; because of its extraordinary weapons system capability it does not need electronic counter measures; because of its speed it does not need fighter cover. On the testimony of the pilots who have flown these aircraft in battle, two pilots and one F ill can do a job in bad weather, with complete accuracy and with safety, which could only be done half as well by 5 or 6 other aircraft. This is the cost benefit advantage of the Fl 11. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition introduced another new note when he said that the ceiling price, which we had quoted as being $5.95m, cannot be pierced. Sir, nobody in this House at any time has made that statement. I cannot recall the ceiling price of this aircraft ever having been mentioned in this House by me or another Minister for Air or by the Prime Minister without the qualifications that it covered also escalation and other costs which have been specified. Mr Speaker, it is quite patent that the Labor Party has run out of argument about the F ill . We have heard all this tired repetition of threadbare criticisms before. The Opposition has said nothing new. The fact is that for a year past we have had one major problem with this aircraft which has prevented it flying with the Royal Australian Air Force; that is, we have had a metal fatigue problem in the wing carry through box. This has been a particular problem born of the use of a new kind of metal about which there is not long years of experience. It is a problem, which has defied the best technical brains in the world, including some of our own world experts in metal fatigue, but the problem is about to be solved. Over this period the Government, quite rightly, has been consistent in demanding that we would have assurances, firstly, that we would have a fatigue free life of type of something like the usual 15 years. We said that we would be prepared to take the aircraft only when it was demonstrated to us that that condition could be met. We said that we wanted to be sure that the United States would itself use the no difficulty about spares backing for the project during the life of type. We said we wanted an assurance that the performance of the aircraft met the requirement of the Air Staff. We said we wanted to know how the aircraft worked out in terms of maintainability-if I might use that termthe number of hours of maintenance required per hour of flight. On each of these matters the mission which proceeded to America just recently has given us the most complete assurances on the best possible evidence. We do have spares backing. In terms of performance the aircraft does better, in many degrees, than the Air Staff requirement. The maintainability of the aircraft is more than satisfactory. We believe that we are on the eve of settlement of this fatigue problem but our whole outlook in relation to our aircraft and whether or not, or when, we should take delivery has been changed by the undertaking by the United States that the Americans will now proceed to develop a completely new wing carry through box which will embody all the metallurgical and other experience learnt in the last few years; and that this box would be available in 1972 for fitment to our aircraft at the expense of the United Stales. Clearly we now have a completely new picture. The United States has agreed to do this readily and without fuss. I believe that this is a measure of the kind of co-operation we have had from the United States throughout this project. Of course, it has been as difficult for the United States as it has been for us except that where our investment in the aircraft is $300m plus, the United States investment runs into $4 billion or $5 billion. Is it to be supposed that the United States would not bend every effort-indeed , it has been successful effort-to the solution of this problem? The deal we have worked out on the basis of our ceiling price plus escalation, still with escalation gives us an aircraft which is cheaper than the price which the United States itself will pay. What this undertaking by the United States means, Mr capacity. Speaker, is that the Americans have virtually underwritten a satisfactory fatigue free life for our aircraft. They have said that if the wing carry through box in the aircraft should fail they will replace it with another and they will see us through until 1972 when a new box will be available. If by any measure of misfortune that box should not be available then, they will go on replacing boxes in our aircraft so that we will continue to have our 15-year life of type. These changes will be made at American expense. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition complained, as he has always done, about tbe cost of these aircraft. He is talking about the cost of an aircraft and we have been talking about the cost of a weapons system of the most extraordinary capability. I have quoted figures in the House to show that even a civilian aircraft like the Boeing 727 has a fly away cost of something over $5m and it is not to be compared with a military aircraft of the F ill type in terms of capability. I have seen some notes somewhere about the F4 and 1 believe the fly away cost of that aircraft is $3.8m. If one adds to that cost the cost of the ground handling equipment, spares, test equipment and all the rest of the things -cre w training and so on-whic h is embodied in the contract price of the F ill , then even the Labor Party's chosen Phantom, despite its enormous disadvantages so far as we are concerned, would be comparable to the F ill in terms of price. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition complained that we may have paid 80% of the price of the aircraft before we take delivery. 1 am informed that Qantas probably will have paid something like 50% of the cost of its forthcoming aircraft programme before it takes delivery. This is normal commercial procedure. If it had not been for the fact that the Labor Party has completely run out of ideas on the F l l 1 we would not hear the same arguments turning up time after time in this tediously repetitious debate. Australia needs a strike aircraft with a capacity of this kind. He would be a brave and, indeed, foolish soul who would say that within the life of this aircraft we would be unlikely to find or could not envisage a situation in which Australia would sorely need this kind of aircraft lt is unfortunate that the fatigue problem and the fatigue programme in the United States is not matched with our parliamentary election timetable. Great capital has been made of the fact that the Prime Minister has not announced anything new. He has brought us up to date. He has announced the only decision which a government could take if it had any concern for the life and safety of the men who will fly this aircraft. We still say that when the aircraft has proved its capability we will be ready to bring it to Australia. I believe with every confidence that we are on the eve of that decision now. But if a new series of fatigue tests is about to be undertaken it would be foolish of us-indee d it would be imprudent -to bring the aircraft to Australia at this time. Despite the fact that we have been given a guarantee by America of replacement of the wing carry through box if there should be a failure, if we brought this aircraft out we could still fly it with complete safety. But why risk the possibility of that change having to be made when everyone associated with this programme, including our own experts, believes with every confidence that the series of tests now about to be embarked upon will certainly assure us of a fatigue free life until 1972 when the new wing box will be available. It may well be, if expectations are exceeded, that the tests on the new wing box will even be much better, and the question whether or not a new box needs to be fitted in 1972 will become completely clear in the course of the next few months. , and I repeat them in closing: The decision the Government has made in regard to this aircraft is the only reasonable decision that could be made. I believe that within a matter of months we will be seeing Australian F l 1 Is flying in Australian skies and, as I have repeatedly said before, adding immeasurably to this country's defence capabilities. As the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) said, the first announcement about the F l 11 was made in 1963. What he did not add, of course, was that that announcement was made when the 1963 election was imminent and, in my view, it played a decisive part in the results of the election. 1 do not know whether anybody in 1963 would have conjectured that by 1969, after two more elections had been held, the F ill would not have been delivered. I agree with the Minister that the Government-has taken what is at this stage perhaps the only decision that can be taken, but I submit there is still a great deal of room for criticism and a great need to answer a lot of the questions about that decision. Until last night the F ill was undelivered, mainly unproven, and unconfirmed. What is the nature of the confirmation now? The confirmation contains a qualification with regard to the unsatisfactory gear box. box. of the aeroplane. I am not arguing about which particular part. As I understand it, aeroplanes cannot be serviced in the air. If even a very minor part goes wrong the pilot cannot limp the plane home in the way that a driver of a faulty motorcar can get the car to a garage. Some honourable members are suggesting by interjection that it can be done, but I am sure they would not get up in this House and say with certainty that it can be done. In any case, at this stage the flight capabilities of the plane are still unproven and the order, it seems to me, is still unconfirmed because the Government still leaves itself the option of ' taking the plane or of not taking it, according to whether the gear box, or whatever I began my remarks with these words, the part is called, is satisfactory. I do not claim to be an expert about aeroplanes, but I do not believe that when we are discussing an expenditure of this magnitude everyone concerned has to be an expert before he can be critical. Since the F ill was ordered in 1963, as I have said before, $5,100m has been spent on the defence of Australia and $ 1,100m is the projected further expenditure this year. Of that $5,100mand honourable members can find detailed figures in the defence reports for 1968 and 1969-nearl y two-thirds, or $3,400m, represents expenditure on manpower and maintenance in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. This simply indicates, of course, that any armed Service has a certain amount of fixed expenditure and something like two-thirds of the total expenditure on defence is of thisfixednature. But in the same period about $ 1,640m has been spent on capital equipment, a substantial part of which represents expenditure on the F ill . In the last 4 years, $l,300m has been spent on procurements in the three Services and nearly three-quarters of that, or about $l,000m, has been spent overseas. The principal single item, of course, has been expenditure on the F ill . The Library includes quite a number of interesting documents on its reading list. On one of them recently there was an article taken from a New York publication called 'Flying-May 1969'. At the end of the article there is a description of the various brands of the family F ill . The article is headed: 'TheF ill family: a tough bunch'. The reproduction is not very clear but it appears to have been on page 117. The article states: F111C: The Australian version; based on a quoted price of $S.2m . . . These are United States dollars, of course, and we have to discount the amount by something like one-tenth to get the equivalent Australian dollars. This article, of course, is contained in an American magazine. The article continues: The Australian version; based on a quoted price of $5.2m per aeroplane, including groundsupport equipment, training and a year's supply of spares, Australia ordered 24 Fills in 1963 as Canberra replacements . . .",48,General Post Office Building Sydney

The price is likely to continue rising, but cancellation of the contract expenditure. Taking the overall picture it would cost Australia about $225.6iu in penalties. The F1I1C is outwardly identical to the FBI 11, but uses the earlier Mkl avionics. Earlier in the article-and this is a kind of examination of the performance of the Fill-unde r the heading 'Summary and sentence' an examination is made of a number of points. I commend the article to anyone who has not read it. If anyone is in favour of the F ill , this article in many places helps to give support to his case. However, the article states: Maybe it could be said that there were too many unknowns involved at one time in the TFX venture-ne w variable-sweep engineering combined with new and untried power plants, with hitherto unapproached advances in afterburning, using radically new avionic and fire-control systems, operating with completely new missile systems, and the whole wrapped in the revolutionary concept, of commonality. I understand that 'commonality' means having all those things combined in the one operation. The article goes on to state: Perhaps commonality could be said to have become obsessive with defendant McNamara McNamara is on trial in the articlewithout regard to cost. The article then goes on to state: We are entitled That is, the Americans and, I submit, with equal force Australiansto ask why thc contract should have been placed at all if accurate costing was not possible at that analyses and other things, once you embark time. The point now being made This is in the United Statesis that there is a possibility that the Fill, has become so expensive that the Air Force would hesitate to use it in operations where the target value is not commensurate with the risk of loss. I was interested to hear the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) say that it seemed that the F ill had no place in Labor's defence programme. I might say charitably that it is just as well that the F l 11 has had no place in the Government's programme in recent years. One thing I am interested to know is the extent to which the rest of defence expenditure has been built around the F ill . Surely the Army, the Navy and tbe Air Force do not work in vacuums, saying: 'Let us cut up the total'. I am sure this is not how they work. Surely one is not oblivious of what the other is doing. Capital expenditure on defence accounts for only one-third of total seems to me that the Government has been very recreant as far as Australia's defence is concerned. There seems to have been a rather curious inversion in this House in recent times. Five weeks before an election the people who appear to be on trial are members of the Labor Party. Actually, it is this Government that should be on trial. It has been in power in one form or another since 1949. Yesterday the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) said: The Government believes that the RAAF must have an ultra modern strike aircraft to replace the Canberras which are now the RAAF's only strike force. The Government knows that the Canberras are approaching the limit of their service life, and the considerations which 1 have set out above all point to the F ill as the best aircraft to be this replacement, without exception. Listening to that one would almost have thought that it was 1963 again and. on the eve of an election, the Government was ordering the F ill . It is 6 years since the aircraft was ordered. Notwithstanding what the Prime Minister has said, even now there is no certainty about delivery. As is pointed out in the American document from which I have quoted, cancellation of the contract would be expensive. I do not suggest that at this stage the F ill should be cancelled. Despite what you say about cost benefit on a project, whether it is the Snowy Mountains scheme, the Ord River scheme or the F ill , and you spend hundreds of millions of dollars on it, it is difncult to walk out on the deal. To do so would involve a new set of cost considerations. But a few weeks before the general election to suggest that the F ill will be delivered and that all is now well is. in my view, an attempt to conceal the mess that is of the Government's making. I hope that there will be some indictment of this Government on 25th October because, as I demonstrated the other evening, public expenditure in Australia has been rising in recent years to a point where it now represents 25% of all goods and services produced in this country. The greatest increase in expenditure in recent years has been in defence expenditure. Defence expenditure has increased at an annual rate of 14.4%. compared with an increase in expenditure on education of slightly more than 10%. What has the Government to show at this stage so far as the F ill is concerned other than promises that it may come good? The Government should be trying to get all the evidence available to show what this aircraft might do. Criticism of the aircraft is not confined have not yet anything with which to strike. to Australia. There has been criticism of this All that the people of Australia can be aircraft in the United States at a level just thankful for is that apparently there is not as high as that from which criticism has anybody whom we need to strike. flowed in this country.

In 1963 the cost of the twenty-four aircraft was estimated to be $112m. What would the Government have said if in 1966 a Labor government had said: 'People of Australia, the aircraft is still on the way, but we will have it by 1969'? Now. within a few davs of the Parliament's rising for the elections, the Priine Minister has had the hide to tell us, as if this were a new proposition, that we will have the aircraft very quickly. As my colleagues will ask. how has the role of this aircraft in 1969 changed from that envisaged for it in 1963? Would the Government in 1963 have bought this aircraft if it had known that its ultimate cost would be not Si 12m but $300ni or more? They are the questions which the Government must answer.

The Labor Party would have had this Government, this country, relying upon an aircraft which the Government's expert advisers had advised was, at best, not as good as the one the Government ordered and which did not, as things transpired, get into operations at all. I think a prototype of the TSR2 actually flew but the project was then cancelled and that was the end of the matter. But it was the view of the Labor Party at the time that the Government should purchase this aircraft. I ask honourable members opposite to compare their Party's policy at the time the decision was taken to purchase the F ill aircraft with the Government's policy. It does not stand up to the Government's decision. It is true that there have been problems with this aircraft, which is the most intricate had been despatched overseas to examine aircraft that the mind of man has ever conceived. It is designed to perform in a manner that is beyond compare with any aircraft which has ever been designed. Indeed, as I understand the situation, there is at present no successor to this aircraft in concept. The aircraft the Opposition favoured was an aircraft which, on distant flying, had to pause in the air and refuel when it was getting near the target. It would have been a sitting duck for enemy aircraft. That is the aircraft the Government did not order. Instead, it ordered an aircraft which would do the kind of job that the Government's advised that it ought to be able to do; an aircraft which the expert advisers of the United States Government, the most powerful military nation in the world, had advised that the United States should have. What is the position today? There are 120 aircraft of this type flying in the United States today. They have flown for 40,000 hours, including 25,000 hours in operations. These aircraft have a lower accident rate than the Super Sabre, the Phantom and any other aircraft in this F category. I would be the last to say that even one accident is nothing to worry about. One accident is one too many, but aircraft accidents occur and experience indicates that the Fl 11 aircraft is safer than any of the modern aircraft which have been designed and built in the United States. What is the position with the aircraft today? I wish to speak quite frankly about the F ill aircraft. I do not deny that it has been the subject of great controversy and I do not deny that doubts have been raised about it. I admit that the aircraft was first ordered 6 years ago, which is a long time but not an extraordinarily long time having regard to the technology involved. An election is to be held in the near future. I shall be quite candid and say that the people of Australia are entitled to know where the Government stands on this matter. I am being quite frank when I say it is my view that the people of Australia are entitled to be told what the Government is doing. It is in this context that the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) stood up in the House last night and informed honourable members of the decision the Government had taken after receiving the report of the mission which the matter. It was not the first, second or third mission to go to the United States but the most recent one. The mission comprised the very top advisers that the Government possesses. These advisers are men who are capable in respect of business and administration, capable in respect of knowing the concept of our strategic requirement, capable in respect of the technicalities of the aircraft and capable in respect of a scientific assessment of it. When this mission returned from the United States it informed the Government that it had confidence in the aircraft, but that the aircraft has one expert advisers had weakness. Following the report of the mission the Prime Minister stood up in the House and said to the people of Australia: 'These are the facts of life: We have ordered an aircraft which, on all our advice, we still believe is incomparably the best for the purposes for which we may need aircraft'. It is an aircraft whose cost has escalated. There is nothing really strange about that. It may be distressing but it is not strange that in the last 6 years something so scientifically intricate should have encountered unexpected problems which have resulted in modification of the design and consequently an increased cost. There is nothing",54,General Post Office Building Sydney

There is nothing astonishing about the Prime Minister saying: 'This is an aircraft which is flying today United States, of which 25,000 hours were and will be flying for Australia for the next 15 years, subject to what I shall say in a moment. There is one weakness in the life, without replacement, of one component but the expert advisers believe that this can be overcome'. So we find the Prime Minister standing up and saying: 'Here is an aeroplane that has everything we want except life, without replacement, in one component -the carry-through wing box. This has a limited life. The designers and builders of the aircraft have already made another carry-through wing box, which they anticipate will overcome to some extent the shortness of life of this component. Jt will be tested next month and if it is successful it will be installed. If it is not successful, I believe the present one could carry on, but it would need to be replaced eventually'. The Prime Minister then went on to say: we will keep on replacing this wing box 'We have negotiated an arrangement with that has a short life, and we will do it at the United States Government that to the no cost to you'. This is what the Prime extent that the wing carry-through box Minister has stood up and explained to the needs to be replaced, perhaps recurringly Parliament and to the people.

Who is going to say that the people who can put men on the moon are incapable of solving that problem? I believe that they are capable of solving it, and I , for myself, would not bc greatly troubled if I had to depend on that. But I do not have to depend at all on their solving that problem by getting an impeccable wing box that will last for 15 years, because they say: 'At the very worse I. accept the Labor Party's making capital",55,General Post Office Building Sydney

119,Mr Stewart (Lang) [3.53],"Th efind that the decision to purchase it was a political decision, made in haste. At the time of the placing of the order no firm terms of contract were entered into by the present Government. It was a bad business deal from the beginning. As far back as April 1960 the then Chief of our Air Staff, Sir Valston Hancock, stated that the ageing Canberra bombers would have to be replaced before long. No action was taken by the Government. In 1962 public and political pressure mounted in all directions British planes. for the replacement of the Canberra bombers. Charges were made that the Indonesian Air Force could bomb any Australian city and that the Canberra bomber could not retaliate. The then Minister for Air, Mr Fairbairn, admitted that the Canberra bombers were the weakest link in our armoury at that time. By 1963 the Air Force itself was pressing for a replacement. the British plane and decided to purchase In June 1963 the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, sent an Air Force mission overseas to evaluate the available aircraft. At that time an early election was States of America, an order for F ill imminent. The Labor Party had already promised that if it were returned to governof delay in delivery and because of general ment it would take immediate steps to replace the Canberra bomber, and that promise met with wide public approval. In October 1963 the Government, because of its having gained a majority of one in an election which everybody knew was going to take place, sent the then Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, overseas to enter into a contract with the United States of America. A few days after the late Athol Townley left Australia, Sir Robert Menzies announced that the 1963 Federal election would be held on 30th November. On 24th October 1963 he came into the House and announced that an order had been placed for twenty-four F ill fighter bomber airinstance, that Australia would make subcraft. He further announced that an interim replacement for the Canberra bombers, the B47, would be made available while the F l 11 were being built and delivered. In his announcement on 24th October the then Prime Minister stated that Mr cost of the 24 F ill s. In the intervening Townley's mission 'has been most remarkably successful; so successful that I have found it necessary to advise the United Kingdom Government that we propose to go ahead with the arrangement he has negotiated.' Sir Robert Menzies was going to tell the United Kingdom Government that we were no longer interested in the TSR2 bomber. A short time ago the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Labor Party at that time suggested that we should have purchased the TSR2 but that the aircraft did not get off the ground-onl y the prototype flew. If he had been honest with the House he would have added that the United Kingdom Government was compelled to discontinue its plans for the TSR2 because the Australian Government had decided to buy American planes and not with any degree of certainty that a country which was looking to Australia for the purchase of at least twenty-four planes could have afforded to proceed with the development of the planes when Australia rejected American planes. The United Kingdom Government, after it cancelled its TSR2 programme, then placed, with the United planes, but because of rising costs, because dissatisfaction with the terms and conditions under which the F ill were to be purchased, the United Kingdom Government cancelled that order. for that reason at all. It cancelled the order because it decided to withdraw from east of Suez. reason. The other part of the reason was rising costs and uncertainty of delivery. In his speech on 24th October 1963 the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, made certain other statements. He said, for stantial savings. He promised delivery of the planes by 1967 onwards, and guaranteed that the planes could fly to any place on earth within 24 hours. But at that stage he made no definite statement about the total period the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament pressed the Government for some definite information on delivery dates and total cost of the F ill s . It asked for the tabling of the documents relating to the purchase of the F ill , and it was not until 26th September 1968 that these documents were tabled in this House.

123,Mr Stewart,"That is part of thewas labelleJ Memorandum of Understanding Between the US Secretary of Defence and the Australian Minister for Defence'. That was signed on 29th October 1963, 7 days before Sir Robert Menzies made the announcement in this House. It is a four and a half page document and it is ail in general terms, but in that memorandum of expenditure one or two estimates were given. It stated that the price would be Si 25m and that the first delivery would be made late in 1967. The Australian Government entered into a deal which at that time it anticipated would cost $125m of the Australian taxpayers' money. It was a deal that was not written firmly and a deal that was made in haste for political reasons. Jt was anything but a good business proposition and since that order was placed with the United States of America the Opposition in this place has based its criticisms mainly on the bad business deal that the Government got from the United States of America. We admit that we stated in 1961-62 thai Ihe Canberra bombers needed to be replaced. I add here that the Government first promised to replace the Canberra bombers as far back as 1954 and we are still waiting for their replacement. You call yourself an efficient Government. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence( Mr contracts with General Dynamics. We Fairhall) came into this House and set up their own Aunt Sallys.

I suggest that the honourable member address the Chair. Deputy Chairman, I say to the mcmbers of the Government that they are the people who need to make these decisions and that it is not the responsibility of the Opposition to make them. But it is the responsibility of the Opposition to criticise this Government when it willy-nilly throws out S300m of the Australian taxpayers' money on a plane that is still not completely satisfactory. The Australian Labor Party admits that the Canberra bombers need lo be replaced. member work that out? a long time ago, as far back us 1954. What we want is for the replacement to be made. The order was placed in 1963. The first payments for this aircraft were made in 1963. The first payment was made when the plane was still on the druwing-bonrd. This Government entered into an agreement under which we were paying out Australian taxpayers' money without knowing whether these planes would ever fly and even before the United States of America had placed entered into this agreement for political reasons only, and if by pure chance this plane turns out to be as good as the Government Ihinks it is the Government will be lucky indeed. By the end of this year Australia will have paid S2Q7m to the United States of America, and as yet we have not received one plane. If we add to that cost of 3S207m the 5530m worth of capital works and ground equipment that we have purchased, the cost of about $2.3m for the training of the air crews in the United States of America, and travel and accommodation for air crews and visiting missions to the United States of America of about S240.5m. In 1963 when thc memorandum of understanding was signed the price then was to be $l25m. By December 1965 the price had risen to $204m. By April 1967 it had moved lo §295m.

129,Mr Stewart,"Becaus e we were toldfew moments ago said that neither he nor anyone else had said in this House that the ceiling price would not be pierced. On 22nd August 1967 on page 276 of Hansard the Minister for Defence said: When the cost reached a certain figure the United Stales came to the party and by agreement set the basic figure at $5.95m per fly-away aircraft. There is still some research and development lo go on and to thc extent that it affects the fly-away aircraft, Australia will carry no part of that charge. If that was not a definite statement that $5.95m was the ceiling price for each aircraft and that no other research or development charges would be placed upon it, I am a bad judge. Contained in the papers that were tabled on 26th September 1968 was a minute signed on 4th May 1967. Paragraph 4 of that minute reads: Based on the exchange of letters between Secretary McNamara and Minister Fairhall on 27th September, 1965 and 31st March, 1966, the unit price of thc 24 F111A aircraft is re-affirmed lo be based on the condition of the UK Agreement. (This calls for a. ceiling price of SUS5.95m on the basic F ill A configuration or a total of $US142.80m). Configuration changes desired by the RAAF (FB-111A landing gear and wingtips, and reconnaissance capability for six aircraft) are and without due consideration. It bought a estimated to add $10.50m for a total aircraft flyplane that was still on the drawing boards. away cost of about $US153.30m. At that time it was estimated that the changes were to cost $ 10.5m in all'. We are now being charged $1.5m for modifications to each plane. So now we are adding $1.5m to each of these aircraft for modifications, bringing the ceiling price from S5.95m to $7'.4m. We still do not know what the final cost of the aircraft will be, because in his statement last night the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) said that some of the charges are still to be looked at. So from a firm agreement on $5.95m as the ceiling price for each aircraft we have now moved to $7.4m and we are likely to move higher. The whole handling of this purchase of the aeroplanes from the United States of America has been ham-fisted and inefficient. The Deputy Prime Minister was or is a practical farmer. If he were to buy a tractor for his farm he would certainly want a better deal than the one this Government has got on the purchase of the F ill aircraft. The Labor Party bases its main criticism on the fact that from the time this started there has been procrastination, lack of honesty with the Parliament and the people, changes of plans and changes of statements, and numerous things have been said in this House that have been contradicted within a very short time. The Government is now admitting that the new wing carry through boxes are still not satisfactory and that they have shown breakdown after 8,000 hours testing. A new design is to be used but it will not be ready until 1972. On 15th August 1968, in reply to a question that I asked in this House, the Minister for Defence said: The committee came away completely satisfied that all areas of doubt, after the most careful scrutiny, have now been eliminated. There is therefore every reason to have complete confidence in the aircraft. How can anybody believe the statements of the Ministers sitting opposite when there is contradiction after contradiction and when there are dishonest statements, or statements that are not based completely on fact, and when facts are hidden from the Parliament and the people? This situation has occurred because the Government entered into a business proposition blindly A mock-up in wood was about the only thing the Government saw. The planes are needed. I think that perhaps the Government may have made the correct choice but it cannot say that it has acted with efficiency in this business proposition in which over S300m of Australian taxpayers' money will be laid out. We have been paying for it since 1963 and we still have not received one plane. We still do not know when we will get them. We have been promised delivery year after year. On numerous occasions the Minister for Defence said that they would be flying in Australian skies in September of last year. He gave up predicting when the delivery date would be after he had burned his fingers on six or seven occasions. We hope that these aircraft do arrive. We hope that the Government's decision is the only reasonable decision that could be made because too much of the Australian taxpayers' money will have gone down the drain unless these planes are delivered and are satisfactory. honourable member's time has expired.",58,General Post Office Building Sydney
130,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order! The[4.12]-Last week was Air Force Week. We honoured the memory of fallen airmen who died on active service. In particular we remembered those airmen who gave their lives in the Battle of Britain. But today have we forgotten some of the lessons of World War 117 In the limited time 1 have, I should like to draw the attention of the House to some of the general considerations of air power and to some of the lessons that should be remembered when discussing the role of the F ill in the Royal was opposed to the initial purchase of this Australian Air Force. Two of the most significant lessons are that the country must be prepared against possible attack in peace time and that an air force without a strike capacity is most limited in its ability to bring the full force of air power against the enemy. This will no longer be the situation when the aircraft are delivered. The Opposition's attack on the announcement of the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) last night was based on two main themes. The first was whether there was a need for an aircraft of this type ancl the second was the cost of the aircraft. These attacks are not new and it has been a continuing approach of Opposition members and no matter of hard fact, given over the years, will satisfy them as far as this project is concerned. One happy note which emerged from the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) last night was that at long last it would seem that he has accepted that the F ill has a better safety record than any other comparable aircraft at the same point of time in number of flying hours flown. The other happy note is thai he concedes the excellence of the aircraft, be stressed. While it can be conceded that but on a note of inconsistency, then prothe threat is low at the present time, this ceeds to say we do not need it. Let me remind honourable members of would suggest it would be imprudent not thc role of the Air Force in our country's to recognise latent possibilities for a quick defence. Amongst other things, it is to change in the area of direct concern to us. provide prompt, effective and sustained conHereI draw attention to the power vacuum tributions in support of allied operations in in the Indian Ocean, the consequences of South East Asia; to contribute to the offenthe British withdrawal from the Malaysiasive air support of the Australian Army; to Singapore region and Russia's growing provide tactical air transport support for interest in these areas. Let me also remind the Australian Army; and to provide a longthe House that if we did not have a recogrange air strike component. You may ask, nisable and effective strike force in our Mr Deputy Speaker, why is a long-range inventory and a situation arose which called strike component necessary to our Air for its use, the lead time involved in introForce? It will be required if we are ever ducing such a force would be such that called upon to attack the enemy's offensive we could well find ourselves in difficulty. power, including those military and industrial centres essential to his power of resistance. Thus in the broadest terms the effectiveness of the Air Force to meet all of its roles depends on the aircraft in its inventory at any one time. The F111C is essential to carry out the air strike role. It has long been conceded by the Opposition that the Canberra aircraft is in need of replacement. Indeed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition states that the Opposition aircraft. ThisI would suggest is only partly true. In fact the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) in October 1963 welcomed the decision to replace thc Canberra but expressed a preference for the TSR2 instead of the TFX, as the F ill was then known. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), commented that the United Kingdom abandoned the TSR project because Australia selected the F ill . This is utter nonsense. In any case, the Royal Australian Air Force evaluation team which went overseas clearly assessed that the TFX, as it then was, was superior to the TSR2 for our purposes. Fortunately, the Government did not follow the Opposition's advice but selected an aircraft about which there can be no doubt now as to its performance in the role for which it is intended-that of a strike bomber aircraft. With the arrival of our F111C aircraft, for the first time in its history the Air Force will have the most modern aircraft available, with potential For strategic strike operations. The deterrent value of strike force must does not alter the fact that the time may arise when the aircraft may be needed. I",59,General Post Office Building Sydney
131,Mr Erwin (Ballaarat,"-Minister far Air)The last decade has demonstrated the rapidity with which threats can change in spite of our best endeavours. I strongly believe, therefore, that a viable and credible deterrent is in the best interests of Australia's defence. And if the need arises because the deterrent has failed, then the aircraft must be capable of inflicting heavy damage. This the F111C will do. The suggestion by the Opposition while conceding that the aircraft is an excellent one, that it is not versatile enough for Australia's needs, does not stand in the light of what I have just said. Let me point out once again as I did in an earlier speech on this subject the confusion about the role of the F111C in the RAAF's inventory. It is not needed as a fighter or as a closesupport aircraft or in the maritime reconnaissance role or in the transport role. Its role is strike reconnaissance, and as the Prime Minister stated last night in his statecraft has a flexibility which will enable us ment, this aircraft has demonstrated an outstanding capacity to deliver its bomb load in all weathers and with unprecedented accuracy. It is without doubt the best aircraft of its type, and for our stated requireherring by saying that further heavy spendment, in the world today. As far as the ground attack and close support roles are concerned, we already have a proven and excellent aircraft in these roles in the Mirage. I return now to the question of the cost of the project. The Opposition has stated that the acquisition of this aircraft will not also referred to associated costs such as stand the test of a cost effectiveness study. I ask: How does one measure, in terms of cost effectiveness, the deterrence against attack on our country which this aircraft will give us? How does one measure the saving of Australian lives if this aircraft destroys the capacity of an enemy to attack the country? I believe strongly that this aircraft is needed in the Australian defence inventory and that it will stand up to any measurement of this nature. The Opposition has also said that the aircraft will be a drain on our resources and an important component of defence spending. Of course we will use our resources, and of course the project will represent a charge against our total defence vote over the years it will be in service. But the same may be said of the Mirage, of the RAAF transport fleet, of the Orion and of every other aircraft which is in our inventory. And does the Opposition suppose that any of the other aircraft which it now suggests as alternatives to this project would not also have a similar, if not greater, drain on our resources? What leads the Opposition to suppose that the Phantom, for instance, would be less costly in maintenance? Indeed there is every reason to believe that in terms of servicing and maintenance generally, the F111C may be superior to any other aircraft already in our inventory. TheF ill was specifically designed to ensure fast, efficient, low cost servicing and maintenance. Further, the initial purchase of ground support equipment, test equipment and maintenance support items sumcient to allow flexibility in operations to give the RAAF a capability to deploy to South East Asia for limited periods without the need for special additional installations in those areas. Contrary to what the Opposition has said, the airto operate it away from its home base, and the costs associated with this flexibility are already included in total project costs. The Opposition has also introduced a red ing will be needed on tankers and escort aircraft. There is no intention to procure such tankers for in-flight refuelling as the aircraft meets the range parameters as stated in the original Air Staff requirement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition capital works, ground support equipment and training. These costs are not peculiar to the F111C and would have been incurred as part of the normal developments associated with the introduction of modern aircraft, irrespective of the aircraft which was purchased to replace the Canberra. The references to the costs have no relevance in the discussions about the total cost of this project. In conclusion, I would like to state that our military advisers have assured us that the F111C meets our Air Staff requirement, and that there is no other aircraft of this type in production in the world today, or planned for in the future, which approaches the performance of this aircraft as a strike aircraft. We have in the RAAF today a highly skilled body of dedicated men, well trained, technically skilled and with high morale. I have every confidence that the addition of the F111C will give the RAAF the capability to prothis subject over a number of years. What vide this nation with a formidable strike operational work has this aircraft ever force. Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr and when has it done this? How often has Barnard) laid out some of the alternatives it done it? Where and against what sort and some of the reasonable criticisms of opposition has it done this?

134,Mr Bryant,"That is right, butit yourself. This is the most modern aeroplane available, according to the Government. What does that statement mean? You might have the most sophisticated item in any field, but if you have no particular use for it what is the use of having it? The descriptions of members of the Australian Labor Party as isolationists and as being interested only in home defence are again the cliches of intellectual sterility, one might say. I suppose a classic case was the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr tralian Air Force. Nobody is sure that we McEwen). He came into the House because he had to speak in favour of purchasing this aircraft. He and the Treasurer ( Mr is that for 6 years one of our major Services McMahon) are the sole survivors of the Cabinet which ordered th\s aircraft so they have to hang together on this one no matter how they hang on other things. So we have the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Treasurer as one, and they have come in and apologised and explained the purchase of this aircraft. But the Minister for Trade and Industry said, and I think this is symptomatic of the whole discussion, that the TSR2, the British aircraft, did not get off the drawing board. Anybody interested in this subject, of course, knows that that is quite wrong. In 1965 the 'Flying Review' said: When the final review of the TSR2 situation started late last year, the prototype had made only one flight, and had run into many minor snags inseparable from so complex an aeroplane. There was a long delay between the initial flights . . but after that, progress was so rapid that the initial flight envelope was completely cleared by the early part of March. It can already be said that the qualities of stability and control are to handle its support equipment. Then of superior to those predicted in the design programme . . . 1 quote that passage only to show that many of the arguments advanced by honourable members on the other side of the House want to know. According to a newspaper have no relation to fact whatever. Why did we buy the F ill aircraft? Last with a full bomb load. That is at the night the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) said maximum height and probably at the lowest that our military advisers are completely speed. When it is in business at full bore it satisfied that the range and weapons load probably has a range of only 700 miles or of the aircraft will meet the requirements so. What does that mean in relation to the that the Air Force set down when the decigeographical aspects of the area in which sion to order the aircraft was made. The we find ourselves? It will carry 16,000 lb of order for the aircraft was placed 6 years bombs. All this information is extracted ago when we were faced with confrontation from non-classified sources. If it is wrong between Indonesia and Malaysia. The situait is up to the Government to tell us. It is tion in this part of the world then was supposed to have this information. What completely different and the problems were does a range of even 2,500 miles mean in different. Yet the Prime Minister said the the Australian context? We must not lose decision was based upon the needs of that time and it was still adequate for the needs of that time. It is interesting to note that the right honourable gentleman spoke in the past tense. The decision to purchase the F ill was partly political. It was partly to get a status symbol and it was partly sycophancy towards the American system. What has the F ill done to the Australian defence system? It has produced a marktime period of 6 years in the Royal Auswill get the aircraft. It does not matter whether this is the right aircraft; the fact has been held up by this decision. There has been a series of indecisions about it, and continuous indecision. There has been hesitation over airfield development. We must meet a tremendous cost. It will be $300m or between one-third and one-quarter of the total defence vote, and for this money we will have only twenty-four aeroplanes. Has this not reduced our capacity in naval and military defence? With this money could we not have bought an aircraft carrier with all its related equipment? Has the purchase of the F ill not strangled any possibility of developing our own aircraft industry? Of course it has. The effort to keep this aeroplane operational is tremendous. For instance, I understand that there is an air conditioned hangar at Amberley to which it has to return for some aspect of its maintenance. 1 understand that it needs many other aeroplanes course we need a tremendous training programme for the people who will operate it. What will the F ill do? That is what I article that appeared in the 'Age' during this year, it has a range of about 2,500 miles sight of the fact that this range is obtained when it is not flying at its maximum speed and is not providing its maximum usefulness. Of course, this is never explained. For what purpose do we need the aircraft? I understand that it will be a strike bomber and that it will be used to interdict the enemy. That means that it is supposed to stop the enemy from getting too close to us. It is to go out, find the enemy forces and destroy them before they get too close. Can it do this? For what distance can it operate? The Minister for Air does not tell us. He does not say whether it would reach Djakarta. I apologise to our Indonesian friends for using the capital of their country to illustrate my point. Can this aircraft get to Djakarta or Surabaya, destroy the bases there and get back to Darwin, operating at full load and full speed? The Government does not say. The Fi l l is supposed to inhibit other people in this area who may have aggressive tendencies. That it may well do. We are told that it will under all conditions strike our enemies wherever they can be found, and do this with an unknown range and an unknown load. This has not been proved. Can it, for instance, support the Army on the ground? Can it do any of these things? Can it reach Singapore? The map I have shows me that Singapore is about 2,000 miles from the closest part of Australia. It is about 1,600 miles from the closest part of Australia to Djakarta and about 1,000 miles to Surabaya. Can the aircraft give adequate cover over Rabaul, if necessary? These are the problems that must be faced. They are not problems of sophistication at all. They are problems of distance. They are not problems of having the most modern aircraft that is available. They are problems of being able to cover 6 million square miles of land and sea. From what I can see of the performance figures of which we have some knowledge, many of the handful of air bases in Australia from which the F ill can operate continuously are so far apart that the aircraft could barely cover the distance between them under operational conditions. For instance, what is the position in the Australian Bight and 300 or 400 miles out to sea? The aircraft would operate out of the Adelaide airfield and the one in Western Australia. They are 1,200 to 1,500 miles apart. We have not seen this aircraft in business try that it is not economical for us to do against an enemy equipped to deal with it. so. If the Swedes can produce the Viggen, Can it reach the places that it may need to reach? Can it strike at industries and fleets? In fact, what will it strike? What do we need in this part of the world? This question has never been answered by anyone on the Government side. It is true that if we lived in Europe we would need an aircraft that could strike at industries in another country, although such action has not yet been successful in any war. If we were in Europe we might need an aircraft that could strike at a fleet. I understand that the F ill will carry nuclear weapons. I hope we will never use them, that we will not need to use them and that there is no possible opponent against whom we may be required to use them. We could, of course, strike at people. There are many people in our area. There are 100 million people in Indonesia. We can strike at bases. But where are all these objectives? Of course, Australia is not that kind of a country. We on this side of the House believe that, if it were necessary to spend $300m on defence, it would be better spent on something other than the F ill . Would it not have been better to have tried the Phantom aircraft? We on this side of the House do not claim to be experts. But what about the Skyhawk, the Viggen, the Buccaneer and the Harrier? I have questioned before why we have not done something about the development of the vertical take-off aircraft. It seems to me that this would have advantages for us. I know that my friend from North Sydney( Mr Graham) in a speech during the Estimates debate said that he had inspected this aircraft. He gave some sound reasons why the present version is not satisfactory for us. But what have we done? We have special problems of our own and the American research scientists will not solve them. They are engaged on different problems. European countries have their problems. Our geographic and strategic situation is unique. No other country has the problems that arise from our size and the distances we must cover. We have the technical and industrial resources that we need to solve our problems. I do not believe the arguments that we hear from honourable members opposite and from others around the counwe can produce an equivalent aircraft. It is not a matter of keeping up with the Joneses or the Swedes. It is a matter of developing the potential to meet the needs when they arise. 1 believe with tbe Prime Minister and others that the potential threat to Australia is remote, at least for the next 10 years. No matter how much honourable members opposite scoff and sneer at suggestions made by honourable members on this side of the House, we will do our best to ensure that Australia is properly protected and that its security is guaranteed. Honourable members on the Government side, also, will do their best to see that Australia is properly protected and that its security is guaranteed. go up to the border with West Irian to see But we challenge the strategic ancl other concepts behind the F ill project. There seem to be innumerable aircraft on the market that could add to Australia's security. 11 seems to me that, with the space of this continent, twenty-four aircraft are a minute contribution to the solution of any problem that may face us. If one or two are out of business and one or two more are being maintained, we will be lucky if we have 6, 8 or 10 aircraft continuously in operational condition. Indeed, for our purposes we would be better served if we had some less sophisticated, less miraculous and less angelic kind of aircraft but more of them. There seem to be quite a number of aeroplanes around today to which we could turn. T would certainly like to see Australia developing its own potential. Of course we hear nothing from the Government during these debates about what our defence aims are. There is this continual generality to tbe effect that we should have a strike potential, whatever Opposition to criticise and to say: Get somethat might mean. We have to be able to thing else. However the facts are that in interdict somewhere at a reasonable distance the geographical context in which we find from our shores. Anybody who came with ourselves 24 aircraft of this nature, no aggressive intentions towards the Australian matter how miraculous they may be, are coast ought to know that he would get a not going to resolve any of our strategic powerful punch indeed at a certain distance or tactical problems or give us a properly from our shores. But what should that disintegrated defence service. tance be? I have been saying to mysetf, as a result of my thinking on the subject, article from today's Melbourne 'Age'. It that the distance should be somewhere out relates to this decision or non-decision about in the 1,000-mile range. We ought to be the Fl 11. Has there been a decision?

Wc ought to be able to that the aircraft will turn up; that on Day1 make things very difncult for a potential or on 24th October there will be flocks of aggressor at that distance. Somewhere beyond that distance we ought to be able to keep a close and constant eye upon a potential aggressor. We also ought to be able to patrol satisfactorily Australia's 12,000 miles of coastline and the 300 or 400 miles of mountainous and jungle strewn borders. Does the statement of the Prime Minister about the F ill provide for any of these things? There has been no indication from the Government side that it intends to do these things. Of course it is one of the facts of life that the present Government does not apply itself at all to the defence problems closest to home. We have only to that this is the case. We are full of fight when we are 3,000 or 4,000 miles away, involved in somebody else's battles, but if we go to the West Irian border at Wulung it is apparent that the Government does not care a darn about things; that all this talk is afigmentor is part of some ideological fantasy which the Government calls a foreign policy. What could we have done with the money that is being spent on the F ill ? Possibly we could have bought an aircraft carrier or something to extend certain aspects of our Navy and the Fleet Air Arm. Certainly the Army has been ground to the ground for too long, lt ought to be more mechanised. It ought to have more rocketry. It ought to have more of such equipment. Perhaps we could have bought 100 more Mirages. Perhaps we could have got 80 or 90 Phantoms, or Lightnings, or Vulcans or something else. It is easy enough for the I think I should close by quoting an them flying over Melbourne and that on them will be painted 'Vote Bryant 1' or something like that? I doubt it. However, this is what the 'Age' had to say: Even accepting the Prime Minister's assurances on the F ill capabUities and safety record, the fact remains that the affair has proved to be one of the most prolonged, expensive and unnecessary in the nation's history. He may be right in describing the F ill as the best aircraft of its type in the world. But what on earth are we going to do with it? At that price what can we afford to do with it? The whole protracted business reflects little credit on the Gorton administration and none at all on its predecessors. Of course, in the Cabinet there are only two survivors of the Government's predecessorsIt stands as a supersonic reminder of the folly of purchasing expensive military hardware sight unseen in a fit of military and political panic. In the past year it has also provided an example of the high cost of indecision. Debate (on motion by Mr Kevin Cairns) adjourned. (No. 2) 1969 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 August (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, this Bill deals with what can be taxed rather than the rate at which particular things can be taxed. The Income Tax Assessment Act determines what shall be taxed and what shall be excluded from tax by way of deduction and so on. As has been said in this place before, the Income Tax Assessment Act is a very compendious volume indeed. The amendments before us on this occasion are highly technical in nature and are before us not really so much for the purpose of collecting tax but in fact to say that operations in certain fields shall be taxed differently from some other transactions. The amendments are serving a social purpose rather than a strictly income tax purpose. It is because of the inclusion of matters of this kind in the Act that in some respects it has become a less simple document than it otherwise might be. introduced this Bill and the two related mately Parliament must pass the law; I do Bills, said they dealt with the rates but for not deny that and we ought not to deny various reasons this Bill was deferred until now. I had thought that there was to be another series of complicated amendments dealing with what are called convertible notes. HoweverI understand that the legislation has been so complicated that the amendments will have to be dealt with in another Bill, Bill No. 4, which may be introduced before this House rises. Alternatively, it may not be introduced until the new Parliament assembles, perhaps towards the end of this year. The main parts of the amendments in this Bill are set out at page 2 of the explanatory memorandum distributed by the Treasurer which states: The third Bill-the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 2) 1969-ha s the following main purposes: Stmctural improvements for water or fodder conservation . . . The scope of capital expenditure incurred by primary producers which is deductible in full in the year of incurrence is to be extended to include expenditure on improvements made to conserve water or fodder. According to the Treasurer the second group of amendments deals with the following: Capital subscribed for purposes of mining or prospecting . . . The provisions of the income tax law which now permit, in specified circumstances, separate deductions for share capital subscribed by Australian residents to(a) petroleum exploration companies; and (b) other companies, the principal business of which is mining or prospecting for minerals other than gold or petroleum, are to be revised so that, in broad terms, deductions may be available where share capital is subscribed to companies engaged in both of these branches of the mining industry. There is also a provision which deals with double deductions. Apparently, because of the way the Act is drawn, some people tried to read into it the possibility that you could claim twice for the one lot of expenditure. Any doubt in this respect is to be clarified by this amendment. I do not want to say a great deal about the technicalities of the amendments because, as I have said on a previous occasion, I do not claim to be able to comprehend some of them in some respects. When amendments of this kind are contemplated there ought to be better machinery than is",62,General Post Office Building Sydney

137,"The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon), When He Currently Available To Evaluate Them. Ulti","that. Nevertheless we ought to be given much more opportunity to hear different points of view on these matters. I was interested to read when these matters were brought down that quite a number of financial writers had some doubts about the petroleum provisions. I refer to one article, which appeared in the 'Australian' of 19th August, headed: 'Uptight over Treasurer's tax amendments'-whateve r 'uptight' means. The article suggests that there is some balance both ways. It would seem to me that when that kind of doubt exists there ought to be opportunity for people with opposing points of view to submit their views perhaps to a committee of this House, where there would be access to the experts from the Treasury or the Taxation Branch, or from outside. Then we would have better means of deciding whether what the Government proposed was an improvement of the law. The other evening when the rate Bills is supposed to be. were before us we talked about the weight of taxation in Australia. Of course, the logical because the one-quarter does not weight of taxation is ultimately determined spend the money. not only by the income that an individual has but also by the deductions that are available to that individual. Tbe deductions as the honourable member will realise, if he that are available fall into two pretty broad will listen to me. One of my colleagues groups. The first covers deductions for pointed out the other day that in some cases dependants, such as wives and children, a person who is presented with what appears and the second includes deductions under a to be a high medical bill can be allowed as variety of other headings, such as expenses a concessional deduction as much as twoincurred in educating children, expenses thirds of that bill. He may actually pay less incurred in meeting that part of one's for an expensive operation than does a permedical bill which is not covered by the son on a much lower income. This is the so-called voluntary health scheme, deducpoint I am endeavouring to make. Jt seems tions for donations to certain charities, to me at least, however it may seem to the allowances for life assurance premiums and honourable member, that in some respects so on. In some respects there is not a great the principle of allowing deductions rather deal of logic in including certain things as indiscriminately runs contrary to the logic deductible and excluding others. I think of the tax system itself. I have said before in this House that if we are going to allow as a concessional deduction expenditure on medical treatment to that the allowance of these various concure a person of an illness, there is probably cessions means that the Commonwealth a good case for allowing one's milk bill as loses in tax yield some $750m, which was a concessional deduction because the milk fairly close to half the total amount colsaves a person from getting sick. That is lected in tax in that year, which was the just one example that I might take. There year ended 30th June 1967. So that the seems to be little logic in what is included effective yield was reduced by nearly a and what is excluded, but of course the third, and the benefit of that abatement in inclusions and exclusions have a considertax went to the extent of more than a half able bearing upon the amount of revenue to a quarter of the taxpayers. I submit thai that is collected. The Budget Papers included Commonwealth income tax statistics which showed that, for the last financial year for which figures are available, total deductions allowed for income tax purposes amounted to some $2,588m. In other words, if we added up all allowable deductions of all taxpayers, for wives and children and medical expenses and what have you, we would get a total of $2,588m. Of this total some $884m was for dependents. In other words, one third of the total was for dependents and two thirds was allowed under other headings, under which the deductions tend to be available to people whose incomes are high rather than to people whose incomes are low. If we make a breakdown of the deductions something like half the face value of deductions, and therefore considerably more than half their tax worth, goes to fewer than a quarter of the taxpayers, so that in a sense this is running counter to what the logic of the income tax In an address in Perth the Treasurer said at least it is arguable whether this is a logical sort of thing to continue. As I have said",66,Income Tax Assessment Bill
138,Mr Buchanan,That would not be,67,Income Tax Assessment Bill
139,Mr Crean,"There can be illogicalities,before, in my view one of the greatest deterrents to getting better social welfare programmes in Australia is that this kind of inbuilt injustice in the income tax structure impedes our ability to give payments equally to all members of the community. I submit this is a matter that needs to be looked at. As I said the other evening, I do not think that these things, in very great detail, can become an argument at election time. We cannot fight elections around what ought or ought not to be in a schedule, because it is a very complicated business. To get on to some of the other matters that are specifically included in this measure, designed for particular purposes. I realise I come again to deductions or exemptions that have application to a relatively small section of the community in total-bu t a not unimportant section. I do not want to deny the importance of the mineral industry and the tax concessions that have been given to it. Nor can anyone deny the significance of the mineral industry to Australia. But at least one ought to be aware that because income tax concessions are given, and for the most part to undertakings which are incorporated or operate as companies, for every dollar of deduction that is given the Government, in a sense, underwrites that dollar to the extent of nearly 45c. It is almost a partner by default in the enterprise. If it allows a deduction that reduces the taxable income of the company by $1 for every $1 of that type of exemption it reduces the tax payable by that company by something like 45c in the $1. In other words, the company pays 55c out of the $1 while the Government has underwritten 45c. This is one of the peculiar things that are going on in a lot of our undertakings today by reason of the high rates of tax at marginal rates for individuals and at flat rates for companies. Whether or not a thing is tax deductible is a matter of some considerable significance and at least occasionally the Parliament ought to probe these questions when this kind of legislation comes before it because, in essence, it means there is a loss of revenue, although that is not the primary purpose of. the deduction. The primary purpose of the deduction is to encourage a particular venture which is being undertaken. I think there is considerable room for argument whether this is always the most effective way of encompassing this sort of objective. I submit again that there is considerable room for argument and the market results, if you like to put it that way, of particular ventures can be affected by whether or not investment in them is or is not tax deductible as a source of capital. There are considerable items which are treated as income tax deductions for primary producers, for instance, which in the case of anyone else in the community would be regarded as either domestic transactions or capital transactions, and those persons would not be able to write the value off as they actually incur the expenditure. This is that our primary industries, as well as the mining industry, play a very important part in Australia's economy, particularly in the field of overseas earnings. If you are to allow a certain item of a capital kind to be written off as a tax deduction it seems immaterial to me whether this is done over a period of years at some arbitrary rate or in the year in which the expenditure occurs, if it suits the taxpayer to do it this way. We have the fiction of depreciation being allowed at the rate of 15% per annum in respect of a motor vehicle used for the earning of income. But the taxpayer is allowed to increase that 15% by a half, which makes the effective rate for the year 22i%. This is a fiction. You say that the asset will last for about 7 years, then you write it off as though it will last only 4 years. There seems to be only a slight difference between doing it in that way and in allowing it to be written off completely at one go, as is already done with a large part of capital expenditure both in mining and in primary production. Let me deal with the definition of income. The Income Tax Act is built around the concept of taxing income. In some cases it is not very difficult to determine what is income. If a person is a wage earner it is presumed that the total of his wage is income. In the case of a business, however, it is not so easy. It would be disastrous for a business if it were taxed on its turnover, although this is the rather peculiar device adopted recently by the Premier of Victoria to augment hisfinances.In the case of a business its income is the difference between what is received and what is expended. There may be some arguments as to what items of expenditure are of an annual outgoing kind, what are of a capital kind and what are of a kind that is not regarded as deductible. The division between what is taxable and what is not is a fine one. In recent times there bas been a lot of talk in the community about including in the concept of income items which in other times would have been regarded as capital items-sometime s described simply as 'capital gains'. In some respects a great deal of confusion has been caused by recent actions of the Commissioner of Taxation, although I defend him because he is acting within the Act and within the terms of his legal rights and to some extent his discretionary rights as he sees them. These actions relate to people who choose to make investments on a small scale in shares. I have said on other occasions that I have never owned a share in a company. That is my business. I regard the buying of shares often as a form of speculation, which in some respects can have anti-social effects. But this is not necessarily the view of everybody in the community. Until recently a person who bought shares on what he thought was a small scale had only to declare the dividends which he received on those shares or, if he put his money into debentures, the interest which he received. But the boom in mining has changed things. Not only is the company engaged in mining allowed a tax deduction but also the person who invests in shares in such undertakings is allowed to claim a deduction in respect of calls he has paid for particular kinds of shares in a particular year. Calls on most shares are not regarded as tax deductible items. They are regarded as capital outgoings on the part of the investor. All that concerns the Commissioner of Taxation is whether there has been a dividend or interest. But in the lastfinancialyear or so a number of taxpayers who by no stretch of the imagination could be regarded as share dealers have been asked to give details of their share transactions going back over a considerable number of years. Most small investors are not bookkeepers. Some are more methodical than others. AH that most would keep would be the scrip of the shares. They may even keep it in banks for safe keeping. Other than last year's cheque butts, they would not have any records of when they bought the shares and so most of the detail has to be obtained from the office of the broker handling the transaction. If the law were altered to provide for a capital gains tax there would at least be some certainty about the matter. But a capital gains tax should not be imposed by stealth. To a degree this is what is happening to people who never imagined that they were share traders and who, having bought shares this year, find that they have to divulge certain information about the transactions to the Commissioner of Taxation. Recently, in answer to a question, the a question of intention and that all that the person had to do was prove his intention at the time he acquired the shares. But proving one's intention is not so simple. In some respects it is almost impossible, because it involves a state of mind. It is something like the arguments we had in our younger days about the morality of gambling. For instance, would a person put money on a horse if he knew in advance that the horse would lose? I have known plenty of people who have backed a horse thinking it would win, who should have known that it had no chance of winning. That is a matter of fine judgment-o r perhaps wide judgment. If a person buying a share were honest he might say: T bought it because last year these shares yielded 5% or 6%. It is a gilt edged investment. I can get more for my money this way than if T left it in the bank.' On the other hand, a person may have purchased shares with a reasonable degree of prudence hoping that, at some time in the future, tbere will be an appreciation of his capital. It seems to me to be a fine line to draw to ask such a taxpayer to prove what his intention was at the time he acquired the shares. But this is, in essence, what the Commissioner of Taxation is asking. I think the Commissioner is giving himself a vast amount of work with very little prospect of recovering large sums of money. He is also using manpower in the Taxation Branch which could be employed upon much more useful exercises. But if this borderline probing of whether there",67,Income Tax Assessment Bill
140,Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Said That It Was,"has or has not been a capital gain is to take place it should be regularised, as it is in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. I am not propounding u definite proposition at this stage because I believe that the matter will require a great deal of further examination, but it could be laid down that if a person bought shares and sold them within a certain period of time, making a capital gain, that gain should be included in his taxable income for thatfinancialyear. But there can always be doubts about this. Because of changed personal circumstances a person may have to sell his shares soon after he felt free to divest himself of some cash and put it into shares as an asset. However, by and large, if a person buys shares one day and sells them within 2 or 3 weeks it can usually be presumed that he is aiming to make a capital gain on the transaction. If such a person makes a capital gain during a financial year perhaps it should be included in his taxation return as income. Losses made in the same period could be offset. But such a law should not be imposed by stealth. A number of sharebrokers have approached me concerning this aspect. As I said earlier, I do not own any shares, but people seem to think that in some way or another I am the spokesman for a large section of the community on this matter. Sharebrokers are disturbed at the fact that the action of the Taxation Branch officers can cause a great deal of inconvenience at their offices for very little real return to the Government. It also creates uncertainty in the minds of the small investors because they do not want to be bothered. Everybody knows that there is a great flood of letters from sharebrokers advising people to buy shares in one company instead of another or something of that nature. Acting on the receipt of that type of prudent advice a person may buy the shares recommended, but he will buy them in the hope that he will get a return. He may think that the shares are so good that he will hold on to them for several years. He is not hauled before the Commissioner ot Taxation if he sells them 5 or 10 years later, but he runs that risk if he sells them in a relatively short space of time. AllJ am suggesting is that there should be some clarity on this aspect. If it is believed that do not think it can be laid down. The people are speculating in this field in large dimensions-ther e is no doubt that there is large scale speculation-the Commissioner of Taxation is justified in taking action. But there are many people who speculate in very small dimensions. It seems to me that it is hardly worth the trouble of the Commissioner to take action. However, I think this aspect should be cleared up. Recently a man who had bought shares over a good number of years and who had always returned his dividends accurately each year came to me for advice. He had bought certain shares in mining ventures and had claimed the calls as deductions as he was entitled to do. He included all the relevant information in his income tax return. He was then met with a demand to show the full layout of his transactions over 4 or 5 years. The man told me that he had actually sold only one lot of shares in all the years he had had been purchasing them, but he happened to strike a winner and. like everybody else, thought it was prudent to sell at a particular time. Normally a person who buys a share at SI hopes it will go up to $1.50 and give some return. If, for some reason or another, it goes up to $5 or $6 and that person has J ,000 shares he would be a most imprudent man if he did not sell them, even if he did not buy them with the intention of selling them within such a space of time. The taxation law as it stands either makes liars out of certain people or causes tax officials to impute improper motives to some taxpayers, f think the law should be clarified. I am one who believes that there are large capital increments in the community which lead to distortion in the distribution of wealth. Not all capital gains are excluded from taxation, as everybody who studies the law knows. But there is a certain amount of haphazardness as to what is permissible and what is not. The Government can remove some of the haphazardness as far as the small investors are concerned by saying: Tf you buy a share today and sell it within the financial year the gain should be included in your income'. asked me the same thing the other clay.

142,Mr Crean,"The honourable memberGovernment is trying to lay down criteria for convertible notes. It has far more experregard to taxation. Many of the things that tise at its disposal than I have. I am only referring to the recent probing of the files of brokers in Perth and Adelaide in order to determine what income is received by certain persons from share dealings. This matter has received prominence in most of the financial newspapers. A number of questions have also been asked in the House. It seems to me that the probing has caused unnecessary confusion and uncertainty. There is a certain amount of discrimination as to who discloses what. I am not suggesting that anything can be done at this stage about the matter, but I think that something should be done when the Parliament resumes after the forthcoming election. These matters should be looked into more closely. I take the opportunity this afternoon of complaining about this uncertainty because I am one who believes that there should be certainty in taxation. A law may be written into the statutes book in a certain way but, as the precedents and cases indicate, there are always clever people who will want to get around it. The law is entitled to dicated that the purpose was to simplify take steps to close any loopholes and to remove as much uncertainty as is possible. I think the same situation exists in regard to the capital gains tax. At the moment we do not have any legislation in broad terms, although certain capital transactions which are carried out frequently enough to form a regular pattern are subject to taxation. On the other hand, there are some people, such as bookmakers and sharebrokers, who buy and sell and deal in this sort of thing and the whole of their income is subject to taxation. Up to date, except for the tax on bookmakers' tickets as well as State taxes on share turnovers, the small investor, unless he declares himself as a share dealer, applies to petroleum, and section 77AA is not subject to any tax on his capital appreciation. It seems to me that recent indications are that the Commissioner is endeavouring to bring such a person within the net. I submit that it is wrong to impose by stealth a tax capital gains. However, if the Government wants ultimately to reform the law it should do so. We have just heard from the honourable look at other minerals, and they had to member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) form separate organisations. Now persons one of his usual, well thought out and subscribing moneys to mining companies reasonable assessments of the position in I intend to say will coincide with the views 1 which he has expressed. But more particularly, I feel that we do not want a capital gains tax at all-certainl y not by stealth. The honourable member indicated that this tax is creeping into the system at the present time. But I will return to that matter a little later in referring to a similar set of circumstances. This Bill covers various sections of the 1 Income Tax Assessment Act, but I am more interested in the changes that are proposed in relation to taxation on mining shares. Sections 77A and 77AA of the Act, which have been in operation for some time, are now being combined and will reappear in the new terms of the law as section 77D. There is no real alteration. The principles remain the same. The Government will not provide more concessions. To all intents and purposes, the same results will be achieved by the new section. But, of course, it will be a tot more convenient for everybody. The Treasurer ( Mr McMahon), in announcing this change, in the law. No matter how we look at this taxation law, the more it can be simplified the better, because it is quite beyond the capacity of the ordinary individual to wade through all the complicated clauses that are involved in the Bill which we have before us. The sections to which I have referred provide that deductions from taxable income of moneys paid to resident companies who make the appropriate renouncing of their own future claims will be allowed to the taxpayer in subscribing new capital to newly formed companies. Section 77A applies to prospecting for minerals, other than petroleum and gold. So some companies which were formed for mining purposes were obliged to maintain separate organisations. The new section, I hope, will prevent the proliferation of companies, which occurred this year when many of the companies which were originally formed to carry out exploration for petroleum found that it was also in their interests to",70,Income Tax Assessment Bill

Unless this had been deductions for the cost of oil or other mindone the concessions given under section ing shares being allowed under more than 77A and later section 77AA would have been has faithfully-bu t perhaps too faithfullyinterpreted the Act as it now stands. Let me emphasise that the double taxaclairvoyance-that the purchaser of shares lt is a general rule of the income tax law that legally impossible. The position now reverts to what it was before the 77A concession was introduced, except that the new provision applies only to shares purchased after 12th August 1969, and I presume that the exception will also apply to calls made or options taken up by an original subscriber. Anyone purchasing shares after 12th August and becoming subject to calls or taking up options would still get the benefit of deduction under 77D, but under section 82 would lose this when such shares were sold. I would welcome advice on whether this is the correct interpretation. It is the best I can do from my reading of the Bill. Under the legislation that has been in force until now only the amount received in excess of the cost would be taxed, but the new provision being introduced in this Bill has the effect of making the total proceeds taxable because a deduction has already been allowed under section 77D and only one deduction is allowed for the cost of these shares. The effect must be disastrous to the oil exploration industry. This incentive was introduced to stimulate and encourage the search for oil at a time when there were no known oil deposits in Australia. Now we have a sizeable field in the Bass. Strait, a medium field at Barrow Island and a small field at Moonie in Queensland which is rapidly running down. The Bass Strait field will make a worthwhile contribution to our needs for the next 10, 15 or maybe 20 years. Barrow Island is a useful contributor and possibly has a life of 20 years also. Butunless we find additional reserves to replace these as they are consumed and to provide for a demand that is increasing by 9% or 10% per annum, we will be right back where we started from. It is important from every point of view that Australia become self-sufficient in oil. Looked at from the point of view of defence, overseas balances, the establishment of local industries, the valuable by-product industries that are associated with refineries, in taxation returns. Questions have been or from any other point of view, the need for incentive in the search for oil is as great today as it was 10 years ago. The Treasurer has assured me that this removal of the double taxation provision is aimed only at stopping what he considers to be undesirable practices which were regrettably only too apparent in recent months with the disastrous spate of oil floats that has flattened the market at the present time. He is aiming at the professionals, the dealers, who cleaned up pretty large sums by floating oil prospecting companies which had no leases to prospect in, no tenements in which to operate and which could contribute to the oil search only by farming in with the established groups. But one does not really have to take a hammer to crack a peanut. There were some problems associated with this sudden change in the impact of raising money for the oil search. If it had not been overdone there would not have been any harm, but as we all know the great majority of these speculative ventures put their shares on the market at a discounted price. I hope that we are not likely to have a repeat of this. A lot of quite small investments make up the sum total of the amount of money that is going into oil search. That money has to keep coming in, otherwise we will not be able to drill holes. The only way to find oil is by drilling holes and hoping. These people seem to be eternally optimistic that at some time they will strike a bonanza. These small people who have been making small investments are not to be confused with the dealers who are investing all the time. Anyone who is making his living in this way naturally has to keep books and declare everything he earns, but the smaller man is doing this just as an adjunct to another job. If it becomes the major part of his income or even a very large part of his income, the Commissioner of Taxation may be justified in taxing that additional income. In the last few weeks particularly many people have been perturbed at the action of Deputy Commissioners of Taxation in various States in investigating the books ol sharebrokers to track down transactions that may have been made on the stock exchange but which have not been included asked on this subject in the House and the Treasurer in his replies has indicated that these investigations have not been at his instigation; they are entirely in the province of the Deputy Commissioners. I understand that this practice has been stopped because of the protest by the various chairmen of stock exchanges who want the Parliament to clarify what is taxable and what is notjust as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports does. Under section 26A the assessable income is treated as profit earned from the sale by the taxpayer of property acquired by him for the purpose of profit making by sale or from the carrying on or carrying out of. any profit making undertaking or scheme. It seems to me that there would be very few people putting money into the purchase of shares with any other motive than ot finishing up with an increase in their assets or, in other words, of making a profit. As far as the wording of section 26A is concerned, one of our very reputable sharebroking firms put out a prospectus for a mineral company earlier this year, and it printed on the face of the prospectus: 'This is a speculative proposition'. Obviously nobody putting money into that venture would ever be able to say that he was making an investment. Anyone putting his money on a race horse does so with the purpose of making a profit. It could well bc described in the words of section 26A as doing something which is the carrying out of a profit making scheme. Yet it is customary to regard any gains on the racecourse, even quite substantial gains, as pin money, unless it becomes apparent that the person concerned is making this his main business. If he is making it his main business, he should pay tax on what he earns the same as any other business or the same as share traders. Many people approach the share market with an optimism similar to that with which they face the racecourse. They take a punt on some oil or mining shares and are hopeful of a profit, but certainly they have no idea of becoming dealers in the sense in which it is now being threatened they will be considered. Last FridayI asked the Treasurer a question on this subject, and part of his reply was: It has long been the law thai there is a distinction between investment and trading in shares. When it is investment and can be proved to be investment, no tax is payable on profits. When it is trading, that is, when a person is investing for the purpose of re-sale at a profit, tax on profits is payable. Always there is a right of appeal . . . But who wants to appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation? It is a very chancy process. If a person was dealing in only small amounts he would probably say that he would not bother to appeal. The main thing is that the small investor wants to know where he stands before he starts, and the brokers want to know what they can advise their clients when they come in and ask for advice about what shares they should buy. How can anyone prove that a transaction is really an investment? It has been pointed out so often that the interpretation of this word 'investment' is very important. A spokesman for the Taxation Rranch has put it in these words: if a lax payer acquires shares and his dominant purpose is to sell them at a profit then he has to include the profit in his income tax return and tax will be levied accordingly. There is no liability if a taxpayer makes a profit from selling shares if his dominant intention at the time of purchase was to hold them for their dividends. That interpretation helps somewhat but it does not help the small investor because if it were intended to hold such shares for dividends nobody would invest anything in thc oil companies that have been floated in the last several years because dividends would not be the dominant motive in investing. A large number of people have invested in the oil industry because they have wanted to support the discovery of oil in Australia. A lot of them knew that their money would go down the drain in certain instances but, by spreading their investment over several companies, they hoped to come out all right. Where would we find any subscriber to an oil exploration company who could, with reasonable honesty, claim that he was putting his money into the company as a capital investment purely for the dividends that would accrue? It is bad enough to try to relate this to industrial shares which, I presume, is the intention of section 26, but I ask again: Who could honestly say that he bought BHP shares when they were S20 as an investment? He would be lucky to get even 2% on them. He would be better off with the money in the bank. Obviously the intention was to make a gain on the eventual sale of the shares. If we leave this legislation as it is the legitimate supporter of new ventures-whethe r it be in petroleum, mining or industrial shares-wil l be entirely confused as to where he stands with regard to taxation and will be deterred from joining in a venture which, if successinvest of being badgered by taxation ful, could result in his being subjected to a authorities. One way out would be for all savage capital' gains tax. A line in the income tax form requires subject to taxation if the original subscriber a taxpayer to state any profits made from held the stock for a specified period. The the sale of land, leases, shares or any other honourable member for Melbourne Ports property purchased for resale. Surely if ( Mr Crean) made a similar suggestion. I that line appears in the income tax forms would propose a period of 6 months. In there should be some clarity about the January 1966 this problem was discussed ultimate result. If a person records an exhaustively by the Government Members entry against that line as a profit he will Mining Committee. As Secretary of that pay taxation on that amount. The person Committee at that time. I made the same who honestly follows the taxation return proposal and, as I understood the position, form is penalised, but someone who makes some of the Deputy Commissioners of his own determination and does not record Taxation would have been glad to have had his profits escapes paying taxation.

Debate (on motion by Mr Davies) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.48 to 8 p.m. Ministerial Statement leave-The 1969-70 Budget Speech foreshadowed some reliefs from estate duty for the estates of primary producers and stated that the proposed reliefs would apply to the estates of persons who die after the authorising legislation has been assented to. Broad details of the scheme of reliefs have now been worked out but it will not be practicable for the amending legislation to be introduced and considered by the Parliament in the short time that remains of this parliamentary session. The Government, has, therefore, decided that the reliefs should, when the amending legislation has been assented to. apply to estates of persons who die after today. The purpose of the proposed reliefs is to provide assistance to discourage the breaking up of economic rural holdings, particularly family holdings, because of the need to pay estate duty. There will be two basic tests for determining whether an estate qualifies for the reliefs. In broad terms, an estate will be eligible if more than 50% of the dutiable assets are primary production assets and if more than 50% of gross income of the deceased for the 5 years preceding death was derived from carrying on a business of primary production in Australia. Primary production assets for this purpose will include land used in a business of primary production and improvements on such land. Also included will be livestock, farm produce and farm plant and machinery. One form of relief for eligible estates will be given by raising existing exemption limits by 20%. At present the exemption for an estate passing to close relatives is $20,000, diminishing by $2 for each $8 by which the dutiable value of the estate exceeds $20,000 and cutting out when thc dutiable value is $100,000. It is proposed that, for eligible primary production estates, the basic exemption be increased to $24,000. diminishing in the same way as at present and cutting out at $120,000. For small estates not passing to close relatives the present exemption is $10,000, shading out by $2 for each $8 in excess of that amount so that it cuts out at $50,000. It is proposed that, for eligible primary production estates, the end limits of this range of exemption will be increased to $J 2,000 and $60,000 respectively. The other form of relief will be by way of the allowance of a rebate of part of the duty attributable to the value of primary production assets included in the dutiable estate. Both for the purpose of determining whether an estate is eligible under the assets test I have already described, and for the purpose of determining the duty attributable to primary production assets included in the estate, debts of the estate, including State death duties, will be distributed proportionately over all assets in the estate according to the gross value of each asset. Duty will, in thc first place, be calculated in the usual way. Against duty so calculated will be allowed a rebate, on a sliding scale, of part of the duty attributable to primary production assets. Where the dutiable value of an estate, before allowance of the appropriate amount of statutory exemption, is $140,000 or less, the rebate will be 50% of the duty attributable to the value of primary production assets included in thc estate. So if, after pro-rating all debts as I have already explained, it was found in such a case that 90% of the value of dutiable assets was attributable to primary production assets, the rebate allowable would be 50% of 90% of the duty, lt is proposed that the rate of rebate will diminish by one-tenth of 1% for each $220 by which the value of the estate exceeds $140,000, so that, for estates of $250,000 or more, there will be no rebate available. I have had a table prepared which sets out the savings of duty that will, through the combined effects of the raised exemptions and the allowance of the rebate, accrue to estates passing wholly to close relatives. The table shows these savings for estates of various values, assuming that the value of primary production assets in the estate amounts to two-thirds of the dutiable value. To quote some examples, the saving, on this assumption, for an estate of a dutiable value of $50,000 is $1,051, for an estate of $150,000 it is",71,Income Tax Assessment Bill
144,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Treasurer)-by$7,727 and for one of $210,000 it is $5,854. Larger savings would, of course, accrue if the proportion of primary production assets were greater than two thirds. With the concurrence of honourable members. I will have this table incorporated in Hansard. Net value Duty of Estate before allowance of present statutory exemption reliefs 5 40,000 50,000 70,000 90,000 110,000 130,000 150,000 170,000 190,000 210,000 230,000 250,000 Assumptions: 1. Whole of estate passes to widow, widower, children or grandchildren of deceased. 2. Net value of primary production assets represents two-thirds of net value of estate, before allowance of statutory exemption. The Government has not overlooked the fact that, in these times, it is not uncommon for the assets of a primary production business to be held by, and for the business to be conducted through, a family proprietary company. We have, therefore, given careful consideration to finding an equitable and administratively practicable means of including within the scope of the scheme primary production assets represented by shares in a family proprietary company. One difficulty that had to be faced is ihat, while such assets held by primary producers personally are, for estate duty purposes, valued at their true market value, shares in private companies carrying on a business of primary production are usually valued on an expected future earnings basis, a method of valuation which can produce a value for duty significantly less than the market value of the assets backing the shares. The Victorian Government, which also gives relief from probate duty on rural holdings by means of a rebate, faced a similar difficulty and adopted a solution which we think is also appropriate, and equitable, in the context of the proposed rebate of Commonwealth estate duty. We therefore propose that for the purposes of the two forms of relief, shares in a family private company, to the extent that they represent primary production assets, will be treated as such assets, if the trustee elects to have the shares valued, for all duty purposes, on an assets backing basis, Duty payable Reduction payable at after in duty that is on the basis of a notional voluntary proposed payable liquidation of the company without allowance for liquidation expenses. This will go a long way towards preserving equity between producers who have retained their $ % % farms as personal holdings and those who 937 400 537 have transferred them to private companies. 2,104 1,053 1,051 5,150 2,967 2,183 It will also give trustees of estates of the 9,397 5,632 3,765 latter producers an opportunity to decide 14,300 9,130 5,170 which would give the greater benefit to 19,500 13,000 6,500 25,500 17,773 7,727 the estate-electio n for an assets backing 32,300 24,470 7,830 valuation with consequential higher exemp39,900 32,645 7,255 tion levels and a rebate or for an alternative 48,300 42,446 5,854 valuation with no rebate or increased 57,500 54,015 3,485 65,062 65,062 Nil exemption. There will, of course, be the opportunity for producers who have entered into private company arrangements to consider for themselves whether, in the light of the new reliefs, there would now be an advantage in reviewing the arrangements they have made. I have mentioned that the proposed scheme will extend to family companies. By family companies I mean companies all the shares in which, at the date of a relevant person's death, were beneficially owned by that person or by him and his family. I might sum up the broad proposals as to the reliefs in relation to private company arrangements in the following way: Firstly, shares in a one-family primary production company may, to the extent that they represent primary production assets of the company, qualify as such assets in the estate of a deceased shareholder if the gross value of the company's primary production assets exceeds the gross value of its other assets at the date of death of the deceased shareholder; secondly, such shares that are included in the assets of an estate would be regarded as primary production assets, to the extent that their value is attributable to such assets, if, as under the Victorian probate duty rebate scheme, the trustee of the estate elects that, for all estate duty purposes, they be valued by reference to the value of the company on a notional voluntary liquidation, without allowance of notional costs of liquidation; and thirdly, for the purpose of determining whether more than 50% of the gross income of the deceased for the 5 years preceding death had been derived from carrying on a business of primary production, income drawn by him from a one-family company in the form of dividends, director's fees, salary or wages in a year within that 5-year period would be regarded as income from primary production if the company's gross income from primary production in that year were greater than its gross income from other sources. Reference was also made in the Budget speech to a proposed relaxation of some administrative requirements of the estate duty law relating to lodgement of security and extensions of time for payment of duty. These requirements will be relaxed for the general body of estates, not only those of primary producers. I conclude by repeating that, in the Government's view, the proposed reliefs, combined with the relaxation of administrative requirements, will be a substantial step towards ensuring the retention of economic farm units by primary producers and their families.

I wish to deal with some of the sections of this Act. Within recent weeks the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for Tasmania has notified mining companies of the existence of a provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act and has requested that it be observed. This will mean that employees of mining companies on the west coast of Tasmania, as well as in all other parts of the State, will have to pay thousands of dollars in this financial year if the provision is enforced. It is a fact that the Act stipulates that, where an employee lives in a company house at a nominal rental, the difference between that rental and the figure more normally accepted as the true rental value of such a residence should be shown on the employee's income tax return as taxable income. I will quote section 26 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which accompanies the Bill. It reads: The assessable income of a taxpayer shall include(e) the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensation, benefits, bonuses and premiums allowed, given or granted to him in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him, whether so allowed, given or granted in money, goods, land, meals, sustenance, the use of premises or quarters or otherwise. The Deputy Commissioner has pointed out to the mining companies that this provision exists and has advised them when preparing group certificates to show, in addition to the wages and salaries paid, the value of all allowances or benefits given to employees in relation to their employment. He has pointed out that such allowances include not only money but also any allowances in",76,Estate Duty Reliefs For Primary Producers

Undoubtedly the person who Branch in respect of any house or houses. discovered ft is obvious that the tax squeeze is on, and I would like to know whether there is any truth in the prevailing strong rumour that the Taxation Branch in Tasmania has beaten the gun by notifying the mining companies in that State of this new direction to obtain more tax from the workers. It is common knowledge that instructions have been given that this direction is not to Australia, because it is the practice of mining companies in isolated areas to subJi this direction is applied to mining The 'Advocate' newspaper carried a very Every now and then a public servant conies how to squeeze some extra millions in income tax out of employees living in houses on subsidised rentals will get a pat on the back from Canberra. The number of new 'company towns' established in connection with Australia's new mineral ventures in recent years will mean a substantial sum in additional taxation. Nor are other new towns like those at Strathgordon and Gowrie Park likely to escape. But there are big dangers involved, not only because of the much wider implications of the tax provision concerned, but in the industrial repercussions which could follow. Trade unions whose members enjoy a benefit like housing on subsidised rentals and wbo must now pay excra tax because of the subsidy will obviously the operation of another provision-sectio n gress for higher pay to offset the tax increase. This is now an Australia-wide problem: Unless there is a solution, quickly, it could haye disastrous consequences-particularl y in Tasmania, f : magnets used to attract workers to isolated areas for employment in essential projects. The strict implementation to observe section 26E of the Income Tax Assessment Act fully can have only a very profound effect upon the stability of employment m such mining towns as Queenstown, Zeehan, feosebery, Williamsford, Renison Bell, Waratah, Luina and Savage River on the west coast of Tasmania, and these effects igjll undoubtedly spread and must influence employment in all the great mining ventures that have been undertaken, especially in Recent years on thc mainland of Australia. The mining companies associated with these towns have for years past seen the need to provide employees homes at low cost rentals as a basic requirement to maintain even modest levels of employment in all branches of the mining industry. The severe weather conditions and comparative isolation of these areas have been a continuing deterrent to many prospective employees and it has been largely due to the fringe benefits, such as low cost rentals, that persons have been prepared to live and work in this part of Tasmania. Stability of employment is the most important factor governing the future bf the west coast mining industry and its consequent contribution to the economy of this State and the nation. On the one hand, the Income Tax Assessment Act recognises this factor and provides for income tax deductions to individuals or firms to construct housing for the use of their employees in timber. I refer to section 124JA, to section 122 which relates to mining, and to section 54, which relates to primary production. These sections were inserted in the Income Tax Act out of the very real recognition of the difficulties of obtaining suitable accommodation for employees without such provisions. Surely it necessarily would follow that employers would be able to pass the benefits they gained from cheaper housing on to their employees by way of cheaper rents and in that way encourage married couples to go to these rather isolated areas to work. It tial tax for such people as opposed to those therefore seems highly absurd that the Comwho live in a cily because, in effect, the missioner of Taxation should now invoke city dweller gets financial advantages from 26E-to enable what appear, in the circumstances, to be exorbitant rentals to be charged, not allowing for the special diffiere subsidised housing has long been one of culties associated with employment in such areas as the west coast of Tasmania. Also what is being done runs counter to the logic of the existing zone allowance as it applies to the west coast of Tasmania. The present proposal of the Commissioner would cancel out the benefits of the zone allowace when, as I stated in the recent Budget debate, recognition of the claims for the west coast to be transferred to ZoneA is long overdue. I point out that a zone allowance is granted in recognition of the inclement weather, high living costs and high freight rates applicable in an area such as the west coast of Tasmania and by enforcing what appears to the Taxation Branch to be a fair rental of $9 a week, it will automatically wipe out any advantage which the wage earner obtains through living in an area gazetted as Zone B. I maintain that the Commissioner should either interpret the section that he now intends to implement in order to allow for the special circumstances that I have outlined or, if he feels that the Act does not allow for this discretion, the Government should amend section 26E to allow for this discretion. I have nothing but the greatest admiration for people who go into these rather isolated areas to work. I lived and worked as a school teacher on the west coast for the best part of 5 years and having lived and worked amongst those people I feel that I understand their problems. In most of the towns that I have mentioned, and in similar mining towns throughout Australia, there is usually but one employer for the great majority of workers. The wages that are offered might on paper appear to be high, but I point out that everything the employee touches and uses is taxable. The freight on his goods, the cost of food and clothing, the maintenance on his car, medical expenses and the cost of higher education, because of the necessity to send children to the cities for matriculation and university education, all are outgoings from which he cannot escape. I maintain that there should be a differenmany employers in (hat he can avail himself of discount on goods, cheaper food such as meat and groceries, and cheaper maintenance and television repairs because he has immediately available to him a vast club, as it were, from which he, through being a city dweller, can draw the advantages of his membership. I repeat again that, on the other hand, once the employee goes to the rather isolated mining towns the initial advantage which he gains on paper from the higher wages is soon eroded by the fact that everything he needs in the town is taxable. If this drift away from such places to the towns and the cities is to be stopped, then the Taxation Branch must rcognise that the worker is entitled to the benefits of such incentives as cheaper homes by the medium of television. housing which can be provided, and is provided, by the mining companies in order to retain their work force. I would strongly urge the Government to have another look at this matter. The Government knows full well that the export earnings from the recent mineral development in this country have been rising and we are lucky in that we have been able to cushion the falling revenue which we have been getting from rural exports in recent years. It is in the Government's interests to see that there is no upheaval or any change by which the mining community can be upset. In conclusion, I would point out that if the Government intends to persist with this measure, then it is going to be a very costly operation. Officers of the Taxation Branch will have to visit every house in every minfor the employee, but it is quickly eroded ing town and Hydro-electric Commission settlement and visit every farm in order to determine what is to be a fair rental. The company or employer concerned will be faced witb a tremendous bookkeeping job in calculating the figure on the basis of the taxable income for each individual employee, because by no strength of the imagination can the Branch set a rental of $9 a week in Hobart and say that this should be applicable to every home that will be subject to this provision throughout Tasable to come in and say to the mining mania and, similarly, throughout the Commonwealth. I appeal to the Federal Treasurer ( Mr housing settlement economically and say to McMahon) to take the most sensible view of this matter. He and his colleagues repeatedly have paid tribute to the benefits that the great mining exploration and development have brought to this country in recent years. The imagination and the pride of all Australians have been stirred by the progress we have seen taking place in this field in the building of new towns, such as Savage River and Luina-town s carved out of the heart of the rain forest. They have been duplicated over and over again in all types of climates. The construction people have faced tremendous difficulties, through isolation and difficult terrain. New towns have been springing up in northern and north western Australia. Some of us have seen this and marvelled at it on personal visits. For the great mass of Australians it has been brought into their This Government and the Australian people have proudly acknowledged the great contribution made by the mining companies in the development of this country. I ask the Treasurer: Is it fair now to move in on the companies and dictate to them what they should charge as a fair rental to their employees? They are only doing what is an accepted thing in all parts of the world where mining is carried on. In Scandinavia, the United States of America and Africa, companies offer homes to employees at a figure which may appear to be below that for comparable houses in a town in order to get men and their families to go there. As I have pointed out, however, this advantage on paper might appear attractive by the higher costs of riving that are always associated with living in these rather isolated areas. So again 1 appeal to the Treasurer to take the more sensible and realistic view and say that if the companies can afford to let these families have these homes at a reduced rent, then that is the concern of the company and not of the Taxation Commissioner. The Commissioner should not be companies: 'You are to charge your employees $9 a week for rent'. If the mining company is able to conduct its its employees: 'You can have a house for $2 or S3 a week' then I say to the Treasurer that this should be the prerogative of the mining company. I maintain that such a viewpoint is imperative in the interests and well-being of the mining communities scattered throughout this country. In conclusion, I again ask why we were singled out as a State and why the directive was issued only in Tasmania? I would like to know why this action was not taken in other parts of Australia such as northern Queensland and the Northern Territory and evidently will not be taken until after the forthcoming election? Dr MACKAY (Evans) [8.32]I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) on the speech he has made. I agree with the vast majority of the points that he has made. I do not think, however, that I could go quite so far as he did in his last few sentences when the honourable member asserted that the Commissioner shouid not have the right to determine or dictate, to use his word, the honourable member for McMillan( Mr rate of rental for the houses he described. I believe that the Commissioner does have a duty to determine what is in effect the emoluments and the benefits-financia l and comparable benefits-that are received by an employee for his labour. The value of the rental has long been established as one of the things which are properly taxable. Nevertheless I agree very much with his arguments regarding the effect of the overzealous implementation of this power in section 26 (E) in the case of isolated and far flung mining communities. I have personal experience of the difficulty in these days of over-full employment of obtaining any kind of permanence in the work force in remote mining areas. Only by the provision of houses suitable for families, and particularly for families rather than for single men, is it possible for a mining comchose wisely-wa s to induce the investing pany to get labour today. Even then the turnover is tremendous. One of the few things which can be held out as an incentive If offered income tax inducements and conto a young married couple with children not yet old enough to require city residence for schooling purposes, is that such a family may be able to save something because housing is provided by the company at a reasonably low figure. But this brings me immediately into the context of the other and larger subject that I want to discuss. I believe that the honourable member for Braddon was quite right when he said that this is something for the Government to determine rather than for the Government to sheet it home to the Commissioner. Throughout the whole process of the performance of the functions of the Taxation Department there is this increasing necessity for the exercise of discretion. I am one who believes that this is a sign of ill-thought-through legislation to pile into the lap of the public service the exercise of discretion in matters which ought to be more nicely determined in this place. I want to turn from this portion of the legislation which I believe does need to be redetermined and rephrased so that the results so aptly described by the honourable member opposite do not ensue. I would now like to refer to the subject that was discussed first by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and more recently by the Buchanan). I refer to this whole subject of income tax deductions as applying to investments in mining shares and stocks relating to the mining of oil and other minerals. Let us just make a resume of what has occurred which, 1 think, would go something like this: This Government determined that there was the necessity to stimulate oil and mineral exploration in Australia. We were a country that was becoming increasingly dependent upon the overseas supply of petroleum products. From defence, economic and many other reasons it became imperative that if oil did exist within our boundaries we should indeed bend every effort to its discovery and production. The way in which the Government chose to set about thisI think that events have proved that the Government public of Australia, the ordinary people of Australia, to lend a hand in the business. cessions in relation to funds contributed directly to exploration companies. When this was done the effect was immediately noticed. It became known overseas, in America and elsewhere, that these kinds of incentives were available, and overseas companies became interested in coming to Australia to explore. This scheme worked reasonably well, by and large, across the nation. But even some years ago there were cases which cropped up from time to time of persons who had subscribed perhaps large sums to companies they formed themselves or companies in which they had been concerned in the original flotation or the acquisition of leases and areas. They had substantial interests and held shares for longer than the periods that have been mentioned this evening. In some cases they held shares certainly for longer than 5 years. However, when these people came to sell their shares the argument was used that the shares had been acquired for the purpose of sale at a profit because it was a no-dividend situation. Even when the sale was a single one in effect, although in fact a large parcel had been placed with a broker who was told to dribble the shares out in small parcels so as not to upset the state of the market, the number of subtransactions within that major determination to sell was taken into account and the matter was taken as far as the High Court. So, even in cases involving just one particular stock which was held for a considerable period tax has been imposed because, I firmly believe, the sum involved was a very large one by ordinary standards. This brings me to the point that there is the necessity for discretion in the application of this legislation. There is a subjective deductions which virtually removed the factor that comes into this that was so well described by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports when he said that it was the intention at the time of the purchase of shares that had to be demonstrated, and it was this which determined whether the shares were acquired for resale or profitno matter how long the time interval before they were sold-o r whether they were genuine investments, namely capital transactions which would return some form of dividend or interest payment or something of the kind over the years. This is a subjective matter; it is something which lends itself to all kinds of interpretations. People with different backgrounds of information may find it necessary to make changes in their portfolios from time to time according to what would be the prudent management of their portfolios in the light of their own knowledge and experience. On the other hand, persons involved in new business activities might find it necessary to make changes. These could occur rapidly soon after the purchases in some cases. The Treasurer has pointed out that the great majority of cases meet a sympathetic hearing when an investigation is made following a challenge to the Commissioner's ruling. But I ask in terms of our duty as legislators whether this is a state of affairs which is desirable in such an important sector of our financial legislation. I admit that it has worked because during the years there has been an eminent sensibleness on the part of the Commissioner. There has been tacit acceptance of small transactions that form only a minute part or a very small percentage of the regular income of the person concerned. These have been winked at. But when the volume of transactions or the amount of money involved has reached a certain unstated percentage, then tax has at least been suggested and even attracted. So in practice it has worked reasonably well until recently, when the mining boom started. Then there were these smart Alecks who floated companies that had no assets in terms of properties to offer to the public. They had nothing other than the suggestion of managerial skill and perhaps technical skill in the management of the capital. They in turn attracted an income tax deduction under section 77A or section 77AA. In the hands of those who manipulated these flotations there were in addition double element of risk from these processes and it became possible for persons to make very large killings. I use that term as a description for a practice which 1 think is reasonable in this field. Obviously something had to give. There had to be a clamping down on this situation, it is true on the one hand that there was an answer, albeit a highly undesirable one in the fact that the plethora of new companies soon knocked the bottom out of the investment capacity of the Australian people and the market generally, and pnces began to tumble so that instead of coming on at a substantial premium new floats were coming on to the market at a discount. As soon as this situation emerged it became important to determine whether the amount of discount was over-arched by the taxation deduction and so all kinds of different calculations became necessary. But the enthusiasm for new flotations began to wane. Obviously the threat was still there that as soon as any upsurge in prices on the flock exchange occurred-as soon as i : became profitable to make a new flotation -the machinery was there to be exploited again. Obviously something had to be done 5 nd what has happened as a result has been lis move with regard particularly to section 82 of the Income Tax Act as it relates to share dealers. But again the situation is bedevilled because it is not quite clear who are and who are not share dealers. It is quite clear in nal subscription to an exploring company. the obvious cases of the persons who make their incomes irom dealing in shares. This is self-evident. But thc fear that has entered into the minds of the majority of persons who have had anything to do with investment in oil and mineral shares is that tliere is a grey area which is expanding. This is ihe area of the person who buys shares in oil and mineral companies that do not have immediate prospects of returning a dividend and so must be buying to sell at a capital gain profit. I use that expression deliberately and virtually disposed of the stock they to show how confused the situation is in terminology. The two should be mutually exclusive in taxation terminology. This is what is in the mind of the average man. He wants to do his bit of capital expenditure and be able to sell at a profit because he has made a shrewd assessment of the value or likely upsurge in interest in a particular area of investment. So these persons have in point of fact engaged in a business of buying and selling shares. Are they or are they not share dealers? Technically and traditionally the answer has been no. They have not been the kind of persons who themselves have sought to be declared dealers. They have not been the persons whom the Commissioner has sought so to declare. Nevertheless, the practice which appears to have developed over recent months has been to seek out all these transactions, particularly above a certain unstated level of activity, to see whether in terms of volume it would not be more appropriate for these persons to be classed as dealers. So you have the situation of uncertainty today. The proposal of the honourable member involve a large amount of money and could for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) was to be something that the Commissioner of make a capital gains tax applicable throughTaxation would want to look at even though out the whole area. He did not quite say it was technically only one transaction. this but this was the tenor of his remarks. Similarly, there could be a large number of I must admit that I agree with the majority small transactions which would make it of the things he said. On the other hand the inappropriate to act-to take the other honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan), assessing the situation as he saw it-h e had obviously given a great deal of thought to it-fel t that there was a number of other possibilities to avoid this blanket tax on all gains made from such transactions. One of his proposals, for instance, was that consideration should be given to the length of time a stock had been held, particularly a stock acquired by origiHe suggested that holding a share for 6 months might constitute evidence of its being a genuine investment rather than something that was bought to be sold at a profit. This is a very sensible suggestion but it still does not get over the possibility of large sums of money involved in thisvery large investments. The proposal would do away with one of the evils, if I may so describe it-on e of the malpractices anyway-of those who have floated companies have taken up for tax advantage even before the shares have been listed on the stock exchange and certainly before trading has begun through the 'second market'. These people have off-loaded their holding at no risk to themselves to what I would call the 'real investors', who pay for it at market value and receive no tax advantage as a result. Certainly it would overcome that particular anomaly but even then we still have the problem of the volume that would be permitted under this time rule. The honourable member suggested that if the shares were held for less than 6 months close scrutiny should be made of evidence produced that they were in fact genuine investments before tax was avoided. Another method of approaching the problem was to suggest that a certain number of transactions might be permitted before tax was attracted, but this again is open to all kinds of manipulation. I refer to the case which I mentioned earlier of a person holding a large number of one particular type of share and placing many of them in one large selling order. This could extreme. So perhaps the number of transactions is not altogether a good solution. The honourable member mentioned a third proposal which I admit has been closest to my own mind in trying to find an answer to this problem. That is that it may be best after all to limit the amount of advantage that could flow to any investor through section 77A or section 77AA, which will now become section 77D. This idea would provide limits to a certain stated percentage of a person's otherwise taxable income. 1 would suspect that in this way the legislation if over zealously-by the Deputy Commiswould immediately eliminate those persons who have, during the last 12 months, received the bulk of their income from such activities on the stock exchange. I think it would be clearer to everybody in the community if the limit were set at, say, 10% or 20% of the otherwise earned taxable income. I think this would be a reasonable limit that should be claimed as a tax advantage under the old sections 77A and 77AA of the Act and the proposed section 77D. I put those thoughts to the Government. I believe it is a job for the Government and not for the Commissioner of Taxation to examine the anomalies that exist under the present taxation legislation. It is abundantly clear that there is uncertainly and a feeling of depression in this field. The Government started out with high hopes of stimulating oil and mineral exploration and it had a great deal of success. I make the plea that the matter should not be left where it is now. We know that underwriters are prepared to underwrite genuine investments and new floats which have something to offer the community, although there is a degree of risk. These persons must be encouraged. At the same time, I believe that the ordinary Australian who wants to have the opportunity of playing just a small part in the great mineral boom in Australia should be permitted to do so. Ordinary citizens such as the postman and the milkman have come to me and, without any stimulation on my part, have disclosed that they have taken up a few shares in some company or another and have asked my opinion about their investment. The ordinary little man in the community feels that he now has a chance of making some money. I would think that from a national point of view it is much better for him to take a chance of making a few dollars out of such shares than gambling at the races or on poker machines. I believe that the Government should stimulate this type of speculative investment by offering and making secure the long standing taxation advantages. The situation at the moment is such thut the whole horizon is overcast with uncertainty because of certain activities which have been pursuedI believe justly, sioners of Taxation in an endeavour to come to grips with those who have made hogs of themselves by exploiting the situation. These as well as certain other things have still to be done. The honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) referred to section 26E of the Principal Act. Proposed sections 77c and 77D as well as proposed section 82 still require clearer definition by the Government. I trust this will speedily be done by the new Govern1 ment. spend at least 20 minutes on the matter raised by the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies). I am grateful to the honourable member for Evans (Dr Mackay) for his support. I am also grateful to the honourable member for Braddon for his comments. There is something very wrong indeed with the new directive which has been forwarded to the employers in the mining areas of Tasmania. When the document I have in my hand was delivered to these employers a few weeks ago by the the postman it was as though he delivered a time bomb. There are no half measures about this document; it is the most rigid interpretation of an Act of Parliament that has ever been supplied to an employer of labour. I shall read it to the House in due course because I want the terms of the document recorded in Hansard. The honourable member for Braddon represents an electorate which is on the west coast of Tasmania. Although it is an isolated area it is a rich mining area. Indeed, it is one of the richest areas in Australia. It will be severely affected by the new directive which has been issued by the Deputy Commissioner ot Taxation in Tasmania, Mr C. R. Woodhouse.

151,Mr Duthie,"My colleague interjectsThese are a mixture of incentives that are given to employees to bring them out into these isolated areas. The honourable member for Braddon and myself, who believe in touring our electorates regularly to meet the people and keep in touch with their problems, know the areas we are talking about nearly as well as if we had been born there because we have been through them so often. Rossarden and Storeys Creek, which are right up under Ben Lomond, one of Tasmania's snow-capped mountains, are in very cold and isolated areas. There is no bitumen road to these areas; just a winding and twisty road of about 14 miles off what we call the Fingal Highway. The people are living in the sight of snow all winter. The houses are very poor; the management admits this. It cannot afford to provide very expensive accommodation. There are not the sorts of homes that a person would bother to live in, in this sort of climate and in these conditions, if they were not right at the place where he worked. The rents are very low. The Commonwealth, through its taxation office in Hobart, is now to get stuck into these managements and force them to allow for $9 a week rental for these places, which would not be worth more than $2 or $2.50 a week anyway by any standard. The rent on some of these places will be lifted from nil which is what some tenants are now paying, up to $9. This will be a very heavy charge on the employees and on the managements. The interesting point about both Rossarden and Storeys Creek is that the technical staff are nearly all from outside Tasmania, and they have been brought to these isolated mining areas because of these incentives and these helpful conditions that the mining managements have given to them. This applies not only to the technical staff but also to the workers. question of fact, which must be determined in the Should the Taxation Branch rob the mining companies of the right to offer these inducements they will not be able to compete in a satisfactory way with the larger companies producing tin on the mainland because they will have to increase substantially the salaries of their technical staff and the wages of their hundreds of employees to make up for this taxation burden. Aberfoyle Holdings has put the matter before the Australian Mines and Metals Association so that that body can make an approach to the Federal Treasurer. It is also having a meeting in Hobart on 30th September to hear the report of a recent deputation by its industrial sub-committee to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Tasmania. Of course, this meeting has not yet taken place, but this debate is the best opportunity we have in this Federal Parliament to raise the matter of this time bomb that bas been issued to mine managements in Tasmania. BeforeI pass on to the document that was issued by the Taxation office in Hobart, I would like to stress again that the inducements that the mining companies can hand out are the key to obtaining sufficient employees in the isolated areas in which they operate. The workers have to contend with isolation, very rough weather and the tough working conditions typical of mining everywhere, right around the world. The poor roads into the mines and the poor amenities for people living in these areas are unfortunately common to mining towns everywhere. The document that was issued by Mr Woodhouse of the Taxation office in Hobart is a circular to group employers and is headed 'Income Tax. Value of Premises supplied to Employees.' I will not read every line of it, but I will read part of it to give an idea of what the Taxation office is driving at. It reads: 2. Section 26 (c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the assessable income of a taxpayer shall include the value to the taxpayer of all allowances or benefits given or granted to him in respect of any employment or services rendered by him, whether so allowed, given or granted in money, goods, land, meals, sustenance, the use of premises or quarters or otherwise. 3. Possibly the most common benefit of this nature is the right to occupy a residence or premises either free of charge or for a nominal rental. The question of what is the value to the taxpayer for the purposes of section 26 (e) is a light of the circumstances of the particular case. 4. Where, for example, a taxpayer is supplied with premises for the use of himseif and/or his family it is considered reasonable to accept that the value to the taxpayer would be equal to the rental which a private tenant might be expected to pay for the accommodation provided. 5. In cases where the employer charges rent for the accommodation provided, the figure to bc included in assessable income, will, of course, be limited to the amount, if any, by which the value to the taxpayer exceeds the amount charged as rent: e.g. if the value to tbe taxpayer is established as being $468 per annum That is $9 a weekand the rental charged by the employer is $312 per annum, then the amount to be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer would be $156. 6. Having regard to current values it is expected that, as a general rule, values in the vicinity of $468 per annum should be adopted where an employee is provided witb a residence. 7. It is realised that this value, if generally applied, might prove to be excessive in exceptional circumstances. The question arises as to what would constitute 'exceptional circumstances', and in this connection it is thought that these would include: (a) the existence of sub-standard, old or dilapidated premises in respect of which normal rental values could not be obtained in the locality; or (b) the existence of small premises which are unsuitable for occupation by a married man with a family and which could only be occupied by a single man. 1 pause here to comment on this last section of the document. He is admitting that in certain exceptional circumstances the houses may be so sub-standard, old or dilapidated that it would be unfair to the employee to charge him $9 a week rent. This is the only light in the darkness of this document and it is to bc hoped that if we cannot do anything to change it or to get it withdrawn, then when we start to implement it paragraph 7 (a) should be applied fairly, without discrimination and with consideration given to all the circumstances. Paragraph 8 of the document states: Conversely, of course, managers and similar senior employees, to whom the value of the benefit derived may be expected to be greater than $468, should return a higher figure. That is to say, if they are charged more than $9 a week they have to include that in their return. Paragraph 9 states: Employers are requested, unless otherwise agreed with this Department, to show a minimum value of $468 per annum on group certificates of employees provided with premises for the year ending 30th June 1970. That is in black and white. Paragraph 10 residence would be the same type of house states^ The group certificate of an employee charged to go two or three suburbs away to get rent for the use of a residence of a higher rental comparable accommodation. Also detailed provided for his use should indicate the net must be any other factors which may be amount to be returned by recording separately relevant and details of any other allowances the gross rental value of the property (i.e. a received, such as free use of telephone and minimum of $468) and the rental paid by the employee. Paragraph 11 states: In the exceptional case where an employee considers uiat the value of $468 is excessive, it will be open to him to demonstrate that, in the particular circumstances of his case, lower rental value would be appropriate. Any such request should be accompanied by a statement showing the following details: Under this paragraph the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation lists certain things in detail that must be done if the employee wants to get an exemption from this payment of $9 a week. They include a general description of the property, including the number of rooms and a description and the size of each room. Think of the work that will have to be put into this, as the honourable member for Braddon said, if this is to be policed properly by the Department. This will possibly involve going into every house in mining districts to check all the details. The details include descriptions of the age and location of the property and particulars of facilities provided, including hot water service, air conditioning and the like. I like the mention of air conditioning. This is usually provided through a hole in thc roof or sometimes through boards which do not fit or flooring that is falling to pieces. This is the sort of air conditioning that most of our tough mine workers in the tough mining areas have to put up with. The statement must also include details of the capital value, if known, and whether the premises are furnished or unfurnished. A man is not likely to be living in an unfurnished house. There would be at least a table and possibly a chair or a bed, and a stove. It certainly would not be unfurnished unless it were occupied by some escapee from justice who suddenly found an unfurnished house in which to live temporarily until he was caught up with. The statement must also include the amount of rent charged, if any, and the rental value of comparable residences in the locality. This is funny, because these are isolated areas. The only comparable in the same town. It would not be possible the supply of fuel and light, etc. A lot can come under tbe meaning of 'etc.' This is a dangerous word in any language. Under paragraph 11 the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation is saying to the employees: Tf you think that this is excessive, you apply to us for consideration, but you have to give us all these particulars.' Then the Branch would have to make checks in case an employee stated that the accommodation had 5 rooms when it had 6 rooms. It would have to determine whether the stated size of the rooms was wrong. Paragraph 12 of the document states: You will be aware that paragraph 12 of the directives from the Federal Treasurer ( Mr Notes for Guidance of Employers in relation McMahon). No wonder the Treasurer is not to Group Instalment Deduction Procedures states in the House tonight if he is responsible for that the value of premises or quarters provided this decision. If any of these mine managers for 'the purpose of computing instalment deduccatch up with the Treasurer during the elections shall be the amount fixed by any award, or where the value is not so fixed an amount of tion campaign he will be down the mine 50c per week. Paragraph 13 states: It must be emphasised that such an amount is for instalment deduction purposes only and has no relation to the amount to bo included as income in column 2 of the group certificate. The final paragraph, paragraph 15, states: Your co-operation in advising employees of the above matters and including relevant values on group certificates would be appreciated. Mr Woodhouse is a darned good bloke. I have had a lot to do with him. He is a considerate and very sympathetic Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. Many problems have been solved by communicating with him on the telephone. I think that we cannot speak too highly of the Deputy Commissioners of Taxation in all States. They are not people to be avoided or to run away from. If a person is prepared to put a case to them in a decent manner and is prepared to see them personally by appointment in their offices he will be absolutely amazed at the splendid treatment he will receive. Many a man, or woman for that matter will receive a pleasant surprise and will leave the office a far happier and brighter person than when he entered it -mor e revenue from the poor mine finish up broke. Commissioner of Taxation would let the look at the situation immediately and to situation go that far. He would leave a see whether an alteration can be made either person with sufficient money to get home. by introducing legislation in this Parliament This is my experience of these gentlemen or by a directive from the Commonwealth who are doing a wonderful job in adminisCommissioner of Taxation. By that means tering an Act of this Parliament. The solution to the problem is, as was suggested by the honourable member for Evans (Dr Mackay) and the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies), not with the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation but with this Government. The Act would have to be amended to allow employers of labour to give workers incentives to go to isolated areas to work. The Government will have to amend the Act. We cannot blame Deputy Commissioners of Taxation such as Mr Woodhouse. He is obviously acting under and there will be no way back. that the directive did not come from the Treasurer. He does not write every letter that is sent out. Fancy it not coming from the Treasurer. He is the big white chief of taxation. He is the Federal Treasurer. He helps to bring in legislation which determines taxation laws. It is up to the Federal Treasurer to look at this problem and to provide a satisfactory answer. Who gave the directive to Mr Woodhouse in Hobart to send out the document that I have read out in detail tonight? Who was responsible for the document being written in the way in which it was written? Was it Mr Woodhouse or was it somebody in Canberra-the Commissioner of Taxation himself? workers who are living in isolated towns. only to one State when they should be applied to the whole of Australia.

159,Mr Duthie,"He is after more moneythis discrimination could be stopped pending a study of the position by the Government. I think it is a matter of sumcient importance to be brought to the notice of the Parliament tonight. The honourable members for Braddon and Evans agree with me that this is a discriminatory provision which will have grave effects on the employment level throughout the mining districts of Tasmania. not my intention until about 5 minutes ago to enter this debate, when it was suggested that I should, but one or two matters have arisen about which I want to make some comment. Referring to the speeches by honourable members opposite I might say that there is one thing on which 1 would agree and there are others on which I would like to join issue. I thoroughly agree that we ought to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the men in the Taxation Branch of the Treasury, at any rate those men who are in the upper echelons who have over the years forged very good relationships with solicitors, tax agents and all those involved in official or non-official capacities, in ensuring that the taxation laws are carried out properly and efficiently. 1 must say that all the deputy commissioners of taxation with whom I have come in contact appeared to be very conscious of the need for good public relations and were at all times helpful. When one considers the number of discretions contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act and which are invested in the Commissioner and his delegates I think that this is most important. The Taxation Branch is now more willing than it formerly was to give an opinion on tbe effects of taxation on a proposed course of action whereas in the past there was an attitude-and I can well understand tbe reason for it-that opinions should not be expressed on hypothetical matters without a complete set of facts. Last week I addressed myself to problems of income tax legislation and I drew attention to one or two matters which I thought could be amended. I take the opportunity of correcting one or two errors of fact and opinion which I previously expressed. Firstly, in relation to the advocacy that the exempt taxable income should be raised from tbe present figure of $416 per annum to $1,000 per annum, I suggested that the limit had not been increased since 1954 or 1955. It has since been pointed out to me that in fact it was at a lower level at that time and it has only reached the level off $416 in more recent times, I think in 1961. Secondly, in putting the suggestion that the non-taxable income should be raised to an amount of $1,000 per annum, I mentioned that this would result in a loss of some $12m per annum. Criticism has fairly been made since I made that suggestion to the effect that it would be necessary to have some shading-in provision, so that there would not be a position where tax would not bc paid on $999 and approximately $50 would be paid on an income of $1,000 per annum, it would be necessary for some shading-in and the total revenue loss could be in the vicinity of $20m per annum. But I am still of the view that my basic argument could apply in that it would save the assessment of approximately 500,000 taxation returns for a loss of revenue which, if my other suggestions were adopted, could easily be taken up in a total review of the general tax scale itself. Honourable members opposite have this evening mentioned one or two things about which I would like to comment. The first refers to the taxableness, if I may use that term, of the surplus which arises from the sale of shares. In the last 2 or 3 years I suppose that we have had a good deal of publicity about this matter but I think it should be pointed out that the section in the Income Tax Assessment Act upon which the Commissioner of Taxation relies is a very old section indeed. It was said in this house tonight that the Commissioner sbould go easy on this body of taxpayers or that he must assess on the basis of the law as it is. If tbe Parliament thinks that this law-and I will explain in a moment what the law is-ough t to be changed, then it is up to the Parliament to change it. Quite frankly it is political nonsense for honourable members to come into this House in the last week of the present parliamentary session and suggest that the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) should take some action on this matter when what is needed to bring about a change is an amendment of the Act itself. Honourable members are well aware that this Parliament is now concluding its business and that all legislation which was",89,Income Tax Assessment Bill
160,Mr Garland (Curtin) 19.21],"It wasintended to be introduced during this session has long since been referred to the Parliament as has, indeed, the main part g£ Jhe Budget proposals, and there is no jSfactical way of making alterations to an ' Si1 a t t m s *ime. * do not believe that honourable members on the Opposition sjde really think that at this stage amendments of an Act could be made. In uttering those remarks I do not necessarily support the view that there should be a change or that there should not be a change in the taxation laws, but having regard to the way that the law stands at present, and as has been outlined by honourable members earlier this evening, if somebody buys shares, or anything else |<pr that matter, with the intention of making a profit, and if such a profit is made it is assessable income. That is the law as it exists. That is the law as it has existed for a very long time. I agree that there are uncertainties in determining that intention because the law as it exists relates to what the intention was in the mind of the taxpayer at the time he purchased the shares, business, land or whatever it was, rather than to an arbitrary cut-off period. Various suggestions have been made from time to time regarding changes of the taxation laws as they now exist. A suggestion put tonight in this House was to the following effect: Why do not we say that if someone has held an asset for 6 months it need not be taxed and can be classed as capital and therefore be non-assessable? Of course, the opposite side to that suggestion is that if it were held for less than 6 months it would be taxable. I want to come back to my original point. It is of no use to raise these matters at this stage. The Treasurer could not be expected to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation, or to take some executive action, to make this non-taxable income. That is the law and that is the way it has always been, subject only to development by case law, although the principle is now basically clear. But with the development of case law from time to time as various cases and circumstances involving this intention were considered, there is a great body of law, both in taxation boards of review and in the High Court of Australia, on these questions which any taxpayer can consult in order to understand his position. PerhapsI should also include potential taxpayers. I will go further and, though this stage of the session is not the time to pursue it, say that I rather support the view that a more arbitrary method of arriving at taxable profits could well be determined. I do not suggest that this would be easy, but I would have to advocate such a course because I believe that the taxation laws in general are far too complicated. It should be easier for taxpayers to know with more certainty what the law is and how they can conduct their business so as to be taxed or not taxed. I believe it is a good principle in all law that people should know precisely, how the law will affect them without having to go through the whole process to find out. A number of criticisms of the income tax law could be offered. In the list I raised the other night I mentioned one matter only by name and I would like to refer to it in a little more detail now. I will deal with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act as they refer to superannuation. I record, as has been recorded by many others already, that the sections in the Act dealing with superannuation are numerous, lengthy and sporadic. They are sections 6, 23 (j), 23 (jaa), 23 (ja), 23 Qb), 23F, 79, 82AAA to 82AAR, 83H and 121B to 121E. This is apart from the special provisions dealing with the superannuation funds of life insurance companies and special rates of tax under the Income Tax Act and thc Income Tax (Partnerships and Trusts) Act. This may sound frightening enough, but I can assure honourable members that a close reading of those sections leads to more confusion. It is exceedingly difficult to understand them. One would need to spend a great deal of time resolving the superannuation problems of a firm or fund or, as in my case, of a client who seeks advice. These matters have been before the House on many occasions and have been examined closely by officers of the Department. Yet the result of all that thinking and all that work is to leave us with a very complicated result and, as I mentioned with other matters, a considerable area of doubt. SoI come to the question I was propounding the other night and that is: Is all this complexity worth the trouble when basically our objective is simply to raise revenue to meet the expenditure of the Government? Tonight some honourable gentlemen on the other side said that the Treasurer should take action to ensure that people in remote areas, who benefit by renting houses owned by the company for which they work or who may receive other benefits in the nature of allowances for telephones and so on, shouid not have the value of such benefits treated as assessable income. They said that treating the benefits in this way was discouraging decentralisation and making it more difficult for the companies to employ labour. It is all very well to advance these arguments but the Commissioner of Taxation must carry out the law as it exists. The law is that such moneys received by virtue of the employment that these people undertake must be treated as assessable income. If this House considers that an allowance should be given to these people and that this income-that is what it is-shoul d not be assessed, the House should amend the Act that we are discussing now. If these matters have been raised before, they have not to my knowledge been raised with the vigour employed tonight. SoI think I can say with a certain amount of respect to thc honourable members opposite that this is really part of electioneering. It was refreshing the other evening to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) put in context the argument that has been advanced in recent weeks through the newspapers by Opposition members that taxes on the middle income groups should be reduced. He said that argument could not be considered in isolation. By inference he told his colleagues that it was not a proper matter to use for electioneering purposes and that there were larger questions relating to income tax to consider before picking out one item that might appeal to a certain sector of the community. I commend his approach and point out that from time to time reviews of the tax scale are necessary because of the inflationary tendency in our community and in every community in the world. Most highly industrialised Western countries have a progressive income tax scale and inflation together with rising salaries means that higher rates of tax are paid. Statistically, salaries rise day by day and month by month, and in this country they have risen remarkably in recent years. With these two influences, it is natural that rhe taxrates paid on rising incomes will increase. So it is necessary from time to time to review the tax rates. The Treasurer has promised that a review will take place and in fact it is now under way. I know that others have asked for various other aspects of income tax to be reviewed at the same time. But I would point out that it is all very well to say that some sections of income tax earners should be relieved of some of the taxes that they bear. Equally we have to consider at the same time how the revenue lost to the Government will be made up. It is not a full and honest argument to ask for a reduction without at the same time indicating how the lost revenue will be recouped. lt is true that the rate of taxationthe tax scale itself-ca n be varied in a number of ways. Indeed, in recent years, although we have not varied the slope of the income tax curve, taxes have been varied up and down by an increment of 2i% on a number of occasions. But what is contemplated, I understand, would be a complete redrawing of the rate scale. If, as a result of investigation, it is fell that a certain section of the community should be paying a lower rate, then clearly a larger amount has to be paid by other groups. I think it would be a pity if this issue should be used for party political propaganda purposes. It was notable in a newspaper article published, I think, last week that glaring headlines were used to mislead. What purported to be almost an official announcement was published to the effect that only those incomes of over $100 a week would receive any concession. I assume that that article and headline would have been printed purely with the view of attempting to denigrate the efforts of the Government to be fair to all. 1 use the word 'fair' because there has been an effort by this Government over many years-indeed , by all governmentsto try to place the burden of taxation as equitably as possible. Special consideration has been given as to where the burden of income tax should fall and on which categories it should fall. Of course, there are many other taxes besides income tax but it raises the vast amount of revenue for the country. There has been a survey throughout those years to determine the most equitable way to spread the load. We have seen the progressive introduction of a large number of deductions and other things to the Income Tax Assessment Act. They include concessional deductions and other deductions of, shall we say, an unusual nature for primary producers, such as the implementation of averaging clauses. Various methods have been devised, the most recent of them being in this Bill. There are other things such as the drought bonds scheme shortly to be implemented. But the growth of those deductions, plus tbe large number of amendments made to the Act, has meant that there is a need for an increasing sophistication of the law in order to prevent a great loss of revenue to the Treasury. Taxpayers have the advantage of a number of structures such as companies, partnerships and trusts which have been devised, in the main, although perhaps not entirely, to minimise income tax. All these movements-and they have been pretty technical all the time-hav e resulted in a very complicated tax structure. I again plead for some effort to be made to go back to first principles. I ask whether economy because it will encourage primary the complicated structure now arrived at is essential in order to raise the revenue of this country? In an attempt to be equitable have we not created for ourselves a great administrative burden? This structure has, perhaps, encouraged other undesirable developments in the community such as the employment, when our resources are already stretched, of a number of highly skilled people, both inside and outside the Public Service, and the registration of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of private and public companies, partnerships and trusts purely for the purpose of minimising income tax. I wonder whether, after very close consideration, it would be possible to eliminate a great deal' of this complexity even though it might be that the burden of tax would shift slightly between income groups or social groups within the community. However, at any rate I think it would save a lot of other problems which have arisen as a result of a structure which we have set up ourselves. This is not something that has been forced lation to which I have already referred. I upon us. It is a growth which we have developed. Surely the time is coming when we must give more and more thought to getting more value for the money that we spend. Certainly part of the money that we spend is tied up in the administration and policing of this law and activities on the part of businessmen to attempt to minimise the burden which they feel. As I said recently, businessmen feci that these funds could otherwise be reinvested in their own businesses. Of course that would be a net transference of public funds to the private sector. Such a simplification of the taxation system would require a complete redrawing of the tax scale and therefore the burden of taxation would shift. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, looking at the amendments, one could only commend the provision in the Bill to extend the deduction to primary producers for structural improvements. Formerly certain items were depreciated by 20% instead of being allowed as full deductions. Probably this will not make a great impact on the Treasury because of the averaging provisions under which the incomes of most primary producers are assessed. HoweverI think it will be of great benefit to primary producers and of assistance to Australia's producers to make provision for water and fodder conservation. Primary producers will have the knowledge that if they lay out a certain amount of money they will receive a tax deduction in the first year based on the whole amount and not merely 20%. Therefore they will face a reduced taxation burden commensurate with the expenditure for which formerly only part allowance was given. Surely that is the intention of this amendment. I support it. I think it will be of particular benefit to primary producers in areas which have experienced or are now experiencing the difficulties of drought. Likewise the amendment provided in clause 12 is fair. It is a principle of taxation that one should not be able to receive a double deduction for any line of expenditure. This surely is fair in every way. The fact that a share dealer has been able to obtain it is one of those anomalies that arise because of the complexity of the legisam more than happy to see the introduction of this element because of its basic reasonableness. repeat that I have no intention of bringing into my speech the emotion and feeling that was the pattern of the speech given by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr back 3 years. Garland). If the honourable member was pleased with this legislation I would hate to hear him speak if he was sad about it. I just mention that the legislation before us is a Bill to amend the law relating to income tax. This gives very wide scope for discussion. I mention this because I believe that I should take full advantage of the scope of the Bill. I was interested during the last week and the week before to hear a number of honourable members express grave concern because a number of share traders' accounts were being investigated to ascertain whether certain people who were able to traffic in shares had been evading their taxation responsibilities. The Treasurer ( Mr double the actual amount that was stated. I McMahon) in this House on 16th September in answer to a question said: . . . he has asked the Deputy Commissioners in Perth and Adelaide to discontinue their actions for the poor. Not only are the rates unjust; in having a general survey of the accounts of various people in brokers' offices. I pass no judgment on what they were doing and what they were not doing. But the fact is that the Taxation Commissioner evidently thought that certain people were evading their taxation responsibilities and he endeavoured to ascertain whether or not that was a fact. But the Treasurer has now indicated that this practice has been stopped. I see also that the newspapers gave great headlines to this matter. This interests me particularly because only a few months ago the garbage men in Sydney were asked to submit statements as to how much they were making out of the bottles they were collecting from their garbage trucks. I did not see any statement by the Treasurer that he would give up chasing garbage men around Sydney. However, when share traders who speculate in huge amounts are involved-supporter s of this Government no doubt-the Treasurer intervenes to say that his Department will discontinue that practice. It it is good enough to chase garbage men and bottle-ohs around Sydney for the few dollars they make out of bottles they collect, it is good enough to go into the share trading activities of those trafficking in shares to a huge extent in this country. Watson has advised me that they took the garbage men back 3 years to find out the few miserable dollars they made out of bottles that were collected from time to time. We find today Government supporters expressing great concern at the intrusion on the rights of the individual by the taxation officers investigating share trading. But not a word is said about the garbage men from whom the Taxation Branch is seeking to extract every penny, every dime and every cent. The Taxation Department gave those men no respite, and 1 presume the Department probably would not take their word for what they earned and would probably point out that under the tax laws of this country which are enforced by this Government there is one law for the rich and one not only have they been unchanged for years; not only does the burden of taxation bear most heavily on those who are unable to afford it; but in addition share traders are exempt from investigation, are evidently given protection and can make what they like out of their activities. But the people who were making a few shillings out of the bottles they collected were chased back over 3 years. What a tragic state of affairs. Is the Government so short of money that it has to chase garbage men for the bottles they collect? I would like the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Swartz), who is at the table, to tell us whether they have desisted in chasing garbage men around Sydney for their taxation returns? \ wonder whether the Taxation Commissioner has been brought into it. I did not hear any questions from the Liberal side on this matter. However, I know that my colleague from Watson( Mr Cope) and others on this side of the House have raised this matter with little avail from what I can see, except that the Government said that the law had to be enforced and the Government does not interfere with the Taxation Commissioner's activities. Therefore, I do not express any great concern and I will not stay awake at night",90,Income Tax Assessment Bill

163,Mr Daly,"The honourable member forworrying about people who have probably made thousands in tax-free share trading whilst the Government of the day is prepared to let the taxation investigators go right into all the pros and cons of what garbage men are making out of bottles. I do not intend to speak at any great length tonight. I just mention this on the eve of thc election for all Australians to hear. In taxation, as in other matters, there is one law for those who support the Government and another for those who the Government does not think supports it. There is one law for the rich and one for the poor. Tonight we saw this exemplified in the Treasurer's statement to this Parliament. We have seen this in the way in which he answers questions. I listened to some Government speakers on this matter. They were almost crying about the share traders. Why, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) was very concerned about this matter the other day. He expressed grave concern about this downtrodden section of society making a few millions out of share trading. We did not hear the honourable member for Swan rise in his place on behalf of the garbage men. He overlooked that. The taxation people probably carried out this treatment of garbage men right throughout the length and breadth of the country. Probably that would not worry the honourable member because from the look of him no-one in his electorate drinks. The point 1 make is that this matter deserves to be aired. This is why I raise this matter tonight not take the precaution of reading what in this Parliament. I wish to indicate the discrimination in social services and in taxation against sections of the community by this Government which has been in oflice for so long. However, I will be pleased Garland) I had to provide myself with two to announce to garbage men and everyone that there will be a change on 25th October. Justice will come to the taxation laws. People that are oppressed by them at present will be relieved of the onerous charges that are made under this Government's proposals. A new era will open up in the field of taxation under a Labor Government. This is a long time overdue. This change will apply to the middle income earners and to those people on the lower incomes. Those who cannot afford to pay will not be asked to pay, but those who can will naturally be called upon to accept their responsibilities. I mention that in passing to point out the discrimination of the Government, the injustice of the laws in many respects and the concern felt by some members on that side for those who can well look after themselves while garbage men are expected to pay tax on their bottle collections to make up for the taxation mat is evaded by people who ought to pay. not have spoken but for the fact that two points were brought up. One was in regard to rent allowances for cottages supplied by mining companies for their employees. Of course, the same principle applies right throughout the taxation field. Farm workers, bank clerks and others are expected to show in their income tax returns the value of the rent of the cottage or the residence in which they are living. This applies throughout Australia. It is fair and just, Having had experience of this myself, I would say that the value of the rental as assessed by the Taxation Department is most reasonable. In regard to what the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) had to say, I think there should be an inducement and encouragement for people to go and work in remote areas. But, of course, we must remember that we have a zone allowance that would apply to places in Tasmania and other places in remote areas in Western Australia. My friend the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) evidently did was in the Bill or he would not have put on tbe little exercise that we have just seen. When I heard his remarks in regard to the honourable member for Curtin( Mr handkerchiefs into which I could cry. IfI read from the second reading speech made that I will make the honourable member for Grayndler very happy. The Treasurer said: 1 turn now to the second major amendment proposed by the Bill. This amendment is designed to eliminate a feature of the mining investment incentives which, in the light of experience, the Government judges to be unnecessary. Provisions for tax deductions are being availed of by persons classed as 'share dealers' who then sell out to others who, in effect, supply the funds to finance exploration and development, but who do not receive any tax concession on their original payment.",94,Income Tax Assessment Bill
164,Mr Irwin (Mitchell) [9.58],1 would,95,Income Tax Assessment Bill
165,By The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) I Am Sure,"It is a general rule of the income tax law that an amount of expenditure is only deductible once. There are, however, some exceptions. One of these rgjates to capital subscriptions to petroleum exrdpration companies, which are deductible in full, and another to calls paid to mining and afforestation companies, which are deductible to the extent of one-third of the amount paid. A dealer in shares-that is, a person who, under long standing principles of the income tax law, is taxable on profits made on share transactions and receives deductions for losses made-is not only entitled to the special deductions for capital subscribed to mining companies, but the same amount is also deductible in determining a taxable profit, or deductible loss, made on a sale of the shares. Mr Clyde CameronI rise to order. Will you, Mr Deputy Speaker, request the honourable gentleman to hold his speech higher so that we may better hear him? substance in the point raised by the honourable member. For capital subscriptions to petroleum exploration and mining companies, the amount deductible can be as much as 200% of the expenditure actually made. For calls to general mining or afforestation companies the amount deductible can be 133:1% of the. actual outlay. As announced in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to amend the law so that the deduction available to share dealers cannot in the tax law particularly with regard to exceed the outlay actually made. By so doing, the expenses incurred by taxpayers in the earnprovision of funds on a continuing basis will not be significantly affected. I think that statement discounts what thc honourable member for Grayndler submitted. Australians have a reputation for being great gamblers but until recently very few people in this country were prepared to invest in mining companies and other industries where there was an element of risk. This attitude has been traditional since our experiences in gold mining in the 19th century. Any incentive which the Government can give to Australians to invest in these companies will be to the ultimate advantage of Australia. I applaud the Government's action. The provision with regard to farm improvements may be of some benefit. If thc farmer knew that he was to have a bumper year he would be induced to make improvements to his property, although the averaging provision would have an effect. The rate is higher when his income exceeds the average in any one year. Advantage will be gained only from the averaging provision. I commend the Bill. The honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) made pleas to the Government on behalf of persons engaged in mining in Tasmania. The cases submitted by the honourable members deserve the support of the Parliament. We should be mindful of the role played in the development of Australia by persons engaged in mining. These people, whether they work in the mine or around the mine, are producing the wealth of this nation. If this Government fails to heed the pleas of the honourable members it will be guilty of betraying men who are building the economy of this nation and helping to overcome our balance of payments problem. I do not want to pursue this argument to its logical conclusion, because telling speeches have already been made. It is now up to the Minister( Mr Gorton) to heed the representations that have been made and to pay regard to the contributions of the people who work in mines in remote parts of this Commonwealth. I would Hke to touch upon inequalities ing of income. Company directors who operate expense accounts are entitled to charge those expenses against taxation, and they do so. There is no argument about that. But the costs incurred by commuters who travel every day of the week to the big cities to engage in industry, work in offices or attend to their professional duties are not allowed as deductions for tax purposes. This is obviously a great injustice and should be corrected. There should not be one law for the company director or executive and another law for the commuting citizen. If it is good enough for the company director to charge his expenses against taxation it should be good enough for the commuter who is obliged to use public transport or, for that matter, private transport in travelling to his place of employment to do likewise. In making these remarks I think of the thousands of people who live on the Blue Mountains in my electorate who are obliged",95,Income Tax Assessment Bill

169,Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) And The Prime,"to travel to Sydney each day to work in industry or commerce. These people are victims of discrimination. To refuse to allow them to claim travelling expenses as a deduction for income tax purposes is unjust and unfair. It violates all principles of jusfo claim the expense as a taxation deductice. This matter should be investigated to see that there is fair play in the matter of expenses claimed as deductions for tax purposes. Miners are often obliged to buy a motor car in order to travel to work because satisfactory public transport is not available. thing that the Government should heed A motor car is essential if they are to get to the mine and win the coal or other commodity which is of such importance in the economic life of this country. These men have made approaches to the Treasury and to the Treasurer seeking some relief, but their claims to charge against taxation travelling expenses incurred in earning their living have been rejected. Most of the expenditure on the purchase of a motor car and on registration and running costs is for the purpose of earning a living. As a result their income in the industry has been reduced. The same argument can be applied to those engaged in the timber industry. These people have to travel great distances to the forests in which they cut the timber. It is notorious that there is a lack of accommodation close to where the trees are being fell'ed. As a result, the timber workers have to travel a fair distance from some country town or village into the forest to fell the trees to provide the timber that is so necessary for the comfort and security of our people. But the men who have to meet the expense of this travel are not allowed to claim it in the compilation of their income tax deductions. Although it is late in the day, the Government should consider the matter. I believe that a Labor government would accept responsibility for dealing justly in matters of this kind. I raise concessions which should be granted to this matter to emphasise the great injustice which has been perpetrated upon a large number of people over the years. Another group of people who are being One is the distance from the ordinary treated unjustly are those engaged in fire amenities that are enjoyed by the people fighting. This is a shameful, shocking and who live in more favoured areas. The scandalous state of affairs. These people point I wish to make, and it is probably are giving their time and energy to fighting the only point I wish to make, is in relation bush fires. Only last week I attended a to the concessions granted nowadays by field day at which twenty-three bush fire mining companies to their employees. These fighting brigades were in attendance. Comconcessions are granted to the employees petitions were conducted and notes were compared by these brigades in an endeavour to become more proficient in the saving of homes and lives. But when these men buy a helmet or a uniform they are not allowed tion. I repeat that these items are not authorised taxation deductions. I have made representations but my representations have been rejected. This shocking state of affairs should not be permitted. If there is one it is the pleas of these men who have performed such an outstanding public service over the years. No more notable service could be given to their fellow men. It is on record that men have died whilst fighting fires to protect the people of the area. Of course, the Government is not moved by their pleas. Canberra is too far away and those who advise the Government are too remote from such problems. I close with another thought. The Government makes a contribution towards national fitness, which is important to the nation. But what is the position in regard to those clubs which are engaged in sporting activities? For instance, rowing clubs have to provide the shells and oars. Is any taxation concession granted for the provision of this equipment? No, it is not. Taxation is imposed on the very equipment that is used by nationalfitnessorganisations to build up the fitness of the citizens of Australia. These are examples of the scandalous record of a Government which is unwanted in this country. The sooner it is defeated the better. agree with most of the comments made by the honourable members for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), Braddon( Mr Davies) and Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) in regard to taxation people in the mining industry. It is almost invariable that mining discoveries are made in isolated areas. Of course, there are certain penalties associated with isolated areas.",96,Income Tax Assessment Bill
170,Mr Katter (Kennedy) [10.13],"Ito encourage them to settle in and become permanent members of the community. Most mining communities have a reputation for the transience of their workers. The workers come to the area and make quick money before getting out. The companies try to make the workers and their families content with becoming permanent members of the community. In order to achieve this certain concessions are made available to tbe workers by the companies. One concession I have in mind is the concession granted by the major company in my electorate, Mount Isa Mines Ltd, of free air travel once every 2 years to the capital city the set-up and will become permanent of Brisbane for a man and his family. Because of the tax on this benefit the concession is reduced quite considerably. I would say that this matter should be looked at very closely by the Treasurer ( Mr member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) for the McMahon). except the strings applied by the Commissioner of Taxation. One has the spectacle of a good part of the concession being lost to taxation. As the honourable member for Macquarie pointed out, miners have to use safety helmets, boots and other apparel of this nature but these items are not allowable as taxation deductions. I believe that they should be allowable. Tremendous mining activity is going on in my electorate. Other activities are emerging around Cloncurry and Mount Isa as well as the Mount Isa mines. There is also the ever-increasing coal development in the central west of Queensland at Blackwater and places like that. I would hope that the operators of these developments will continue to offer increased concessions to employees in order to entice them to these areas and then influence them into becoming permanent citizens. I believe that the Taxation Branch has a role to play if these people are to settle in these areas and become permanent citizens. I believe that they should receive some encouragement. The other matter I would like to mention does not relate precisely to taxation. At present we have the situation of communities bursting at the seams and snowballing. I believe that there should be some very precise planning. An important element in this regard is taxation. But the matter goes further than that. One cannot plan and develop under the normal formula a mining town that is bursting at the seams. In 10 years time such a town may have a population of 5,000. There are many rapidly developing mining towns, particularly in my own electorate. Therefore, I believe that the local authorities as well as the State and Federal governments should watch closely the development of these areas, particularly the health and education aspects. They should plan so that these facilities are adequately provided for. In this way one will have workers who are happy with citizens of the area. [10.18]I am obliged to the honourable excellent case he has made out against the Government. It is quite noticeable that whenever supporters of the Australian Country Party have an opportunity to snipe at the Government, particularly the do so. Once again we have an example of a supporter of the Country Party making snide shots at the Treasurer because he has failed to give proper attention to a certain matter. In this instance it is the needs of the Mount Isa miners. The honourable member for Kennedy is quite right in his criticism. What will the Mount Isa miners do about the matter? Will they return the honourable member at the forthcoming election so that he will again be able to come here and support the very Government which has neglected them in the way that the honourable member has so eloquently described tonight? If they have any brains they will vote against those who support the Government which is perpetrating these anomalies in the taxation laws and will elect somebody who is pledged to a Party which will remove the anomalies of which they complain. I appreciate that the honourable member has not had much experience, but I think that, without realising what he said, he has Mr KatterI realise exactly what I said. I do not need any guidance from a King William Street expert. that the honourable member knows what he said because the people in the electorate",97,Income Tax Assessment Bill

175,Mr Clyde Cameroni Am Pleased,"of Kennedy have been told that they should vote against somebody who supports the sort of Government which goes on ignoring the just needs of the people in the electorate, particularly those who live in the Mount Isa area. The honourable member for Kennedy made his point quite well and I support him in what he had to say. However there is another point I want to raise. I think we have reached the time when we should look carefully at the taxation allowances in respect of machinery purchased for mechanising the building industry. Year after year we look at the building statistics and we find that the rate of building is not keeping up with the current demand, let alone taking care of the backlog. The reason why this is so is because the building industry in Australia is so poorly equipped. It is not properly mechanised. It has not taken full advantage of the mechanisation that is available to it if it were in a position to become more highly mechanised. I am told by people in the brick making industry, by people in the cement industry, by people in the roof tile industry and by people in other industries basic to the building industry that one of the reasons for this is that when they purchase machinery they are not allowed to write it off at a rate that makes it attractive to introduce machinery to the industry. The fanners are able to write off the cost of a silo to store the wheat which the Government has not been able to sell and which through its own lack of interest and apathy wefindmounting up all over the country. If it is right that they should be able to write off the cost of a silo in 1 year, surely in a country that needs more houses so badly-and which we will never get unless we «et more basic materials-the first 4 thing we ought to be doing is to extend to the building industry the right to write off the cost of mechanising the basic materials section of the building industry. That is all I want to say except that since and in the management of their operations. we are reaching the end of the Parliament The companies will also benefit from the I want to compliment you, Mr Deputy amendments in that the amount declared Speaker, on the able manner in which you for the benefit of shareholders under have presided over the Parliament during Section 77D will not reduce the companies' this session.

In view of the fact that the time has gone a little beyond that at which we originally expected we wouldfinishtbis BillI will refrain from making a number of comments on this measure because we have a couple of amendments to move in the Committee stage. But I must refer very briefly to one or two of the comments that have been made, particularly by the honourable members for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), Braddon( Mr Davies) and Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti). Whilst the matters they raised were of great interest and certainly were raised with great sincerity, they had little reference to the measure that is before the House. Whilst we have noted the comments which have been made, I am afraid that they cannot be accepted in the context of the Bill that we are discussing at the present time. I want to refer to the Bill itself. Much has been said about profits on the sale of shares and double taxation deductions, but very little has been said about the major amendment proposed by this Bill, that is, the amalgamation of Sections 77A and 77AA into a new Section 77D. That has been done to meet the present circumstances of a number of exploration companies that are engaged or wish to engage in both oil and other mineral exploration and mining. The amendment will undoubtedly assist those companies both in the raising of risk capital",98,Income Tax Assessment Bill
176,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Cope),,99,Income Tax Assessment Bill
177,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rFinally, 1 wish to refer to the major amendment that was made to the income tax law last year which both widened the scope of allowable expenditure for mining companies and which also clarified and brought up to date many of the capital expenditure provisions. It is also interesting to note that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and the honourable member for McMillan( Mr water conservation facilities the cost of Buchanan) raised a number of questions under this measure which really referred to Section 26 (a) of the income tax law. While most of their speeches were devoted to this aspect of the income tax law, they had no relationship whatsoever to the Bill presently before the House, but we have certainly noted the comments which they have made. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill for Civil Aviation and Minister assisting the Treasurer) [10.26]I refer to clause 6, which reads: Section 75 of the Principal Act is amended(a) by omitting paragraph (h) of sub-section (1.) and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:"" (h) the construction of(i) structural improvements for the purpose of conserving water for use in carrying on primary production on the Iand (including dams, earth tanks, underground tanks, concrete tanks and stands for tanks); or (ii) irrigation channels or similar improvements for the purpose of conveying water for such use;""; (b) by omitting from paragraph (j) of sub-section (1.) the word ""or"" (last occurring); (c) by inserting after paragraph (k) of subsection (1.) the following word and paragraph:""; or 0) the construction on the land ot buildings or other structural improvements for the purpose of storing foodstuffs for use in the feeding of animals in the course of carrying on primary production on the land,""; and (d) by omitting from sub-section (2.) the words ""under paragraph (g), (ga), (gb), (h), (i), (j) quite obvious from the answer that was or (k) of the last preceding sub-section"" and inserting in their stead the words ""under paragraph (g), (ga), (gb), (h), (i), (j), (k) or (1) of the last preceding sub-section"". I move: Add the following words after sub-paragraph til) of proposed new paragraph (h):-"" , including the sinking of bores or wells for water for such use '. 1 The amendment relates to paragraph (a) of clause 6 concerning the insertion of a new paragraph (h) in section 75 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The purpose of the new paragraph is to extend the scope of which is wholly tax-deductible by primary producers in the year of incurrence. In its old form the paragraph specifically referred to the cost of sinking bores or wells. This reference was dropped in the amended paragraph and, although it is considered that, in technical terms, the new paragraph would, like the old, cover the cost of such expenditure, the Government has decided, in the light of representations it has received, that it would make the position clearer to primary producers if the specific reference to the sinking of bores or wells were restored. The amendment I propose will, accordingly, restore the specific reference to the sinking of bores or wells. I move: In paragraph (c). omit 'storing foodstuffs for use in the feeding of animals', insert 'the storage of grain, hay or fodder'. The amendment relates to paragraph (c) of clause 6 concerning the insertion of a new paragraph-paragrap h (1)-in section 75 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. As it now stands, the proposed new paragraph (1) of section 75 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will mean that the cost of installing facilities for on-farm conservation of fodder will be deductible in full in the year in which it is incurred. The Government has decided that it would be appropriate to extend the 100% deduction to all on-farm facilities for storing grain, hay or fodder. I commend these amendments to the Committee. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) [10.28]I would like to speak briefly on these two amendments. The first amendment is one with which everybody will agree. There is some difficulty of interpretation of section 75 with respect to the actual sinking of bores. However, I think it is a good amendment. But I believe that the second amendment will set a dangerous precedent. It is given by the Minister for Trade and Indusasked by a member of the Country Party",99,Income Tax Assessment Bill
178,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,Minister,100,Income Tax Assessment Bill
179,Try ( Mr Mcewen) In Response To A Question,"that he was under the impression, as many others were, that the 100% deduction for structures for the storing of foodstuffs or grain applied to storages for grain which was to be later moved to Wheat Board silos. The prime purpose of tbe amendment is to provide 100% depreciation for structures to store foodstuffs for use in the feeding of animals on the farm. This is in line with other depreciation allowances but the precedent that is being established here could lead to abuse. For example, there is nothing to stop a dealer who classes himself as a primary producer from establishing large structures on a property for the express and migrants. With regard to the first group purpose of storing fodder for sale. This is not the purpose of the Act. In the present circumstances a primary producer who builds a structure to store wheat which is subsequently sold to the Wheat Board is entitled to this deduction. Under the crisis conditions in the wheat industry today there may be some excuse for this, but as I say these amendments provide a loophole for anybody who wants to set himself up as a dealer with the prime objective of selling either fodder, grain or hay which is not to be used on the property. In other words, there is nothing to stop him buying produce from elsewhere for resale. This is not in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This is not what the Act was designed for nor is it the purpose of this Bill. 1 should think that the Taxation to the funds for the period of unemployBranch would have to look closely at this amendment otherwise it could be subject to abuse. for Civil Aviation and Minister assisting the Treasurer) [10.32]-This amendment refers solely to a farm. The reference is to farm facilities for storing grain, hay and fodder. Perhaps a must unusual circumstance might arise, as the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) cuggested, but generally 99% of the cases to be covered by the amendment would be genuine cases.

Bill-by leave-presente d by Dr Forbes, and read a first time. Second Reading Dr FORBES (Barker-Minister for Health) [10.36]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before the House provides machinery by which special groups of people in need may receive adequate medical and hospital insurance benefits. The people who will be assisted by this Bill fall into two groups-thos e on low incomes the Bill provides machinery whereby people on low incomes may have adequate insurance cover under the national health scheme without the burden of paying contributions normally necessary to secure the benefits available under the scheme. These people on low incomes fall into two categories: Firstly, people in receipt of unemployment, sickness or special benefit under the Social Services Act 1947-1969, and secondly, families whose means are within prescribed limits. Those eligible for unemployment, sickness or special benefit and who are already members of a medical or hospital benefits fund, may continue membership without the need to pay any further contributions ment or sickness and for 4 weeks after the unemployment or sickness ceases. Claims for benefits in respect of medical or hospital expenses during the period of assistance will be paid by the funds in the normal way. The funds will claim on the Commonweallh, not only for the Commonwealth benefit as provided under the existing law, but also for the fund benefits paid. Similar provisions will apply to persons who join funds during the period of unemployment or sickness except that the benefits will not be available in respect of medical or hospital expenses during a waiting period of the first fortnight. This period is considered necessary to prevent undue abuse of the arrangements. Special beneficiaries under the scheme are those who, although not qualified to receive unemployment or sickness benefits, are unable to earn a sufficient livelihood, by reason of age, physical or mental disability or domestic circumstances, and to",100,Income Tax Assessment Bill
180,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,Minister,101,National Health Bill 1969
181,Bill (On Motion By Mr Swartz),"by leavewhom the Director-General of Social Services has granted a special benefit. It is estimated that there are in Australia approximately 30,000 unemployment and sickness beneficiaries at any one time. Assistance under the Bill is available for medical and hospital expenses incurred after 1st January 1970 and the fund benefits which are the subject of reimbursement are those available under approved scales of benefits. The approved scales will be, for medical benefits, the highest table of fund benefits available and, for hospital benefits, insurance problems which are not necesthe table providing cover for the public ward hospital charge in the State concerned. The medical benefits available will be limited so as not to exceed 90% of the medical account in accordance with the principle of the present scheme. For low income families, where the head of the family is of pensionable age, assessment of eligibility is on the same basis as that for age pension purposes. That is, the assessment takes into consideration both property and income and is therefore consistent with age pension assessment. A family is eligible for benefits if, on this basis, the means as assessed does not exceed $2,028 per annum. That amount is the annual equivalent of $39 per week. For younger families, where the head of the family is not of pensionable age, assistance is available if the weekly cash income does not exceed $39 without regard to property. The ceiling of $39 provided by the Bill approximates the average minimum wage payable under the Commonwealth awards in the various States. Assessments of income and means levels of beneficiaries will be reviewed from time to time and in cases where income has moved above the ceiling, the contributions to funds will continue to be waived for a further 4 weeks after notification of the withdrawal of the assistance. The levels of benefit available are the same as for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and there is no waiting period for those who, on becoming eligible under the scheme, are not already insured. Those eligible are persons who qualify under the income or means test, who have at least one dependant and who are not enrolled in the pensioner medical service. It has been estimated that about 100,000 families comprising nearly 300,000 people will be eligible for the assistance now being made available under the Bill to low income families. With regard to migrants, the Bill provides cover under the national health scheme for medical or hospital expenses which are incurred within 2 months of entry into Australia. This cover is available even if the migrant has not joined an organisation at the time when the expense was incurred. Migrants in the first few weeks of their arrival in Australia have health sarily financial ones. In the short term, migrants, especially those from non-English speaking countries, are faced with a bewildering number of problems in adapting to our ways of life. This has been noted particularly in the matter of health insurance, and, despite assistance and guidance in many directions by Immigration officials before, during and after migration, many migrants fail to insure quickly enough to avoid the burden of medical expenses in the early period after arrival. Many migrants, of course, do insure promptly. However, individuals who suffer illness can be faced withfinancialhardship if they are not insured. The Bill therefore has been drafted to provide a breathing space for these people by ensuring cover during the period of 2 months after arrival. Migrants who incur medical or hospital expenses during that period may, on joining a benefit fund, claim for normal benefits in respect of those expenses. The fund which pays the benefits will then claim reimbursement from the Commonwealth for the benefits so paid. The Bill provides for the benefits to be available notwithstanding that the migrant was not a member of a fund when the illness occurred. Migrants who insure themselves in thc breathing space afforded by this legislation will also be covered in respect of claims for medical and hospital expenses incurred after the expiration of the 2-months period thus ensuring continous cover. Benefits available are at the same level ns under the other measures contained in the Bill, that is, the highest medical tables and the public ward hospital tables. The benefits are available to all migrants on first permanent entry into Australia and operate in respect of illnesses after Ist January 1970. It is estimated that the measures will cost approximately §8.1m jn a full year. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. Generic Prescribing-Commonwealt h Serum Laboratories-Northern IrelandReturned Services League-Commonwealt h Police Investigation-Road SafetyRepatriation-Valedictor y Motion (by Mr Erwin) proposed: That the House (lo now adjourn. Dr EVERINGHAM (Capricornia) [10.43] -Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to comment on generic prescribing, a matter which has been raised before in this House. This means prescribing a drug by its generic name. 'Generic' of course literally means categorised or classified. A drug's generic name is its official name in any official list double blind cross-over trial. of chemical substances such as the British Pharmacopoea. The generic or official name oxytetracycline is a Loch Ness monster of a word which should have been shortened to something like oxtetcyn. There is no excuse for generic names exceeding three syllables, and one of the strongest reasons for avoiding their use is the increasments. His point will then be proved if it ing demand on doctors who have to hold these polysyllabic lexical monstrosities in their heads and write them down repeatedly, often in a tearing hurry, because there is a shortage of doctors in most areas and in most varieties of practice in Australia. There is a good case, as I have remarked before in this House, for a central drug authority in Australia. One of the jobs of such an authority could well be the compiling of names for official drugs just as streamlined as the patented trade names so dear to the heart of the honourable member for Bowman (Dr Gibbs). I want to take issue with the honourable member who has argued for trade name prescribing. Certainly Terramycin is more romantic in derivation and streamlined than the alternative oxytetracycline. But the argument he used is a rather shallow one. If BP criteria for drug purity and effectiveness are inadequate, then it is time we looked for something better. Anyone who has heard the honourable member for Bowman speak on this subject could be pardoned for concluding that he would rather be guided by the big drug firms on matters of drug standardisation than by any statutory body. This is quite consistent with his doctrinaire anti-Socialist, pro-monopoly philosophy. It is claimed that Terramycin produces higher blood levels of oxytetracycline than so-called generic oxytetracycline; that is, a cheaper brand which the chemist will supply unless there is a brand indication in the prescription. This may well be so. The evidence produced by the honourable member for Bowman is not, however, scientific evidence. To be valid it would need to be a double blind trial. That is to say, the opposing brands would have to be produced in a form indistinguishable from each other to botli those who take them and those who assess clinically the effectiveness of the drug. The persons who are the subjects of thc experiment must be statistically matched and then the drugs alternated between the groups. This is known as a The experiment referred to by the honourable member for Bowman may have been such, but the evidence he gave was not to that effect. In any case, the findings may be quite valid. They may be quite capable of being repeated in other experihas not already been proved. He said that he could give other examples but I would be surprised if the list he can produce based on scientific criteria will exceed a handful of drugs. His conclusion that trade name prescribing should be allowed is also valid only so long as the official standards of drug potency remain inadequate and inferior to those of private drug interests. There is no good reason in the wide world why they should be if the statutory authority concerned is doing its job. It may not be necessary to specify the average blood level reached or the peak blood level reached in a large number of a specified type of population. In fact it is highly unlikely that this method is used by the Pfizer corporation or any other firm which claims its product is superior to its generic competitors. A common explanation given for this superiority is a micronisation of drug particles, or to put it in the vernacular of the television commercials, the drug may be microfined. The smaller particles, obtained sometimes by a filtering process, dissolve and absorb more readily and so may reach higher blood peaks, which are more effective, but this effectiveness will be to some slight extent offset by quicker excretion of the drug which of course normally accompanies the higher and earlier blood peaks. Other advantages may depend on thc shape or wetability of the particles of the active ingredient or other factors which can be measured far more simply than by using human guinea pigs or real guinea pigs. They may be additives concerned in drug effectiveness, and to use another television advertisement, beloved of the petrol companies, for example, the alcohol vehicle which preserves atropine methonitrate, which has the trade name Eumydrin, or the drug probenecid, which has the trade name Benemid, which is taken with penicillin or separately to delay excretion of penicillin and so keep up its blood levels. If such an additive is the reason for the advantage of the trade name product, then the additive itself should take its place in the official list, as ethyl alcohol much truth and basis in his argument as and probenecid have done. Thc drug firms who have spent so freely in recent years and months to convince the medical profession that they should jealously guard their right to trade name prescribing are very often the holders of patents and supply the coarser grades of the drug to smaller operation. It is then a very easy matter to set up an experiment such as the one quoted by the honourable member, knowing with certainty in advance that their product is micronised. That is, they have passed it through a filter and passed off the coarser fraction of the product to their competitors. They do not, of course, do this at a loss. Their gross profit margin is therefore higher than that of their customer competitors and this so richly rewards the cost of their research that they spend about one-quarter of the manufacturing costs on promotion of sales and another quarter goes in dividends, according to a survey of the twenty-two largest producers in the United States a few years ago. A report of the survey was published in the British Medical Journal. I again appeal to the Government to set up a national drug authority to save the continual conflicts between State drug laws, but above all to free the Commonwealth seems to have caught an infectious disease Serum Laboratories Commission from the from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr unfair restrictions placed on it. This is in contrast to the freedom of private drug interests to enter any field of drug production. A Labor government will not shackle this efficient, pioneering research and manufacturing drug firm to the production of biological products only. There was a case for this when tbe Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission was set up, because biological preparations at that time were mainly perishable and were bard to obtain overseas. There is no longer a case for it, except the doctrinaire, anti-Socialist attitude that private enterprise must be best even if this must be proved by putting Government restrictions on public enterprise. Dr GIBBS (Bowman) [10.52] -The honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) did not do me the courtesy of advising me that he intended to attack me or my remarks tonight. However, it is very easy to refute his arguments. There is as there was in recent statements he made. One was that the present Queensland Government could not achieve power after many years of Australian Labor Party rule until it adopted as its electoral policy the preservation of the free hospital system, wbich it still vigorously defends. That is a completely untrue statement. The Country Party-Liberal Government in Queensland came to power when the Australian Labor Party in Queensland split asunder because of doctrinaire differences. These differences still exist within the ranks of the Parly at the Federal level. There is as much truth in his argument tonight as tbere was in his statement that tbe free hospital scheme in Queensland was bitterly opposed by the predecessors of the present Minister for Health. One of the strongest protagonists of this scheme was the present Minister's only predecessor, the late Dr Winston Noble, a man whom T personally knew very well. He was extremely keen on the free hospital system in Queensland. Indeed he was so keen that he offered his services in an expert capacity to the Queensland Labor Government when he was a member of the Opposition. Of course, his offer was rejected. The honourable member for Capricornia Whitlam), the infection being the argumentum ad hominem. The principle of this is: 'Do not let us spend too much time on the argument as to fact. Let us attack the man. Let us have a go at some of his attitudes or general viewpoints.' They will fill in time in this way but will not get to the basis of the argument. This is what the honourable member for Capricornia did tonight. His argument tonight is an argument that is espoused by most Socialists in Australia but not so much by their colleagues in Great Britain, because they have learned by experience. In this argument he tacitly admitted that there were differences between drugs of the same broad chemical composition. I will use the drug that he mentioned, oxytetracycline. It does not worry me what its name is. Terramycin has not sounded a particularly romantic name to me, but I have always recognised that the firm that manufactured it is of high probity and produces a highly effective drug. That is why I prescribe it. I do not prescribe it very often but when I do I prescribe Terramycin by name. I know it is highly effective and I can be sure of its action. The honourable member nevertheless admitted that there were differences between various groups of the same drug. He suggested that this might be due to additives or different forms of the drug, and he is certainly right. He challenges me to take other examples. There are thousands of other examples. I will bet that in the days when thyroid BP was being prescribed, he was prescribing, if he was a good doctor, thyroid BP.BW because it was by far the superior brand. But what about Chloromycetinchlorampheticol. If he does not admit that there were many instances when the drug, though chemically the same, was virtually unabsorbed, he has not been reading his literature very well. There are many other examples, but I will take a simpler one. Let me take the case of an enteric coated druga drug that is coated so that it will not dissolve until it without allowing it a considerable time in has passed through the stomach. There are many enteric coatings, though the substance inside might be absolutely identical. However, because the same skill is not used in applying the enteric coating or because an inferior type of enteric coating is used, the preparation goes right through the body without being absorbed at all. The patient might just as well never have taken the drug. Though they might both, for example, have sodium salicylate, the patient might just as well never have swallowed one as compared with the other. I challenge the honourable member to deny this. This is why a doctor who is not blinded by his doctrinaire socialism will prescribe the drug manufactured by a firm that he knows and trusts. He will prescribe the drug that he knows from his own experience and from reading literature is more effective than another, because it is so prepared that it will be absorbed. The honourable member also made some remarks about making a double blind test. This is all very well, but it is utterly irrelevant to the set of circumstances that I spoke about. I spoke about blood levels. There is no gainsaying the fact that, if a certain identifiable blood level of a drug is achieved and if that level is higher than the blood level of a similar drug prepared by another firm, that is prima facie evidence that the preparation that produces the higher blood level is more effective. The question of double blind tests does not enter into it at all. I made the point that one preparation of oxytetracycline is absorbed far better than another is. This is conclusively proved simply by stating that the blood level of the first was higher than the blood level of the others. Talking about double blind tests in this context is just talking nonsense. Then the honourable member went on to say that if one firm discovers an additive that produces a better effect on a patient-that is, it is more effective-the additive should be included in the generic nomenclature. The name of this additive should be disclosed. The honourable member loses sight of this fact. He will find that the incentive to do research is lost when the discovery is taken away from the firm that has done very expensive research which to reap the financial benefits of its discovery. This is proven conclusively by the fact-thi s is not denied by anyonethat when we take away the profit motive we take away the incentive to produce new drugs. Russia, for example, has produced practically no drugs of any worthwhile effectiveness. It has certainly broken no new ground in the field of pharmaceuticals since the Revolution. It has made a nil contribution in this field. It invented a few antibiotics, but they were all variants of an existing highly toxic type of antibiotic. In the field of chemo-therapy, it has produced nothing. In fact, no socialist state has produced anything new. This is universally admitted. Only firms that have the incentive of profits that they will gain from their research are engaged in productive research. It is the incentive that the human being requires to venture forth. If he is denied incentive he stagnates. It is the same with drug companies. In fact drug firms are particularly fine examples of this. This is recognised by the British Socialist Government. During the course of one of my investigations into the British health scheme I had a great deal of discussion with the person who controls drug pricing. He admitted that this was a fact and that the British Socialist Government had recognised it by giving firms who produced a new drug a preferential rate of costs for a number of years so that they could recoup the cost of their research. This was done in an endeavour to induce them to continue their research. I have only a few moments left to deal with the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia about the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The Laboratories are doing an excellent job in their present field. A Labor government would want the Laboratories to parasitise on the discoveries of drug firms: to produce the drugs in Australia and possibly undercut them. At least it would want preferential treatment for the Laboratories and would therefore drive out those firms in Australia which are doing a magnificent job for us by producing drugs for export, certainly to Asia, and are employing scientists who previously worked abroad. The research work of those drug companies has attracted our scientists to return to Australia. They are employed in the manufacture of very high quality drugs. The companies are greatly benefiting our economy and the people of Australia. If the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are to be unleased into this field and away from their own private field, this action certainly will discourage further drug firms from coming to Australia, and this will be to the detriment of our people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and honourable members for allowing ine the opportunity to speak in this House tonight. I thought I had finished making speeches in this place 2 weeks ago when I made my swan song. As one who realises that friends must part I was prepared to leave it at that. However since then everybody I have met has asked me what 1 intend to do in retirement. Retirement is something I had never worried about. I was invited to join an association working for the people of Northern Ireland. Honourable members may laugh. However if it was Russia or any other country all honourable mcmbers would be prepared to speak to them, as did the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton). Five weeks ago I saw thousands of people coine from Northern Ireland to Southern Ireland for protection. Their homes had been burnt and shot at. People had fired from cars passing by. In1 week 5,000 homes were burnt. Thousands of people have left Northern Ireland and have gone all over the world. Some of them are in Australia today. Other homeless people have been taken in and given protection. In Sydney we have started a body known as the Northern Ireland Interdenominational Distress Organisation. Two of the patrons of this body are His Eminence Cardinal Sir Norman Thomas Gilroy and the Right Reverend F. O. Hulme-Moir, Bishop Coadjutor of Sydney. Those two gentlemen would not have put their names lightly to something that was not genuine. It is my duty to tell people wherever I go from now until 2nd October-that will be Thursday week-that there will be a public meeting at the Sydney Town Hall on that dale. The Organisation has received the sum of $2,300 at present by way of donations from good people. However that is not enough. Therefore we hope and trust that more money will be coming in. Mr Clyde Cameron-What was the date of that meeting? held on 2nd October. Do not get it confused with the night on which the Labor Party opens its campaign. I understand that our campaign will be opened the night before. This public meeting will he hei'd in the Sydney Town Hall at S p.m. and all are welcome.

I am sorry to say it is not living up to the tradition of Labour. What has been happening in Northern Ireland can be called nothing but murder. Eight people were shot during one day and night. This sort of thing is continuing. The English Chancellor of the Exchequer provides £Stg300m a year to keep the H million people of Northern Ireland going. The Prime Minister of England said the other day that those subscriptions would have to be withdrawn if certain people in Northern Ireland did not agree with what he had been trying to do. The Labour Government in England also has condemned out of hand Bernadette Devlin, the girl member for Bogside-Mid-Ulste r if you like-and has told her that she belongs to the Castro regime, whoever Castro is. However she has told them, in her own language, that if they want peace in Ireland they should go and make peace. To Bernadette Devlin's credit, during the first 2 days that she was in Parliament she said it was wrong to say that she was against people in the north of Ireland who are President: Dr M.

The people of Northern Ireland want only a portion of that money in. order to carry on. There are half a million people without guns, ammunition or anything else while the English Government is buying guns and ammunition for the remaining 1 million people. Honourable members might ask whether I have any proof of this. There is proof enough that the £Stg300m is being poured into that country and it is not given to the 500,000 people I am referring to. A representative from Northern Ireland is always present at Commonwealth conferences which we attend. I met the representative for Northern Ireland at a conference I attended 2 years ago. I said to that gentleman: 'There are four Lords present today and for the Lord's sake do something about the north of Ireland. Do not let it become a second Rhodesia in the near future.'

The clubs are maintained by purely voluntary effort by a dedicated band of RSL officers and instructors in various interests and sports. They give a tremendous amount of their leisure time and money to guide these young people along the way of democracy, freedom and liberty. I pay a tribute to tbem. Some of the RSL clubs in my electorate of Barton do not have accommodation for youth activities such as the clubs at Ramsgate and Brighton-le-Sands have. In these cases they give practical assistance to other youth activities in their areas. For example, the Brighton-le-Sands RSL club built and dedicated a superb playing field complex opposite the public school in that suburb. It is available to all youth in the area and has a superb running track, football field, basketball courts, tennis courts and changing facilities. It is thefinestsporting arena in my area. It was paid for by the Brighton-le-Sands RSL so that the youth in the area could engage in clean, healthy activities and grow in body, mind and spirit.

Ten minutes is not long enough in which to put a case which is of a very serious nature. However, I want to refer to the case of Mrs Jacqueline Patterson who died last year and whose family and she herself were subject to a lot of trouble and harassment by the Commonwealth police and the Attorney-General's Department. Let me say that I have written about eight letters to the Attorney-General( Mr Bowen) but I have never received an answer to one of them. I have not even received an acknowledgment. I told the Attorney-General that I was speaking tonight but he is not here.

When she arrived home she was very upset and should have had some compassion. When remained that way for 2 days, as we can testify. she died her case was called on in court and The police were trying to force her to admit that the facts became known but it was months she was taking morphine. However, my wife is after her death before any information dead and cannot testify, as the Commonwealth Pohce well know. As a matter of fact all the evidence shows here. I have all the depositions from the that this unfortunate woman, who was 32 coroner's inquiry. I have copies of the years of age, was allergic to morphine. She summonses served on her. She was charged could not use it. The drugs register was on four counts that she: countersigned by a senior nurse and by a doctor. But this evidence was not accepted did, by the Commonwealth Police or by the lently and in breach of her duty make a false entry Attorney-General's Department. I took the matter up first with the Department of Health, whose officers were very co-operative and understanding. But once the matter got into the hands of a couple of flat feet like Sergeant Fox they decided that they would force her to admit what they wanted her to admit. This poor woman came to see me 2 days before she died. She was pursued in 1966, then for 2 years nothing was done. Ultimately she was charged and at the Williamstown court in Victoria she was committed for trial. When I saw her 2 days before she died-sh e died the day before she was due to appear in courtI thought that she was very distraught and highly emotional. She was a woman with an unfortunate medical history. She had had many operations but she was always cheerful, as her father told Constable Smith of the Commonwealth Police. He said: I have read my wife's statement. It is true and letter which he wrote to me the woman's correct. I have only to add that I have never husband said: known anyone to go through the hell and torment of one doctor after another, with illnesses that no-one could find a cure for, and still be able to himself told Mr Bowen that she was innocent the smile and be cheerful to the end.

I have a mass of evidence contrary to section 72 (a) of the Crimes Act 1914-1966, being a Commonwealth officer, frauduin a book, to wit she did write the name 'B. Grayson' in the drugs register at the casualty section of the Government Aircraft Factory. She was a trained nurse. When the police 2 years later spoke to the doctor in charge of the casualty section it was difficult for him to remember the name of the person concerned. Anything this unfortunate woman did to release drugs in the discharge of her duty was countersigned by the senior nurse and by the doctor. Tn my opinion the Attorney-General's Department acted very badly and very viciously in pursuing this woman as it did. I would not under any circumstances believe the evidence of Sergeant Fox on the documents I have perused. I think that in his ultimate reply to me 8 or 9 months after this woman died the Attorney-General was covering up for his Department. It is disgraceful that the Commonwealth Police should be able to do the things they did in this case and possibly in others. (Extension of time granted). In a Her parents and I are under no illusions. If God disregard the evidence, accuse a dead girl and deprive her of a defence is not as interested in She had no intention of committing suicide. What the officers were trying to get her to admit was that she stole this small amount of morphine to give to somebody else. She would not make that admission. She said that she did aot steal it. There was no evidence that she stole it. Sergeant Fox went to her home. She said that he called for her at 10.30 a.m. and took ber home at 3 p.m. He broke it down to H hours. Somebody was not telling the truth and I believe the woman rather than the sergeant. She said that she wanted to telephone her parents and a lawyer but that she was not allowed to leave the room-no t even to go to the toilet. She said tha she had nothing to eat during the period. All the letters that I wrote to the husband of the woman say that she was Attorney-General about this case were unjustly treated. They want to clear her unanswered. Ultimately I got a letter from reputation. They do not want to leave the the Attorney-General in which he defended matter as it is at present. I shall be glad his officers.

The Department of Civil Aviation has established an enviable record in safety. RecentlyI wrote to all Ministers for Transport in Australia concerning the problem and 1 received replies from some of them. Not all the replies were satisfactory. One of the Ministers for Transport wrote to me in the following terms: I have no doubt that Mr Sinclair will raise your letter and its contents at the next meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council to be held in Adelaide next February for consideration by the Commonwealth and State Transport Member Ministers. Another 1,000 Australian lives will be lost by then. February is a long way ahead and so many lives are being lost on our roads. In company with some other honourable Another reply I received from a Minister for members, I was privileged to see a demonTransport was in the following terms: I can assure you that these matters are recently.

It is my opinion that advertising that cars can quickly accelerate to 40 m.p.h. does nothing to help road safety and, as you so rightly point out, a car can never be made safe to travel at 100 m.p.h. in our road systems. I do not regard the replies I received as being particularly satisfactory. However, there is one bright spot on the horizon. I refer to the development of the simulator it.

He is now, at this moment, in the kidney ward of the Sydney Hospital, apart from urgent admissions to smaller hospitals on the far south coast, which are not equipped for his condition. Please keep pn fighting on his behalf and try to do not know how soldiers treat soldiers, help. Best wishes, That letter is from his wife. Subsequently I received a letter from him in which he said that his wife was so distressed that she took certain action which caused her very grave illness: He went on: She has second and third degree burns to her back and arms and it is likely that she will be in hospital for quite some time but it is also almost certain that she may not return to this life here of isolation, poverty and worry. I returned homo by ambulance last Friday night from Sydney Hospital apparently not fully recovered, as I was passing blood through the night and an examination by a Nowra doctor of repute it is suggested that I be sent back to Sydney Hospital, but at this stage I will have to stand by the two boys still at high school. I brought to your notice some time ago two of our problems here are (1) lack of skilled medical attention and (2) the extremely high cost of basic foodstuffs. Please keep in touch with me. From the correspondence that was supplied to me it is apparent that this man is well known to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) and that the Minister at some stage had been friendly with the family or had known them in army days and knew the children well. The Minister was good enough to show me the files on this case, and I went through them. One thing impressed me. Any benefit of the doubt was always given against the ex-serviceman. Right through the files it is said that when he enlisted he had this sinus trouble but did not admit it. Evidently he had it, but he was a fellow who gave up a good business to enlist. All through it is said that his condition may be one of the general conditions that occur. Blindness can occur from this. All the time we see the phrase: It could*, 'It could', It could'. I said to the officer who was with the Minister when I spoke to him: 'Don't you ever give the soldier the benefit of the doubt in a case like this?' Every time there was any doubt it was found against him. The fact of the matter is that he is totally blind and is living in poverty on an invalid pension. The tragic circumstances of his case are contained in a very big file, and I think the circumstances of his case would appeal to even the most hard hearted citizen in the community. For my part, I cannot help but be convinced that some of the repatriation boards want cleaning up lock, stock and barrel. I think the people who sit on those boards are case hardened. I but I think the boards might be improved by putting a couple of civilians on them. They do not get case hardened on these questions. In cases like this, where only a few dollars are involved, they go into all the elements of doubt. I repeat in this Parliament what I have said before. I think the Repatriation Commission is taking it out on this soldier because it has something against him. He is fighting for his rights, and it will not give him the justice to which he is entitled. The other day the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) paid the fare to England of one of Prince Charles's school mates as a gesture of goodwill. If the Government can afford to spend money that way, why the devil can it not afford to give to an ex-serviceman a pension if his circumstances are such that there is an element of doubt? It is all very well to say that these things can be glossed over. Anyone seeing this man would be horrified at his condition. The business he gave away for £400 to enlist has changed hands since because of the change of times for around about £40,000. He is now desperate and in poverty. Someone from the Government side should take a good look at these repatriation boards because I am far from satisfied with them. If the treatment that I have exemplified in this case is indicative of what is being handed out, it is nearly time that something were done about it. I listened to the honourable member for Barton( Mr mentary Standing Committee on Public Arthur) tonight when he said that the Returned Services League tells soldiers not to apply for pensions unless they are sure of getting them. I give this advice: TeU the RSL to change its policy and advise all soldiers to put in for a pension because whether their cases are good, bad or indifferent, with some of these repatriation boards they have no chance of getting a pension. This man has been told to have an operation to remove both of his eyes, but he cannot get a pension of a few bob a week. The difference between a military pension and an invalid pension for his wife and children would not represent much in a Budget of the magnitude that we have to consider. I know that ex-service members opposite probably get cases like this. I suggest that the Minister look at this matter again. When I interviewed him and the officer of the Repatriation Commission they more or less gave me to understand that if certain evidence were produced the case would be reviewed, possibly favourably. That evidence has gone in but the matter is back where it started. This treatment of an ex-serviceman is a public scandal. There is no justification for it. It is something that the Minister should investigate in fairness to the person concerned and, I think, in fairness to the Government's reputation of standing by the rights of ex-servicemen who have given much and sacrificed a lot and who are entitled to justice and security, not poverty as in this case. I probably will not get an opportunity to speak on this matter again. The man, because of his condition, may well be dead before anything is done but I brought this matter before the Parliament tonight because I felt a great responsibility to do so. been inspired to speak as a result of the garded as important it is equally important remarks of the honourable member for that this grave social problem should be Lalor( Mr Lee) who referred to road accidents and the need for greater'training of drivers. This is a matter in which the Parliaments of the States and the Commonwealth must interest themselves to a greater extent. Road accidents represent a grave social problem. In recent times the ParliaWorks, of which I am a member, has had to investigate Commonwealth rehabilitation centres. Recently it recommended, and the Government approved, work involving considerable expenditure at the Commonwealth rehabilitation centre in Perth. Recently, too, it investigated another Commonwealth rehabilitation centre in Melbourne. The Committee inspects the sites of these centres and it is tragic to see the number of people who are being trained to take up other professions because they are not able to resume their normal professions as a result of physical handicaps sustained, in many instances, in road accidents. WhilstI appreciate what the honourable member for Lalor said, I should have thought that his speech would have been richer had he urged greater use of television in educating drivers. His speech was sincere, but this was an omission on his part. He is a member of what all members opposite claim to be is a free enterprise government that denounces the Socialist tendencies of the Australian Labor Party. Of course, it would be difficult to get private enterprise television stations to allocate time to advertising the need for persons to drive more safely. If we examine the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board we find that the major newspapers and big businesses own most of the shares in television stations. Honourable members cannot deny this fact. To get television stations to emphasise the need for safe driving would probably need a government subsidy. honourable member for Lalor says. We know that under the legislation controlling radio broadcasting and television there is an obligation for a specified time to be made available weekly for religious broad-",113,Northern Ireland Inter Denominational Distress Organisation N S W Branch

194,Mr Jamesi Appreciate What The,"given the same time so that the need to drive properly on our roads may be emphasised. Recently we have seen the introduction of breathalyser tests, but these have not reduced road accidents at all. I can never be enthusiastic about such tests. I always say to audiences that I address on this subject that I think that the police authorities should be empowered to give blood and alcohol tests to drivers who are involved in accidents in which a person suffers actual bodily harm. Many people can drive cars in perfect safety even after having consumed sufficient alcohol to render them punishable under the present breathalyser tests. If a person is involved in a collision and actual bodily harm is caused to another person the police authorities should have the right to give him a blood and alcohol test. The other day I read in some of the correspondence that honourable members get that by the year 1980 one in every three persons will have been involved in a serious road accident by the time he reaches the age of 45 years. This is a problem that is being investigated by experts throughout the world. It is a serious problem in the United States of America and Canada which have a greater number of cars per head of population than most countries. It is a problem that politicians must tackle. It is a problem that society must tackle. When society tackles the problem, its political representatives tackle it. I reiterate that television stations should be requested to devote an hour a week, even if the time is spread over a number of days, to emphasising the need for safe driving. If necessary preacher yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, you the Government should subsidise the television stations. If this were done I believe that government expenditure on Commonwealth rehabilitation centres could be reduced. I hope that the Parliament will consider and that people will talk about the submissions of the honourable member for Lalor and myself. People are being maimed on our roads. If a breadwinner is killed a pension is paid to his surviving wife. If we were to avert one accident the television time would be worthwhile. I believe that the number of deaths would be minimised, so obviating the need to pay widows' pensions to those persons whose husbands have died. I believe that breadwinners would be persuaded to drive safely. In conclusion I want to say that since coming to this Parliament I have read some of the writings of that great lawyer in the United States of America, Clarence Darrow, who is now dead. In his writings he had this to say: We provide in a capitalist society the means of committing further crime and then we punish the evil doers for committing the crime. How true it was then and how true it is today. The people of Australia are on the brink of extending drinking hours in hotels to Sundays. On the other hand we are fighting with the problem of the drinking driver who is maiming himself and others on the roads. How true Darrow's remarks are. We induce people to commit a crime and then we punish them for committing it. That is the very thing that a capitalist society does. The big businesses want to make more profits for their shareholders by opening hotels on Sundays, and if this comes about then we will need to have more police on the roads to curtail serious accidents. As a must appreciate the sincerity of my remarks and agree that they are factual. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.2 a.m. (Thursday).

National Service (Question No. 1774) Dr. J. F. Calms asked the Acting Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) How many young men are known to have refused to register for national service and have (a) been charged with an offence related to their refusal and (b) not been charged with any offence. (2) How many young men have refused to register for national service in the form or manner required by his Department, but have notified his Department of their identity and address and that they have a conscientious objection to military service. (3) Is such action regarded as a refusal or failure to register; if so, on what grounds. honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Section 48 of the National Service Act provides that it is an offence for 'a person who being required to register under this Act(a) fails so to register; or (b) while the liability continues, remains unregistered under this Act.' Section 13 of the National Service Act provides the circumstances in which a person who is required to register shall be deemed to be registered under the Act. Persons who are liable to register and fail to do so at the required time thus render themselves liable to prosecution. All cases of apparent default including refusal to comply with the requirements of fhe Act are investigated to determine a person's liability to register and whether a prima facie case which warrants prosecution exists. Records are not maintained of cases cleared of default nor are the reasons for failure to register or late registration classified. As at the 31st August, 1969, 784 persons had been prosecuted for failure to register and 91 cases were pending. Aboriginals: Employment (Question No. 1782) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: How many of the 5,118 Aborigines who registered for employment during the 12 months to 28th June 1968 were found employment with (a) State and (b) Commonwealth Departments, and what was the number found in each Department. able member's question is as follows: Commonwealth Employment Service records do not distinguish between registrants for employment on the basis of race, and thus there are no statistics compiled on this basis. The special survey of Aborigines registered for employment which yielded the figure quoted by the honourable member, was possible only because District Omcers were notified in advance that for the purpose of the survey they would be required to identify Aboriginal registrants. Registrants' cards were later returned to normal registers without special identification. At this point of time it is not possible to provide the detailed information asked for; however, it is estimated that more than 800 Aborigines were found employment in Government departments, Commonwealth and State. Aboriginals: Employment (Question No. 1783) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Was the number of 103 Aborigines who registered for employment at Port Hedland during the 12 months to 28th June 1968, the total number of Aborigines who applied. (2) If not, how many did apply but were not registered, and why wen; they not registered. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Yes, insofar as it was possible to identify the particular persons as Aborigines for the purpose of the survey. Aboriginals: Employment (Qnestion No. 1784) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: How many of the 103 Aboriginesregisteredfor employment at Port Hedland during the twelve months to 28th June 1968, were found employment with (a) State and (b) Commonwealth Departments, and what was the number found in each Department. member's question is as follows: As explained in my answer to Question No. 1782, it is not possible to give precisefiguresin answer to this question. However, it is known that at least fifty of the 103 Aborigines referred to were placed with State Government Departments operating in the area.

(2) Are the facilities adequate, if not, what is intended to make them adequate. member's question is as follows: (1) There is no Commonwealth Employment Service representation at any of the towns listed. The State Department of Native Welfare has omcers stationed at Broome, Derby, Wyndham and Hall's Creek, and the towns of Onslow, Roebourne and Fitzroy Crossing are visited regularly by field staff of that Department. Aborigines in these and other remote areas are assisted in making application for employment or unemployment benefit by officers of the State Department who maintain close liaison with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Liaison on employment matters is also maintained between the Commonwealth Employment Service and police omcers. (2) In order to improve the service now being provided consideration is at present being given to creating additional positions so that greater attention can be given to the employment needs of persons in more centres of the North-West. Pre-school Education: Expenditure by States (Question No. 1681) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: . (1) Why do the Statistician and the Commonwealth Grants Commission fail to publish comparative State expenditure on pre-school education. (2) What does each State spend on it. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Commonwealth Statistician and the Commonwealth Grants Commission advise that, Number of matter Money Lenders and Consumer Protection Amendments of Uniform Compames Acts in the statistics of State expenditure on social services published by them, it has been necessary to restrict the dissection of expenditure on education to several broad headings. The accounts published by the States contain insufficient detail in an appropriate and comparable form to enable any further breakdown to be made. In particular, it has not proved possible to separate out figures of expenditure on pre-school education. Significant differences between the States in the method of providing pre-school education services have added to the problem. I am advised by the Grants Commission that further details of expenditure on education have been sought from the States but not all of them have been able to supply thefiguresrequested. Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Question No. 1646) Mr Whitlam asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Where and when have there been meetings of the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General since his answer to me on 10 October 1968 (Hansard, page 1902).

(4) Is there more clinical evidence of (a) 10 1942 to 1963 physical, (b) mental or (c) moral damage among 15 1942 to 1943 users of (i) alcohol and (ii) tobacco than among 21 1944 comparable numbers of users of Cannabis and its 170 1908 to 1941 derivatives. 4,100 1941 to 1959 (5) Will he take such prompt steps as are available to bim. to reconcile the conflict between laws 8 1942 controlling (a) Cannabis and its derivatives and (b) alcohol and tobacco. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Customs Act 1901-1969 prohibits the possession of and trafficking in prohibited imports. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations prohibit absolutely the importation of Cannabis. The Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 contains proarea Tenure visions on manufacture, as defined by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, of drugs, but does not cover the production or preparation of Cannabis or Cannabis resin from the Cannabis 6. 25 years lease to 28.6.75 plant.

209,Dr Forbes,"The answer to the honourQueenslandStock Routes and Rural Lands Protection Acts Health Acts South AustraliaDangerous Drugs Act Western AustraliaPoisons Act Police Act TasmaniaDangerous Dntgs Act. Similar provisions in relation to Commonwealth Territories are contained in: Australian Capital TerritoryNoxious Weeds Ordinance 1921-1966 Public Health (Prohibited Drugs) Ordinance 1957-1966 Northern TerritoryProhibited Drags Ordinance 1963-1969. (3) The World Health Organization together with many other medical authorities including the United Kingdom Inter-dcpartmental Committee on Drug Addiction, holds the opinion that Cannabis bas practically no therapeutic use and virtually no value in modern medicine. The latest report of the World Health Organization strongly reaffirmed opinions expressed in previous reports that Cannabis was a drug of dependence, producing public health and social problems, and that its control should be continued. (4) Investigations on the pharmacological effects of Cannabis are at present being conducted in various countries under the auspices of the World Health Organization. Until these studies are completed no conclusive answer can be given to the question of tbe drug's effects. Dr Dale Cameron, head of the World Health Organization Drug Dependence Unit, at a press conference in January of this year, reiterated that it was not possible to compare the effects of Cannabis with those of alcohol. (5) The World Health Organization, with the support of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, was instrumental in the drafting of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. Australia, as a signatory to that Convention has implemented its provisions by the enactment of the Narcotic Drugs Acl 1967. By operation of Article4 of the Convention. Australia has agreed to "". . . limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of. trade in. use and possession of drugs"". Cannabis is specified as a narcotic drag in Schedule1 to the Convention. The National Health and Medical Research Council through its committees makes recommendations from time to time on a wide range of matters concerning public health, including the use of tobacco and alcohol. This Government, together with thc Governments of the various States, has always been willing to consider these recommendations and bring in legislation where that has seemed the proper course to follow following major, general categories: Aboriginals: Trust Funds (Question No. 1497) Mr Cross asked the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) What trust funds does his office administer on behalf of Aborigines. (2) What is the purpose of each fund. (3) When was each fund established. (4) What amounts have been spent from each fund in the current financial year and what amounts remain unexpended. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account. (2) The purpose of the Trust Account is to provide a source of payments for the advancement of Aboriginal citizens: (a) To the States for programmes approved by the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs and the Treasurer in relation to housing, education, health and other welfare matters agreed by them; (b) To the Department of the Interior for programmes relating to internal Territories approved by the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs and the Treasurer in relation to housing, education, health and other welfare matters agreed by them; (c) To an account in the name of the Treasurer in the Commonwealth Development Bank to be referred to as the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises which will be administered in accordance with procedures agreed between the Treasurer and the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs.

Having examined children under 5 years of age on five settlements he concentrated on a selected group showing growth retardation and did blood ascorbic acid estimates on children in two of the five settlements. In children exhibiting growth retardation there was evidence of deficiency of several factors including iron, folic acid, ascorbic acid together with a low calorific intake. Blood ascorbic acid levels were found to be well below average in many of the children on the two settlements on which the test was performed, hi spite of this, clinical scurvy was detected in only five cases which represented less than 1% of the age group. While I am myself impressed with the views of Dr Kalokerinos I emphasise that this is a medical question in which a lay opinion should carry little weight in comparison with the opinions of qualified medical men. I have asked for these opinions on the highest level and shall bc guided by them. (2) No.",137,Commonwealth Subsidy B Y Organisation 1962 63 To 1967 68
