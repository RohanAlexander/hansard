The workers' compensation. These are the very factax scales that have been introduced by the tors that are denying opportunities to people in Government this year, to my mind, give rise to the work force.

Perhaps we are restricting the the Opposition acting in such an irresponsible money supply a little too much. That is a point to fashion on the long term growth implicit in the which I will return. But the main thrust of the uranium decision. Virtually every member of the Budget is right.

Firstly, we right and that a Labor government would have must avoid superficially attractive employment wanted to take the same action but he dares not creating schemes such as those proposed by the say so for fear of losing a few votes or, more Ukely, Opposition which by increasing the money supply for fear of the outside forces that control him. will do more harm than good.

Secondly, we must avoid any All the rumours of dramatic cuts in community further significant devaluation which inevitably services which were sedulously disseminated by increases inflation and the pressure on wages.

Paradoxically, if we make proved to be false rumours, but this does not undo it clear that we are prepared to borrow as much as the worry and distress that was caused to many is necessary to defend the dollar, we will probably people.
