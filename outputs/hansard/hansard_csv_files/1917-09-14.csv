The Prime Minister was president and I was secretary of a strike conference which dealt with a waterside workers' dispute in, I think, 1913, when the conditions were much as they are to-day. The conference met daily for some weeks and controlled the whole of the union movement of Australia. The New Zealand Government had inaugurated a so-called National Service Strike-breaking Bureau, and were employing so-called loyalists for the purpose of smashing the New Zealand unions.

I was leading up to this point by a recital of the circumstances. The right honourable gentleman pointed out that unionists had returned to work with non-unionists at the gas works in Sydney, and described their treatment at that and other places, and in his own lurid language said, "" Y o u men know perfectly well that it would be easier to find the on behalf of the conference, cross of Christ at the bottom of hell than to find a non-unionist amongst you in a week's time."" ledge and belief, I said no such thing.

But the proposals which emanated from the New South Wales Government yesterday are such that, with my experience of coal mining, I have no hope of the immediate resumption of work, nor do I think that the activities of the Commonwealth can be brought to their normal condition in reasonable time. Therefore, the State Government's proposals are likely to retard, to a very large extent, the Commonwealth's efforts for the prosecution of the war. This Parliament was elected for the purpose of doing its utmost to win the war, and I feel sure that honourable members on both sides of the House have an intense desire to bring about such a condition of affairs as will conduce to the attainment of that end. These proposals, coming, as they did, right in the midst of a conference which, we had hoped, would have resulted in a settlement, have so accentuated the industrial crisis, that I can see no prospect of the activities of the country regaining their normal condition for a considerable time.

It is impossible to work mines which give off gas, and have other dangers, with inexperienced men. The New South Wales Government seem to have thought that extreme legislation would have a big influence in settling the trouble in the railmen at the coal face. This legislation proway and tramway services. As a matter of fact, this legislation has had no such influence, but it is having a very detrimental effect on the Commonwealth generally. The trouble with the railway and tramway servants seems to have been settled, and the State Government ought to bend every energy to the bringing about of a resumption of the normal activities of the country. I remind honourable members opposite that, though they may be powerful, though they may be in a position to dictate terms, though they may adopt an autocratic policy, the great public of Australia will not submit to such conduct for any length of time. our side. able gentleman will realize that a powerf u l Government must be merciful, and it is nofc a safe axiom of government to say that, because a party is in power with very strong support, it is justified in going to extremes. Such action would probably result in disaster to the Commonwealth. We must have regard to the national position.' There comes a time in connection with every trouble when justice must be tempered with mercy; and, having regard to the fact that the railway men have resumed on the Government's terms, the State authorities should endeavour to settle the coal miners' strike amicably, rather than accentuate any existing bittermerely said that the .inexperienced men ness. services resumed? vice in the Newcastle district is resumed, and the Commissioner has said that the Government are able to continue the existing services; but, until the mining trouble is settled, they will not extend them. Apparently, the whole position depends upon the Government getting supplies of coal. Nobody knows better than the Minister for the Navy the reasons for the passing of' the Coal Mines Act with a provision precluding inexperienced men working alone at the coal face. That legislation was not introduced by a Labour Government, but by a Liberal Governr ment, who realized that on account of the dangers attendant on coal mining, the industry required the services of skilledj vided, therefore, that each incompetent man should be under the care of a skilled miner. If ever there was panic legislation, it was that recently passed by the Government of New South Wales, apparently without thought, and simply for the purpose of' exercising power against a body of men who ceased work out of sympathy with their comrades. Now that the men are ready to resume work, the Government say that the panic legislation must continue. In two or three mines where the Government had succeeded in getting a body of inexperienced labour, those men are to continue at work, and the experienced miner is to be asked to work alongside them. T.f that is done, each man who enters the mines will run the risk of being blown up. No one can say that there may not be at any moment an ignition of gas consequent on the acts of inexperienced men, and a disaster may befall the whole of the employees in the mine. I am sure honourable members will not support legislation of that sort. I could have understood the Government, if their desire is to be loyal to the men who accepted work in the mines, stipulating that such men must continue in work, but having experienced men alongside, in order to protect the lives of all. In imposing such a.condition the Government would have been on safe ground, but they have must remain where they are. Those men have been employed only in two or three mines tliat are not giving off gas, and from those properties the output of coal is infinitesimal. In tlie Catherine H ill Bay mine, where 250 men are employed, the output is only 250 tons-\ per day, although 200 experienced miners produced 1.250 tons a day.

If*, the men are prepared to settle the dispute-and I believe they are-the Government should meet them in a conciliatory spirit. The union ofncials told me a few days ago that they would bend a l l their energies to the settlement of this trouble. The action of the State Government in bringing forward such proposals just at the critical moment when Mr Holme was suggests that they have no intention of t r y in g to effect a settlement, but desire to accentuate the difficulty and crush the unions.

This action on the part of the State Government is criminal. Mr Hagelthorn may not have had much experience of coal mining, and I can only say that in persisting in this proposition to work the mines with inexperienced men he is deluding the people. The sending over of inexperienced men from Victoria to New South Wales to cut coal will probably end in disaster. This is not a time to mince matters. The d,anger is very real. The New South Wales Government have found it necessary to cause inquiries to be made in regard to the use of electrical appliances in these mines, because sparks coming from them are likely to ignite the gas. A t this critical time, when every effort , should be made to bring about a settlement, we find that the Government are prepared to send from this State inexperienced men to work the coal mines of New South Wales. From whatever stand-point we may view the situation, we cannot escape the fact that it is most serious. scabs to k ill the union men in New South Wales. negotiating w i th the miners, not mend the situation. creant to my duty as a member of the National Parliament if I permitted a Government composed, perhaps, of men inexperienced in coal mining, to go on with these proposals without pointing out the danger and offering a protest. This working of the mines by inexperienced men means a serious risk to life. Every one admits that a supply of coal is essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth at any time, and is particularly necessary in this time of war. I have heard the Prime Minister and other honourable members opposite say that it is the desire of the National Government that indusI t is no use talking t r i a l conditions should continue as they were before the war, and that in order.

The Prime Minister will probably reply to my arguments with the statement that lie appointed a tribunal some time ago to In the two mines to which I deal with the grievances of the coal miners, and that although that tribunal settled their disputes, they are again on strike. He will probably point to that fact as justifying the action of the New South Wales Government on this occasion.

The New .South Wales Government now make certain demands. I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister and Mr submit to the conditions that have ibeen Beeby quite understand the position. Mr laid down by the State Government, the Beeby visited Melbourne a day or two ago, and in his absence negotiations were proceeding in Sydney, with every pTospect of success. There seemed to be every hope of a settlement, but yesterday, according to the press reports, the Cabinet of which Mr Beeby is .a member suddenly came down with these new proposals. They did not wait for Mr Holme to submit the proposals made by the conference which he had been attending, but issued their mandate to the miners. I ask the Prime Minister to state, when replying, whether it is not a fact that Mr Beeby discussed this matter with him when in Melbourne a day or two ago, and .whether he agreed with Mr Beeby that the Commonwealth should not intervene at this hour of national crisis, but should permit the State Government to deal with the dispute in the way that it now proposes to do. I ask the Prime Minister to give a direct answer to that question. There appears to me to be some ground for the belief that such an arrangement was made by him with Mr monwealth matter. I cannot understand Beeby. ' In view of the fact that Mr why the Prime Minister, who, in the past, Holme, the Industrial Commissioner, was negotiating with the men in accordance with the terms of the State law, and that there seemed to be some hope of a settlement, I am at a loss to account for the action of the State ""Ministry in suddenly stepping in and breaking off those negotiations.

Mr Charlton. can fill the mines with free labour, and so starve the men into submission, they aTe mistaken. They will find the task more difficult than they imagine, and even to attempt it will not be in the best interests a-of the country. I believe that rather than coal miners would stand out until after Christmas. The State Government cannot hope to starve these men into submitting to such proposals as are now made. I appeal to the Government to be reasonable, and to endeavour to bring forward a reasonable scheme. If they do, they will find the men amenable. I am convinced of that as the result of conversations I had with the leaders of the miners while on my way over from Sydney. I have brought forward this matter in ordeT that it may be seriously considered by the House. This Parliament ia paramount. We have in the past taken up the position that in this time of national crisis the Commonwealth Parliament is supreme, and that we have a right to control everything within the Commonwealth. There is the further point to be considered, that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that when an industrial dispute extends beyond the limits of any one State it at once becomes a Comhas done so much to settle industrial troubles, should be prepared now to allow a State Government to deal with an industrial upheaval, affecting, not only one, but every State in the Commonwealth, and which is doing an immense amount of injury to the successful prosecution of the war. orable member suggest should be done? most recent proposals of the State GovernI shall not be guilty of any breach ment should not have ibeen issued.

43,Mr Joseph Cook,In what way?,26,Adjournment Industrial Crisis Coa L Mining Industry
44,Mr Charlton,"The State GoFrom time to time statements appear in the press-and they probably originate with the State Ministry, that, in New South Wales, there are many collieries working. Let me say straight out that the quantity of coal that is being won from the collieries now working is not worthy of consideration. At the Catherine H ill Bay mine there were something like 6,000 tons of coal in the bins when the men ceased work. There are very large bias on the mine, and all that is necessary is to run the trucks under them and load up. It has been proclaimed far and wide that the volunteers working in that mine have been cutting large quantities of coal. As a matter of fact, the coal being supplied from that mine was cut by the old employees, and was in the bins when this trouble arose. There is very little coal in the bins now, and the same statement will apply to other collieries. Assuming that the State Government could successfully work the coal mines-and I say they cannot-ho w could they get the coal away? Isi t in the interests of the Commonwealth that the whole of our shipping should be held up! From every stand-point it is most important that we should do all in our power to settle this strike. Whatever may be said of ""their action in coming out, it is to the eternal credit of the Newcastle colliers that they have supplied more volunteers for our fighting forces abroad than has any other electorate in Australia. The electors of Newcastle turned down conscription by a very substantial majority; but that electorate holds pride of place among all others in regard to the number of fightingrnen it has sent to the Front. Its population consists chiefly of miners and mine workers; so that no one can urge that the men there are not doing their level best to aid the Government in the successful prosecution of this war. All their sympathies are in the direction of bringing the war to a speedy and successful termination, and they are prepared to do all they can in that direction. They are setting an example to the people of every other electorate by their response to the recruiting appeal. Even now they are supplying their full quota of recruits. That being so, no one can say that they are disloyal,' or that they are in any way opposed to the best interests of the Empire. The whole trouble is the' result of a mistake, and every effort shouM be made to bring about a settlement. The State Government having overcome the trouble in regard to the tramway employees, surely it is only fair to call upon the State Administration to be reasonable. If they are strong they should be merciful. That is an axiom of good government. It is easy to adopt autocratic methods, and to resort to extremes, but we require at the head of the Government a man . of tact, who knows exactly how far to go, and when it is time to pull off. The time has arrived when this trouble should be settled in the interests of all concerned. I ask the Prime Minister to seriously consider the position. Surely no one would have this industrial trouble going on until after Christmas. If the State Government so embitter the feeling of the men that they refuse to return to work, then we cannot hope to do much in the prosecution of the war. If the men become embittered we shall not be able to look to them to help us to make up our reinforcements as they have been doing. They will have the impression that the Government, because of their success at the polls, are no longer prepared to be reasonable. This is a bad idea to get abroad amongst workmen, and I submit to the Prime Minister, and to this House, that the time has arrived when the Government of the Commonwealth should get into communication with the State Government, and instruct the latter to come to a settlement on reasonable terms as early as possible. The proposals that have been made by the State Government are most unreasonable; but I feel sure that, so far as the miners of the Newcastle and Maitland districts are concerned, they would accept reasonable terms. That being so, I appeal to the Prime Minister to take immediate action, realizing, as he must, that this matter concerns not only the miners, but the whole of the Commonwealth. In all matters concerning the Commonwealth, and the welfare of the Empire, since the commencement of the war, the Government have endeavoured to maintain control; and surely they ought to do so at the present moment. I speak feelingly, because there is no man more anxious than myself to see the wheels of industry going round, and everything possible done to bring the war to a successful ending. If we all have that desire, surely we can sink our personal feelings, and those in power can afford to be generous. ister and Attorney-General) [11.46] This is the second occasion on which the adjournment of the House has been moved in relation to this matter; but of that I do not complain It is a matter of importance, and the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), who represents a district vitally concerned, has, as becomes him, put forward the case temperately on behalf of his constituents. I venture to say, however, that he has not put forward a case which will commend itself to the community in general. admit that much of what he says in regard to the position is true. I admit, for example, that the amount of coal now being got out by the men from the National Service Bureau is insignificant. I admit that the amount of coal that is likely to be got out by volunteers will still leave many of the most pressing needs of the Commonwealth unsatisfied. major premise of the honourable gentleman in his statement of the case. He has entirely passed over the reason for the strike, organized plan, and this strike served one though ithat is the touchstone of the whole position. The honourable member said that, because the Government happened to succeed at the polls, we ought tp remember our duties-that while we are strong we ought to be merciftil. I say that the real reason for this strike is that the Government did succeed at the polls-that it is the answer of those gentlemen who were then defeated, or, rather, to -the gentlemen who led those who were defeated. -Let me remind the honourable member of one or two facts. He said something about the card system, and contended that the New South Wales Government, by introducing it into the railway and tramway workshops, is responsible for the cessation of work by the coal miners. Could there be a greater manifestation of the position than is here set forth 1 The card system is not responsible for the strike. I shall come to the main point in a moment; but it is certain that we could not get a coal miner to stand here and deny that the conditions granted them by the coal tribunal were the best they had ever made. Here was a god who came bearing in both hands all the gifts of Heaven and poured them freely and without price into their lap. , Did this satisfy them ? Didi t allay industrial unrest? No. They became light-headed through the exuberance of Heaven's generosity Since the awardsome eight months or so .ago-the y have struck I do not know how many times. In the month of July-that , is the month preceding ithe strike-ther e were strikes at Seaham No. 2, Pelaw Main, Aberdare Extended, Hepburn, Burwood, Rothbury, and Richmond Main collieries. These are only some of the strikes that have occurred. I have not had an opportunity to collect all of the necessary information, whereas the honourable member I had his 'case prepared, and put ib without warning. However, there were strikes without number, for any reason and for no reason. He now says that it was the card system that brought about this dire calamity. orable gentleman permit me to say that there has been only one breach of any award delivered by the coal tribunal. strikes, some of which I have quoted, were deliberately fomented as part of an of the purposes of the leaders very well. I shall not say one word about what that purpose was, but no doubt every coal miner knows. However, that shall not occur again. I now come to the main cause of this strike. When the conscription campaign was in full swing, and about four or five days before the vote was taken, it is a fact that Mr Baddeley, Mr Willis, and two others, whose names I forget, waited on me at Newcastle. They said that they had been goaded by the irritating delay of the Arbitration Court into a state when it was only by superhuman efforts that they were keeping the men from striking.

There is no doubt about that-non e whatever. Why, later ou, the Waterside Workers Union had a congress in Hobart, and at that time. I was president of the union. The minutes show that motions were openly moved-on e to the effect that, if conscription were carried, the Waterside Workers Union would j o in in with every other unioD and strike. knows that is true. ried? Mr, HUGHES was. A t any rate, it .was discussed for three days. think that the community are fools. Do honourable members think . that unions always publish the things that they really mean to do ? Do they think I do not know what happened? Now we have a strike of coal miners, who were enjoying the best conditions they or any coal miners ever had. They had deliberately ceased work because it was alleged that an injustice was being done, or proposed to be done, to a certain section of the railway employees. No one knows precisely how this card system would operate, but the railway men struck, and the miners left their work in sympathy with them. Now, after going six weeks, the railway employees, or a great number of them, returned to work unconditionally, and the rest went back with a settlement, accepting the card system as one of the conditions. But the coal miners are still out on strike, and declare that they will not go back unless and unti l a section in dispute is repealed and certain permits issued to loyalist miners under a special Act passed in New South Wales are withdrawn. that. They were negotiating with a view to resumption of work ; but they did not say that. They did not make tliat a mandatory condition. now refuse to go back. The honourable member says that they are "" negotiating,"" but what they are really doing is striking, though they have no grievances. They do not even allege one. According to the honourable member, there are 200 or 250 men cutting coal in some out-of-the-way place, which I do not suppose one miner out of I have ample proof. every 300 on strike ever saw or goes near. Surely to heaven the honourable member is not going to tell me that such conditions W h a t nonsense! are new in the coal trade-that we have not had the same sort of thing long ago ? The kernel of the business is still in the unionists' hands. The Statute to which the honourable member has referred gave the unionists a monopoly of cutting coal, because they were tlie only skilled men; and those who have that monopoly-o n Everybody which the community lives, and without which it cannot live, without which it cannot wage war-say , ' ' Unless you do as we say, and settle this card business as we say, unless you do everything we say in T h a t particular one the way we say, we will not cut coal, and you shall not live."" We cannot have Honourable members must t h a t ; and the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) could not accept such a position if he were in my. place. Neither he nor any of the miners can deny that in the last trouble, when it was a question of eight hours from bank to .bank, and they had a good case, I did stand by them, and gave them what they asked, or the means by which thfey could get what they asked. Now', however, they have not a leg to stand on, and they are committing an offence against the community. I am . informed that Mr Baddeley, only last Saturday or Sunday, when speaking at a meeting, so f a r from expressing any desire to bring this unhappy dispute to a close, said that the miners would go back on their own terms-that'othe r men had had a month's holiday, and why should not they ?-in short, it was an incitement to continue the strike. The miners imagine that they have the community in the hollow of their hands, and they are going to extort their own terms. I do not think any man would justify such an attitude. The miners shall 'have a fair deal, and they may go back upon the same rates and conditions as before. But we are not going to allow them to dictate to the whole community after they have thrown the country into a state of chaos, holding up all transport.",28,Adjournment Industrial Crisis Coa L Mining Industry

The honourable member for Hunter says that Newcastle has sent more volunteers to the Front than any other place; and for that I take off my hat to Newcastle in recognition of the men who are gone; but I put my hat on again in contempt for the men who have remained behind to stick up the food ships necessary for the men at the Front.

As I have ""shown, there were seven strikes in one month. They were striking every day. The coal tribunal was given to them to redress grievances. They have abused the privilege thus granted to them, and treated the Court with contempt. They do not. deserve the tribunal. They shall not have it any more. strikes were stoppages by men who were not associated with the unions. they were, but they were strikes. I was informed that they struck in one mine because a man had been paid 2s. too much. It is the first time that I have heard of men striking because one man has been paid too much. I do not think that that was a matter which should cause a strike. I agree with the honourable member that the present state of things is deplorable, and ithat common sense should prevail on both sides. If the men would, with an earnest desire to bring the trouble to a conclusion, meet the Government of New South Wales, a settlement oould be arrived at in half-anhour. I know that Mr Fuller and the executive of the Federation are negotiating, directlyI trust these attempts at settlement will be successful. The desire of the Commonwealth is to bring the matter to a speedy end, and we are determined upon two things. We shall not permit the exploitation of the community by the miners, and we shall not allow those who have come to our aid to be victimised. A t the same time the interests of the miners, like those of every one else in the community, will be safeguarded. The Prime Minister has quite evaded the present position. His remarks mostly had reference to the unfortunate strike that is in progress, and were founded on hearsay statements and not on direct evidence. For instance, he said that the president of the Federation had made certain remarks, but he did not know where he had got the information. He also told us that he did many things for the coal miners. I do not deny it , but none of those matters afiect the motion submitted by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), which we are v now considering. The point that we desire to bring before honourable members is a stick with which to be that a specific attempt is being made by the State Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, aided by the Prime Minister, to injure one of the most loyal districts of the Commonwealth. there. They are at the Front. recruits are there, and the fathers are at the back of the strike, not the extremists often these that the honourable member believes are operating in other parte of the Commonwealth. The history of our coal mines I do not know what has been a record of disaster after disaster as the mines became deeper, and legislation has had to be passed with a view to safeguarding the men engaged in them. Whenever a disaster has occurred there has been a wave of sympathy towards the workers from the people of Australia, but when it is a question of industrial turmoil , the sympathy seems to be quite the other way. The present proposal is that these men who take their lives in their hands every day, even when working with skilled and practical men, shall be deprived of the protection of the Coal -Mines Regulation Act. It is not a question of wages. It is a deliberate attempt to break the unions. The amendment of the Coal Mines ""Reeither through Mr Holme or gulation Act will deprive the miners of the necessary safeguards imposed by the Act Further than this, the Government, for the first time in the history of Australia, has become an agent for engaging free labour, and has taken the place of the former free labour bureaux.

61,Mr Watkins,"The fathers of the Minister said that he would be glad to see the trouble settled, after heaping abuse on men who clothed and fed him in the early days of his association with trade unionism in this 'country. The Prime Minister has made a statement that negotiations are proceeding with the Government of New' South Wales with the view to the settlement of the dispute, but, at the same time, in yesterday's newspapers, an advertisement, paid for with Commonwealth money, and issued from his own Department, appeared organizing miners, shiftmen, shot firers, going right through the whole list of coal-mining employees, in order to supply them to one of the most dangerous mines in New South Wales. That is the neutral attitude of a man who professes a desire to see this trouble settled. While he tells us that he hopes that the negotiations will be successful, he is busy endeavouring to secure free labour through the National Service Bureau, for which, as we were told in reply to a question yesterday, £500 has been advanced from the Treasurer's Advance Account. That is his method of settling the strike, while, at the same time, he is attacking a district which is as loyal as any other part of Australia, even if it does have its industrial troubles. All the sectional strikes that the right honourable gentleman quoted this morning are not like the case he quoted where trouble arose because one man had been paid 2s. more thein he should get. Such a statement would be absolutely absurd coming from a layman. It is much more so emanating from the Prime Minister. Occasionally there are little troubles for a day or two, and we have had them since the tribunal was appointed, but they have not come from the Federation. They are created, perhaps, by a boy or two outside the pale of the Federation, nevertheless, they are all spoken of as strikes of some magnitude. the miners have been producing sufficient coal, it has only to be stated that there is New South Wales persist in the conat grass about 200,000 tons more than has been required for export purposes. these men would do anything to hold up supplies.

The miners will be no party to holding up transports. like the honourable member and the honton) to lead them, the dispute would soon be settled. Minister's attack on the men was one that he should not have made, but I am sorry if, in replying to him, I have said anything more extreme than was justified. honourable members of the Opposition who have put the case for the men have done it with knowledge of the conditions, and with the conviction that something should ibe done to end the difficulties of the present has lived all his life in the same atmosituation. The Prime Minister, however, apart from the heat which he naturally exhibited, put the position clearly. This is not a fight between employees and employers to obtain better conditions or bigger wages. The coal strike in 1909, which lasted three or four months, enabled the men to get most of what they wanted. At the end of last year the community was greatly inconvenienced by another strike, to settle which the Government created a special tribunal, which dealt with the trouble within twenty-four hours by practically giving the men all that they asked for, and saddling the cost on the community. Those engaged in the work of hewing coal have a monopoly. ' It is true, as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) pointed out, that coal mining is one of the most dangerous occupations, and it would be unwise to employ unskilled men generally in mines, and particularly in mines where gas is found. But what is the alternative? To that point the honourable member appears not to have given 'reasonable consideration. The coal miners have a virtual monopoly. Their'position is that of the tyrannical employer of a century or two ago who had plenty of labour to hand and no conditions to embarrass him. The coal miners, by reason of their technical skill, and the protection of the legislation which JOHN FORREST -Why did these surrounds them, have a monopoly, and are in a position to say to the community, ""Unless you give us what we want, we I object to raising will not supply you with coal."" Therefore, notwithstanding the danger of employing unskilled labour in mines, the only alternative, if this dictation of a section of the community is to be resisted by If they had men the Government, is to employ such labour. In a Democracy the Government chosen by the people as a whole must be supreme; a section cannot be allowed to say to the rest of the community, "" Until we get the I felt that the Prime conditions we demand, we will not give you the benefits of our labour."" "" UnlessI can make a profit, I shall not. use my money in a business."" tween capital and labour, but between the Government and labour. sphere, but as he gets older his experience will become wider. Either the Government must be supreme, or we must have anarchy. member think that the New South Wales Railways Commissioners blundered in forcing certain conditions on their employees ? with the matter, because the difficulty created by their action has been settled. No one wishes to see a condition of civil war arise. The original dispute has been settled, and the troubles of the men still on strike have been increased as the result of their own action.

In other words, they suggest that the Government of the country should capitulate to a section of the community, which, by virtue of its monopoly, can withhold the very life blood of commerce.

I do not intend to deal w i th the matters touched on by the Prime Minister; but it "", must be recognised that there was a deliberate attempt to control all the affairs of the community by means of a sympathy strike, .and the calling.out systematically of the strongest unions. This strike has not succeeded, and it is because the community has rallied to the assistance of the Government, determined that the whole people, and not a section, shall rule, that so much noise is being made. If the men thought they could succeed, they would not make appeals for leniency and consideration. It is because they are tottering to their f a l l , because they know that they have lost the sympathy of the community, and because the leaders have not the sympathy of three-fourths of their own men, that they wish to save their faces, and are w ill in g to do anything they can to If a Labour Government get out of the dispute which they have brought about. wasted in discussing this matter, but the interests of the whole people of the Commonwealth require that something be I have not.

A t fhe present time the coal mines in These honourable New South Wales are being worked under most tyrannical conditions. The recent amendment of the Coal Mines Regulation Act endangers the lives of miners, because a number of the men who are working in the mines to-day are unskilled and know' nothing of the dangers that confront them. Blissfully unconscious of their dangers, they are led into the mines, and do not know of the disaster that may overtake them at any moment. ' I appeal to the Government to attempt to remove the obstacles that stand' in the way of a settlement. Immediately that is done, the minerswill be prepared to resume operations in the coal pits. Buti n no circumstances is it reasonable to ask them to enter mines which may have been l e f t in a dangerous condition. The men at present working the _ mines know nothing of the dangers of' coal mining, and are not likely to leave the mines in the condition in which they were when they entered them. The Prime Minister said that this strike was a direct result of the conscription proposals of the previous Government, and that the miners intended, in the event of the conscription referendum being decided in the affirmative, to refuse work until that principle of military service was abandoned.

I do not say it is heart-breaking; I say it is treasonable.

152,Mr Jensen (Bass,"Minister forof the fact that the time had arrived when Australia-should, if possible, be self-supporting'in respect of this product which we so much desire. I had interviews at that time with the then Premier of Tasmania with reference to the Commonwealth taking a certain amount of oil per year from the Government of that State, if the State entered into negotiations in regard to the Latrobe Shale Oil Deposits. The Commonwealth Government communicated with the Government of Tasmania, and offered to give £ 3 15s. per ton for oil up to 8,000 tong per year for a period of eight years. In Tasmania the shale oil deposits are believed to be huge, and it is anticipated that there is shale enough to produce 450,000,000 gallons of oil. Some 40 gallons of oil per ton of shale can be extracted. In consequence of an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government of Tasmania, a Bill was introduced into the Legislative Assembly of that State to provide for the taking over of the deposits, the payment of a certain amount of money for them, and for the erection of certain machinery to cost the State Government approximately £200,000. That Bill passed the Lower House of the State, -but, in the Upper House, unfortunately, it was lost by one vote, for the reason that the members of the Legislative Council were not satisfied that £ 3 15s. per ton was a satisfactory amount. The Premier of Tasmania has made a request to this Government more than once for a bounty, and has even gone so far as to ask the Prime Minister whether he cannot see his way clear to join with the State of Tasmania in the production of this oil. The company at present in operation in New-South Wales is controlled by Mr John Pell, who has taken it over, and under whose supervision there is being produced, roughly speaking, 2,800,000 gallons of oil per annum. That company at the present time is in such straitened circumstances that Mr Fell is considering whether he should not close down the whole of the works. He has produced balance-sheets and made statements, to the effect that, owing to the increase in wages, and in the cost of material, during the last nine months, 'expenses during the year have been increased by 52^ per cent. He has entered into certain contracts for supplying crude oil at so much per gallon, and has produced evidence which goes to show that, unless he gets some assistance from the Commonwealth Government, he will be forced to cease operations. Such a step would, in my opinion, be a disaster. good thing, why do not the Commonwealth Government take it over? not prepared at this time, at any rate, to take over the enterprise of shale oil production. In order that the Government might be assured of its position in submitting a measure of the kind now before us, Mr Lockyer, one of the Inter-State Commissioners, was invited to report and make recommendations on the proposition as put forward by Mr Fell. Mrv Lockyer was asked to look into the balance-sheets, and so forth, in order to ascertain whether the statements made by Mr Fell to the Prime Minister and myself were accurate. This Mr Lockyer has done, and, in his report, he recommends that there shall be paid a ' bounty of 2£d. per gallon on crude oil up to 3,500,000 gallons produced by any one company; that between 3,500,000 gallons and 5,000,000 gallons the bounty shall be 2d. per gallon; that from 5,000,000 gallons to 8,000,000 gallons the bounty shall be l f d . per gallon, and that on all production above -8,000,000 gallons the bounty shall be l£d. per gallon. num. It is anticipated that, in the first two years, at least, there will be only one company to receive any bounty, and on the output of that company only half the sum provided will be required, and it has been arranged that any of the prescribed sum not earned in these first two years may be earned and paid in subsequent years. It is proposed that £270,000 shall be appropriated for the purpose of paying this bounty, and that the bounty shall be made available for four'years. It is important that Australia should be in a position to produce oil for its Navy. If we were attacked by an enemy and our overseas supply of oil were cut off Australia would be in a most precarious position. Mr J. H . CATTS -Are there any stocks in hand?",38,Second Reading

I ask members not to look at the matter from tlie present point of view, but. from the point of view of five years ahead. If it is possible to have the extraction of oil from the shale deposits of Australia in f u l l working order in a few years onr commercial community as well as our Navy will be greatly benefited. There are shale deposits in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. ThisB ill makes no provision for paying a bounty on the production of oil from running' wells. considered that aspect of the matter, but if it should happen that a big running stream of oil is struck in Australia, the Government, though delighted at the discovery, would be called upon to pay out the whole of the 2£d. per gallon bounty in a week. My personal view is that financial assistance on a pound for pound basis should be given to any person or company which is to r in g for o i l , and I am prepared to ask Cabinet to give consideration to such a proposition. But that is a different proposition from the extraction of o i l from shale. We have the shale deposits, and we know that the oil is in them, but unless we offer some encouragement to those persons who are mining the shale for the purpose of extracting oil from it. the small production that we now have w ill cease altogether. The. Inter-State Commission, which in vestigated this matter-, in 1915. recommended that a bounty of I d . per gallon should be paid on crude shale oil, but since then the cost of wages and material and everything in connection with mining operations has enormously increased, and I can quite understand Mr Lockyer, a member of the Inter-State Commission, recommending a week ago that the amount of bounty should be increased to 2£d. per gallon. Judge Edmunds, who inquired into the troubles of the coal and shale rnining employees in the earlier part of the year, and awarded the miners enormously increased wages and much better working conditions, which have added considerably'to the cost of production of both shale and coal, has forwarded a letter to the Crown Law ofiicers stating that he is convinced that some assistance must be given by way of a bounty to the shale I am not at liberty to oil industry, because he is assured that shule mining cannot be carried on profitably under the increased wages that he recommended. H is letter supports the action that the Government are taking. The working expenses of the Australian O i l Corporation of New South Wales have increased by 52 per cent, since 1st January last. I ask honourable members to regard this matter as a national one. The purpose of the B ill is to enable the Commonwealth to get the oil ifc requires for its Navy and its commercial community. I trust that honourable members w ill view the measure The Government ""have in a favorable light, and that as a result of the granting of this bounty there will be 'before very long at least 20,000,000 gallons of oil extracted from shale. I trust, also, that there w ill be discoveries of oil wells, but honourable members must not confuse oil extracted from shale with oil raised from wells. The two things are quite distinct. We know that there is oil in. the shale deposits of Australia, but we do not know that there are oil wells here I hope that in their zeal to help in the discovery of running o i l streams, honourable members w ill not prevent assistance being given to the industry that we have already in our midst. just had an opportunity of seeing the B ill , and what strikes me about it is the amount of the bounty that is to be made available for the production of crude o i l in comparison with other bounties. Parliament considered £30^000 per annum a sufficient bounty to enable the iron industry to be established in Australia, whereas £67,000 is thought to be necessary for the purpose of establishing the shale oil industry here. We considered that a total bounty of £150,000 was enough for the iron industry, yet this B ill proposes a total bounty of £270,000 for shale oil production. apart from the value of the o i l . aspect of the question into consideration, because the people concerned in the establishment of the iron industry also retain the value of their product. According to the report of the' Inter-State Commission, dated the 26 th May, 1915, a bounty of I d . per gallon on locally produced crude oil from shale is equal to a duty of 5d. per gallon, or a 2£ p.er cent, import duty on",39,Second Reading

160,Mr Ttjdor,"I have not taken thatkerosene. If a bounty of Id. per gallon on crude oil locally produced is equal to a duty of 5d. per gallon on kerosene, a bounty of 2£d. must be equal to a duty of Is. 0^-d. per gallon on kerosene. It is equal to a bounty of £2 6s. 7d. per ton on crude oil. I have no doubt the Ministry have considered the matter carefully, but the producer of the crude shale oil, as the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) has interjected, will secure all the by-products, such as petrol, light spirit, heavy spirit, and lubricating oil. The only company operating in Australia, formerly called the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, claimed, and obtained, a bounty of 2d. per gallon on kerosene, which was a much smaller bounty >than the Id. per gallon on crude oil suggested by the Inter-iState Commission. Kerosene is the' refined article. The difficulty commences after the crude oil is produced. I think that the Government would have been better advised if they had devoted £50,000 per annum to subsidizing on a pound for pound basis persons who would"" bore for oil. When I was at Newnes last, over £1,250,000 had been spent by the company engaged there in the production of oil from shale. The company has now -passed into the hands of Mr John Pell, and I understand that he is trying to work the mine on his own account, and all honour is due to him for endeavouring to establish the oil industry here, but I doubt whether the extraction of crude oil from shale is the wisest method to follow for the production, of .oil in Australia. I desire the establishment of the crude oil industry, but, to my mind, the proposal of the Government is not a practicable one. The Minister says that it is not expected that, in the first two years, the full £67,500 per annum will be claimed, but that the money will be .available in subsequent years. Most honourable members will agree with me that it would have been sufficient to make available £35,000 a year, or thereabouts, to encourage boring operations. If a good supply of oil were struck, the bounty would be claimed in a week. No one would.remain in politics if he knew he could go out and find payable deposits of oil. The Inter-State Commission say that a bounty of Id. per gallon on locally-produced crude oil may be expressed as equivalent to an import duty on kerosene of 5d. per gallon, or to a bounty of i d . per gallon on locally-produced crude shale oil, together with 2£d. per gallon import duty on kerosene. There has been no alteration of industrial conditions to warrant the increasing of the bounty by 150 per cent. Mr John Pell is probably the most practical man in the oil business now in Australia According to the Commission, a bonus of 2d. per gallon on crude oil was supported, in the alternative, by Mr John Fell, who, at an earlier date, opposed the application in regard to crude oil. the works of Newnesi n 1915, when he was connected with this company, which was before this report was written. He originally requested a duty of 2d. per gallon on kerosene, benzine, benzoline, naphtha, gasoline, crude petroleum, petrol, pentane, turpentine substitutes, solar and fuel oiis, residual and all petroleum spirits; and 3£d. per gallon on all pure mineral lubricating oils. Before the war, the price of crude oil was about. £3 per ton. We put. a duty of i d . per gallon on it, and are now asked to encourage the industry by a bounty equivalent to ten times that duty. The Bounties Act 1907 provides £339,000 for bounties extending over the period from 1908 to 1922, on cotton, fibres, New Zealand flax, jute, sisal hemp, oil materials, cotton seed, linseed, rice, rubber, coffee, .tobacco-leaf for the manufacture of cigars, fish, dates and dried fruits, and combed wool or tops. The amount set aside to encourage the production of all those articles is only about one-third more than what is now proposed for the encouragement of the oil industry alone. I would not put an obstacle in the way of the establishment of any industry, but we are justified in asking if the present proposal of the Government has been carefully considered, in view of the fact'that they propose to increase the bounty suggested by the InterState Commisson two and a half ypars -ago. another report a fortnight ago. industry is, there are others which could be encouraged with bounties; and if we set aside £67,000 a year for four years for",40,Second Reading

[2.53] I was at first influenced by the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition, which was based on the report of the Inter-State Commission, which investigated the shale oil industry. The honourable member made it appear that a bounty of 2^d. on the first 3,500,000 gallons would be equivalent to a duty of Is. a gallon on kerosene, which seems excessive; but having made a short examination of the report while the honourable member was speaking, I think now that his argument was not entirely borne out by the report. sioners say that a bounty of I d . per gallon on locally-produced crude oil from shale may be expressed as equivalent to an import duty on kerosene of 5d., per gallon. But they appear to base that calculation on the assumption that the only products of crude oil are kerosene and wax. Those may be the main products, but distillation produces many more. gallons of crude oil as 20 gallons of kerothrough his ability that the oil industry sene and 40 lbs. of wax. If we assumed that kerosene alone benefited by the bounty, the honourable member's argument would be right, but, as a matter of fact, only a fifth of the bounty on the crude oil is to be attributed to the kerosene distilled from it, which makes the bounty much less than Is. a gallon on kerosene. To arrive at a right conclusion as to the effect of the bounty, we should know the value of the various products distilled from 100 gallons of crude oil, which I understand to be first benzine or petrol, kerosene, and other volatile products, then the lighter and heavier lubricating oils, and finallv wax. are distilled from crude oil. the highly-organized plants of American factories produce a very large number of products. I have merely outlined the principal of these. It is desirable that the Minister, if he can do so, should tell us, approximately, what are the products derived from the oil. I am not in favour of cheeseparing in this matter. The Ministry does right to offer a substantial bonus if it wishes to stimulate this industry, which I admit is of immediate importance to Australia. But we should be placed in a position to determinethe effect of the bounty, not merely on kerosene, but also on wax and all other oil I must support the Bill. There is no industry in Australia more entitled to the consideration of the Government than the oil industry at Newnes. A large amount of money has been expended in the establishment of this industry, and unless the Government come to the rescue,' £1,250,000, which was spent in the erection of the plant at Newnes, will certainly go to waste, because under present conditions it is not possible for the CommonI t is true that the' Commiswealth Oil Corporation to carry on in competition with the AmericanO i l Trust at the present prices of kerosene and crude oils. If this industry were in tbe hands of some unscrupulous individuals, who were reckless in the production of oil, there would be some justification for honourable members taking exception to the amount of the bounty But Mr John Fell is the most practical and experienced They speak of the yield of 100 oil expert in Australia, and it is only stands in its present position. Some four year's ago the industry was abandoned aa hopeless, but Mr Fell took the enterprise in hand, spent a certain amount of money, and erected some experimental retorts, which have proved most successful. But for the success of those retoTts, Newnes would be at a standstill to-day. Nevertheless, it must be realized that it is. not possible for the company to carry on unless the Government render some assistance. Newnes is situated in an isolated spot in the Wolgan Valley, and is served by one of the steepest railway lines in Australia. It runs a distance of 28 miles from Newnes Junction, and its construction cost about £250,000. Consequently the cost of getting the product to the market is considerable. Having regard to all the conditions surrounding the industry, the bounty proposed by the Government is not too high. It is essential that we should have an oil industry upon which we can rely, and the shale deposits in sight at Newnes aTe not likely to be worked out under fifty or sixty years. Therefore it cannot be said that this industry is of an ephemeral character. Apart from the Commonwealth Oil Corporation's works at Newnes, there are oil works at Murrurundi and Temi.

It is recognised that it is necessary, at the present time especially, to stimulate oil production in Australia, and the only way the existing industry can be maintained is by giving it protection against the competition of the imported' article. The conditions existing in Australia are totally different from those in America, because the cost of raising a ton of shale from the ground is considerably greater than the cost of pumping a ton of oil from a well. Sir [3.5] I most cordially commend this proposal. people who have hitherto engaged in the production of shale oil have shown their bona fides by the expenditure of vast sums of money. most discouraging conditions, and I am glad to see that the Government are at last realizing the value to the community of an oil industryI t is true that the bounty is limited to crude shale oil from mined shale. The bounty is substantial, and nothing else would be of any value. I hope this measure is only the forerunner of many Bills of a like character, and that amongst other things the Minister will see his way clear ito offer a bounty have been raised to such an extent that it for the discovery of petroleum fields. There are many indications that such fields do. exist throughout Australia, and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money for the encouragement of those who are prepared to invest their own means in exploiting and developing them would be justified. bodied in this Bill is an admirable one, which we should endeavour to apply still further. I do urge the Minister to give his attention to the discovery of oil fields, from the people by way of taxation, we and offer like encouragement to enterprising individuals and companies. was my privilege some years ago to visit the shale oil mines at Newnes in company with the Leader of the Opposition. I was very much impressed with the importance of those progressive works. A t that time we were considering whether, by placing a duty on kerosene, we could encourage the development of those mines and enable the company to make a decent profit. I asked one of the directors whether at Newnes they could produce kerosene, of a quality equal to the imported article at the recognised market price. He said that they could do so provided the labour conditions remained as they were. It appears to me that the labour conditions are the crux of the whole question. There are many enterprises in Australia which could be, and would be, worked profitably, and very much to the advantage of the people as a whole, if it were not for the uncertainty with regard to labour conditions. If the Commonwealth is to provide this bounty for the shale oil industry, we ought to protect the public interest by insuring that those employed allowed to usurp an influence which puts There is no doubt that the an additional cost upon production, making it necessary to still further increase the bounty. They have fought against I was surprised at the statement made by the Minister in regard to wages. Practically the taxpayers of the community are to be asked to pay portion of the wages in this industry. If the increases in wages were of any particular advantage to the employees, there might not be much reason to object to them. But we know that through the artificial conditions of labour imposed by Statute, and through the Arbitration Court, wages is impossible for us to develop the industry as we should like to do. I commend to the Government the suggestion fchat if we grant this bounty it must be upon something equivalent to free labour conditions. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but the crisis which confronts the commuuity to-day is the result of the The principle emartificial labour conditions which have been brought into existence. Certainly, when we are voting out of the public Treasury money which is to be extracted should insure that no unfair conditions are imposed upon those who, accepting the opportunity which the bounty affords, are yet unable to make their enterprise profitable. This suggestion is worthy of the serious consideration of the Government. If we are to vote money for this or any other developmental purpose, we must see that the public interests are protected as against the interests of those who make",42,Second Reading
168,Mr Palmer (Echuca) [3.7],"I tunjust demands. It has been the unfor1 tunate experience in connection with many factories and industries that, no sooner are they started, than the union bosses come along, and tell the men that they must have better conditions and more wages, and the ventures become financial failures. No amount of bolstering by way of bonuses will overcome that disability until the labourers to be employed are compelled to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, and to do it under equitable and reasonable conditions. I have nob had time to study the merits of the Bill, but .it is certain that we have oil shale in Australia, and that we can produce oil in almost unlimited quantities if the production is made profitable. There are very many .properties which, under present labour conditions, could never be utilized, and the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that most of the shale being mined when we visited Newnes was being exported to Germany. Only a very limited quantity was being distilled in Australia. The reason advanced for this was that labour conditions here did not permit of our establishing the subsidiary industries, and the consequent advantages were lost to us. The Germans were prepared to purchase in unlimited quantities the shale produced from the mine, because it is regarded as being about the best shale discovered in any. part of the world. The artificial conditions that we have been labouring to establish, however, are absolutely fatal to tlie successful prosecution of many industries that would be very valuable to us and which, under normal conditions, could be carried on with profit. I presume that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in submitting this Bill, is merely beginning to fulfil the promise given by the Government that it would encourage new industries in Australia. mencement. struggling industries which, with the help of a small bounty, would flourish and produce numerous articles ""absolutely essential to a self-contained Australia. We have the raw material for many new lines of manufacture, and that is why I hope this Bill is .but the forerunner of other proposals by the Government to encourage new industries. While providing for abounty on shale oil the Government v might well have gone a little further, and have provided for a bounty to encourage boring for oil deposits. I hope that the Minister will urge upon the Government, in the immediate future, the desirableness of encouraging in this way. boring for crude oil, so that we may be able to supply our own requirements in that direction. The honourable gentleman said that if he could secure the support of the Cabinet-and , I suppose, of his partyhe would be prepared to propose a bounty of £1 for £1 to those who were boring for oil deposits. Oil is one of the essentials of our Navy, and of many industries in Australia. In a country that is rich in many minerals, it is more than probable that large deposits of oil will be found. I believe that a very small proportion of the total oil production of the world comes from shale. The great bulk of it is drawn fromoil wells. I hope that, as soon as we meet, after the approaching adjournment, the Minister for Trade and Customs will bring down a Bill to encourage the discovery of crude oil deposits. ""We have every sympathy with those who have invested their capital, and have spent much time and energy in the endeavour to provide Australia with an article such as this, which is so essential to all branches of industry. This bounty, I understand, is to be at the rate of 2^d. per gallon on crude oil. The extraction of by-products will follow. pay on the crude oil. that crude' oil subsidiary products will be extracted. I accept the Minister's promise that he will give the House an early opportunity, provided that he can induce the Cabinet to support him, to encourage oil discoveries within the Commonwealth. It is only by making an early attempt to promote the production of shale oil and the discovery of oil deposits in Australia 'that we shall be able to meet the necessities of the situation, and to make Australia independent of outside sources of supply. When we succeed in doing that it will be a happy day for Australia. I had the privilege of moving in this House, in 1910, that a bounty should be allowed on crude shale oil.

The present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr repeat that, in the hands of the GovernTudor) was then Minister for Trade and Customs, but he could not be induced to take a wide view of the proposal or to display any foresight in regard to it. He could not be persuaded to do more than grant a bounty for the production of kerosene. There was only one company in Australia-the New South Wales enterprise-abl e to produce kerosene at that time, and those who now hold the property of that company are calling for the very bounty for which I pleaded in 1910. Had the Government of that day looked the matter fairly and squarely in the face, we might by this time have had firmly established in Australia a most important industry. The war has served to intensify the importance of this industry. It is absolutely necessary for the naval defence of Australia that we should be self-contained so far as the supply of oil is concerned. I am glad that tbe Bill has been intro^ duced, but I regret that the Government have not come to some arrangement with the Government of Tasmania, to jointly work the Latrobe-Bailton shale oil deposits. There we have a deposit which, according to experts, is in every respect satisfactory. The only trouble is that we have been unable to float a company with the capital necessary to develop it. manian Government taken it up? come possessed of the property, .but, although a Bill with that object in view was almost unanimously passed by the Lower House, it was defeated by a narrow majority in the Upper House. I am satisfied that the deposit to which I have referred could be worked to greater advantage by the Government than by any private company. satisfactory ? reports were so good that I cannot understand why any body of men who were not actually experts in oil production should turn down the reports of experts and reject the proposition. Had the proposal of the Tasmanian Government been agreed to by the State Parliament, the industry would have been well established, and the whole of the oil produced by it would have been used by the Navy. I ment, the industry would have a better chance of success than if it were controlled by a private company. If conducted by the Government it would be freer from the possibility of labour troubles, and any unfair competition by the Standard Oil Company or any other great corporation could be met. There are many solid reasons why the Government might reasonably be expected to make a better success of the proposition than a private company. I regard this Bill as an honest attempt on the part of the Government to found a 'very necessary industry, and, so far as it goes, I cordially support it. I hope that it will not only benefit the New' South Wales company, but will lead to the establishment of the industry in Tasmania. The Government certainly have not gone too far in the provision they have made on the Estimates for-the payment of this bounty. I do not think the whole amount will be claimed for a year or two, but if we can found this industry on a solid basis, we shall have every reason for satisfaction. not say that I am opposed to this Bill, but at the same time. I am not wholly in' favour of it. There are certain facts in the report of the Inter-State Commission on the production of shale oil to which I propose to draw attention. In the first place, the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer) is not very keen about paying the bounty. making that statement, for I am very keen in regard to. all these matters. seems to bother the honourable member is the fact that working men are to be. employed by means of this industry.

182,Mr Palmer,"The honourable membera bounty is much to be preferred to a fixed duty as a means of industrial encouragement. However, after looking at the report of the Inter-State Commission on the shale oil industry, I find some difficulty in believing that the Government have thoroughly considered the matter, or they would not have introduced a B ill containing such a schedule as we have before us. I am pleased to see that the Government have followed the example set by the BountiesA c t , which was passed in the time of the Labour Government, in respect of rates of wages and conditions of employment. This w ill prove one safeguard for the working man, notwithstanding the Peddlington ideas of the honourable member for Echuca; and it is the one redeeming feature of the B ill . The honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) has told us that the crude oil extracted from shale in Tasmania is very good, but that sufficient capital has not been forthcoming to develop the industry in that As a sporting offer, I venture to say that if any one can guarantee shale oil in any part of Australia, I shall be able to raise him a capital of £100,000 in forty-eight hours. I should like to read an extract fro m the report of the Inter-State Commission on this question. we are told, by 52£ per cent, since that report was issued; and it is one of the members of the Inter-State Commission who recommends a bounty of 2£d. State Commission in respect to shale oil is dated 1914-15, and contains the following : On an* estimated output of 4,000,000 gallons by the British-Australian Oil Company, and 10,000,000 gallons by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which is not likely to be reached or exceeded for some years, we have a total of 14,000,000 gallons. It must be remembered that there will be the initial difiSculty of capance to those who are boring for o i l . turing the local market in competition with well-known brandB. It may be assumed with fair accuracy that, in relation to such an output, the total capital of the two companies should not exceed £1,000,000. Assistance by bounty of Id. per gallon of crude oil on 14,000,000 gallons would amount to £58,300, or 5.83 per cent, on the above capital. It would represent 25 per cent, on 4d. per gallon, the value of the local output. It will be observed that these figures are on a basis of I d . per gallon, whereas the Government propose a bonus of 2^d., or 11 per cent, or 12 per cent., on a capital of £1,000,000. This, I think, is pretty "" sultry,"" and I can only wish we were all interested in an investment of the kind, for we should very soon become '' Get-rich-quick-Wallingfords.'' industry. for it has been tried with bounties for years, as you, Mr Speaker, must know, seeing that you have been one of the biggest champions of this industry in the House. May I ask whether this B ill will include Papua? tralia according ito the Acts Interpretation Act. Papua. that is so. A t Roma, and in the Crow's Nest district, and elsewhere in Queensland, State. there are outcrops of shale, and the Queensland Government are boring for oil at the first-mentioned place.

If there is one place in Australia where I feel confident oil can be obtained, it is in the Roma district. ing conducted by the State Government. that the State Government are entitled to the bounty if they produce oil.

The one thing I am afraid of, in view of our past experience, is that, if we coddle an industry too much, it ceases as soon as it is required to stand on its own legs. top industry is running without a bounty. the wool-top industry-it is one of the biggest swindles in Australia. If the oil industry should prove a success, this bounty expenditure will be money well spent; and I again urge the Government to have some regard for the Statei n dustry in Queensland. supporting, the Rill, I desire to call attention to a phase of the matter that certainly requires consideration. If this industry is established, I think it will be found that the supply is more than there is a local market for, and that fact may involve a good deal of negotiation with the British Government after the war is over in order that we may have a guaranteed market in the Old Country. A great change has come over the view of British statesmen, as we have seen in the case of the metal trade. If the aim is to make the British Empire self-contained, and that aim is achieved, there ought to be a good future for Australia in connection with oil-production, whether from shale or from boring. In Tasmania, I was told that one of the reasons why the Upper House rejected the proposed arrangements with the Commonwealth Government was that New South Wales would be able to supply the whole of the markets of Australia. We know, of course, that expectations in that regard have not been quite realized, owing, it is said, to the machinery employed not being of the righ t kind. The reason given by some members of the Legislative Council was that they were afraid that the venture was not good enough without some guarantee of the market. I hope that one result of the war will be that Australia will be able to dispose of its surplus oil in the markets of the Old World. There are few places in the world that have a big supply of oil, but we cannot compete with foreign companies in the British market. adopt a Protectionist policy-the y are practically committed to it-ther e should [79] [14 SEPTEMBEB, 1917.] Bounty BUI. 2137 be a future for our oil industry when it outgrows the local demand.

They' are prospecting for it with successful results in Papua, T h a t is not so; tlie wooland the prospects in Queensland are good, while a visiting expert has pronounced the opinion that oil will be found in the Northern Territory. An y assistance towards the discovery of oil wells must be given on a different basis from that which is proposed in regard to oil produced from shale. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) that boring should be encouraged, and that the Commonwealth Government should not await results before giving assistance. Australia has not been explored from its oil bearing point of view, and the Government could well give encouragement to prospectors for natural oil streams. Mr Wade and others have examined the Tasmanian shale deposits, and there is no doubt that the oil is there, but the reason advanced by the members of the Legislative Council of Tasmania for tlie action they took has something in it . I believe that their objections can be overcome in the way I have mentioned. This is not the first occasion on which a bounty has been offered for the production of oil in the Hartley Vale district in New South Wales. Forty years ago the State Government paid a bounty of 2d. per gallon on kerosene, and the oil produced from the Hartley Vale shale was the best in the local market, and held that market for a number of years; but owing to the crude methods of treatment the industry had to be abandoned. The Newnes Company was subsequently brought into existence to work another shale deposit in the same locality. I would rather have a protective dut y than a bounty, because there is always reason to suspect the genuineness of the latter, while the former gives every one an opportunity to commence operations for the production of the article for which the assistance is given. The machinery in use at the Commonwealth Oil Corporation's mine is worth an inspection by any person interested in this matter.

He is a resident of Woodville. He was summoned for having a military coat in his possession, and fined f 2. He asked for a stay of proceedings, which was granted till the Uth of next month (September). We think such drastic action as this is against recruiting, and would like you to make inquiries, and if possible, have the' conviction quashed. I am enclosing a report of presentation to Mr Elliot at Woodville. You will see by it the respect he is held in his own locality. I forwarded that communication to the Department, and thought that there would not be the slightest difficulty in getting it to 'intervene in the case, seeing that the man concerned has not only served two years at Rabaul, where bis health broke down, but also that he had distinguished military service in the SouthA f r i c an War, being the possessor of the M i l it a r y Medal, with half-a-dozen bars, and of the King's Modal.
