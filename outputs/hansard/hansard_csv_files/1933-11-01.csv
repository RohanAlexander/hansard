What truth, thou, is there in the published announcement been received within the Inst half hour that certain alterations of its policy have arisen out of the conference hold yesterday between representatives of wheat interests and the Government? If alterations are projected, what are they? euce yesterday discussed the proposals of the Government for the implementing of the International Wheat Agreement. That conference endorsed the principles underlying the. Government's scheme, but suggested certain variations of it which were readily assented to. The principal variation relates to the method by which export quotas for licensed exporters shall ho fixed. The proposal of tbe Government, as outlined in this House, was that the allocation of quotas for exporters this year should be based ou the transactions of exporters during the last three years. The conference suggested that the quantity of wheat received by shippers aud pools this year sbould form the basis, the quota to be fixed at the earliest moment when it was ascertained how the wheat was being received by exporters.

I understand that the erection of buildings by the State Government is being delayed pending a decision as to whether the Commonwealth building shall be of three or seven stories. under consideration in the department. Originally, it was intended to construct a three -storied building; but, as the result of representations made, it was thought that it might be advisable to construct a seven-storied building, to cost the same storied building, but to face a different direction in the square. A letter has lately been received from Brisbane offering the Government a certain building at a considerably lower price than the estimated cost of the new building, and consideration is now being given to the question whether it would be advisable to purchase this building or proceed with the erection of a new building. It seems to me, at this jiuncture, that the Government is committed to the construction of the new building. for Trade and Customs inform me whether the Government is exercising any supervision over the purchase of this year's tobacco crop?

I have since reviewed the official file of correspondence in the Prime Minister's Department on this subject, and desire to supplement the information then given by my colleague, the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins). For some time an arraugement has existed between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments, under ""which patients suffering from leprosy in the north-west of AVestern Australia are admitted to the Darwin Leprosarium for treatment. Payment is made by the State to the Commonwealth for the services so rendered. Australia has entered into a contract with -ihe Port George Mission, near Broome, Western Australia, under which the mission has undertaken to transport patients from that centre to Darwin. In July last, when a batch of aboriginal leper patients was about to be transferred from Beagle Bay to the Darwin lazaret in the mission lugger, the Commonwealth navigation authorities pointed out that it was necessary that a certificated master be employed, as the journey extended beyond the waters of the State. The Premier of Western Australia asked that the requirements of the Navigation Act be waived to enable the skipper of the mission lugger, who, lie stated, Avas thoroughly competent and experienced but not certificated, to remain in charge of the vessel for the journey from Beagle Bay to Darwin, a distance of 600 miles, in order that the additional cost involved-late r stated to be £75might be avoided. The Commonwealth Government was unable to see its way to comply with this request. Statements that the accommodation and sanitary arrangements were unsuitable came to the notice of the Common( wealth navigation authorities, in consequence of which clearance of the vessel from Broome was withheld and the reports were communicated to the State Premier, who replied that the Broome harbourmaster considered that the lugger could carry fifteen native passengers comfortably and that it was intended to convey twelve only. In view of the assurance of the State Government that the accommodation was sufficient and suitable, authority for the clearance of the vessel was granted. Some weeks later, in reply to my telegraphic inquiryin regard to reports published in the press that the conditions under which these lepers were being transported had caused adverse comment, the Premier informed me that a committee composed of the manager of the Harbour Department, who happened to be in Broome, the manager of the Aborigines. Department Native Station, and the Broome harbourmaster, had made an investigation, as a result of which all were satisfied fhat the boat was seaworthy and not overcrowded. The Premier added that the captain of The Government of Western the vessel, Captain Scott, was also perfectly satisfied with the equipment.. In a letter to me, dated the 12th August, the Premier statedTliu Public Health Department is perfectly satisfied that the vessel Rolla-nd is seaworthy and that she is definitely not overcrowded. The department is also satisfied that it has been made the victim of -a certain section of interests, and that the difficulties and complaints that have heen raised have been due, not so much as to the solicitous care for the aboriginal patients as to the fact that the department is pursuing its own policy and transferring these patients to Darwin by means of one of the mission's luggers.",15,Assistance To Purchase Fertilizers

I have received from the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr pense involved, only four were provided. Nelson) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The administration of the police in connection with native affairs in the Northern Territory."" Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion. [3.2] I move That the House do now adjourn. Owing to the limited time at my disposal, I shall be forced to omit a number of details, but I desire to focus the attention for 300 miles, the horses being more a of the Government, and the people of Australia, on police matters as affecting native affairs in the Northern Territory. I have received numerous telegrams from settlers in the Gulf of Carpentaria country, beseeching me to request the Government to intercede in order to save them from the natives in the locality who are adopting a threatening attitude. So far the Minister for the Interior( Mr to travel 100 miles to reach an objective Perkins) has not replied to those telegrams. I shall deal with that later. Honourable members know of the tragic death of Mounted Constable McColl recently at Woodah Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In the execution of his duty, he was speared through the heart by a native, and other persons in the party escaped death by a mere fraction of an inch, the spears of the natives actually tearing away the _ puggarees from their hats. The survivors of that small, ill-equipped party are lucky to be alive to-day. Those who are in a position to know, attribute the death of Mounted Constable McColl more to the defective ammunition with which the expedition was supplied than to any other cause. The other police in the patrol party were also in the unenviable position of being unable to defend themselves because of the defective ammunition supplied to them in accordance with the suicidal policy of economy followed by the Northern Territory Administration. In other ways, also, the party was badly equipped for the mission on which it was sent. It was not given the services of a sufficient number of native police to carry out the duties expected of it. The expedition asked for twelve policemen, but because of the exMoreover, the party was split into two sectionsa sea party and a land partyagainst the advice of the patrol officers who knew the country. The land party was forced to take horses-again , contrary to the advice of the officers who knew the country-som e of which were police crocks of no value whatever to the expedition, and had to be left by the wayside to perish. The small party had to cart tons of wood to corduroy the tracks to enable the horses to cross over the quagmires and swamps which had to be traversed. The patrol ""foot-slogged"" hindrance than a help. I repeat that all this hardship was due to the Administration having disregarded the protests of the men who were charged with carrying out the mission. The members of the patrol say that the horses supplied to them were about as useless as would be a motor car without petrol, and that because of their horses they had only ten miles away. The sea section of the patrol was sent out similarly ill-equipped. It put to sea in a crazy craft which was unseaworthy, and consequently the lives of all in it were threatened time after time. Had anything happened to the sea party, the land party which was to meet it at an appointed place on the coast, would have fared even worse than it did. At times the launch nearly foundered; it was incapable, under full pressure, of overtaking a canoe dug out of a tree and paddled by a native. The Administration refused the request of those who were competent to give advice on all matters affecting the expedition. I , therefore, charge it with having displayed gross incompetence and a callous disregard for the lives of the members of the patrol, by ignoring the advice of those",17,Government Works Programme Federal Capital Territory Christmas Relief

The natives in the area in which the murder took place have been responsible for murdering 21 Europeans and Asiatics over a period of years, besides numerous aboriginals belonging to other tribes. Aboriginals of the kind found in the Gulf of Carpentaria country are not found any where else in Australia. mixture of Japanese and Macassars, and combine the cunning of the Japanese with the strength of the Macassar and the barbaric savagery of the wild aboriginal. They are pursuing their fetish of murder far beyond their tribal boundaries. There are now four policemen stationed at Groote Eylandt to protect the missionaries from the onslaughts of the natives. Telegrams which I have received from settlers in the gulf country have informed me that the friendly natives have advised them that the natives belonging to the Ballamoona tribe, which murdered Constable McColl, have threatened to wipe out the whole of the members of the police party, as well as the missionaries and settlers in the district. The settlers have pleaded with me to make strong representations to the Government in order to protect the white population, but so far I have not received any advice of the Government's intention. numerous? not known, because no white man has ever passed through their country. I say that advisedly. The intention of the natives to destroy the mission, and to kill any police who might' he sent against them, was known to the authorities twelve months ago, but no action was taken. These natives far exceed in cunning and savagery any of the other tribes on the Goast. For a long time past, they have been prepared to receive any parties of missionaries or police who may visit the locality. The foreshores in that area are covered with dense scrub, through which the natives have cut tracks so as to entice I parties of white men towalk intoan ambush and be speared. That is what happened to Constable McColl. Knowing these things, however, theauthorities yet allowed the police party to go out with poor equipment, the whole party consisting only of four white police and four native hoys. The cunning of the natives may be realized from the fact that they send their lubras down to' the foreshore to entice unsuspecting strangers into the jungle where they may be speared. I have here a letter from tliebrother of Constable McColl, who was They are a murdered by the blacks. It is as follows:Dealing with tlie matter of my brother's death at Woodah Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, during August last, I , on belialf of the wholo of my family (those of the late Albert Stewart McColl), desire you to bring certain matters connected with the above before the House in order that they might receive attention which wo consider is overdue. I ani aware that my late, brother's body is still lying"" at Woodah Island. Our desire in this matter has been made known-that we require his body brought into Darwin without delay. Any hesitation in this matter may mean the dismembering of the body for ceremonial purposes by the natives connected wit h the murder aud finally result in our not being able to locate any of his remains. This is a serious phase of the matter to our family and one that demands prompt action by the police. It appears that certain members of the Northern Territory force are now stationed at Groote Island and we hope that the authorities can make immediate arrangements for their dispatch on this mission. I would have spared the family the knowledge of what might happen, but, seeing that they are already aware of the fact that the body will probably be exhumed, and the' bones used for ceremonial purposes, there is no reason why I should not mention the matter here. I trust that the Government will take immediate action to fulfil tlie wishes of the murdered man's family. As I have said, this tribe has been responsible for the murder of 21 outsiders, apart from numerous tribal murders. I should like honourable members to understand what happens when murders of this kind take place. One can visualize the tribe gathered together for a grand corroboree in celebration of the event. Around the warriors are gathered the lubras and piccaninnies, and all the pantomime of stalking the victim, culminating",18,Northern Territory Administration Motion Foe Adjournment

This stage is greeted with a final yell of triumph that rends the night, and every piccaninny in the tribe who witnesses the spectacle is longing for the time to come when he, too, can emulate the. bravery of his elders. Eor this reason, the Government should not delay too long action designed to place this tribe under control. Now it is intended to send a peace 7 mission to talk matters over with the members of this tribe, and the expedition has the blessing and approval of the Minister. Experienced patrol officers have had the greatest difficulty iu travelling through this country in the dry weather, and, as the wet season is now starting, what chance have tlie members of the peace mission to achieve anything in the same territory after 50 to 60 inches of rain have fallen? The Minister cannot escape responsibility for the disaster which seems likely to befall this unfortunate party, because he has authorized its despatch. It is not likely that the mission will be able to inspire confidence in the breasts of the natives; the memory of the occurrences at the Roper River Mission are too fresh in their minds. At the present time, a police constable is standing his trial on a charge of having ill-treated a native. say that the law must be vindicated; but bhey attempt to do so only so long as the accused is not a missioner, or attached to a mission.

The chairman was the Reverend Nash, and the other members were Mr to go scot-free, even though the authoriAshe and Dr. Cook. So revolting was the evidence tendered that it was heard in camera, witli the exception that Archdeacon Herring, and the secretary of the Church Mission Society, Mr Long, were present at the hearing for three days.

I do not know whether the evidence was forAvarded to the Governor General and the Minister for the Interior, but I know that the findings of the committee reached them. Nevertheless, the whole matter was hushed up, and nothing was made public, nor were criminal proceedings instituted. like that? must, in fairness, state that the Roman Catholic Mission is one of the best conducted I know of, and I am not a Roman Catholic. I am dealing with a specific case. It is a fact that all mention of this vile and brutal treatment of the natives by their reputed protector, who professed to be a disciple of Christ, was suppressed by the Government, and its action in thus suppressing the truth is interpreted in the north as meaning that, it condones the offences. Why is the Government discriminating between Constable Stott, who is standing his trial on the charge of having ill treated a native, and representatives of a mission, against whom similar charges have been made? The missioner concerned is the same man who brought tears to the eyes of southern The authorities audiences hy relating stories of the brutal treatment to which the natives were subjected by settlers and others.

About the time of the to protect the mission murder, the district in which the tragedy occurred was declared a special reserve for the aborigines, and in consequence of the atrocity the authorities in Darwin will protect them against despatched an expedition consisting of to which they three or four police officers, who were armed in the same way as were thetroopers who followed them later.

They returned merely' foi 1 further supplies, and later they set out again for the scene of the atrocity. If these police officers had any complaint to make regarding their equipment, one would The Northern Territory naturally think that they would have made it known upon their return. In June, 1933, at the end of the wet season, they continued their search for the murderers.

Evidence appears to be forthcoming McColl's weapon having misfired, because I believe that when his revolver was found it was noted that the cap of a cartridge had been struck by the pin of the weapon but had not been exploded. Yet no complaint was made that the party was too small, or that it was improperly equipped. Of course, it had to take the risk of attack by the natives, because it was searching in jungle country. One or two policemen have told me that the size of the party was ample, it is sheer ill fortune that Constable McColl was not sufficiently experienced i i i bush life in the Northern Territory to avoid being separated from his companions. The practice adopted in this case was not different from that foldirected public attention to affairs in the lowed on previous occasions. It must be admitted that, having to go in search of wild natives in scrub country, the members of the expedition took their lives in their hands. The Administration at Darwin considered that it should send out a bigger expedition, and it then proposed to equip a party of twelve or thirteen white men,, assisted by a similar number of natives. A communication to that effect was sent to me at Canberra, and the department was asked to forward a further supply of ammunition for the purposes of the expedition; but, as Mr Brown, the secretary of the department, was then leaving Canberra for Darwin, I requested the Administration not' to despatch the party until Mr Brown had arrived and considered the matter on the spot. In the meantime we sent the ammunition *and supplies asked for, so that if it were considered necessary to despatch the party, no delay would occur. When the press was advised of the proposal, it immediately announced that a punitive expedition was to he sent. expedition was ever contemplated by the Government. Refutation of the suggestion that a punitive party was being organized was repeatedly denied, and I think that honourable members will agree that in this matter the press blundered in not accepting the Government's assurance. Careful inquiries were made by the department as to the best course to follow, and in the meantime the Mr Perkins. missionaries in various parts of the regarding Constable Northern Territory, and former missionaries in other parts of Australia, suggested that a peaceful expedition be sent to Caledon Bay.

Otherwise he would not have undertaken the job. not have been foolish enough to undertake it. An outcry was raised throughout the Commonwealth, and the press rendered good service, in that it Northern Territory. Most people were surprised to know that in that part of Australia are large numbers of aborigines. The Government has received advice from all directions. Many missionaries wrote to the newspapers on the subject, and the following proposal was submitted to the Government by the Victorian branch of the Church Missionary SocietyThat with a view to showing to the aborigines the purposes and aims of the Government, and with the further view to the proper execution of justice in connection with tlie recent happenings, a small party of experienced missionaries, unarmed, should be invited to approach the natives, thus to seek a better mutual understanding between the parties concerned; and that the Government be requested to take no action pending the result of the embassy. The suggestion was strongly supported by the Rev. H . E. Warren, who interviewed me in Melbourne. I did not give an immediate answer to the project, preferring to make inquiries concerning the capabilities of Mr Warren. I discovered that he had been instrumental in foundNo such ing the Groote Eylandt Mission Station, and had had considerable experience of the Caledon Bay aborigines, and that, in every respect, he was a most reliable and experienced man. ^At the time when the Groote Eylandt Mission was established, the aborigines thereabouts were just as savage as they are at present at Caledon( Bay, but, as a result of contact with the mission station, they have become tractable and friendly.",21,Northern Territory Administration Motion Foe Adjournment

Mr Dyett, a capable man who has had a long experience of native affairs in the Territory and probably possesses a greater knowledge of the Caledon Bay tribes than does any resident of Darwin, declared that the mission would be successful and offered to accompany Mr ""Warren. The two men were eager to proceed to Caledon Bay immediately, but the Government suggested that it would be advisable to postnatives of Caledon Bay made an pone the trip until after the wet season. The Government also kept in mind the fact that ""the blacks in the neighbourhood are flushed with their recent victory, and, Groote Eylandt have protested that the therefore, are in a more dangerous mood than they will be after a couple of months have elapsed. settlers in the district who are being threatened by the blacks? that presently. Dyett declared that they were so familiar with conditions in the territory that the wet season would not interfere in any way with their plans, and that they would set off, provided the Government gave them the necessary permission. also indicated that they did not want financial assistance from the Government, but would undertake the task as part of their mission work. It has been said by some that if the Government were to send an armed police expedition, blood would be shed, and it is claimed by others that if the peace expedition goes to the terrilightened regarding the details of this tory, blood will also be spilled. In each case, apparently,. the blood' will be upon my head. As I desire to have as little bloodshed as possible, I approve of the sending of the missionary party.

The honourable member has said that settlers have been threatened by the aborigines. Admittedly, settlers at Groote Eylandt have been threatened, but when the Government sent a party to safeguard them its action was condemned. On looking through the departmental files, I find that, twenty years ago, the attack on settlers at Groote Eylandt, and what haj>pened then can be repeated to-day. The missionaries at mission needs no protection; that when they undertook mission work, they were prepared to risk their lives. Despite their protests, the Government considers it wise to take the precautionary measure of sending a protection party to the island. Because of their victories, the natives arc in high feather. In addition to killing Mr Warren and Mr Constable McColl, they have captured abandoned supplies which belonged to the white man. Their appetites are whetted for further victories. The Government realizes the seriousness of the position', but it is confident that They these two experienced men will do nothing foolhardy. They go at their own risk, and I admire them tremendously for their courage. The expedition proposes to leave Sydney on the 6th of this month, and in order that the two men concerned may know the opinion of the Government, they will be endebate.

If , as the honourable member for the Northern Territory alleges, the evidence discloses a serious state of affairs, the Government should not hesitate to appoint a committee to investigate his charges. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the man concerned was not suspended as a result of the investigations of the committee of inquiry. I know something of the value of mission work, particularly in the Northern Territory. I trust that the Minister will take early action to test the charges of the honourable member for tlie Northern Territory, so as to prevent any repetition of the delay that took place in respect of the inquiry into the loss of the Douglas Mawson. I do not believe that those women, ever reached land after the boat foundered; iu fact, escape would be impossible, because of the waters in those parts being infested with sharks. I am pleased that the Minister has realized the drastic nature of the charges of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and promised to give them, serious consideration. Dr. .MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.4S] I have been to Darwin twice. .1 know a. good deal of the work of missions, especially in the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands, and I have nothing but admiration for them. The honourable member foi the Northern Territory ( Mr1 Nelson) has made serious allegations against a man named Langford Smith, who is clothed in the garb of religion, and the Government should not hesitate to take action to investigate them. Some time ago, a native named Neighbor, with three companions, robbed a house in order to obtain food. They were captured by a. constable, chained together, and were proceeding on their way to Darwin. They came to a flooded creek, and the policeman, when endeavouring to cross it,was thrown from his horse, and Tendered senseless by a kick on the head from the horse's hoof. Neighbor managed to free himself from the chains, dived into the creek, rescued the policeman, and brought him ashore. None of the other natives tried to run away. As the result of the efforts of a Mrs. Bon, with whom I was glad to be associated, Neighbor was awarded the King's Gold Medal. The authorities in Darwin, did not give that aborigine a dog's chance. They had him photographed, wearing the medal which had heen presented to him. The photograph and medal may be seen among the collection of historical and other records in the basement of this building. They took no interest whatever in his welfare, aud afterwards allowed him to drift away.' Subsequently, Judge Ewing, of Tasmania, was appointed a commissioner to inquire into charges in regard to the general administration of the Northern Territory. A lady named Mrs. l?erau admitted on oath that she had shot a man, and stated further that she was subjected to a great deal of annoyance by Dr. Gilruth, the Administrator, who had police watching her movements. A ll the evidence taken in connection with that matter was suppressed by the Administration, and is now hidden in the archives of this Parliament. If all that has been said about Mr Langford Smith, formerly known as the Reverend Langford Smith, is true, lie must be a sexual maniac, and should be sterilized. All such men ought to be shot. I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for having brought up this matter for discussion this afternoon; and I hope that the Minister, whose sincerity is undoubted, will do all thatlies in his power to remove this stigma from the escutcheon of Australia. I am sure that all honourable members will support, him in any action which he may consider necessary to have the charges cleared up. I emphasize the very serious nature of the charges made this afternoon by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) with reference to certain phases of administration and mission activities. The position cannot possibly be allowed to rest where it is. The charges call for a thorough investigation in order to clear the good name of all mission workers. The honourable member for Northern Territory says that he is in a position to indicate exactly the nature of the horrifying experiences detailed by him this afternoon. For my part, as a representative of the people, I shall not be satisfied, until the chara'p""",24,Northern Territory Administration Motion Foe Adjournment

It has been stated that the man concerned has_ not been removed from his present position in the mission. Because of the serious nature of the allegations it is imperative that the fullest inquiry should be made in the interests not, only of the mission, but also of the man concerned. The good name of Australia and of the mission is at stake. ""We must, at the earliest, opportunity, be informed definitely whether or not there is any truth in the charges, [f they are proved, definite action should be taken against any person or persons guilty of such revolting conduct.

In Senate's requests resumed from the 31st October (vide page 4112). Item 281Drugs and chemicals, viz.:(C) Alum, alum cake, and sulphate of alumina, including alumina ferric, per ton, British, £ 5 ; general, £6 10s. Senate's requestLeave out "" per ton British, £ 5 ; general, £fl 10s.""; and insert "" a d valorem-British, 50 per cent.; general, 70 per cent."" That the requested amendment be made. hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr ""White) will agree to a reconsideration of the duty on this subitem, because I feel sure that, if the Senate's requested amendment is accepted, we shall do a great injustice to a deserving Australian industry. I , therefore, urge that the item be referred back to the Tariff Board for further investigation. In the 1921-2S tariff the rates of duty were £4 a ton British, and £5 10s. a ton general. When I was Minister for Trade and CustomsI increased the British rate to £5 a ton, and the general rate to £6 10s. a ton, because I believed that the industry had put up a good case for a greater margin of protection. I am informed that 90 per cent, of the trade is in sulphate of alumina, which is alumina combined with sulphuric acid,-and is used mainly for water purification and the manufacture of paper. The rates imposed by the Scullin Government were recommended by the Tariff Board in 1926 after a searching inquiry into the industry. That rate was passed by the House of Representatives on the recommendation of the present Minister when the tariff was before us early this year. The Minister then said that a number of items in the schedule would, from time to time, be investigated by the board. I presume this is one of those that were referred back to the board for reconsideration, following the adoption of the Ottawa agreement. When this item was before the Senate, that chamber, on the recommendation of Senate Ministers, adopted the board's recommendation made this year, to remove the fixed rates of duty, aud substitute ad valorem rates of 50 per cent. British, committee: Consideration of aud 70 per cent, general. The protection was thereby reduced from £5 to £3 a ton; and it will be further reduced to £2 14s. lOd. a ton by the application of the exchange adjustment provisions. The matter caused honourable senators some concern, and at the request of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in that chamber (.Senator O'Halloran), the item was recommitted for further consideration. The representative of the Government in the Senate (Senator McLachlan) undertook that the whole question would be reconsidered by the Tariff Board before it was dealt with in this chamber.

Sulphate of alumina (including alum cake tion of the importance of the purification and alumina ferric) -The use of sulphate of alumina is in two main fields(a) .Paper-making; (6) Water purification. (a) Paper-making -From 400 to 500 tons of sulphate of alumina are used annually in tlie various paper mills in Australia, and since 1023 all requirements used have been of local nmnufiicture. Prior to the establishment of this industry in Australia, as much as £40 per tori had been charged for imported material. As the local manufacturer has always charged a fair price, the paper mills have reciprocated by dealing locally, despite the fact that at times they could have bought cheaper overseas. (b) Water Purification -A t the time of the last Tariff Board inquiry into this industry (1020), Brisbane, Launceston and Rockhampton were treating their water supplies with sulphate of alumina. Since 1920 there have been big developments in this sphere, and Sulphates Proprietary Limited assisted in the formation of a subsidiary engineering company, which specializes in water problems. This company has erected the' following filtration plants during the period under review:Nine filtration plants for town water supplies, with a total capacity of 8,186,000 gallons daily; Twenty-one filtration plants for industrial -purposes, with a total capacity of 3,048,000 gallons daily; Fifteen filtration plants for swimming pools, with a total capacity of 4,720,000 department or municipality in Ausjrallons daily; a total of 15,954,000 gallons daily, whilst many other companies have also installed plant for similar purposes. I stress the point that the reduction of complete approval of the efficiency of the the protection from £5 to £2 14s. lOd. a industry and of the reasonableness of the ton makes it lower by 25s. a ton than that price charged. Sulphates Proprietary granted under the Massy-Greene tariff Limited, and its subsidiary company, of 1921. The committee probably wishes to considerable value, and have thus renknow whether the protection recomdered service of a higher standard than mended by the Tariff Board, and' adopted can be given by importing interests. £13 3s. 4d. a ton under the proposed rewill be done to an industry which has and brought local authorities to a realizaof water supplies. gest that the Australian unit is too small to be economical? do not. The demand for this product has been greatly increased as the result of its availability .at short notice, improved methods of handling, the reduction of the price of equipment, and the technical advice that has been given by experts to municipalities throughout Australia. It will not be long before the Australian manufacturers will be able to raise their output to 5,000 tons per annum. When that stage is reached, I believe that they will welcome further consideration of the matter by the Tariff Board. They do not want a higher duty than is adequate to protect the industry to-day. The figures that I have quoted show that the importer can land sulphate of alumina at a price £1 12s. a ton cheaper than that at which the local manufacturer can produce it profitably. No water supply tralia has .objected that the price of the commodity -is too high.

89,Mr Foede,"In my opinion, theyLet us examine what the local industry -has done for the Australian users of this product. It was established at the end of 1918, and iu 1919 commenced supplying sulphate of alumina at £19 10s. a ton. Its only customer at that time was -a paper-mill; it was not in a position -to meet the whole of the Australian demand. There was then no duty. In 1920, the Brisbane Water Board paid £29 15s. a ton for sulphate of. alumina, the price in Great Britain being £14 a ton, or less than one-half of what was -charged in Australia by importing agents. In 1921 the Brisbane Water Board paid £28 a ton, and in 1922, approximately £25 15s. a ton. In .the latter year the price in England was £12 10s. a ton. Late in 1921, a duty of £4 a ton had been imposed, but supplies had already been obtained from overseas at the price that I have given. The Australian industry was not yet in a position to supply tlie -whole of the market. Early in 1924, the Brisbane Water Board paid £22 10s. a ton for imported sulphate of alumina. In that year the Australian company made its first sale to that body at £16 a ton. delivered at Brisbane. .result? duct was immediately dropped to £13 10s. a. ton, a reduction of almost 50 per cent., to meet the Australian competition. That proves that Australian users of -sulphate of alumina had previously been fleeced, and that they benefited greatly from the establishment of the local industry. From 1925 to 1928, the Brisbane Water Board used the Australian product, exclusively, the price charged being £15 10s. a ton. It was thus prepared to give a preference of £2 a ton so that the Australian industry, which had been responsible for the reduction of the price, might be supported and maintained. In 1929, the board bought a consignment of English sulphate of alumina for £12 5s. a ton, but, owing' to representations made to it that the local industry would not be able to carry on operations ""without substantial support in Australia, it agreed to purchase future requirements from the Australian manufacturers for £14 10s. a ton. During 1931, 1932, and 1933, the Australian company has sold to the board a'special sulphate for £13 10s. a ton. Its. competition in this product Mr Forde. would come from alumina ferric, which, under the amended conditions, could he landed in Australia for about £11 10s. a ton. Every Australian municipality or commercial enterprise using sulphate of alumina has had. its plant started or its operators instructed in the efficient treatment of water by the chemical operators of this company. The following towns are dependent upon the chemicals covered by this item for the purification of their water supply:Queensland -Brisbane, Maryborough, Rockluiinptou, Iimisfail. Victoria -Shepparton , Orbost, Yallourn, , Kyabram, Wonthaggi, New Hallam water scheme (for 1'Yankston-Moniington Peninsula). Tas mania -L a u neeston. South Australia -Peterborough . .Two South.

The Australian paper manufacturing industry need it for What was the both water purification and manufacThe price of the imported proturing purposes. Many of our most important woollen, mills and butter factories also need it. The amount of chemical required to purify water is very small, averaging only 25 parts per 1,000,000 gallons, so that the cost of the chemical is equivalent to only a fraction of I d . per 1,000 gallons.. .

I have received the following copy of a letter on this subject from the Kyabram Water Trust, dated the 30th June, 1933:Wlien using alumina ferric in 1030-31, wo paid 25s. per cwt. for same, and obtained it from William Adams and Company, 521-3 Collins-street, Melbourne. No technical assistance or advice was tendered beyond a printed circular as unclosed herewith. In .July, 1931, William Adams a.nd Company, in reply to an inquiry from me for alumina ferric, informed me that they had no stocks of same, but could supply sulphate of alumina at £2H 12s. Od. per ton. In the meanlime, I was in communication with your firm, and wasquoted by you £15 10s. per ton for sulphate of alumina. You then took up the question of clearing our water in a very practicable manner by visiting Kyabram and treating the water in Messrs. Sulphates Proprietary-Limited, our storage basin. The result was so satisfactory that we have used your chemical ever since, and have been very gratified with the Dear Sirs, results obtained. Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) Secretary. .1. direct the attention of honourable memamended price based on the reduction. bers to _the difference between the price of the imported sulphate of For Brunner Mond& Co. (Australasia) Pty. alumina and the locally-manufactured product. The local industry is Thoroughly efficient, and as it is not exploiting the public, it should be protected. If the company were sheltering behind a high tariff and exploiting the public, the Government would be justified in reducing the duty; but that is not the case. It is illuminating to note that, although alumina ferric could be landed in Australia i i i 1930-31 for £.1.2 10s. a ton, including all charges, the sole Australian agent was charging a country water board £25 a ton for it, or .100 per cent, on landed cost. A good deal is said at times about the necessity for throwing a searchlight on the operations of manufacturers. It will be seen from what-1 have said that a searchlight should also be thrown on the operations of some importers, who have been fleecing the chemical carried a profit, of only 15 per cent, to the manufacturers when it was being supplied for £15 10s. a ton ex works. In 1926, the Australian company guaranteed that the price would not go beyond £15 10s. a ton ex works. It has not only carried out that under-' taking, but' has also improved the product, by making it in a concentrated form, so that less is required. This improvement is equivalent to a reduction in price of £3 a ton. This item should be referred back to the Tariff Board because the board has made several serious errors. There is an error, for instance, in the board's table of landing costs on page 7 of its report. Freight has heen assessed by the board on a basis of one ton of 40 cubic feet at 45s. a ton, whereas freight can be obtained on heavy chemicals at 32s. 6d. a ton, as the following letter indicates:K. S. & A. Bank Buildings, 370-380 Collins-street, Melbourne, C.l 3rd March, 1933. 395 Collins-street, Melbourne, C. I . Wu are pleased to advise that the rate of freight on Soda Ash for shipment from Liverand you will notice that your shipment per S.S. Clan Macneil has been invoiced at the Yours faithfully , Ltd., (Signed) G. W. PIERCE, Local Manager. That freight would apply to all heavy chemicals, such as sulphate of alumina, as it does in the case of Australian coastal freights. Another serious error in the board's report relates to the manner in which this chemical is imported. The board appears to have accepted the statement of a representative of the British manufacturers, that all sulphate of alumina, including alumina ferric, comes to Australia in drums, which occupy 57 cubic feet 9 cubic inches to the ton weight, whereas the fact is that commercial sulphate of alumina, which accounts for 90 per cent, of the Australian market, would be imported in sacks, occupying 40 cubic feet to the ton. The result of these two errors is that, whereas the Tariff Board states that freight and insurance public. The Australian-made would amount to £3 6s. 9d. a ton, the true figure would be only £.1 15s. 6d. a ton, a difference of £1 l is . 3d. a ton. In view of these very serious errors, the whole subject should be referred back to the board for further consideration. Another factor that should he considered in connection with this industry is that the Australian manufacturers of sulphate of alumina are helping water hoards and other users of water-purification equipment to obtain efficient and cheap plant. For instance, chemical feeders are being sold to-day at £13 10s. each whereas on the 20th July last, similar overseas feeders cost £46 10s. at par and could not be landed here for less than £70 each. Fifteen locally manufactured feeders have recently been sold to the Public Works Department of New South Wales. Chlorinators, which are essential for sterilizing water supplies of towns, public baths, butter factories and other enterprises, are being manufactured and sold in Australia for less than the ruling price of similar equipment in Britain, and America. For these reasons, I sincerely trust that this item will be referred back to the Tariff Board. If a suitable amendment of that nature is moved, I shall be glad to support it, though I do not desire t rt move it in my capacity as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have made a personal investigation into the circumstances of this industry, and am satisfied that it is thoroughly deserving of assistance. Trade and Customs) [4.29] -In view of the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) I shall give the reasons why the Government is asking the committee to adhere to the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The honourable gentleman, said the subject should be reconsidered because the freight on soda ash was at a certain rate.

The duty because it can call for customs house in which the Government is now asking the voices to enable it to come to an accurate committee to accept is in substitution of decision. an ad valorem duty. rates were British, £5 per ton; general, consideration, because the Government £6 10s. per ton. The new rates will be does not wish to take any action 50 per cent, and 70 per cent., respectively, in connection with an Australian industry which should be adequate. The Tariff that may jeopardize the employment of Board has made a very exhaustive investigation into this industry, and has made it clear that it has no desire whatever to damage the industry in any way. Yet this company has despatched circulars to honourable members in which it says that the Tariff Board's report contains an inaccurate and incorrect statement in setting out the freight and landing charges on imported sulphate of alumina. Such statements are not only contained in the circular, but have also been made to the Government. The company's representative interviewed me immediately the board's report was published, and made a complaint. Thinking that the company might be able to prove its case, I referred the matter back to the board, which informed me in definite terms that the freight and insurance charges amounting to £3 6s. 9d. a ton used in its calculations were not selected at random, but were the actual charges on shipments of sulphate of alumina imported at Sydney and Melbourne, and that the freight charge of £1 15s. 6d. quoted by Sulphates Proprietary Limited is based on a quotation for soda ash furnished by the Australian distributors of that commodity.

94,Mr White,"Australian workmen. In very few instances has the board, after reconsidering a recommendation, deviated from its first decision. In connection with this matter, the board reports1 The board feels that in making this recommendation of ad valorem duties of 50 per cent. British, and 70 per cent, foreign, every justifiable effort has been made to conserve and protect the interests of tlie Australian industry, while still keeping in mind the ultimate cost to the consumer. Honourable members are aware that for weeks there has been a good deal of lobbying in connection with these duties, which led some to believe that the Government was doing wrong, and that the Tariff Board was responsible for some injustice. The Tariff Board states^ further'.Kvav if the cost of all' the materials, direct labour, packing, plant, repairs and depreciation, and factory overhead, were deducted from the Australian selling price, the resultant figure would still exceed the f.o.b. price of sulphate of alumina from the United Kingdom. In other words, profits, administration, distribution, interest, technical and selling expenses represent more than the total cost in the United Kingdom. Those are the reasons why the Government' accepted the board's recommendation after an unbiased inquiry into the industry. In one communication, the company states,"" "" It will be impossible to carry oh the industry in Australia under these conditions "". I challenge the accuracy of that statement, as I believe that in twelve mouths' time the company will still be conducting its business if the duties recommended by the board are adopted. Similar statements have been made in respect of other industries which are always anxious to retain the highest possible duties. Tlie Government is concerned, with not only the interests of the manufacturers, but abo those of Australian consumers, who should be able to obtain necessary commodities at reasonable prices. The Tariff Board has to ensure that manufacturers are charging reasonable prices, and that the interests of consumers ' are not prejudicially affected. Under this item it is proposed to replace of alum and. sulphate of alumina. From a. specific duty of £5 a ton British and .1925 to 1932, the price of alum has been £6 10s. a ton foreign by ad valorem duties reduced from £10 10s. to £8 10s. a ton, andof 50 per cent. British and 70 per cent, that of sulphate of alumina from £8 5s. to foreign. The Deputy Leader of the £6 15s. a ton. These reductions are due Opposition ( Mr Forde) told the comlargely to economic causes, and not to the mittee that a duty of 50 per cent, on British importations of sulphate of alumina will mean a reduction of the British duty to £3 a ton, which, after allowing for exchange adjustment, would be further reduced to £2 16s. a'ton. A t the same time, he said that the price of this commodity is about £14 a ton. I cannot understand how a duty of 50 per cent, is equal to £3 a ton. He also said that the proposed duty is 20s. a ton less than the duty imposed under the 1921-30 tariff. The party to which I belong is sometimes inaccurately described as the low tariff or free trade party, but the fiscal policy which we support is that of adequate protection for sound Australian industries. The Tariff Board is a better guide to the committee than the ex parte statement of a company directly concerned in the manufacture of this product. I know nothing of the industry; but it is not worthy of protection, I submit, if an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent. British and 70 per cent, foreign is insufficient. The Deputy. Leader of the Opposition said that, after the local industry became established, there was a sudden drop in the price of the imported article. If that is so, I say, "" All success to the local industry-"". In many cases beneficial results have followed the establishment of Australian industries; but, if those controlling them are exploiting the consumers, they must expect to receive the same treatment as importers who are alleged to be guilty of similar practices. The Ottawa agreement provides that Australian manufacturers must expect reasonable competition in the production of many commodities. I am not familiar with the articles mentioned in this item, and I have no knowledge of those concerned in their manufacture, but the committee will agree that the duties recommended fey the Tariff Board are liberal, and the local industry should be ""satisfied with them. Tariff Board states that in England there has been a progressive decline in the cost",30,Geohge Clemekts Pool Has Been Reduced To 32s Od Per Ton

96,Mr Nad2n (Perth) [4.42],"Th econditions obtaining in Australia. It is necessary to refer to only one paragraph of the Tariff Board's report to justify its recommendation that the duty should be reduced.from £5 a ton British to an ad valorem rate of 50 per cent. When reference is made to the price of alum it should be to the price paid in England, and not to that which the people. of Australia pay for alum imported from England. It is quite misleading to make the comparison with the price of English goods after they have been shipped to Australia and subjected to certain charges. The Tariff Board shows that the price of powdered alum f.o.b. Eugland is. £9 13s. 3d. a ton, while the cost landed in Australia is £23 3s. 4d. It is absurd to take the Australian cost as a basis for comparison. the English price to water supply authorities who require large quantities of this material? ing the duty which should be placed on this material, so that the Australian industry may operate under fair conditions. In order that we may decide what is a ' fair duty we must compare the price in Australia with the price of similar goods in other countries, such as England. Usually, the English prices are quoted f.o.b., and the Australian prices at the works, thus giving an advantage to the Australian-made article. In order to get a proper comparison the English prices should he written down a little. Powdered alum in England costs £9 13s. 3d. a ton, compared with £16 in Australia. The in the lump are £8 15s. and £16. If both quotations were on an f.o.b. basis, the Australian price would be about double the English price. Sulphate of alumina is quoted at £7 10s. 9d. a ton f.o.b. English ports; the Australian price is £14 16s. aton. show that the people of Australia are being charged unduly high prices for alum and sulphate of alumina. notknow, whether the reason is exploitation by Australian manufacturers, in' efficiency in Australian factories, or the possibility of the Australian industry being too small to be carried on economically. Whatever the cause, the fact remains that the people of Australia pay nearly double the English price. Having investigated this matter thoroughly, the Tariff Board recommended a margin of 50 per cent, ad valorem. That should be sufficient.in' view of the added protection afforded by freight, insurance, primage, landing costs, cartage, and other charges, amounting to £S 10s. a ton. If the Australian industry cannot carry on with that measure of protection, it.should go out of existence. I support the Senate's request that the duties be 50 per cent. British and 70 per cent, general. -When the manufacture of sulphate was commenced in Australia some years ago, the price of this commodity immediately dropped by nearly £10 a ton. Those of us who have watched the operations of manufacturers and importers for a number of years know that if thisAustralian industry is destroyed by outside competition, overseas manufacturers will levy roll on Australian consumers. They have .done so before. It is well known that as r.iie output of a factory increases, so its overhead charges are proportionately reduced. An increased output from this Australian factory would soon lead to the price being reduced to about £10 a ton. The statement of the Kyabram Water Trust, which was read by tlie Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), is evidence of the valuable service rendered by the Australian manufacturers of this commodity. The company's experts travel throughout the country, and arc available at short notice to give advice to respective prices of alum water trusts and other bodies for the purification of their water supplies in the interests of the health of the people. It may not be generally known that one of the difficulties associated with the manufacture of butter in some parts of Australia is that of the water supply. These comparisons In order that Australian butter may have,-> a chance of competing with, the product' of other countries in the world's markets, I do some of our country water supplies have to be treated. Previously, expensive filtration processes were employed to purify and clarify the water.

99,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [4.50].,"Tariff Board called any paper manufacturer before it as' a witness. The board's report does not contain any evidence by paper manufacturers that the Australian manufacturers of sulphate have charged exorbitant prices for their product. On tlie other hand, there is voluminous testiCustoms( Mr Guy) "" That the requested mony that they have rendered valuable service to the community. The experience of the authorities controlling the water supply of Brisbane is of interest. The torrential rains which fall on the watershed of the Brisbane water supplies sometimes discolour the water, and make treatment necessary. Before the Australian manufacture of sulphate of alumina was commenced, the authorities at Brisbane paid about £9 a ton more for the purifying material than they did after the Australian' competitor entered the field. Moreover, the authorities found that they i-ould obtain from tlie Australian manufacturers advice which they could not get from importers. That fact, together with the certainty of getting regular supplies of sulphate of alumina of good quality from Australian factories, led to their deciding to use the locally-produced material. In order that the Tariff Board may call further witnesses in support of the claims of this Australian industry, I move That the item he postponed. The chairman of directors of the Australian company which manufactures this material informed me recently that for many yearsthe company made no profits at, all, and that, its profits now are only a bill be read a second time.

119,Mr White (Balaclava,"Minister formerit is carried, the matter will be re' ferred back to the board, but the Government cannot accept the amendment. Today we have heard complaints about the delay of the board in dealing with cotton yarn and Oregon. It is hardly fair that industries that have had two hearings should be given a third chance. Minister has stated that the interested parties waited upon him as a deputation, and that their case has already been considered by the Tariff Board on two occasions. As I was not aware of that, I withdraw any suggestion made by me that the board should again be asked to consider the matter. urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It is true that the claims of this industry were considered by the Tariff Board in 1926, and the duties which were imposed when I was Minister for' Trade and Customs were then recommended. .When the rates were reconsidered in the light of the Ottawa agreement, the board suggested a drastic reduction of the protection given to the industry. The company asked the Minister to have the matter further considered, but the board did not conduct the. usual public inquiry, at which the company would have had an opportunity to rebut some of the alleged misleading statements made by its competitors, the importers. Personally, I should like the old rate to be approved by the'committee; but the policy of the present Government is to accept the board's recommendations, and that course was advocated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Pearce). The Minister quoted from a statement made by the board regarding .the freight en sulphate of alumina from England to Australia, and, in reply to an interjection by me, said that the figures Gibson, W. G. were based on. information dated the 10th March last. Four months have elapsed since then, and further reductions of freight may have occurred. If further inquiries were made, possibly the freight quoted as ruling on the 3rd March for soda ash, another heavy chemical, would be found to apply also to sulphate of alumina. The odour of these chemicals does not affect the freight charges, because Watkins, D. . the goods are not deleterious. freight is obtainable from some of the shipping companies to-day than six or eight months ago, and I believe that if the importers asked for lower freight charges than those quoted on the 10th March last, on which the board based its recommendation, the request would be granted. The members of the Tariff Board, as reasonable men, would surely be prepared to reconsider all the. facts, and give the representatives of this Australian factory an opportunity to place before them the latest information regarding freightcharges. The company has reduced prices by 50 per cent., and it is giving excellent service to the community. Its technical advice is available to local authorities, such as water boards, and to butter factories. Question-That the amendment ( Mr committee divided. (CILATJRMAN-MR . BELT,.)

The Senate's request is based on a recommendation of the Tariff Board contained in its report dated the 12th May, 1933. If adopted, the only alteration which the request will make to the item is to 'increase the duty on spirituous toilet preparations by Is. a gallon for every 20 per cent, spirit content or fraction of 20 per cent. In. recommending this increase, the board points out that at the present time importers of toilet preparations which contain, say, 100 per cent, proof spirit, pay extra duty on the spirit content of 20s. a proof gallon, British preferential tariff, while local manufacturers of toilet preparations, who do not use a prescribed proportion of Australian products, such, for example) as essential oils, have .to pay excise duty on the spirit used at the rate of 25s. a gallon. [Quorum formed.] Thus the local manufacturer's ad valorem protection is reduced by the equivalent of 5s. a proof gallon. The board's recomnfendation for an increase of the spirit content rate on imported toilet preparations will overcome this anomaly. Local manufacturers who -use a prescribed quantity of Australian raw materials for example, essential oils, will have a. further protection as the result of paying less excise, duty on Australian spirit used. board has recommended ad valorem rates of British 45 per cent, and general 65 per cent., which arc 5 per cent., general tariff, lower than those prescribed in the bill. The Australian delegation at Ottawa undertook to maintain a margin of preference of 25 per cent, ad valorem, hence the retention of the rate of 70 per cent, under the general tariff. Briefly, the board's reasons for its recommendation, which relates also to perfumery, item 290 o l , are(a) Direct employment will be given to 350 hands with an annual wage bill of £43,000. . (&) Seventy per cent, of the raw many of the ingredients used in the actual perfuming are imported. (c) Australian manufacturers are able to meet requirements as to quality and quantity, and output can be readily increased. Export trade with New Zealand has been undertaken. . (d) Prices are not increased as a result, of protection. One firm, which is an offshoot of the English concern, charges the same prices in Australia for locallymade preparations as are charged for similar goods in England. (e) Indirect employment which will be given in the manufacture of jars, tins, and cartons, will be much greater even than the direct employment which will be provided. is so seldom that the Tariff Board recommends an increase of duty that one cannot help feeling that one did the right thing, when Minister for Trade and Customs, in imposing a total prohibition against the import of all toilet preparations. As a result of that prohibition Australian manufacturers were given an opportunity to develop the local industry, and they have obtained additional capital and increased the number of their employees. The interesting speech of the Assistant Minister( Mr Guy) indicates that as the result of the prohibition 300 additional persons have been employed in one factory, and hundreds in another. At a time when the almost general practice of the Tariff Board is to make recommendations in a downward direction it is a consolation,, even if the case is an The isolated one, to deal with a recommendation for an increased duty. The results in this case certainly justify the policy of the Scullin Government in giving protection to Australian industries, as a result of which additional employment has been given to our workers and prices have been reduced to consumers.

The ad valorem rates contained in the request are 5 per cent. British and 10 per cent, general higher than the 1921-30 tariff, under which no fixed rates operated. manufacturers have been gradually capturing a large percentage of the market during the last few years, and at present the larger local handles', such as pick, mattock, and axe handles which are manufactured from Australian timber, are selling at prices much lower than the landed duty-paid cost of imported handles with present exchange. The Tariff Board considers that the Australian timber is quite suitable for the manufacture of axe handles for ordinary household purposes, but is not entirely suitable for use with axes used by timber-getters and bushmen. This item has previously been debated in this chamber, and I know that some honourable members contend that Australian axe handles are as good as the imported. The professional timbergetter prefers the imported hickory handle. Of course, the difficulty could be overcome if some of the Australian manufacturers imported hickory in the log, and manufactured hickory handles here. The proposed duties are higher than those which operated under the 1921-30 tariff, and are more than sufficient to bring the overseas costs' in line with the Australian selling prices, but the Tariff Board considers that this difference is necessary in order to overcome the prejudice against the loeal product. The majority of the smaller handles required, such as file and chisel handles, are being produced locally, and the Tariff Board, in recommending the duties of 30 per cent. British and 45 per cent, general on this type of handle, states that the evidence submitted showed that these duties are sufficient to hold the trade in the lines being manufactured . in Australia. While protecting the local manufacturers, they are not so high as to impose an unreasonable burden on the few types not manufactured in Australia. Mr F0SDE (Capricornia) [5.47] -It is true that this item was debated in this chamber earlier in the year, but at that time the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) adhered to the duties in the schedule. Sincethen the Tariff Board has made a recommendation, which has been adopted by the Senate. I am sorry that that alteration has been made, because the increased duties imposed by the previous Government enabled a useThe Australian ful industry to be established in Australia, It is now to be made vulnerable to imports. No doubt the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) will be able to give us a good deal of information respecting an enterprising industry which is manufacturing tool handles in his electorate. Much of the prejudice which formerly existed against Australian-made tool handles has now disappeared, and the users of tool handles generally are quite satisfied with the quality and price of the local article,",37,Fenton S Be Agreed To Put The

Australian handle-manufacturing in : dustry comprises thirteen principal manufactories in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and, to show that this is not a backyard industry, let rae state that the capital employed in it is estimated at £82,000, the value of the plant, buildings and machinery is £75,000, the number of hands employed is '288, and the value of the output in 1932 was £S6,000. As a result of the high duties that were imposed, there has been a falling off of imports; but that was only to.be expected, because the tariff was increased to compel overseas manufacturers who wanted to exploit the Australian market to establish their factories here. Consequently, there has been a falliug off in the value of imports from £58,000 in 1927-2S to £13,000 in 1931-32. what source has the honourable member obtained hisfigures? Tariff Board. Australian timbers are used extensively in the manufacture of tool handles, and in that respect let me quote the opinions of quite a number of experts who gave evidence before the Tariff Board. MrM . B. Foley, professional axeman, Limeburnevs' Creek, New South Wales, statedAs a bushman since boyhood, I have been getting my living through the axe. Por the past eight or nine months I have been cutting sleepers for the Forestry Commission, and have been using three axes-tw o squaring axes and an American axe all fitted with Australian spotted gum handles. I have been using spotted gum handles for the last couple of yoarB, and one now in use for. tliree months. One of the axes in use was for grooving, and a handle that will stand up. to that will stand up to anything. MrN . W. Jolly, Forestry Commissioner, Sydney, statedThe position with regard to tool handles in New South' Wales is that there should be no necessity whatever for any importations of handles for picks, mattocks, hoes, rakes, spades, shovels, small hammers, chisels, &c, as there are ample supplies of local timbers suitable for these purposes. tioned. specifically refer to axe handles, but there is no doubt as to his opinion of the suitability of Australian timbers for that The purpose. Mr G. A. Duffy, Chairman of the Timber Advisory Committee, Brisbane, and representing the Brisbane Handle Factory Limited, Brisbane, and Messrs. C. A. Kruger and Son,"" Bundamba, Queensland, supported the duties requested by the New South Wales manufacturers on the ground that Australian timbers were quite suitable for tool handles. About seven or eight other Australian manufacturers gave similar evidence before the Tariff Board, and, so far as I can gather from its report, there is no evidence to the contrary. Two American firms have established branch factories in Canada, and although the handles which they produce are entirely of American timber, they are admitted into Australia under the British preferential tariff. That preferential tariff was never intended to allow American firms which had established factories in market to the. detriment of the local manufacturers, and also of the bona fide British manufacturers in both England and Canada. A very efficient factory has been established at Bateman's Bay for the manufacture of tool handles, and I should like to 'hear what the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins), who represents that district, has to say with respect to these duties. A number of timbergetters employed by Messrs. Bagot Brothers at Ballina, New South Wales, in the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), all use Australian-made handles. If the local industry were permitted to develop under protective duties, permanent employment would be provided for a number of our factory workers and timbercutters at a time when we should do everything in our power to help the unemployed.

132,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [5.59].,"( Mr Eorde) has quoted many opinions as to the suitability of Australian timber for axe and tool handles generally. The following evidence was given before the Tariff Board by Mr IT. J . C. Beer,' tha President of the Victorian Axemen's Association, a man who has accurate knowledge of axe handles, and of what is required by expert axemen:The association enters protest on behalf of the axemen and bushmen of Victoria against the high rates of duty that are at present in force. The following petition signed by 108 axemen is submitted iu support of the protest:We, the undersigned axemen or bushmen, consider that the present duty on hickory axe handles should be considerably reduced, as, in our opinion, there is no timber in Australia available iu commercial quantities suitable for making axe handles. It it dangerous for us to use Australian handles in our work, because they are not reliable. The men who signed the petition nearly all come from the country, and earn their living by the use of the axe. They must have an axe handle they can depend upon, and so far the only wood is hickory. They know only too well, after years of experience, that hickory is the only timber grown in commercial quantities that is suitable, and they send to America for their handles. A timber-feller many feet up a tree, standing on a staging or shoe, may possibly lose his lite as the result of the breaking of a faulty axe handle. There is no timber available in commercial quantities in Australia, which is suitable for the manufacture of axe handles. The present f.o.b. costs of ""an American No. 1 quality hickory axe handle in sterling (converted at the-vrate of 3.50 dollars) are 15s. 5d. per dozen, and the ci.f. cost in sterling 16s. Od. per dozen. Duties and charges raise the landed cost in Australian currency to 34s. per dozen. Despite the duty imposed, these men feel that, for their own safety, they must buy American axe handles. Mr Beer stated furtherBrood axes are used extensively in Australia for squaring sleepers, poles, &c.. and the and is better than American hickory. handles used in that type of nxe are sold in Unfortunately, the area upon which it two styles-righ t hand and left hand."" As is grown is somewhat limited, but it profar as is known, there is no one in Australia duces sufficient to supply the whole of making this type of handle, and yet a duty Australia's requirements for high grade of 05 per cent, is imposed.

Consein hardware. quently, I welcome the Senate's requested Mr Paterson. amendment, and hope that it w ill be made. I happen to know something about the petition signed by 16S so-called axemen in Victoria, to which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has referred. I am reliably informed that, if it had been required, the people who do not favour the petition could have secured ten times that number of signatures from men who make a livin g by swinging an axe. The witness quoted by the honourable member for Gippsland knows practically nothing about the timber-getting industry. Broad axes are used only by expert axemen for squaring timber and sleeper-getting. Handles. for broad axes must be bent, and as a ll American handles, are straight, they have to be steamed and suitably bent by axemen to meet their individual requirements. The finest timber in the world for use as handles for broad axes is water gum, which is grown in limited areas in the f a r north coast of New South Wales, and in certain parts of Queensland Timber grown in southern New South Wales and Victoria is not so suitable for axe handles. As a rule, expert axemen prefer axe handles made from Australian timber. A t the last show of the Royal Agricultura l Societyi u Brisbane, every prize-winner in thosesections set apart for axemen used Australian-made handles; and at the last show of the Royal Agricultura l Societyi n Melbourne, every major prize-winner--that is, every championship winner-also , without exception, used handles made from Australian timber, spotted gum, chiefly. Two of the successful competitors used handles made of water gum, which is deep red in colour, axe handles for many years to come. definitely Probably one of the reasons for this The fact that Mr Beer's evif r o m Australian timber is the fact that",39,Parkhijjl Fro M Canada To Compete I N The Australian
133,Mr R. Green (Richmond) [6.4],"something to say iu that matter? they prefer Australian axe handles. gi ven before the Tariff Board with regard to water gum for axe handles? evidence was taken in Melbourne. There are, in my electorate, more professional axemen than in any other division in. the Commonwealth, and .1. repeat that their preference is for axe handles made from Australian wood. I hope that the committee will not. agree to the requested amendment. The Senate's 'requested amendment is really another attack on an Australian industry. It. is surprising that, although the great majority of honourable members favour high duties for the protection of rb*t Australian timber indusfeny, the Tariff Board has recommended, and the Government, by accepting its recommendation., approves, a course which is calculated to do serious injury to the industry. .1. was interested in a report which appeared in tlie. Weekly Timn$. Melbourne, last week, of a test, which had been, made by MrL . Galbraith, B.C.E., of the Melbourne ["".'uiversity Engineering School, of the strength of timbers for axe handles. Knowing that this item would be discussed in this chamber this week, I rang Mr RecentlyI met a gentleman who Galbraith on the telephone to get further information from him about the test. I rake the following from the report which appeared in the Weakly Times:'t'liu tests were made om un Amster Universal machine, which gives n measure of the included first and si-rotid grade handles of hickory, blue. gum. oak. lentherworiri. and -riven olive wood, all having been seltvled at random from wholesalers'' stocks. The olive wood handles wi-re growing nine weeks lie-fore the test. The final values allotted to tlm various wood* were:-Second"" grade, hickory. 8!) units: first grade hickory. 80; second grade gum, 8 1 : first-grade leatherwood, 78: fust grade oak, 75: first, grade olivewood, 75: first grade gnni, OS: olivewood, 08. Hitting sufrprnded from 6.J6 to S p.m. the conclusions arrived, at by M'.r. Galbraith readsIn view of the controversy that has long been associated with the merits of different woods for axe handles, considerable interest is :i.V.t'a<?hed to,tests which have been conducted recently by MrL . Galbraith, B.CJ:., of the University School of Engineering. Were we to argue this question for months, diverse opinions would still be held as to which wood is the most suitable for axe handles. WhatI complain of is the prejudice which has largely been responsible for the antipathy to Australian woods. Before the merit's of a number of very fine Australian timbers were recognized, hickory held undisputed sway for many purposes. I know that jinker shafts are a different proposition from axe handles; but I have never forgotten a conversation that I had with a wheelwright in a country district, who, in reply to my query as to whether those who ordered jirikers from him always specified hickory shafts, replied, "" No ; I keep a good supply of blue gum as well as hickory, and as many persons -choose the one as the other."" The paragraph concerning. Mr Galbraith's tests says that the handles were selected at random from wholesalers' stocks, and concludes with the following statement:The straight-out breaking tests to determine . the strength of the handle or its ability to stand u;i to a wrench proved that secondgrade gum, which Ibroka with a load of 285 lb. on the free end, was the strongest. Tho others, in order of their breaking loads, were: Firstgrade oak, 185 lb.; first-grade hickory and first-grade guni, 175 lb.; seeond-gTade hickory and first-grade le&therwood, 145 lb.; olive wood (two samples).. 130 lb. and 100 lb. represents Tasmanian manufacturers. He informed me that from mountain blue gum that firm is turning out one of the finest axe handles offered for sale in the Commonwealth. That that -treu^tli make has met; with approval is shown by the fact that large sales of it are made in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, from which centres a big distribution takes place. I saw on his books orders for at, least 10,000 axe handles, proving conclusively that merchants are inclining towards the i article made from Australian wood. I hope that the time is not fat distant when the prejudice against Australian timbers will have been, completely removed, and they will take their rightful place in the front rank' of the timbers of the world.

Green), on the other hand, showed/that practically every winner of a principal prize at the wood-chopping contests, held at Brisbanei n August, used an Australian-made handle. also understand that champion axemen winners at the last Melbourne show, where the contests include not only chopping on the ground, but also at a height of from '20 to 30 feet, used Australian handles. Mr Galbraith says that there is no strain on an axe handle in use except when theheel or toe of the blade first strikes the wood. He declares that more axes are broken by wrenching the blade from the wood than by any other means. It is pleasing to note that tests of this nature are being made at our engineering schools, and that Australian timber, in common with other Australian product's, when put to the test, holds its own w i th the best that the world produces. For this and the other reasons I have given I shall vote against the proposed reduction of the duty. honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) stated this afternoon that he had been informed by axemen that danger is associated with the' use of an Australian handle at some height from the ground, because of the likelihood of its breaking and causing the user to overbalance. That applies with equal force to Americanhickory. I have no wish to disparage that tirniber, but I am totally opposed to importing it while Australia produces -every class of timber from which good axe handles can be made.

The prejudice against other Aus/a timber which will readily stand up to this class of work, and is comparable only with American hickory. It is not quite as flexible as the American, but is stronger. I have been for the last twelve months making handles and experimenting with the various timbers, and just as I reach a decision to launch out on a large scale, we get the setback in the tariff, which will kill thisindustry entirely. A quantity was sent to I Harris Scarfe Limited, of Adelaide. Up to tlie present I ha,™ not had time to get a who were among the prizereport. This firm has agreed as to price, and will do their best to push these handles. It has been contended that wood suitable for axe handles is not grown in the Commonwealth. On this point the Tariff Board publishes the following opinion:C. J. J. Watson, wood technologist of the Queensland Forest Service, in' his letter of 4th March, 1933 (produced) speaks of spotted gum, grey and wbito handlewoods, and yellow wood as being equal in most cases, and in others superior, to hickory. The tariff, as existing, has been of great benefit to the^Queensland manufacturers, as is shown by the following figures:£ Year ended 30th June, 1930 .. 8,245 Year ended 30th June, 1931 .. 4,953 Year ended 30th June, 1932 .. 1,682 The number of workers employed by tlie two factories represented were30th June, 1930 .. 25 30th Juno, 1931 .. 32 30th June, J.932 ... ..40 March, 1933 .. .. 56 In addition, there is the iudiirect employment . of timber-cutters, haulers, railway men, and others. A lot of timber is grown in the Cairns electorate, and much of it is exported. Generally, axe handles are made from spotted gum, hut mountain ash also is used for this purpose, its only defeet being that it is subject :to borer. It is a timiber that w ill stand up to any amount of work, and w ill not break. That applies also bo spotted gum. One objection that may be .urged against it is that it is somewhat heavy; but that its strength is equal to that of either American hickory or any other timber can.not be denied.

I must admit that it was a good article-fa r better than I. expected an Australian axe handle to be. I said in my previous speech on this subject that the South Australian people, if products were as good as American hickory handles, would buy them. But, undoubtedly, the American hickory handle is better than the Australian made handle, and although the latter is now suitable for the work for which it is intended, it is too heavily protected. /Richmond( Mr R. Green) referred to the broad axe. This implement has a width of .12 inches, and is ground on only one side. Left-handed and right-handed axes are made and these require appropriate handles. If handles are not made for both right and left-handed use they must be bent into the desired shape. Extra good timber is needed for such handles. Even the honourable member had to admit that supplies of suitable Australian timber for the making of handles for broad axes were inadequate to our needs. The honourable gentleman referred to spotted gum, but I think that he would admit that many handles are made from inferior timber. The duty requested by the Senate is British, 3s., and foreign, 4& 6d. a dozen. There is approximately three quarters of a superficial foot of timber in an axe handle. Taking timber at £2 10s. for 100 superficial-feet, the value of the timber in an axe handle is only a few pence. With the protection of 4£d. foreign now suggested, axe handles could be produced locally for about, 5-Jd. each, the protection amounting to the cost of manufacture. People who want American handles are compelled' to pay 3s. 6d. each for them. I submit therefore that the protection now suggested is adequate, and I hope that the Mr Senate's request will be acceded to. [8.18] -The arguments of honourable members who seek a reduction of the duty on. axe handles are much more faulty than the timber from which' Australian axe handles are being made. Honourable I gentlemen opposing the existing duty are actuated by a desire to close down Australian industries, increase unemployment and reduce the spending power of the great consuming public of Australia. As a member of the Country party I value every industry that can be established here under reasonable conditions. Each new industry that we establish successfully gives employment to additional convinced that the Queensland people and reduces public expenditure on unemployment relief. We have, timbers in Australia equal to the best in the world. early stage of the manufacture of The honourable member for any article faults are bound to occur. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who has interjected, found that the wooden ships that he bought in America were faulty. The loss that that transaction caused (to the public was far greaterthan the loss involved in the purchase of a. few faulty axe handles. I am prepared to go to the extent of prohibiting imports from the United States of America, for that country does not assist our primary industries in any way whatever. If food taken on board an American ship at an Australian port is not consumed before the ship reaches American waters, it must be dumped into the -sea outside the three-mile limit. Why, therefore, should we consider American industries. I am not. concerned that American",42,Imports Into Queensland

It, was quite u n f a i r for the honourable facture of axe handles, I direct attenmember for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) to say that honourable members iipposed to the existing duties on axe handles, and favoring the Senate's request, wish to close down industries in this country. Nothing of the kind is desired. We are anxious that our industries shall be developed on a sound basis. If Australian axe handles are as good as those imported from. Americai t is not likely that the American article w ill be bought, for three Australian axe handles can be obtained for the price of one American handle. As the honourable membwfor Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has said, our skilled axemen need the best handles, and buy American hickory handles. Although the Tariff Board has reported"" that certain Australian timbers are suitable for making axe handles, it has also said .that these timbers are quantities. The honourable member' for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) suggested that the test of an axe handle is its strength, but that is not so. Australian timbers arc among the hardest and strongest in the world. But an axe handle must have lightness combined with toughness. Unfortunately, some Australian axe handles are so heavy that it is hard to tell the end on which the head is fitted. That is a great objection. The following comments were made by the It has been demonTariff Board on the evidence submitted to it as to the relative quality of the Australian and American axe handles:-Tlie prices charged by local manufacturers of handles from native timbers are from one-half to one-third of the lauded duty paid cost using unsuitable timof imported handles. Despite this disparity, importations were at the rate of £19,000 per Those opposing the existing annum during IH30-31 and 1931-32. This is evidence of a definite demand-a t almost any cost-for American hickory handles. There can be. no question as to the superiority of hickory over other timbers for axe handles, sledge hammer handles, pick handles and the like. Its particular virtue is a. combination of resiliency and toughness not found in other timbers which are available in commercial quantities. Timber experts and some of the local manufacturers admit the suporiority of hickory; iu fact, one local manufacturer is making axe handles from imported hickory. In reply to the statements of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R'. Green) that Australian timber is available of a proper quality for the manution to the following statement of the Tariff Board :During the last two years the New South Wales Forestry Commission has tested several New South Wales timbers for handle making. Good reports have been obtained in respect of axe lni,ndle wood, iron wood, and water gum, but supplies of these timbers are inadequate or inaccessible, except at heavy costs. Mr N. W. Jolly, Forestry Commissioner, considers that although the species mentioned are not the equal of hickory, they are quite suitable for the manufacture of axe handles. . . . The hoard is convinced that there is no Australian timber available in commercial quantities to substitute for hickory for axe handles. In these circumstances, the Government > is taking the right course in recommending acceptance of the Senate's request. If the Australian handles are as good as the American handles, they w ill certainly be preferred, because of their comparative cheapness. From the trend of this discussion, it appears to me that the Country party is extremely anxious to grind the free trade Some axe even at the risk of destroying the Australian axe handle'manufacturing in-, dustry. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) quoted a petition from axemen presented by MrH . J . C. Beer, but while he was speaking, another honourable member said truly,",43,Imports Into Queensland
146,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [8.23],,44,Imports Into Queensland
147,Not Obtainable In Commercial Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [8.28],"that it is always possible to get persons to sign a petition. We should like to know who inspired the petition. Mr Australian handles in all the heats and Beer said thatThere is no timber available in commercial quantities in Australia' which is suitable for the manufacture of axe handles. But it is stated in the Tariff Board's report thatA manufacturer now instill ling a plant in thu Dorrigo assures that he will have no diffiRailway Department finds that Ausculty in turning out ample supplies of handles of water gum and ironwood. That suggests, therefore, that Mr Beer's statement is hardly in accordance with the facts. Although the Tariff Board has said that sufficient quantities of suitable Australian wood are not available for the manufacture of first-class axe handles, it has not adduced any evidence to that effect. The evidence referred to in its report, shows that plentiful supplies of suitable timber for this purpose are available. In quoting the evidence tendered by Mr Beer, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) pointed out that a timber-feller standing on a staging fixed some distance from . the ground might lose his life if the axe handle should break. I do not dispute that, but an American handle is as likely to break as is an Australian handle. In the making of axe handles, a great deal depends upon the cutting and quartering of the timber. It is not, always profitable to quarter a log to get the grain to the best advantage for making axe and other tool handles; may be faulty, but the same can be said of American handles. A good deal depends upon the nature of the timber; but even the very best of timbers, including hickory, if not cut and quartered in the proper way, will break as easily as pine or any other light timber. Greater risks can be taken with Australian spotted gum, in cutting and quartering it, than with any other timber in the world. Oak and ash timbers have a distinct flat and edge grain, and if quartered in the wrong way, are very brittle. Spotted gum has au interwoven grain, , which makes it, more dependable than many other timbers which have been so highly spoken of to-night. In giving evidence before the board, one witness stated that as a professional axeman he had used Australian axe handles in bush work for the last two years, and had also used iu the final of the wood chopping contest, at the Royal Sydney Show, which he won. That man found the Australian spotted gum handle entirely satisfactory. The Railway Department, of New 'South Wales uses large quantities of handles made in Australia, and the Victorian tralian-made pick handles meet all its requirements. Orders for large supplies would not be lodged with the Australian manufacturers unless the timber from which the handles are made is serviceable-. The New South Wales and Victorian Railway Departments obtain expert evidence as to the durability of the Australian-made handles, and if they were not up to standard, the local manufacturers would not continue to re ceive contracts from the New South Wales and Victorian Governments for the supply of large quantities. It appears to me that the Tariff Board does not always make its recommendations in accordance with the evidence submitted. There are indications that, in regard to supplies of Australian timber, the board has been guided by prejudice against Australian manufacture, rather than by the actual evidence tendered. The board states that in some respects the Australian timbers are not as suitable as are the American timbers for the manufacture of axe handles; bin I see nothing in the evidence to justify Some Australian axe handles its conclusion that suitable timbers are not available in sufficient quantities. In these circumstances, the committee should oppose the Senate's request in order to afford adequate protection to this Australian industry. are admitted free of duty, but axe handles, which have to be replaced more frequently, are carrying an exorbitant duty. When I was in S""outh Australia two months ago, an axeman whom I have known for years thanked me for putting the case for the axemen to enable them to get cheaper handles. H.e also said that he had been in hospital for a -fortnight as a result of using an Australian-made axe handle. I refer the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green)",44,Imports Into Queensland
148,Mr Nock (Riverina) [8.36],"Axesto thefigures quoted by the honourable .member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), who said that, in spite of the fact that Australian axe handles can be obtained at from one-third to one-half of the price of hickory handles, £19,000 worth of the latter are imported annually. This sum represents nearly 400,000 axe handles. No one denies that Australian axe handles have been used successfully at wood-chopping competitions, but surely we should be guided rather by the fact that the axemen in this country use, each year, 400,000 imported hickory handles in spite of the excessive cost of these handles. must also remember that -in the tests made in Victoria by Mr Galbraith new handles were used. Most of the Australian handles, even when not in use,, deteriorate by drying to a greater extent than a hickory handle. exchange, primage and transport costs aggregate 120 per cent. The duty of 45 per cent, recommended by the T a r i ff Board, which the Government is prepared to accept, w ill be supplemented by exchange 25 per cent., primage 10 per cent., and transport costs 20 per cent., making a total of 100 per cent, against American handles. industry cannot compete under those conditions, those who are supporting its cause must admit that it is inefficient or is lacking in good material. The old rate of duty meant an unnecessary burden of Is. 6d. to 2s. on each handle, and unduly penalized the users. Senate's request. listened to the arguments adduced by honourable members, but I have not heard anything to cause me .to alter the vote I gave when this item was last under consideration. Accidents have occurred to the users of both American and Australian axes, but we must protect those who use axes for domestic work and who probably outnumber all other users. As I capable of carrying on successfully with lower duties, I shall support the Senate's request. In view of the statements made by some honourable members since I last spoke on this item, I propose to quote from the summary of evidence tendered to the T a r i ff Board. On page 7 of the board's report the following paragraph appears:C. J. J. Watson, Wood Technologist of the Queensland Forest Service, in his letter of 4th March, 1933 (produced), speaks of spotted gum, grey and white handlewoods and yellow wood as being equal in most cases, and in others superior to hickory. Mr Beer, the President of the Victorian Axemen's Association, statesBroad axes are used extensively in Australia for squaring sleepers, poles, &c, and the handles used in that type of axe are sold in two styles-righ t hand and left hand. As far as is known, there is no one in Australia We making this type of handle, and yet a duty of l}5 per cent, is imposed. Mr Beer does not know what he is talking about, because right hand and left hand axes are made only in Australia. In many instances, sleeper-cutters and timberThe old duty, getters using imported handles have to steam and bend them to get the shape required. Mr Gates, giving evidence before the Tariff Board, said that no Australian timber that is available in commercial quantities can compare with hickory for axe handles and with beech for other tool handles. He makes that bald statement and If the Australian expects us to believe it . On page 10 of its report the T a r i ff Board comments on the suitability of Australian timbers for tool handles in the following terms:During tha last two years the New South Wales Forestry Commission has tested several I support the New South Wales timbers for handle making. Good reports have been obtained in respect of axe-handle wood (Pseudomorous brunoniana), ironwood (M'etrosideros leptopatala) and I have water gum (Tristaivia laurina), but supplies of these timbers are inadequate or inaccessible, except at heavy costs. Had the members of the commission, or its advisers, visited the country between Kyogle and the Queensland border they would have been convinced that sufficient supplies of suitable timber are available, for in that area there are sufficient water gums believe that the industry is quite to supply Australia's requirements of axe handles for a great many years. Already there is one factory in the district making tool handles and there is scope for many more. A further paragraph on the same page of the Board's report readsTimber-getters and bushmen require axe handles of the highest quality; their occu-",45,Imports Into Queensland

All the prize-winners in the woodchopping contests ut the last Brisbane national show used axes with Australian handles; and all the major prizes at the last Royal Melbourne show were won by axemen using Australian axe handles. argument for lowering the duty ? MrE . GREEN argument axe handles is that they are unsuitable and inferior to those made of American hickory. If we were to prohibit the importation of American hickory for three years, the prejudice against Australian timbers would disappear, and the people would realize the value of some of our own timbers.

Unfortunately,, some Australians are biased against any product of their own country; they prefer goods grown or manufactured in other countries.

It would be beneficial if the States transferred their powers in this regard to the Commonwealth, so that this Parliament may be able to legislate on all phases of the industry, including production, distribution and exhibition. Honourable members may not be aware that the Commonwealth has, on several occasions, invited the States to transfer their powers, but so far that has not been done. The industry is particularly one that lends itself to federal control. It may be possible to introduce a quota system, but I do not recommend it 'until further investigation has been made. The Government has done its part to assist the industry by admitting British films free, and their increasing use and steady improvement -are tributes to the policy of this and of other governments. I , therefore, urge the committee to agree to the duty of 8d. a foot on foreign feature films. Other foreign films will still be admitted at 4d. a foot, while British films will be free. havo been interested to listen to the Minister's having regard to the following passage in a letter which he wrote on the 12th June, 1933 :If tlie objects of the recent amendment are achieved it will merely result in the restorato 4d. per foot on foreign films, there began tion of the revenue to the former figure, and the burden of duty on film importers will not be greater than it was prior to the change in their practices. In conclusion, I would add that the whole matter has been very careftdly considered, and the duties now in force represent the final decision of the Government. That letter was written after a deputation they also lead to the establishhad waited on the Minister, and I prement of Australian industries: -In sume that he again placed the matter before Cabinet. I do not blame him for changing his opinion about this duty if further evidence showed that the increase of the rate to Is. a foot was too great, which was what really happened. When he introduced that amendment on the 30th March last, he said it would have the effect of making positive films dutiable at the negative rate, if used for copying purposes. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) asked what effect the amendment would have on laboratory work, and the Minister replied that it should provide an increased amount of work for the Australian film-printing industry, and bring in revenue that was previously lost. I find, however, that instead of resulting in additional work in the laboratories, it would probably cause reduced importations of films of the cheaper kinds, and unemployment in an industry that was built up under the reasonable measure of protection imposed by. the Scullin'Government. The Bruce-Page Government increased the rate from l ^ d. to 3d. a foot in 1929, but I shall uot elaborate upon the consequences of that action, and the way in which it was received throughout the Commonwealth. In June, 1930, the Scullin Government, faced with a deficit of £10,000,000, and a prospective deficit for the next year of £20,00,000, increased the duty from 3d. to 4d. a foot for a twofold purpose. It was thought at the time that additional revenue would be obtained and that a local film-printing industry would be established. On the Sth March the Minister referred in these words to the aJiendment then madeThese are the increases imposed on negative and soft positive cinematograph films. . . . explanation, particularly It has recently become the practice to import a negative or soft positive copy only, and to print the whole of the Australian requirements from this. Previously five or six positive copies of a film were imported, but, with the increase in the rate of duty from 2Jd. the importation of only one negative copy of each film, and revenue returns progressively contracted as this practice grew.

Mr .FORDE -But the Minister is aware that the distributors pass on to the exhibitors any additional impost which they may have to meet.

The responsibility for these is passed on to the exhibitors. The exhibitors fear that under this clause in their contract the burden of We hasten to let you have the union's conPermit me to point out that sinr-e the our members have sufTpred wage an industry consisting of employers who are always ready to pay fair and reasonable wages. Unfortunately, business has been so bad over the last three years that no profits.have been made by picture proprietors, therefore, they were forced to take advantage of any wage reduction that came along, and to reduce staif to a minimum. Mention is made of this f a r t The to prove that we have no reason for putting forward .views that are not believed by us. The union had me visit Canberra to confer with Colonel White, for the purpose of having the duty reduced. Our representations went for naught. We believe that should the Government insist upon the Is. per foot duty, it will have the effect of a .serious reduction in the importation of films into the Commonwealth, with the result that many of the theatres in industrial ureas will reduce the number of their screening nights, thereby lessoning the employment of our members. Then again, the Minister for Customs, some time back stated through tlie press that the duty would only mean a difference to the exhibitors of 15s. per feature. As exhibitors use at least 208 films each year, it will seem from the Minister's own figures that it is a considerable sum to place upon theatres that have been showing losses for the past three years. Another point worth mentioning is. when you increased the duty on film up to 4d. per foot, it created a duplicating industry which employs about 150 hands. Any falling off in the importation of films will seriously hamper this now industry that has spent many thousands of pounds on machinery, &c. Our union depends entirely on the picture side of the industry, the legitimate stage havfore, it is most essential that Australia should allow to enter as much film as possible, without which, competition will become so keen among the exhibiting combine on the one hand, and suburban and country exhibitors on the other, which must have the effect of closing down many struggling showmen who will not be able to pay the film hire that will be demanded. To back up my statement that there w ill be less' importation of film if the Is. per foot duty remain, it can be pointed out that certain kinds of films, such as westerns, and",51,Pairs

No other industry has ever attempted to bring to bear upon this Parliament such pressure as has been exerted by the foreign film companies through the press, the unions, 1 and the exhibitors' associations, and by letters to senators. Honourable members should resist such tactics, and prove to the community that they have no effect on this National Parliament, which intends to persist in doing it's duty to the people of Australia irrespective of the machinations methods of foreign film companies. dorse rhe remarks of the Postmaster General( Mr Parkhill) Tegarding the propaganda which has been indulged in by American film companies. of it had an inaccurate basis. These concerns have distributed circulars among country picture showmen claiming that the proposed increase of the duty on films to Is. a foot would ruin them, and 1 adversely affect the industry generally. The figures circulated were brought under my notice by some country picture show proprietors, and, when I first read them, I felt that the claim was a failoue. However, I discovered that the American film companies were deliberately misleading picture show proprietors by applying to individual sections figures that rightly applied to the whole industry. I resent such tactics, which are deliberately designed to mislead. I also resent the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the first place, British films enter AusForde) that the classes of picture most' desired, by picture-goers in industrial suburbs are the sensational western dramas and gangster films. I sincerely hope that I misinterpreted his remarks. letter written by the secretary of a union stating the experience of picture showmen in different centres. It . was not my opinion. any honourable member should quote, apparently from a communication that . misrepresents the tastes of persons living in industrial suburbs. It is an insult to the intelligence of those who attend picture shows, no matter in what suburb they live, to -claim that they delight in witnessing trashy, distasteful, and destructive films of the "" wild west"" and "" gangster "" variety. ""We should be doing a great service to the community, and particularly to the rising generation in industrial suburbs, if we placed a prohibition on the importation of such films. It is a tragedy that they are permitted entry. keep them out. sorship board? with certain features of films.

What effect will this increased duty have upon the costs of the exhibitors? In tralia duty free, and 30 per cent, of all films shown in Australia to-day are British. In addition topical films, scenic films, travel talks,serials, and short films of 2,000 feet or less, are exempt from this increased duty. Only foreign feature films of considerable length are affected. In all probability an average of less than one film exhibited at each programme will be affected by this increased duty.

Therefore the increased duty would involve an additional cost of £12 10s. a copy, which cost will be spread over several hundred exhibitors throughout a State. Under those circumstances, is it conceivable that the added cost would be passed on to the exhibitors, particularly in view of the fact that they obtained no benefit whatevei from the action of the distributors in evading these duties previously? Is it conceivable .that the added cost of £12 10s. a picture film, spread over three or four hundred theatres-abou t 6d. a theatrewould lead to increased admission charges? That suggestion is absolutely ridiculous. I consider that the proposal of the Government is entirely fair, because it is merely endeavouring to recoup a small portion-les s than halfof the revenue which it lost as a result ' of foreign negatives being copied in Australia. There is no justification whatever for an increase of the already high rates to the exhibitors, and surely much less ground to assume that these increased duties will lead to higher charges for admission. Unlike the. Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) I am not at all perturbed about the pressure that has been brought to bear by foreign film interests, because pressure is usually exerted on honourable members when fiscal matters are being discussed. I am concerned more with the position of the people who earn their livelihood in the motion picture industry, and I suggest that even at the -risk of losing a little revenue we should give every encouragement to a new industry which has been established in Australia for the copying of negatives. Honourable approached, not only by the American film representatives and the exhibitors here, but also by the theatrical employees. ber should not forget that the action of 'the local exhibitor has heen prompted by the distributor. member's statement is not proof of that. Tbe Scullin Government increased the [146] duty on films from l f d . to 4d. a-foot, and as a result a new and important section of the motion picture industry-the reproduction of films-was established in Australia. At the present time, the film industry is one of the greatest industries in the United States of America and we should do all in our power to encourage the industry in Australia even if it means the loss of a certain amount of revenue. Wo have to decide whether it is of more importance to Australia to regain revenue which has previously been lost because of the establishment of this industry, or to continue to lose that revenue i u order to encourage the development of the industry. If an additional sum of £95,000 is extracted from tlie film interests in Australia, the tax will be passed on to the exhibitors, who will have to bear the additional cost themselves, or pass it on to their patrons. The picture theatres give employment to many thousands of people in Australia. The exhibitors have been hard'hit by the depression. The reduced purchasing power of the community has affected thei' 1 audiences to such an extent as to force them to reduce their admission charges, and as a result their turnover has been considerably reduced. I have received the following communication from the Theatrical Employees Union:May we mention the fact that ah industryhas been created in Australia for the purpose of duping films from negatives and employs about 150 hands. As the negatives are the raw material necessary for the continuation of this new branch of industry created, we can see no justification for a 200 per cent: increase in duty, Should the duty be in creased it w ill mean a considerable decrease of importation of films into the Commonwealth, as the film distributors w ill not import western and other unprofitable films, which will mean the closing down in some districts of theatres from the usual six screening nights, to one or two each week.

Then there is the further question of percentages, which presses heavily on country exhibitors. On one picture an exhibitor was asked to pay to the exchange 60 per cent, of his gross takings, leaving only 40 per cent, to the showman. I believe that the Minister is trying to act fairly to all interests concerned, and that the Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) correctly stated the position to-night. At all events, he satisfied me that I would be justified in supporting the proposed modification of the Senate's request. [10.7] -The most serious features of the moving-picture industry in Australia have been mentioned by the Postmaster General( Mr Parkhill) and the honourable member for Darling Downs (' Sir Littleton Groom). Judging hy what has been said in this discussion, we appear to be in danger of doing the wrong thing in a futile effort to "" get at "" the people who are tlie real cause of all the trouble. It must he apparent to everybody that American producers are fleecing the people of this country through the film exchanges, and that our efforts to impose taxation on them through the tariff will be absolutely futile because of the rigidity of the contracts made between the distributors and exhibitors. I agree with the Postmaster-General that a searching inquiry should be made into every aspect of the moving-picture business, with a view to making it possible for the Australian industry to compete on reasonable terms with American producers. But the Government proposal will not do this, although I am afraid that many honourable members who will vote for it think that it will. My fear now is that, because our minds are prejudiced against the American film industry-and I think rightly so, because I believe it is fleecing exhibitors in Australia and destroying all possibility of profit for the local industry-w e shall not be able to take If the effective action against it through the tariff. We may think that we can, iu this way, impose some taxation upon American trusts and combines, but I am afraid we shall not succeed, and that in the meantime we may injure the AusThey tralian moving picture industry, which is already in a shocking condition. The number of positives imported will not be affected, no matter how the duty may fluctuate. The increased duty will have to be borne wholly by the exhibitor, who employs Australian labour, not by the distributor, who, I believe, is allied with the American producer. My concern is for the. Australian workers in the industry, who, numerically, aTe the biggest, factor. The employees engaged in the multiplication of films in New South Wales are all members of the typographical association, and their knowledge of the .technical side of the industry is not inferior to that' of even the directors of big film corporations. They fear, not a diminution of profits, but the dismissal of a number of hands, or an application to the Arbitration Court for the reduction of award rates. If greater taxation is imposed in the hope that some of it will be passed on to the American producer, and that is not the result, more harm than good will be done. I consider that 6d. a foot would be a fairer duty than Sd., and I shall support it. [10.13] I offer no objection to the dissemination of propaganda among members of Parliament by moving picture distributors. Propaganda is practised in connection with almost every item of the tariff, and. we should adopt an extraordinary attitude were we to take exception to it in this case. That which I have seen appears to me to be harmless. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) spoke of pressure on exhibitors. Some months ago, certain exhibitors in my electorate brought under my notice circular letters that were issued by the distributors, which, in one or two cases, urged that' the facts mentioned should be placed before the federal member for the district, and that his support should be enlisted. I cannot see anything objectionable in that. Some years ago",56,Pairs

To my mind, the Government has not a strong case;and it is largely buttressed with prejudice against 'the American industry. I admit' that, until recently, the American picture interests had practically unchecked freedom in Australia. To-day, however, they are up against world competition, and particularly from Great Britain, in which country they have practically iost the market. The British picture interests are beginning to regain the position that they formerly held, hot only ih the British Empire, but also in many countries in which formerly American interests enjoyed a 95 per cent, dominance. Australia is one of the countries in which British picture interests are now competing strongly with the American; command approximately 30 per cent; of the market. I contend that the matter should be considered, not only from the amusement, but also from the economic, point of view. I shall, not pose as an authority on the merits of moving pictures; bt.it, from what I have seen, I am Mr Thompson. satisfied' that', for all rotin'd' productive merit, British pictures; which are sent to 1 1 1 Australia to-day are not in the same class1 asAmerican productions' I challenge"" any one to provethatf the British, industry is entitled to receive considerationfrom .this Parliament*, on account' of the serviceit h'as> £*fid'<§3""Jd to Australia-i runs in the capital cities. British films' gives them &false value, and is intended to mislead: the people in. regard to their quality. Recently, Iread anarticle by a Britishpictureshow reviewer in theLondon Daily Mail, in. which it was stated that 95' per cent, cdi the. pictures produced in Great Britain to-day were no credit to the British film industry, and no advertisement to Great Britaini f shown in other parts of the world. In the opinion of that reviewer only about 20 or 30 of the 400 or more pictures that he had reviewed were any credit to British producer's. That bears out my own opinion of the British picture-producing industry. It In the present instance, my sympathies seems to me that we see very few of the best British pictures. I have seen reviews of many British classical and hisor three years, but the pictures have never come to Australia. Only the poorest rubbish of the British producers comes here. 'Apart from pictures produced in the United States of America, very few foreign pictures are shown in Australia. It seems to me, therefore, that by agreeing to the Government's proposal we shall penalize our own people. The extra duty will, undoubtedly, come out of their pockets. The amusement-loving people of Australia have had a raw deal in the iast three or four years. Many picture houses and theatres have been closed, because the people have not been able to spend as much as formerly on entertainments of this kind. 0ne of the surest indications of the existence of the dethey pression in this country has been the disinclination of the people to spend money on amusements, and one of the surest indications of the lifting of the depression will be the return of the people to their accustomed, habits in this connection.

The picture industry the expenditure of enormous sums of money. If this monopoly has, in thb past, called for heavy toll from our people, it has undoubtedly ""delivered the goods"". The technique of high class American pictures is superior to that of the best pictures produced in other countries, and the people who spend money to see American pictures get good value as a rule. We should not discourage the importation into Australia of the best American pictures. the imposition of a heavy duty on these pictures in recent years has led to the building up of a small but valuable industry in this country in the printin g of copies from negatives, and has enabled our own people to learn something of the technique of picture production. In my opinion, the American picture interests were quite justified in trying to avoid crushing taxation by establishing a studio in Australia for the printing of pictures from the negatives. do not agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) that we should heavily tax every Americani n dustry doing business in this country. Each industry should be dealt w it h on its merits. If Ave"" f l o g "" the American picture industry there w ill , undoubtedly, be an unhappy reaction. We shall, in such circumstances, see very few of the be3t American pictures. The concessions granted by Australia to British picture producers' have not had any very great effect. The people of this country are the best judges of the pictures that come here. They are well able to pick good pictures from bad ones, and they certainly have not been enthusiastic about either British or locally produced pictures. pictures are not being exported to Australia, what is the reason? unless it is that the British producers are not interested in the Australian market. Sof a r they seem to be quite content tc send us their rubbish. 1 The CHAIBMAN The honourable member's time has expired. -According to the Postmaster-General( MrP a r k h ill ) the object of the Government in imposing a duty of Is. a foot on of that country has involved imported foreign feature films was to gain revenue to the amount of £177,000 per annum, but foreign picture companies have re-arranged their business methods, to avoid paying 'this extra tax. It is strange to me that the Postmaster General should complain about an industry taking steps to reduce production costs. I have always understood that the honourable gentleman favoured the conduct of industry on economical lines. He is always talking about the necessity I am glad that for efficiency and up-to-date methods. methods. gentleman has complained to-night of the audacity of picture-producing companies in seeking to avoid the payment of extra taxation by limiting their Australian i m portations to one negative.

Jt is surely just as expedient 'that one industry should be run on economic and efficient , lines as that any other should be so run. Honourable members opposite say that everything possible should be done to reduce costs, and after all capitalism is based on business methods of the nature complained of by the Government. We cannot blame commercial organizations, Avhether foreign or local, which adopt such a logical policy, and I should imagine that any industry which did not keep its costs at the lowest possible level would receive the strongest condemnation of honourable members opposite. companies cannot get away.with it in this case. show that with this added duty they w ill not.

It is questionable whether we have the power to deal with the aspect mentioned by the Postmaster-General. So far as we can see there is nothing to prevent the picture distributors passing on any additional impost to exhibitors and through them to picture patrons. The Government is justified in endeavouring to secure revenue from every reasonable source, and, if it feels that the picture distribudened, should not be asked to carry more. tors should render a greater service to the country than at present, they should be made to do so; but not at the expense of the picture patrons.

In visiting many suburban honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr and country theatres, Mr Harrop found John Lawson) on that point? vanced by that honourable member do not aid of their wives 'and members of their disprove that foreign companies have the families instead of employing labour. The power to pass on any additional expense Government may secure £95,000 iu in which they may :be involved. figures quoted by the houorable member for Macquarie, the amount would be infinitesimal. ber will agree that, even if the amount, involved is small, picture patrons will not, benefit,. For instance, if the sales tax is increased by only 1 per cent., some retailers increase their prices disproportionately. fit ihainselves. in most cases of that, nature the increase of such taxes is a profitable proposition to ihe trader. If the duty on films is increased, the pricas of admission to picture theatres may be raised to a greater extent than is necessary to cover the extra impost. If the Government requires additional revenue from this industry, it should show the tax will be obtained from those concerning whom complaints have been made to-night. There is no question as to their power in this country. The Postmaster-General has rightly said that the picture distributors impose exacting conditions upon the exhibitors, and there is nothing to prevent them from evading this increased tax. As they have the matter entirely in their own hands, we feel that the additional revenue will not be obtained from the picture distributors, but from the picture patrons and exhibitors who, being already overburTho Postmaster-General endeavoured to discredit the views expressed by the Secretary of the Theatrical Employees Union( Mr Harrop), on the ground that the members of the union ure not associated witli the moving-picture industry. The fact is that the greater number of the members of the organization mentioned work in picture theatres, owing to the dearth of employment, in other theatres. Many the honourable of them are living at present from hand that, struggling picture show proprietors revenue films may not come into the country. number of screenings each week in some theatres may be reduced and fewer films will he required. Under its original proposal the Government 3et out to obtain £177,000, but the foreign companies devised means of evading the tax and so reduced their costs. The Government now proposes toraise £95,000 from this source, but the companies may still continue to reduce costs. If a compromise of 6d. a foot is accepted the film importers may carry the impost, which I think they reasonably could. They may feel that the additional expenditure involved, when spread over a large number of exhibitors, will be'too small to be passed on.

The question of the effect of duties on unemployment has been mentioned. should like to refrain from discussing this item from that angle, as my colleagues have already dealt with that aspect of the matter. Bather would I stress the fact that picture shows are the chief entertainment of the poorer sections of the community, and that we should not make it more difficult for them to have this enjoyment. We,' in this party, believe that these duties would deprive them of this pleasure, and therefore we shall vote against the Government's proposal. Trade and Customs) [10.41] -Thos e engaged in the film business have indulged in a. good deal of propaganda. In the publication before me-the Film Weekly -ther e is a statement that apparently the Government has forgotten "" the lesson of 1929 "". It is clear that the exhibitors were influenced to write as they did to members of this Parliament; but I shall not go further intothat, as the bitterness may only have been passing. I have signed scores of letters to members and picture theatre proprietors stating that the impost was not so heavy as they had been led to believe, which, I think, confirms my view that they had been influenced to write as they did. I propose to supplement rhefiguresgiven by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) in an endeavour to convince the houorable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that the impost will not press heavily on the small exhibitors. The Deputy Leader of 'the Opposition ( Mr Forde) confused what. I said on a previous occasion with another matter. I said that the increased duty would give increased employment in film printing, in which industry about 150 employees are said to bo engaged. result of action taken by the Scullin Government. said that unemployment was being created among theatre proprietors, which is a totally different matter. The unemployment argument was used by those engaged in the film-printing The film industry when the duty was raised, but their fears proved groundless. The exhibitors should be able to absorb the extra duty, and not have to I pass it on, because the removal of the federal entertainments tax, and the granting of other concessions should increase their turnover. In a number of ways, the Government has assisted the industry, aud, in addition, exchange between the United States of America and Australia has eased considerably. The exhibitors should have borne the whole Is. duty without complaint, but, instead, they have chosen to scare the picture show proprietors. I shall show how unfounded is that alarm. It has been ascertained that 70 per cent, of the rentals received from exhibitors is paid by city and suburban exhibitors, and 30 per cent, by those in country districts. There are 310 suburban picture theatres, and 630 in the country. The average length of a feature film is approximately 6,000 feet. An increase of the duty by 4d. a foot-the difference between the rate of 8d. now proposed by the Government, and the 4d. which operated prior to March last-woul d mean an additional duty of £100 on each film, but, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson), that would be further reduced by printing copies. On the basis of a week's screening in one city theatre in each capital city, 21 screenings in each city theatre each week, three screenings each week in half the number of suburban theatres, and two screenings in each week in half the number of country theatres, .the increased charge would be 2s. 4id. for each screening in city and suburban theatres, or 11-J-d. for each screening in country theatres. In the case of double feature programmes, the additional cost, would be 4s. 9d., and Is. l i d . , respectively. These calculations are based on an average film screened in a city theatre for one week. In the case of the better-class films, the charge would be much less for each programme, because such films are screened for as long as twelve,",60,Pairs

In view of all tbe changed conditions which have operated to the advantage of distributors, the higher duties should not be passed on to the exhibitors. I , therefore, ask the committee to accept tbe Senate's request. I shall deal with this subject from the financial point of view, but, in passing, I must remark on the unique event which has occurred here to-night-the Deputy Leader Forde) moving for a reduction of an existing duty. I do not know whether the Government has given serious consideration to the proposal that there should be no duty whatever on films entering Australia, that not more than one copy of any film be admitted, and that an excise duty be placed on all copies made in Australia. Under that proposal a film would contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth, not on the basis of its length as at present, but according to its acceptance by the people. A good feature film like Tell Me To-night, or Cavalcade, which has had a long run in some theatres, pays no more duty than another film which is not so great a box office attraction. We should endeavour to tax each film according to its earning capacity., sidered by the Government, but was found to be unworkable. operating in New Zealand. in New Zealand. way of getting out of the difficulty without having to .effect any compromise. When the Senate refused to agree to the duty of Is. a foot, the Government compromised by fixing the rate at 8d. a foot. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) performed what must have been a miracle for him, by moving that the duty be reduced to 6d. In fixing this figure, he was probably guessing just as much as the Minister. Each proposed a lower figure haphazard, and without any ' attempt to base' the duty on science or reason. If my suggestion were adopted, those nauseating films, which one is compelled ""to see almost every time one visits a picture theatre, would not be exhibited, because the exhibitors would lose money by having to pay excise on them. I listened with interest to what the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) had to say, but I take exception to his statement that I was guided by guesswork when proposing 6d. a foot as a fair rate of duty. The Queensland Motion Picture Exhibitors Association, in a letter written some time ago in of the Opposition ( Mr answer to various questions asked by members of the Senate, statedDistributors say that if Is. a foot is imposed tlie extra Sd. must be passed on to tlie exhibitors, but if the duty is fixed at not more .than (id., they will carry it themselves. I am not concerned witli making out a case for the American subsidiary companies engaged in the distribution of films in Australia. They can look after themselves; hut I am concerned with the exhibitors and their employees, and with those engaged in printing films in this country. I submit that an increase of the rate from 4d. to 6d. would be fail , iu view of the fact 1 that the duty was only l£d. in 1928. It was next increased to l^d., and later to 3d. The Scullin Government increased the duty to 4d., and the present Government raised it to Is. The Minister said that he was anxious to help the industry, and that the Government proposed to give money prizes with this end in view. Is it expected that the giving of these prizes will benefit the exhibitors ? assist the industry. prizes given to assist the exhibitors.

There is no doubt about the quality and the price of their work. During the last three years they have reduced their prices by 50 per cent. Until recently the firms in Victoria were plating the whole of the radiator shells imported by the Ford company, but that company has altered its policy in recent years, and now wishes to see the duties lowered. One member of the Government, the honourable member for Corio( Mr Casey) has, quite legitimately, I admit, held a brief for if since it changed its policy. If the Senate's request is adopted, five firms in Victoria will be seriously affected, as will also firms in the other States.

I have been specially asked by the Engineers Society in Victoria, as well as the firms which do this class of work, to mention this matter to-night. The Walhalla Plating Works has been doing plating for the Ford Company for the last five or six years, and has been complimented upon the quality of its work. It is also claimed that Australian firms engaged in this particular work have reduced their prices by 50 per cent. is not in question.

But I have always understood that, in fiscal matters, the interests of Australian firms should receive first consideration, and it seems to me quite wrong that, in respect of this particular item, they should be ignored. 1 see no reason why we should change our fiscal policy merely because some Australian firms, which are really offshoots of American manufacturing companies, have altered their business practice during the last few years. If the board's inquiry should disclose that the work done by these Australian firms was faulty in any respect, or that they had not reduced their prices, there might he some reason for an alteration of the duty; but that is not the case. This proposal is not for a minor reduction of the duty. The Senate's request is to remove it altogether, and thus do a great injustice to the Victorian firms I have mentioned, as well as companies in all the other capital cities, which went to considerable expenditure to install special plant and train men to do the work. If the Senate's reque'st is adopted much of that plant, will be scrapped, aud a considerable number of men will lose their employment. Proprietary Altogether it, will be a scandalous and anti-Australian act. I urge the Government to postpone consideration of the item until further inquiry has been made. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.37 p.m. The followvn-g answers to questions were circulated:Mr E. J. HARRISON asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon noticeI n view of tlie fact that it is officially, admitted that an entry was made on the records of Captain T. P. Conway in 1917, and expunged in 1931, because it was injurious and unjustifiable, is it proposed to make any amends to this officer; if so, what is proposed? on several occasions, a certain entry was made in the records of Captain Conway in 1917. The truth of this entry is unquestioned. Whether it was justifiable is a matter of opinion. Upon a report by Major-General Bruche, it was expunged",65,Paths

The operation of tliese recommendations as embodied in the Financial Kmergency Act 1931 effected savings in war pensions in the year 1931-32, of approximately £834,000 (the savings in 1931-32 did uot operate for the full year), and in 11132-33 of approximately £1,070,000. Owing to the operation of various factors, which affect the normal pensions expenditure, it is not possible to estimate exactly the savings due to the Financial Emergency Act.
