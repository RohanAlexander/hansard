In this year's report of the Repatriation Department there is mention of payments made to British Commonwealth ex-servicemen now resident in Australia. On what basis are these payments made? function of my department to cater for the repatriation requirements of British Commonwealth ex-servicemen who are at present residing in Australia. In fact I think last year's annual report mentioned that about £1,500,000 had been paid out for this group of people. Those involved are mainly from the United Kingdom, although there are some from Canada and New Zealand and some from European countries who became eligible under the repatriation conditions applying in the United Kingdom. We act merely as agents for the countries concerned, and we claim reimbursement from the authorities in those countries after payments have been made. to the Postmaster-General. Has a firm of management consultants been called in to the Accounts Branch of the Postmaster General's Department in Melbourne? If so, what is the name of that firm? When was it called in? What is the purpose of its investigation?

Those deliveries were the outcome of gation firm of W. D. Scott and Company arrangements made quite some time ago and Proprietary Limited. Is that right? whether that is the firm you have in mind. in the press during the last two or three weeks about this matter and naturally I made inquiries. This is a well-known firm which carries out investigations of various kinds and is frequently called on to give top-level reports on procedures followed in various instrumentalities. It is a most valuable organization. Some considerable time ago the Postmaster-General's Department did use this firm to carry out a check, not because there was anything wrong but merely in pursuance of our aim always to provide the most efficient service that we can. I am glad to be able to tell the honourable member and other honourable members that on that occasion the department received a very favorable report from its investigators. When I saw the statement to which I have referred I made some inquiries and up until at least a fortnight ago the firm had not been called upon again. Minister for External Affairs concerning the build-up of arms by Indonesia. Has the Minister any evidence to suggest that recent reports of additional deliveries of arms by Soviet Russia to Indonesia are well founded? If so, are those additional deliveries the outcome of agreements entered into before the recent settlement relating to West New Guinea? Has the Minister any information to suggest that subsequent to the settlement relating to West New Guinea the Indonesian Government has sought to increase further the strength of its armed forces by entering into fresh arrangements with Soviet Russia or with any other power? However, I think there has been some degree before the settlement of the West New Guinea dispute. I have no evidence at all that Indonesia has sought to increase her arrangements or seeking any deliveries other than those that were arranged prior to the",7,Setup

Is everything possible being done by Australia's representatives at the United Nations to support the West German appeal to the conscience of the world in the hope that this inhuman state of affairs will be eliminated? with the honourable member the repugnance which I am sure he feels at the events which have taken place at the wall which divides West and East Berlin. I understand that to be the mainspring of his question. I have no information as to an official complaint by any West German authority to the Commission on Human Rights but I have seen an unofficial complaint to that commission. The procedure is for that complaint to be sent to the governments concerned for comment and later for it to be placed before the commission. However, there will be no opportunity for any debate on the complaint before the commission. The honourable member asked me whether we are doing what we can in relation to this matter. No doubt he will have observed that I made a point of this matter in my address to the General Assembly of the United Nations and that I made a point of it here during the relevant debate. For my part, I shall not cease to direct attention to the barbarity with which people are being treated at the wall. Mr J. R. FRASER -Although this question is at short notice, I wish to ask the Minister for the Interior whether he is in a position to give the detailed results of the auction sale of residential leases which was held in Canberra this morning, both as to the restricted auction and the open auction. Is it true that premiums paid for residential leases in Red Hill and Narrabundah have reached record heights? Is there any indication that the Government, through the .National Capital Development Commission, is approaching the day on which it will be able to offer sufficient residential sites to meet the demand? from this morning's auction. The honourable member agrees that he has asked his question at rather short notice. I shall have the figures by to-morrow at the latest and I will let him have them. The policy of the National Capital Development Commission is to throw open increasing numbers of blocks for private purchasers. I do not know when saturation point will be reached but we hope that we shall make more blocks available each year for the public to buy. External Affairs whether, in the giving of Colombo Plan aid, the expenditure on arms by the recipient nation is taken into account. to the honourable gentleman, let me say that Colombo Plan aid is given without respect to political considerations of any kind. Its object is to assist people. No account has been taken of the policies being followed by the nations to which aid has been given in the respects which the honourable member mentioned. aware that the lord mayors of six capital cities met in conference in Sydney last week? Also, is he aware that the most important discussion at the conference concerned the Commonwealth Government's failure to pay rates to municipal councils or to make any grants in lieu of rates on government-owned buildings? Furthermore, is the Treasurer aware that the Commonwealth banks, which do not admit liability, pay an amount equal to rates assessed? The Sydney quota for Commonwealth Government properties is approximately £150,000, which, if paid by this Government, would help to house age and invalid pensioners in Sydney. newspaper references to the activities referred to by the honourable gentleman.

37,Mr Harold Holt,"I have seencity lord mayoralties when some of these matters were discussed. In stating that the Commonwealth does not pay rates, the honourable member has put the position much too broadly. The Commonwealth does make appropriate payments to municipal governments in various situations and details of them have been supplied to honourable gentlemen from time to time. State governments, of course, refrain from paying rates in respect of buildings which they occupy. I can appreciate the financial difficulties which municipalities and other local government authorities face in this country. Indeed, for some time now, recognizing that these authorities function inside the jurisdiction of the State governments, this Commonwealth Government has indicated a willingness to meet representatives of municipal and shire organizations in conference, providing that the State governments concurred, in order to discuss their overall financial problems. The last occasion on which I mentioned this publicly was in the presence of the Minister for Local Government in New South Wales, who informed the same meeting that the conference of the State Ministers for local government had, about that time, unanimously decided not to join in any such conference. So far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, that is where the matter rests at present. Minister for Immigration. My question is supplementary to a matter I raised in this chamber in April of this year dealing with the shortage of medical practitioners, partiing rights of any kind have been given in cularly in country areas. Is the Minister aware that the Victorian Government has promised to investigate the possibility of obtaining doctors from overseas because of this grave shortage? Is the Minister in a position to inform the House whether, the policy of the Government to continue to encourage qualified professional men to come to our country is having the desired effect? honourable gentleman has said about the action taken by the Victorian Government. I am afraid I cannot give him any more detailed information than I did when, some months ago, the honourable member raised this point at question time. I am well aware that there is, in some parts, a shortage of doctors and dentists, and indeed when I was abroad in May, June and the beginning of July of this year, in every country I went to I pointed out the employment and vocational opportunities in Australia for people in these categories. I can assure my honourable friend, because I know he is very interested in and has personal experience of the hardships caused by this problem, that this is the last thing I am forgetful of in our quest for migrants to Australia. addressed to the Minister for Territories. Can the Minister inform the House of the most recent developments in the Northern Territory concerning bauxite, iron ore and phosphate deposits? Has the work carried out by the Mines Branch, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and private interests proved that workable deposits of these minerals exist? If developments are favorable, what action is being taken to exploit these deposits, on a commercial basis, by the interests holding the mining rights over them? ber for the Northern Territory referred to three minerals.

The position regarding bauxite is that two leases are held in respect of the deposits in Arnhem Land on the Gove Peninsula, one by British Aluminium and the other by Duval Holdings. Both of the rights are subject to certain stipulations regarding the presenting to the Government of proposals for future development. Both companies are due to present their proposals within a matter of a few months from now, and when the Government receives these proposals from either of these companies it will decide what steps shall next be taken.

Some rights are held in respect of them, and I understand that those who hold the rights are in negotiation with overseas interests to investigate the possibility of finding a market for the sale of ore. At the same time, officers of the Northern Territory Administration, of the Department of Territories and of the Commonwealth Railways are assisting them with discussions on the costs of extraction, cartage, and, in particular, loading at the Darwin wharf. Until such time as a purchaser for the iron ore is found I do not think the deposits will be worked. Of course, there are many people in many parts of Australia trying to sell iron ore at the moment, but until such time as a purchaser is found there will be, I assume, no development at Burrundie. the Treasurer. Will he consider having a review made of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, directed to two aspects, first, a possible lifting of the rates of payment for individual specified disabilities and, secondly, a review of the substantive sections of the act to see whether there are any anomalies which could be eliminated? to give consideration to what has been put to me by the honourable member. The Commonwealth Government has, over recent years, from time to time reviewed this legislation and has made changes in its terms. We have to keep before us the legislation of the State governments as well, because I think it is generally recognized that, so far as is practicable, there should be reasonable uniformity of treatment of these matters among the various governments in this Commonwealth. I know that the honourable gentleman has given a lot of thought to the problems arising from this legislation and I would welcome any suggestions or assistance that he might give to our own thinking on this matter if he cares to make his views known to me. dressed to the Treasurer. A week ago my colleague, the honourable member for Scullin, asked a number of questions dealing with the large annual payments made by Australian manufacturers for licences to produce goods of overseas design. The right honourable gentleman promised to make inquiries and to send the honourable member a reply. When does the Treasurer expect to be in a position to give the information desired on this very important matter? have not that information immediately by me, but I shall see whether I can give some indication to-morrow of where the inquiry stands. the Minister for Territories.

SoI did not see this programme. PerhapsI should say that both after the programme was presented for the first time about a month ago and since Monday night, a number of people with a knowledge of the Territory have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the programme. I do not know whether their opinion is well founded or not, because I have not seen the programme. I gathered that the ground for dissatisfaction was that these people thought the programme was not truly representative of the Territory and gave a wrong impression.

I do not think that it contains any specific proposals of a new kind. It exhibits the same general attitude as he put to us in London.

I understand that the computer room is already occupied, and that next year the RAAF. will be taking it over. We have had a team recently in the United States of America whose members have returned with a considerable amount of knowledge on this subject and have carried out work here. I understand from what I have been told that the computer will be of considerable use to the RAAF. I can tell the honourable member that, for example, whereas at the present moment it takes us something like 12,000 man-hours over a period of a fortnight to compute the pay of the RAAF., once this computer is i-j operation four men, in about 80 minutes' work, will do the same job.

Will he agree that the abolition of such sales tax could substantially boost local consumption of those products and stimulate both local primary and secondary honourable members are aware that sales tax is retained on a relatively small group of processed foodstuffs which can hardly be described as being in the essential foodstuffs that it is this Parliament which has determined upon the collection of revenue from that source and that if that revenue were not so collected we would have to look to other forms of taxation for a corresponding one of policy which is reviewed from time to time as we prepare the budget for the ensuing period.

As each proposal is called on I thought it might be helpful to honourable members if I outlined very briefly the subjects covered by it. I will also suggest to the committee that where a preferential tariff proposal is also relevant to the main proposal, consideration of the preferential tariff proposal be included.

Labour Party offers no opposition to these the wide range of tariff proposals now before us I feel bound to say that in my opinion the Parliament is being treated very shabbily indeed in the way these proposals are brought forward. The proposal dealing with polyvinyl chloride came before the Parliament on 2nd May this year. The tariff expected on 10th October to discuss the merits of the tariff and to support or reject the proposal. But that is not all. The Government has no consistent policy concerning Tariff Board recommendations. As I have said, the proposal immediately before the committee first came before us on 2nd May last but the Government also intends that we shall discuss a tariff proposal introduced on 2nd October. In one case a long period of months has elapsed before discussion takes place and in the other case only a few days have elapsed. The time is long overdue for this Parliament to lay down a policy in respect of Tariff Board proposals which would enable the Parliament to discuss a proposal already in operation within one month or six weeks of its operating date. If that had been done with the proposals that are now coming before us honourable members would have been able to retain some knowledge of the proposals. In the case of new proposals, such as that introduced on 2nd October, we would have sufficient time to inform our minds on them. Let me illustrate the stupidity of the",19,Training For Industry

72,Mr Kelly (Wakefield) [3.31],"Mrwith Tarifi Proposals No. 21. My general remarks apply to these proposals as well as to most of the rest. Most of these Tariff Proposals that we shall discuss this afternoon emanate from reports made by the Special Advisory Authority whose appointment I so bitterly opposed earlier this year. Being so bitterly opposed to the new procedures, I have followed these reports with more than usual interest. As the debate proceeds, it will become apparent that I find many of them economically absurd. However, that is not the particular matter that I wish to discuss. One particular comment applies to the principle of these sliding-scale duties which have generally been adopted by the Special Advisory Authority in these and other proposals: The duty rises as the cost of the import falls, and falls as the cost of the import rises. The admitted reason for this is to prevent cheap imports from coming in. I shall not discuss the question of whether imports should be cheap, although I always think it is rather queer that when I , as a primary producer, would like access to cheap imports these are deliberately stopped. However, let us not look into that now. I should like to examine the philosophy behind these sliding-scale duties. The Opposition and we on this side of under recent legislation is that disruption the chamber have always disagreed about is caused when there is even a rumour of the philosophy of price-fixing. The fixing of another inquiry. The rumour of an inquiry prices suits their philosophy, but it does causes importers to reduce their -' imports, not suit ours. I shall not canvass the because they are frightened that the goods reasons at this stage. It seems queer to me may land in their laps just at the time when that people on this side of politics have duties are raised. I point out that many accepted so dumbly the principle of slidingmanufacturers go to some trouble to make scale duties, which are, in effect, another it known that they are asking the Special form of price-fixing. The only difference Advisory Authority to hear a case. between these duties and price-fixing is that the duties, instead of fixing prices down, fix them up. The duties rise as the about the sliding-scale duties and one about prices of imports fall, and fall as the prices the disruption of trade, in making my of imports rise. The result is that prices general comments about all the Tariff Prorise to a given base level fixed arbitrarily posals that we shall discuss this afternoon, by the Special Advisory Authority in many I now turn to Tariff Proposals No. 21, instances, and, if the recommended prowhich deal, among other things, with polytection is effective, the price of the local vinyl chlorides. I am glad that these proproduct adjusts itself to this base level. I submit, Sir, that the principle of giving any one person the power so arbitrarily to fix the prices of goods up is dangerous, partiOne would not expect worse than these. cularly when the prices are fixed after only Authority, of course, has time to make only a cursory examination. I am rather puzzled by the acquiescence of the Australian Labour Party in this. I understood that it was anxious to fix prices down. I did not understand that it was so willing to fix the prices of goods up. Furthermore, I congratulate those on this side of the chamber on their graceful acceptance of a principle that strikes directly at the root of our political philosophy. One thing should be said about these sliding-scale duties in particular, Sir: They remove incentive. What happens is that techniques change overseas, manufacturers of polyvinyl chloride become better at the manufacturing process, and, as a result, the price of the product falls. But, because of the sliding-scale duty, which rises as the price of the import falls, the price in this country of the imported product comes up to the base price. So the impetus for the reduction of prices is gone. This, I say, removes the incentive for Australian producers to market their product more cheaply. They do not have to compete with imports, the prices of which are falling, because the prices of imports are jacked up. Another feature of the activities of the Special Advisory Authority constituted Having voiced two particular criticisms posals are being taken first, Sir. Surely they are about as bad as proposals can be. In September of last year, the Minister",21,Tariff Proposals 1962
73,A Cursory Examination. The Special Advisory For Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Tabled A Report,"by the full Tariff Board on P.V.C. At that time, only one company in this country was making it. That company was our old friend, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, which manufactured the basic P.V.C. material under the protection of a 40 per cent, mostfavoured-nation duty. Surely a duty at that rate was high enough to protect a product which is the basis of many usages in secondary industry. In the report of the full board, Sir Leslie Melville and Mr Such information as is available to me indicates Boyer recommended a duty of 6id. per lb., which, they considered, approximated the duty of 40 per cent. The other two members of the board which made this report presented a report in which they recommended a duty of 7id. per lb. The Government accepted the recommendation for a duty of 6}d. per lb., but, almost immediately, referred the matter to the Special Advisory Authority for another report. Only six months after the full Tariff Board had reported, Sir Frank Meere, the Special Advisory Authority, presented a one-page report. He did not even mention the volume of imports, but he statedI am firmly of the opinion that the local P.V.C. would ask him inside to have a look at my Industry is in need of temporary assistance to enable it to operate efficiently and with an adequate return on funds invested. This latter aspect will necessitate some upward revision in the Industry's price structure. . . . He recommended temporary additional duty of 4id. per lb., making a total duty of l i d . per Ib., compared with the duty of 6id. per lb. recommended by two members of the full Tariff Board only six months before and the duty of 7±d. per lb. recommended by two other members of the board, which, many would say, erred on the side of generosity. The total duty of l i d . per lb. represents almost 100 per cent, and will fascinating subject, P.V.C. One would inevitably make P.V.C. very much dearer think that this last duty would be the end for those who use it in industry. The price of polyvinyl chloride is 26d. the Tariff Board is now conducting another per lb. in Australia, compared with 16.3d. inquiry into the same industry. In the in the United Kingdom, 17.1d. in the debate which preceded the appointment of United States of America and 14.6d. in the Special Advisory Authority this year I Japan. The product is nearly twice as dear mentioned that I could think of no quicker in Australia as in Japan. When I saw this, way to break the morale of the Tariff BoardI sat back with grim amusement to see than to pass applications from the board to what would happen. I did not have long the Special Advisory Authority and from to wait. On 18th June last, the Minister him back to the board again. I thought for Trade referred to the Special Advisory then that perhaps I was drawing rather a Authority the question of further protection for those industries that use P.V.C. I thought that Sir Frank Meere was at his best in his second report. I admit that his reports generally have been models of brevity. He makes no effort to disguise things which others would like to see hidden in a mass of verbiage. In fact, I have often thought that it is not for nothing that his name is Frank. But in this report he is at his best. Listen to thisthat the industry is supplying an increasing proportion of the demand for goods of the types and classes which it manufactures. However, the industry maintains that its current sales volume has only been achieved by reducing its prices to levels more competitive with imports. So in order to cure this Sir Frank recommended specific duties which approximate 22 per cent., thus giving a total protection of 66i per cent. It is clear that in these two cases the object of the exercise is not protection of industry but protection of income. I wish I could get Sir Frank interested in my farm. I can imagine him strolling around looking at my ricketty old fences and out-of-date buildings. ThenI books and maybe I would offer him a cup of tea. Then he would read the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and find that the average level of return on capital for wool-growers in my area is about 3 per cent. He would be so moved with compassion that I feel sure he would look after me in my adversity. I might suggest, in a mild aside, that one of the ways he could help would be to make the things I buy cheaper rather than dearer. But he must be a marvellous person to know. I have digressed. Let us return to that of the exercise. But of course it is not. With the ink hardly dry on its first report long bow, but I begin to wonder. I am beginning to think that this is a deliberate attempt to weaken the independence of the Tariff Board; if it is not a deliberate attempt it is having the same effect. Trade) [3.43] I speak to this subject because whereas the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall), who is in charge of the chamber at present, represents the Minister for Customs and Excise, I , as the Minister for Trade, have a responsibility for the Government's policy of protection. While I cannot undertake to speak to every tariff proposal which will come before the committeeI do not think honourable members expect me to do soI think that this is an appropriate occasion for me to offer some observations. I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). His message seemed to be that if, in the absence of a tariff, a company operates at a loss, it should be left to operate at a loss. I am afraid that commerce is not like that. If it is government policy that a business shall operate at a loss, business discontinues. It lays off its employees and does the best it can with its investment. You cannot tell business that it shall operate at a loss. You can tell it that you do not want it to operate, but you cannot tell it that it is governmental policy -that it shall operate at a loss. You cannot even tell this to one business because every other business in the land will begin to wonder what security it has and what the future holds for it. If there is one over-riding policy consideration which the Australian people demand, I am sure it is that thc country shall continue to grow, that there shall be a base for absorbing new population and that there shall be employment for new population. These things are inseparable from stable manufacturing industry. I say unhesitatingly that this Government's policy is that there shall be stability in our manufacturing industry without which there cannot be stability of employment and assured prospects of growth. In making that statement. I do not ignore the interests of the great primary industries for which I am a particular spokesman. I join with the honourable member for Wakefield in saying that they have to be enabled to survive also. But there is no future for this country if one sector of the economy is enabled to survive by deliberately destroying another sector. There must be an integrated growth of the economy. In the fast-moving, international, cut throat business world you cannot say that a decision taken to-day will not be changed. You cannot say that any such decision must stand for a substantial period irrespective of the circumstances which may develop. The item under discussion illustrates the fast-moving, if not the cut-throat, character of the competition in its manufacture. The industry concerned with this product first appeared before the Tariff Board as long ago as 1958 when it claimed that it was being harmed by dumping from Japanese sources. A Tariff Board inquiry was conducted but not for protectionist purposes because one of the functions of the Tariff Board is to ascertain whether dumping is being practised. The Tariff Board finding on this occasion was to the effect that on the evidence it was unable to say that dumping was occurring. That decision having been taken the industry, quite within its rights-n o new right but one that has existed in various forms for 40 years-appeale d to the Government to have the Tariff Board conduct an inquiry into its claim for sufficient protection. So, a normal Tariff Board hearing took place. The honourable member for Wakefield has referred to it. By majority decision which the Government adopted-the Government usually accepts the Tariff Board's recommendations although it is not bound to do so-the board recommended on 14th September, 1961, that a specific rate of duty of 6id. a lb. be applied. Within a year the industry was able to produce prima facie evidence that this protection was insufficient to enable it to survive against competition. In accordance with the law which the Parliament had approved -it is notorious 1 that not all of the Parliament approves all laws but in this case there was no division, if I remember rightly-the case was referred to the Special Advisory Authority. He is not a duplication of the Tariff Board. His function is not to do precisely what a full board of eight members and the whole",22,Tariff Proposals 1962
74,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister formechanism of the Tariff Board machinery does with more leisure. His function is to ascertain whatever evidence is available and, within 30 days, to make a recommendation to the Government designed not to establish a permanent state of affairs but a holdthis Parliament. We are out to encourage the-line state of affairs if in his judgment this is necessary. He made certain recommendations. The honourable member for Wakefield has said that the Special Advisory Authority recommended a further increase in duty. That was approved by the Government, and the law requires that the matter automatically shall be referred back to the Tariff Board. That has been done and it is with the Tariff Board at present. I take up with the honourable member for Wakefield his charge that to refer back to the Tariff Board a matter which had been before it a year or so previously is calculated to break the Tariff Board's morale. The primary responsibility of this Parliament and of the Tariff Board is not to attend to the morale of the Tariff Board, it is to attend to the well-being of the Australian economy. The duty of the Tariff Board is to respect the law which this Parliament passes. If this Parliament passes a law which clearly contemplates that in certain circumstances a matter shall be referred back to the Tariff Board, then there is no justification for representing the than the cost of production in Australia the Government's action in referring such a matter back to the Tariff Board as one calculated to destroy the morale of the board. I do not believe that the Tariff Board is such a tender plant as that. I hope it is not. It is a bad thing for the manufacturing industries and the primary industries of this country if the Tariff Board is as tender certainly implied it. However, I accept his a plant as that. I do not believe it is.

I do not think that such an attitude would represent Australian public thinking. It certainly does not represent the thinking of the industrialization of this country, both primary and secondary, and to encourage its tertiary activities. There are certain industries, particularly those described as "" capital intensive"", in which everybody knows, as I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield knows, that to have the lowest achievable unit cost of production there must be a certain economic throughput. That is why it is essential, particularly in this type of industry, if we want it to survive, that there shall be some device of protection which ensures a certain economic through-put, otherwise there will be unbearably high unit costs. I hope that every one does want this industry to survive. One concern which I cannot name has stated that if the Government will take such a course to sustain its volume of through-put and its unit costs it will undertake not to raise its prices. This is not an airy-fairy story. This has been done and the promise has been honoured. I am sorry, but we cannot accept the proposition that because polyvinyl chloride can be produced in the United Kingdom or Japan for lower industry ought not to exist in Australia or that it should be allowed to wither and fold up. statement that he did not say it.

He has said that the tariff should not be attacked on the ground that it increases prices in the community. I believe, as the Minister pointed out, that there is a relationship between tariffs and the Department of Trade. The effectiveness of tariffs can be assured only if we have a desirable and effective trade policy. The honourable gentlemen who have spoken have considered the tariff in relation to prices and in relation to the promotion of industries in this country. They considered this question in a Very general manner. I , too, should like to make a few remarks in connection with the tariff generally.

Does the Government say, in the this country in great quantities despite our face of that, that it must remain inactive tariffs and are being sold over the counters and cannot do anything through its tariff of vast emporiums throughout Australia. provisions or the Department of Trade to Why is that possible? It is possible because protect the industries of this country and tariff protection is not enough.

Australia sells to Japan about three and one-half times as much in value as she buys from her. If the Department of Trade operated on the advice of the honourable member for Scullin and decided not to allow those goods into this country, Australia would not have Japan as a customer. Japan has been Australia's best customer for many primary products. The honourable member for Scullin made the point that because of some of the goods coming into Australia a certain amount of unemployment was created; or, to put it the other way, if the goods were not coming in more employment would be available. That may be so, but if Australia did not have a very satisfactory trade or make an overall assessment of what agreement with Japan and was not able to sell the vast amount of wool and other products to that country under that agreement, surely there would be more unemployment in this country than would be caused by allowing certain goods from Japan into Australia. I ask fhe honourable member: Is not everything in favour of Australia in the Japanese Trade Agreement, and is it not absolutely imperative that Auslralia should take a reasonable amount of Japanese goods so that we can sell to Japan a vast quantity of our primary products? Chairman, in the course of this debate on the report of the special Tariif Advisory Authority on polyvinyl chloride resins and moulding compounds we have seen behaviour which, at one stage, one would have regarded as remarkable and upsetting, but which is now becoming traditional. Because we are familiar with it we no longer pay great attention to it as we once would have. There is obvious dissension in the ranks of the Government on various aspects of policy. Not only did the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) launch an unreasonable and unjustifiable attack on this particular tariff proposal and the Government which resulted in, first, the on public servants who, after all, are only commissioned to carry out the policy and orders of the government of the day, but he also made critical comments on his cohorts on the Government benches. AlthoughI agree with him that there is far too much dumb acquiescence in the dictates of the oligarchy running the Government, I cannot help feeling that his cohorts were justified in criticizing him for attacking them in this way. No less an authority than the Minister first to rebuke the honourable member for Wakefield, and he was quickly followed by the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden), who dissociated himself from the remarks of his fellow-supporter of the Government. I believe that the expressions of the honourable member for Wakefield epitomized the narrow, insular and parochial bigotry which is exhibited far too often by members of the Government. They do not take an expansive view of the needs of the national economy Australia needs in order to develop. There are certain members opposite who can think of nothing but their own particular problems. From what the honourable member for Wakefield said it is obvious that he has a farm somewhere, which he feels is the pivot upon which Australia revolves. It is to him the axis of the nation. He is not worried about the distress that exists in secondary industry. He does not care for the welfare of the thousands and thousands of workers who are employed in our industries. We, of the Opposition, take a more balanced view of these matters. We realize that tariffs are laisser-faire has been discredited during the past century of the world's history, yet some honourable members opposite, from purely selfish motives, would see such a policy inflicted on the nation. We, on this side of the chamber, realize that we have to protect secondary industries, because while workers in those industries are earning their pay they spend it. They constitute the consumer market. They are the people who buy the products of primary industry. Let us remember that it was the short sighted and ineffectual policies of large-scale unemployment which has been maintained for a disgracefully long period, and secondly, a lessening of the prosperity of our primary producers.

We realize that there must be present in industry a certain level of efficiency, but Australia has particular proThis is a subject. I intend to develop blems. We cannot launch out on a programme of industrial development such as the United States of America has, because whereas that country has a population of about 180,000,000 we have only 10,000,000 people. Our industrial production suffers certain restrictions which are not apparent in the industries of a country which can mass-produce huge quantities of one particular line. In Australia production must be on a smaller scale. Further, Australia has a reasonable standard of living, despite the efforts of the Government to wreck it. We have a reasonable standard of living the honourable member for Oxley, as I -reminded the honourable member for Scullin, that he is going outside the scope of the matter at present before the committee. Mr Chairman, I was referring to the commodities under consideration and saying that if these things are to be manufactured in Australia, tariff protection is needed. I was coming to the point that eastern countries have low wage structures and therefore lower costs of production than ours are. I hope, and so does the nation, that it is not the policy of the Government to reduce our standards of living to meet competition on our home market, which, as members of the Government often claim, is our best market. We must offer our commodities on this market first because, if we do not, our consumer market will not be stimulated and our nation will not prosper. Locally manufactured products such as previous occasions. The people of Auspolyvinyl chloride resins and moulding tralia know those things very well, as they compounds, and hosts of other things indicated by their support of Labour in must have tariff protection against comthe last election. Are we to see a petition from the products of low-wage recurrence of the build-up in our overseas countries. Many overseas countries subtrade deficit, as the portents now seem to sidize these products. Japan heavily subindicate? This type of thing must bo sidizes many commodities for export to the Australian market. Canada and France also subsidize some products for export to the Australian market and this upsets our trade. Dealing with woollen piece goods, the Minister for Supply said he felt that some protection should be afforded to a section of the textile industry which will face the threat of cheap imports from Italy. further when that proposal is being debated. The point I wish to make rises out of the attitude of the honourable member for Wakefield who, as I was glad to hear from criticism of 1 him by fellow-members of the Government, was not expressing the attitude of the Government. His view was that we should have a period of free trade. We could not possibly hope to bear the burden of such a policy; it would wreck the development of Australia. We have already seen what followed from the Government's policy of abolishing import controls in 1960. Imports rose and we had a heavy trading deficit. Then in a moment of panic, to offset this and other movements in the nation's economy, the Government introduced a severe credit squeeze. We know the suffering that caused not only to the people of Australia but also to our industries. It set the development of Australia back by about 10 per cent. We lost about £700,000,000 worth of production because of the Government's policy. Now imports are starting to build up again since the credit squeeze has been eased and at the same time the Government is commencing to remove emergency tariffs. Does this mean that we are to see a recurrence of the disastrous cycle which wreaked so much havoc on Australia? Are we to see now, as we saw previously, the abolition of import controls and the development of a heavy overseas trading deficit? There is no need to go into all the side effects and all the side issues, because they have been debated in this chamber on",28,Tariff Proposals 1962

If industry is to be rebuffed again-ther e are sections of industry which are still staggering and reeling under the blows administered by the credit squeeze remind the honourable member that going outside the scope of the matter is under discussion at the moment. is not a general debate. some form of parallel between abolition of import controls and the abolition of these protective emergency tariffs. If this nation is to develop to its proper stature we must have some measure of protection for industry. I am not proposing outlandish tarifl measures, but we on this side of the chamber believe that reasonable action must be taken to protect employment in this country's industries, which are operating for the benefit of the nation. We do not wish to see any diminution of national development or any economic decline, but the portents are there, and unless this Government is prepared to undertake immediately an effective policy of protection for the benefit of the nation we will find our economy regressing to where it was eighteen months ago. say a word in defence of my friend the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr large output in order to be able to pay, and Kelly). I must say that I resent strongly the suggestion made by members on both sides of the chamber that the honourable member for Wakefield, in presenting to the committee the results of a careful consideration of the matter under reference, is a free trader. The honourable member for Wakefield did an enormous amount of work on this subject, without having the benefit of the resources available to the Government in the Public Service, and came to a conclusion about the recommendations made which the Government has accepted, lt is utter nonsense to say that because of what he said the honourable member for Wakefield is a free-trader in favour of the abolition of protection. At no stage in his speech did he say he was not in favour of the tariff. He did not even say that he was not in favour of the temporary protection procedures. What he did, taking evidence from both the Tariff Board report and the Special Advisory Authority's report, was to cast doubt on the level of protection. Surely he is entitled to do that without everybody in this place branding him with the label ""free-trader"" and asserting that he is not again in favour of the development of this he is country's industries, or of national developwhich ment, and is taking a narrow and parochial This view. These are complicated and complex matters. Why else would we have the Tariff Board system? . Why else is the Tariff Board required to make long and detailed reports to this Parliament? Why else is the Special Advisory Authority required to make reports? Why else do these reports require the consideration of this Parliament, if members are not to be entitled, after making an examination of the reports, to point to defects which they believe exist in the reports? T listened carefully to the speech made by the honourable member for Wakefield, and not once did he utter a suggestion which implied that he was against protection. He pointed to some defects in the report of the Special Advisory Authority in this case, and I submit that his statements have not been answered. I say with all due respect that the Minister suggested that the honourable member for Wakefield did not realize that a capital-intensive industry had to have a that this was one of the reasons why protection in the particular case has been virtually doubled since the last Tariff Board report on it was made. I am sure that most honourable members understand-cer tainly the honourable member for Wakefield does-that it does not always work out this way, because what has happened in respect of this particular industry is that, as the honourable member for Wakefield pointed out, whereas there was one firm in the field before this duty was applied there are now two in the field. The second firm has been encouraged into the field by the level of protection given. Where are you in respect",29,Tariff Proposals 1962

99,Mr Forbes (Barker) [4.20],"I rise toof capital-intensivity in that particular respect? The honourable member for Wakefield has also been roundly criticized because, it was said, he was taking a selfish view when he talked of the effect that pursuit of an unwise tariff policy has on the farming community. What he said was perfectly true. The Minister mentioned capital-intensivity. Is there any industry in this country which is more capital-intensive these days than farming? On a quick calculation, the average farm represents something like £40,000 to £50,000 in capital investmentand most farms need that amount of capital investment in order to be profitable-whic h means that the average farm is twice as capital-intensive as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Even on the Minister's arguments the farming community is entitled to some sort of consideration in that respect. I am just mentioning this in order to point out that the honourable member for Wakefield is perfectly entitled to refer to the effect that an unwise level of duty-no t protection itself as such-wil l have on the farming community, even on the argument of capital intensivity. I will conclude, Sir, by repeating that I think that it would be a great pity for the parliamentary institution if, after an honourable member has made a careful and conscientious attempt to perform his duty to examine and review reports of the Tariff Board and the Special Advisory Authority, this new trend should be hit on the head. I know that that will not happen in this case, because the honourable member for Wakefield has got guts and will not be deterred by the tactics that have been used. But I repeat that it would be a great pity if this new trend were thrown overboard just because people are going to start pinning the old label of ""free-trader"" on anybody who disputes the level of tariff protection or the procedures used in applying protection. honourable members that this debate is on the lower rungs, but to the permanent the subject of polyvinyl chloride and is not employees on the top rungs of the ladder. a general debate on tariff proposals or on To illustrate this, I turn to page 12 of the tariff in general. SoI ask members of the committee to relate their remarks to the matter before the Chair. to make a brief comment on proposals that are listed on the notice-paper. As a member representing a country district I point out that my electorate is vitally interested in what happens as a result of Tariff Board reports on textiles. People in my electorate would like to know what is going to happen about protection for the textile industry, because country communities are dependent to a large degree for their prosperity on the textile industry and textile mills. They would like an assurance that the current proposals in connection with textiles will not be proceeded with. I differ from the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) in my understanding of the remarks made earlier by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). I agree with the Minister for Trade( Mr McEwen) that the honourable member for Wakefield implied that if we can buy imported goods cheaper than locally produced goods we should allow our local industries to fade away. An examination of "" Hansard"" to-morrow may prove otherwise, but certainly the Minister for Trade thought that the honourable member for Wakefield implied that. So did the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), and so do I . I would like the honourable member for Wakefield to bear in mind the fact that there is a vast difference between the cost structures of Australia and of the countries that compete with us. This fact is adequately borne out by a comment that appears on page 7 of the Tariff Board's report:There is also a strong threat of competition from Japan which has a wage structure far lower than has been revealed in publications. As a person who spent some years in Japan, I can assure the honourable member that that is true. There is a number of grades of employees in Japanese factories, and generally the information that you and I get about wages and working conditions of",30,Tariff Proposals 1962

The paign of sniping at them, as he has been doing for some time. some news for you, Mr Chairman; I intend to address my remarks, as far as possible, to the matter before the Chair, the report of the Special Advisory Authority on polyvinyl chloride. I would like to remind the committee that these tariff measures are really the result of Labour's policy as announced during the last election campaign. Before the election this Government had completely discarded Australian manufacturing industries, and it was only when its majority was substantially reduced that it realized the vital necessity to establish a Special Advisory Authority, and in a roundabout, half-baked way, to face the great problem of protection of Australian industries. The matter now under discussion is the Wakefield has certain views on tariffs. His views are difficult to follow, having in mind Generally speaking, the honourable memSpecial Advisory Authority states in his report on this industryCapital employed in the local industry would be of the order of £5,000,000 and employees engaged would approximate 1,000 persons. I have studied the recent annual report of the Tariff Board and it is interesting to note the dependence of employment on the Australian manufacturing industry. The report contains on page 11 statistics relating to the number of people employed in factories in this country. In 1962 there were 1,100,000 people employed in factories in Australia. Industries which provide employment for Australians-the industry under discussion provides employment for 1,000 Australians -ar e entitled to protection from this Government. Let us take this matter a step further. In appendix C on page 5 of the Special Advisory Authority's report there is a list of the associations and companies that were",32,Tariff Proposals 1962

122,Mr Cairns,"Mr Chairman, I have no undesirable for any kind of questioningChairman, it is not my desire to take up a great deal of the committee's time, but I want to say something about some observations made by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) on polyvinyl chloride. The honourable member is one member of this place who at least would know whether polyvinyl chloride was a parrot or a cockatoo. If there is one member of this place who really devotes his time to the study of tariff items, it is the honourable member for Wakefield, and I always listen with profound respect to what he has to say, even though I do not necessapily agree with him. The honourable member mentioned the name of the great company that manufactures polyvinyl chloride in Australia-Imperia l Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited-and pointed out that applications for tariff protection made by that company see-sawed between the Special Advisory Authority and the Tariff Board. There seemed to be, on the part of the Special Advisory Authority and the board, a strange, sweet solicitude for the company. I wondered, immediately I became aware of it, why the same strange, sweet solicitude was not extended to the textile industry. This brings me to the particular questions that I want to ask: Why were the Tariff Board reports on textiles and man-made fibres not presented to honourable members this afternoon? When shall we receive the reports, and what is to happen in the meantime? Mr Malcolm Fraser -Honorabl e members have had the reports for a week or more. presented. Chairman, I suggest that the honourable members who told the honourable member for St. George( Mr Clay) that the reports on textiles and man-made fibres about which he asked were already available misunderstood what he was getting at. He was really asking why the Customs Tariff Amendments, which were listed on to-day's notice paper and which are designed to confirm the tariff rates on textiles now operating were not proceeded with. he wanted the reports? I made that explanation, Mr Chairman, having in mind some liberties that were taken earlier this afternoon by other people. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), for example, came to the defence of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). Then he told us that the honourable member for Wakefield has an ample supply of guts. I am sure he has. What impressed me particularly was the evidence of disintegration in the ranks of Government supporters because the Minisgated the honourable member for Wakefield a castigation which normally would have been reserved for me as the honourable member leading the debate for the Opposition. After enjoying your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I conclude by saying that we shall not oppose this proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 22). Consideration resumed from 2nd May (vide page 1834), on motion by Mr FairhallThat the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 19331962, as proposed to be amended by Customs Tariff Proposals, be further amended as set out in the Schedule to these Proposals . . . (vide page 1833). Supply) [5.1] -This proposal covers three subjects. The first is the imposition of additional temporary duties on slide viewers and image projectors arising from a recommendation by a Special Advisory Authority. Secondly, following a report on yarns wholly of or containing continuous filament man-made fibres, including monofil and existing duties on acetate rayon yarns should be retained and extended to yarns in chief part by weight of acetate rayon while triacetate yarns, not made in Australia, reverted to non-protective rates of duty.

Items 44 and 382-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Item 390Opposition has asked that item 390 be considered separately because it is a reduction in tariff. The Tariff Board has recommended in relation to imitation catgut of man-made fibre materials, non-sterile, that the British preferential tariff be reduced by 20 per cent, and that the most-favourednation tariff be reduced by 37i per cent. As far as we know, there has been no claim that this product cannot be or will not be manufactured in Australia, and in the absence of some satisfactory explanation by the Minister for the proposed reduction the Opposition very strongly opposes the proposal. It is evident that at some time the product we are discussing was either manufactured in Australia or manufacture in Australia was contemplated, and to assist the industry the two rates of tariff were imposed. We do' not consider that there is any justification at this stage for adopting the Tariff Board's recommendation that the existing protective., tariffs be reduced. We believe that the Tariff Board's report does riot go far enough. Supply) [5.4]'!-It is clear that the Tariff Soafd had no evidence on this particular subject and therefore it set down what it presumed to be a reasonable level of protection. After all, the board is not unknowlgdgeable on matters of this kind because of the general references which are made to it from time to time. Having no specific evidence before it, the board established the proposed tariffs as reasonable, and the Government is prepared to accept the recommendation. that the Tariff Board had no evidence either way before it is no justification for the committee accepting the board's recommendation for a reduction in tariff. Simply because some one was not wide awake enough to, attend the board hearing and ask that the existing tariff stand, there is no justification for the pro'posed reduction. A reduction in tariff may do a substantial injury to this industry. In those circumstances the Opposition will vote against this proposal. Question putThat the item be agreed to.

159,Mr Kelly,"I am glad to have theadvisory authority the Tariff Board had completed its public hearing, but it had not submitted its report. I am referring to the ful] board. The Special Advisory Authority's report was signed on 24th May and the full board's report was signed on 28th June. So there was about a month during which this procedure was necessary. That is the first complaint I make. When this special advisory authority procedure was instituted we understood that the authority was to be called in if emergency action was needed; but nobody can tell me that emergency action is needed when there is only one month elapsing between the signing of the special advisory authority's report and the signing of the full board's report. But of course the Minister did not wait. He moved in and the special advisory authority was asked to report. He found that imports were threatening local production. In his report he did not give anyfiguresfor imports but he said that the percentage was increasing. Of course, if the import figure were small in the first place then obviously a percentage increase of that figure would not be significant. The full board in its report found that at no time was the amount of imports more than 18 per cent. When you realize that rubber belting is something in which particular grades are needed for different jobs-and in any case there are always by-law entries given by the customs authorities to allow this particular class of goods to come in, because Australian industry cannot supply them-it is obvious that imports will not be affected outright. The Special Advisory Authority admits, with typical frankness-and I pay a tribute to him for it-that there is a ring operating amongst these rubber belt manufacturers. If we wanted to put it in parliamentary parlance I suppose we could say that restrictive trade practices were being indulged in. I shall read an extract from the authority's report, because I do not want to do him an injustice. Rather do I think he should get full marks for making these statementsCertain users expressed dissatisfaction with the to know, and I would like the Minister manufacturers' practice of quoting uniform prices and conditions when tendering for belting contracts. In my view, there is some justification for this dissatisfaction and the practice may explain, in some small part, the local manufacturers' loss of orders to overseas suppliers. Having made that point, and having shown that he knows what is happening, he evidently felt that it was not fair to ask the manufacturers to break up their ring, and so he was prepared to impose increased duty of 5s. a square foot. The duty previously was 171 per cent, at the British preferential rate. Conveyor belting is not a luxury material. It is vitally necessary in industry. It is an essential tool of trade. It is essential, for instance in coal-mining. We hope to build up our exports of coal, and yet we make considerably dearer the very tool that we have to use in the extraction of coal. There are many wheat silos in my area. There is one at Wallaroo in which 23,056 square feet of rubber belting is used. This extra duty of 5s. a square foot would increase the cost of equipping a similar silo-and they are going up all over my electorate-by £5,764. As I say, it is not a matter of an extra amount for one silo, because silos are being built all over the country. The extra cost will have to be borne by the wheat-growers. We build our own silos. It would be interesting to learn to what extent the cost of equipment for the bulk-handling installation at Gladstone would be increased by this extra duty. One would think we were deliberately looking around for ways to make it more difficult to export goods competitively. After all, this is what we will achieve if we continue in this unreasonable fashion, rushing in and imposing unnecessary duties even when we know that a ring is operating amongst local manufacturers. Since this report was made by the Special Advisory Authority the Tariff Board itself has made a full report. It realized that the duty recommended by the authority was unnecessarily high, and it proposed an increase of the duty from 171 per cent, to 271 per cent., that is, it imposed an increase of 10 per cent., but the final rate was still lower than that recommended by the Special Advisory Authority. I want to tell me, whether, now that the Tariff Board has reduced to some extent the temporary duty imposed by the Special Aflyisory Authority, the matter will be referred again to the authority. Once again the honofable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) has vented .his spleen against the Special Advisory Authority. I interpret the authority's report in a way entirely different from that in which the honourable member for Wakefield interpreted it. Ths honourable member has given no importance to the fact that the people involved in this ring that he speaks of are such reputable firms as Apex Belting Proprietary Limited, Bramac Limited, Dunlop Rubber Australia Limited, Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company (Australia) Limited and Olympic General Products Proprietary Limited. These are ths people who are providing this country with a complex of undertakings in the rubber industry which represent a valuable asset to Australia and provide a large volume of employment. The special authority said that he held discussions with representatives of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the Australian Coal Association, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, George Angus and Company Limited, Turner Brothers Asbestos Company Limited, Greendale Engineering and Cables Proprietary Limited and a whole list of other organizations interested in these goods. The honourable member for Wakefield complained that no information was made available in this report. ing about the previous report, ""on phthalic anhydride. it you implied it very strongly. talking about the report on phthalic anhylaughter that I hear, it appears that honordride, the one we discussed previously. exactly the same thing 'in respect of this special authority who reported on the quesreport.

That was what State Electricity Commission of Victoria, he was appointed to decide. He did not know that a Tariff Board report would be coming out within a month. He examined the facts as they appeared to him, and, knowing all these things that the honourable number for Wakefield has referred to, such as the extra cost of belting used in silos, he decided that the extra duty was necessary. If the honourable member wants to talk about the cost of belting in silos, I suppose I would be allowed to mention that the belting used, for example, at the briquette works at Yallourn would cost a colossal amount. It would leave the cost of belting for wheat silos for dead! Yet, having all that knowledge, the authority decided that some protection was necessary, and so he did the right thing. I suppose the honourable member for Wakefield, in insisting on attacking the authority, is merely carrying on the sniping campaign that I complained of a little while ago. honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) suggested that insufficient information had been furnished to the committee. phthalic anhydride. member tried to give the impression that insufficient' information had been made available by the Special Advisory Authority. vious report. ber says it was the previous report.

We could be charitable and say that this was, perhaps, an omission on the part of the special authority due to pressure of work. We know that these inquiries are piling up all the time, and, generally speaking, the reports are very well presented. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield that the cost of this product in a certain kind of installation is very high, and that an increased duty of 5s. a square foot on rubber or other kinds of belting represents a very heavy impost on the industries that use this product. But when the honourable member tells us that the extra cost of belting for a silo in South Australia will be £5,000-perhap s he meant annually, but he did not say over what periodI remind him that he did not tell us the total value of the wheat conveyed on that belting during its lifetime. The honourable member is laughing, but he cannot laugh this off. The total value of wheat conveyed on belting that cost £5,000 could easily have been £5,000,000 during the life of the belt. In those circumstances the total cost of the belting would be infinitesimal in a consideration of total capital involved.

I assure the honourable member that if protective tariffs were removed and local industries destroyed there would be nothing to stop importers of a wide range of goods from imposing on the Australian community any price that they felt they could obtain. Earlier to-day the honourable member for Wakefield referred to a certain by-product produced at the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited plant at Newcastle. He said that only seventeen men were employed in the manufacture of that by-product. 1 would like the honourable member to tell me how much he thinks the Australian consuming public would be asked to pay for that product if there were no local industry protected by tariff and supplies had to be imported.

Obviously if an article is not manufactured in Australia, importers are at liberty to charge any price they like for the imported article.

Of all the industries being sheltered from best treatment of all. The last report on this subject by the full Tariff Board was made in 1957.

187,Ter For Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Took Action To,"The Minister for Trade, having received the report from the deputy chairman of the Tariff Board rejecting the request for additional duty on fine paper, reacted quite strongly and referred the matter back again under the obnoxious provisions of the act providing for reference in "" special circumstances"". The deputy chairman this time bowed before the storm and recommended temporary duty of an additional £10 a ton. This was in September of last year. The sorry catalogue continues from there. In the meantime, Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited, considering that it was being neglected in this exercise, breasted the trough and requested temporary protection on the lines of paper that it was producing. This was in July of last year. The company received a hand-out of an increase of £9 a ton in duty, which just about doubled the duty. The deputy chairman of the board also found that that company, too, was engaging in a restrictive trade practice by giving a l i per cent, discount to merchants who promised to buy only from it. If merchants will not buy only from that company, they are forced to import in order to compete, because no merchant can give his competitors a price advantage of 7 i per cent. This restrictive trade practice is encouraging imports. The deputy chairman of the Tariff Board had recommended two increases of duty, but, evidently, this was not enough for that poor company, because in May of this year, the Special Advisory Authority entered the fray and began to help the company. He recommended a temporary duty of an additional £20 a ton on wrapping paper. The duty on this product began at £19 a ton last year, went up by £9 a ton in July and then took another jump of £20 a ton to a total of £48 a ton-a n overall increase of £29 a ton, or 68 per cent. And no one could justifiably describe wrapping paper as a luxury. The same sort of picture may be seen over the whole field. The duty on printing paper began at £28 a ton. The deputy chairman of the Tariff Board recommended an increase of £9 a ton and the Special Advisory Authority recommended another increase of £10 a ton. And so it goes on. In the meantime, the Special Advisory Authority admitted that these restrictive trade practices that the deputy chairman found operating were still operating. The profit rate of Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited is highly interesting. ment shows a profit of £2,089,250, or a return of 11.9 per cent, on capital. I know that this profit may not seem large to some people, but it seems large to me. Mr Malcolm Fraser -Was this the company's record profit in 22 years of operation? Mir. Malcolm Fraser -Has not the company also made a bonus share issue? really seems'to be struggling along reasonably well. In the meantime, the poor old Tariff Board is scrambling about trying to catch up with things. The board completed its public inquiry, which was followed by a reference of the matter back to a deputy chairman of the board. Whether the board will hold another inquiry subsequent to this last reference to the Special Advisory Authority no one is told, but I presume that there will be yet another inquiry. Even if there is not, there have already been five inquiries into the papermaking industry since May of last year. If the Department of Trade were setting out deliberately to break the morale and the back of the board by imposing repetitive work on it, surely the department could do little better than it has done. Chairman, I have listened carefully to the honorabie member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). The Australian Labour Party has no illusions about the capacity of Australian manufacturers and business enterprises to endeavour by every possible means to exploit the Australian community. However, we are not unconscious of the fact that we prefer to be exploited by Australian-domiciled companies and enterprises rather than by concerns domiciled in other parts of the world. Not one penny of foreign capital is invested in any of the Australian paper and pulp enterprises. It is the proud boast of these companies that in every respect they are Australian. Australian money is invested in them and they use Australian plant. They are Australian enterprises. The",47,Pairs

I read in a recent report of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited of the company's resentment because, too frequently, Australian governments support and encourage the investment of foreign capital which inevitably and Without reservation must, together with the dividends it earns from the Australian people, be repatriated to the United States of America, Great Britain or Europe. Whatever the profiteering activities of this company may be, at least it can be said that in regard to the dividends able member to come to Gippsland and see which it declares and the profits which it distributes among its Australian shareholders, the Australian Parliaments, Commonwealth and State, have complete control over its activities and, to the extent that they think desirable, can discipline the company. Our arbitration courts determine the wage rates and conditions of labour of the company's employees. In those circumstances, speaking on behalf of the Opposition in this Parliament, I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that the Opposition stands four-square behind the measures of protection accorded to these Australian enterprises. If the Government parties think that the protection'will be abused by the Australian paper companies, they have the right to introduce restrictive trade practices legislation to cope with the situation. Despite the promises which have been made in this regard, no such legislation has been forthcoming. The way is open to the Government parties to accept the recommendations before us. of the Constitutional Review Committee and thereby give power to this Parliament to police prices and profits. I repeat here not lose sight completely of the points made ancl now that, although the companies by the honourable member for Wakefield stand always for high prices and profits, we ( Mr Kelly).

Here is a new primary industry. We have sought to encourage primary industry in many ways. Surely it is worthwhile to grant assistance to the paper industry. Surely the cost of doing so will be more than offset by the additional employment opportunities which will be made available.

195,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [8.29],"We shouldhe has stated that in accepting a tariff we are ignoring the significance of restrictive practices in industry. Clear evidence has been produced to, and accepted by, the Special Advisory Authority during his investigation of the two most recent cases which have been mentioned, namely, the conveyor belt industry and the paper industry. The evidence indicates that it is unsound economically to continue granting tariff protection to concerns that operate in rings to raise their prices independently of their cost of production and to do the very thing that the tarifl seems designed to prevent. We adopt a tariff system to establish an industry and allow it to grow suffihave shares in Associated Pulp and Paper ciently to produce at lower costs and lower prices. But here the honourable member for Wakefield has put hisfingeron a weakness. He has said that in respect of conveyor belts the Olympic and Dunlop companies and two or three other producers operate in a ring, fix their prices; the honourable member for Yarra that that particular proposal has already been dealt with. go on to another point if you rule that way, Chairman, that I would be prepared to conbut a few minut-es ago, when I asked percede the substance of the case made by the mission to speak and you said that you honourable member for Wakefield but I do would call the honourable member for Wakenot want the honourable member or any one field, it was on this very point that I wished else simply to let it go at that.

When the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) interjected a few minutes ago I was quite surprised to hear some implied criticism from the Government side of people who might Mills Limited. I should have thought that perhaps the honourable member for Wannon would have had an investment in that company, but apparently his investments are placed in other high profit organizations. I shall leave that matter there. I think that the honourable member for Wakefield has made a strong case in relation to the effect of restrictive trade practices and other matters to which I cannot refer because of the nature of the debate but which have been referred to in this very well to criticize what occurs in the course of the imposition of tariffs on comwould affect Australian industry and presumably the commodities that would otherThis tariff, we can assume, is necessary",49,Pairs

I think the honourable member for Wakefield has not established his case in respect of this. He might state that paper pulp would come into Australia for 6d. per lb. less than the price at which it would be sold under this tariff, but we have had a good deal of experience of rings and price fixing by importing concerns and we have no guarantee that if we allowed free imports into Australia without the competition of the Australian product a lower price would result. SoI ask the honourable member for Wakefield and those who support him on the other side of the chamber, at some stage of the debate on these almost multitudinous items, to say whether their remedy is simply to refuse the tariff. There are other alternatives to what the Tariff Board or the special authority or the Minister may do. I suggest, Mr Chairman, that indicating for a moment what those alternatives are is completely relative to tbe matter before the committee. If the essence of this problem, in one respect is the establishment of restrictive practices, the operation of rings, the charging of excessive prices and the making of excessive profits, then perhaps the appropriate corrective is to introduce a restrictive practices law. We have been waiting for three years, or four or five, for the Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick), in co-operation with the State governments, to frame such a law. This is no remedy, either. Restrictive practices legislation has been so long delayed that we cannot anticipate that it will ever be introduced and, even if it were introduced, we would have very little confidence that it could be effective. In those countries in which such legislation has been introduced it has not proved to be very effective in keeping prices within reason. There is another remedy that might be adopted in cases such as this. I think that if it is estabtold, in effect, ""You put a tariff on this, lished at a tariff inquiry that restrictive pracdespite what you have discovered."" That tices exist the correct attitude for the Government to take is to refuse the tariff. The Government should say that unless the restrictive practices are abandoned tariff protection will not be provided. Surely we should not be prepared to give tariff protection under any conditions that may operate. We should not give tariff protection to monopolistic organizations, 3uch as those cited in this debate which Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) to say what he would are operating restrictive practices in order to enable them to increase their prices and make still more excessive profits. That would certainly not be in the interests of the Australian worker or consumer. Such action would be in the interests only of the monopolistic organizations concerned and, I regret to say, only in some instances in the interests of the union that organizes labour in their industries. The honourable member for Wakefield and his supporters must offer a little more than destructive criticism in this matter. In the course of the debate they have offered some very effective destructive criticism of tariff making but they have said nothing whatever about what they themselves would do. We are allowed to assume from what they have said that they would have refused the tariff, but that is no way out of it. We cannot get out of it that way. The development of Australian industry is going to require more protection in the future than ever it has had in the past, and those people who think in terms of primary or raw materials industries providing employment for people in this country and believe that we can move further in that direction are completely wrong. If we had relied on that kind of thing we might have a population of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 in this country, which would have perhaps a higher average standard, but no more. In fact we have 10,500,000 people to employ and to retain in employment in Australia, and that cannot be done without a system of protected secondary industries. That system of protection has to be efficient, and it is not much good our adopting a system in which we see a Special Advisory Authority refer a matter back, presumably because there are unsatisfactory conditions of restrictive practices operating in the industry, and then have it thrown back to him, and be is not the correct attitude to take. This is where the criticism in this matter rests firmly at the door of the Minister and perhaps his departmental advisers, because they are meekly and continuously accepting the practices of monopolistic industry in this country and will do nothing to interfere or check them. I should like the honourable member for do in these circumstances. I suggest that other would accept a tariff, no matter what, we should refuse a tariff unless the restricbecause the employment conditions were tive practices are broken down and, further, good. that we should consider refusing a tariff unless an economic price is charged for the done a real service to this committee in product produced.

These paper companies have to agree completely with the honourable been granted, by the Special Advisory member for Lalor( Mr Pollard).

Yet the conditions which the company had been able to establish before the Special Advisory Authority were, at the same time, such as to persuade the Special Advisory Authority that they should have some high additional temporary duties. Those facts, to me, do not seem to add up. The profit position of the company was not bad and, certainly, the record as reported in thefinancialpages of the newspapers some time ago would seem to indicate that the financial position of Australian Paper Manufacturers was pretty sound. The company has been able to come again at the end of last year with a peak profit and record dividends. June? end of June, 1962. I know that the temporary duties were granted earlier than this. Paper Manufacturers Limited is a very good suffering. suffering before to that extent. The dividend it paid for the year before was quite a realistic one and the profit it made for the year before was quite a realistic one of £1,600,000, a return of a bit over 9 per cent. How a company such as Australian Paper Manufacturers can, at the same time, persuade the Special Advisory Authority that it requires additional temporary tariff protection is quite beyond my comprehension. Chairman, this is a very interesting debate centred on the paper industry. There has been a great divergence of opinion among members on the Government benches about the justice and correctness of the decision by which duty has been imposed on paper coming into Australia. As one honourable member interjects, there may be a little difference between members on this side of the chamber, too, but it is very little by comparison. The differences have hardly been noticeable, but in view of what the honourable member for Wannon( Mr that it could produce a profit and pay diviMalcolm Fraser) said about the profits of the paper industry, let me say that we in Tasmania were grateful that the industry was assisted at this stage of its development and we, too, wonder how such a high profit and such high dividends can be reconciled with the granting of the duty. The company referred to must have had very good spokesmen and facts we did not know of when presenting its case to the Special Advisory Authority. 1 agree with the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) that the purpose of tariff protection should not be to increase unnecessarily the dividends or profits of any company, whether it is monopolistic or otherwise. If the tariff did that we would just be handing increased profits to private companies on a plate. Surely that is not the purpose of this Parliament, of the Tariff Board or of the Special Advisory Authority! The purpose of these bodies is to see that industries of this kind are kept going on a sound economic footing and that nothing is done to drag them down or cause a recession in their development through unfair overseas competition. Australian and efficient industry. At Burnie, on the company was north-west coast of Tasmania, this company employs well over 2,000 men, including the men in the bush, and it also has another mill or two in Victoria. It is a very big company and is doing a mighty job for Australia by supplying high-class paper and helping to give employment both at Burnie and on the mainland to thousands of men and women who would not otherwise be employed. I feel that this industry is doing a great service to the economy of Australia. During the credit squeeze it was caught in a pincer movement. First of all there were the credit restrictions, which affected sales of paper fair competition from imports. That was the pincer movement in which this industry, like many others, was caught up. The paper industry came to the Special Advisory Authority with a case for a duty on imported paper. The duty was granted, but not at as high a level as the industry wanted. I feel that on this tariff the industry will survive the temporary setback to its output and its expansion. Its profit for the twelve months ended June, 1961, proved that A.P.M. must be a very efficient company, in dends during a year of credit squeeze.",52,Pairs

The Special Advisory Authority has imposed a temporary duty, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) said, and the Tariff Board will' later examine the position. It may be six or even twelve months before the Tariff Board gets around to looking at the special authority's decision. At that stage it could either retain the duty at pregrowth of legitimate Australian-owned insent imposed by the special authority, reduce it, or even increase it. So, for nearly twelve months the industry will have protection. During the year of the credit squeeze unemployment at the Burnie mill amounted to about 600 men. That was a very large number indeed, but many of those men have been re-employed. Many of them are specialists and found great difficulty in obtaining temporary jobs elsewhere. They were brought up in the industry and know it from end to end. We are pleased to know that the industry has been assisted by the special authority, so that it can re-employ many of the men who were put out of work. Another reason why this industry deserves some consideration is that A.P.M. is going to expand in northern Tasmania by building another enormous mill at Wesley Vale, near Devonport in my electorate. The company proposes to spend £20,000,000 on the project over a ten-year period and preliminary building has already commenced on the site. This is a very good thing for the economy of Tasmania and that of Australia as a whole. Certainly it will improve and stabilize the employment position in that part of Tasmania. We congratulate the company on its forethat was caused in that area and of the great sight in practically doubling its plant and difficulty there is in finding employment production. It has expanded each year for for people put out of work in these cirmany years and this project at Wesley Vale cumstances in a rural district. I realize is a very big forward move.

It has been fortunate in order for it to survive, and that it was having been granted an extra duty to protect it from overseas competition. It is now up to the company to prove to the Government and to the special authority that having been given protection it can do the job efficiently. We, on this side of the chamber, feel that tariff protection should not be designed simply to expand dividends and profits unnecessarily, but basically to maintain economic stability and help the dustries. That is why we support this legislation. able member's time has expired. During an earlier part of the debate I said the honourable member for Wakefiel-d ( Mr Kelly) should be congratulated on the amount of work he had done and the study he had made of the subject. I am afraid that in the case of the paper industry he has broken down a bit and has not even read correctly fhe amounts of duty to be imposed. The honourable member mentioned a duty of £48, which I cannot find anywhere in Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 26). The report of the Special Advisory Authorityafter all, that is the only report that we are considering-wa s made to cover a particular set of circumstances. In that report it is stated that between December, 1960, and December, 1961, Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited and its subsidiaries put off 1,000 men. That is a very important point which the special authority no doubt took into consideration. Some 250 men were put out of work in one corner of the McMillan electorate where an A.P.M. mill is located.

I do not regard this as being a restrictive trade practice, because the company had to do that in order to keep its mills working on a full production basis. If the trade supports the company by giving it more business the whole of Australia will benefit. This is an industry which operates in every State and provides much employment, and it needs the support of the various outlets, which are themselves Australian manufacturing industries. It does not matter to the paper-bag manufacturers whether they use imported or Australian-made paper for their bags. They are concerned only with getting paper of a quality that will hold a pie or a pastie without its falling through. The cigarette manufacturers make packets to hold Australian cigarettes. Whilst they are pleased to get the fullest protection they can from this Government as regards their own cigarette-making industry they have the impertinence to want to import board for the making of cigarette packets, for the sake of saving £5 a ton or some such ridiculously small figure, which would mean that our own mills, which are quite capable of producing those things, would not be able to maintain full production and full employment of their workmen.

That is in accordance with ordinary business practice. The Special Advisory Authority finishes the paragraph dealing with this matter by sayingIn the circumstances That is, the refusal to grant the discountI do not recommend temporary duty on corrugated paper. I maintain that the Special Advisory Authority has handled this matter with judgment and studied each problem as it came up.

216,It Was Found There That Mr Coutts (Griffith) [9.5],"As theThe honourable member referred to restrictive trade practices being indulged in authority has not given all that was asked, by various manufacturers who are attempting to take advantage-lik e the company concerned in the matter we are now debating-of the Tariff Board and the Special Advisory Authority in order to inflate their profits. If such be the case-and we on this side of the chamber say it is the casefollowed the First World War, and the other there is a responsibility on the Government to do something about it. I know that honourable members opposite have long been the apostles of free trade and have said that they do not believe in any form of prices control by a government. Yet they are endorsing absolutely a form of prices control organized by manufacturers who create these monopolies-and the people of this country are the victims. It has been suggested by some honourable members that Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited has been getting a hand-out from the Tariff Board-to use ihe term employed by a member on the Government side-becaus e of the large profits it has made. The profit for last year has been stated at £2,089,000. We must all admit that no business organization establishes a manufacturing undertaking merely for the sake of supplying Australia with a commodity it needs or for the sake of providing work for the workless. An organization establishes a business undertaking for the purpose of making profit. At least, that is the first consideration. Apparently this company has been successful at long last in making a very substantial profit. Birt it has also, in adversity-adversit y created by the policy of this Government-provide d employment for a very large number of men. I am indebted to .the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) who pointed out that only recently, as the result o."" the policy of the Government that he supports, this company alone was compelled to dismiss 1,000 employees who had been engaged in the manufacture of paper. Associated with the fact that they were working perhaps under more advantageous conditions than the manufacturers in Australia enjoy, the low tariff on paper enabled manufacturers overseas to undercut the Australian manufacturers. As we all know, this company applied to the Special Advisory Authority for some immediate consiueration of its case and, whilst the he has given partial assistance to this very progressive and active company. The policy of the Labour Party is for protection to Australian industry. That policy has borne fruit. On two occasions, one of thern after the depression that immediately following the Second World War. when Labour governments were in office, the policy of strong protection was implemented and, as a result, Australia changed from a purely primary producing nation into a nation with widespread manufacturing activities. This has been the result of the protectionist policy implemented by Labour governments and followed, to some extent, by some honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber. But at the present time we have a coalition government, made up of partial protectionists on the one hand and free traders on the other hand. I find it difficult to follow the views advanced by the honourable member for Wakefield, who is a member of the protectionist party that forms one side of the coalition, but who is really advocating free trade. We on this side believe in protection for Australian industry, and the company I have mentioned has shown justification for the protection that has been extended to it. Apparently there is a large group of members on the Government side who believe in protection for themselves on their farms, but not for the consumers of their goods. What would happen if a policy based on that kind of belief were implemented in South Australia, which is rapidly becoming a manufacturing State? What would happen there if the industrialists were to lose their markets and large numbers of employees were to be thrown out of work? Where would be the market for the fat lambs raised on the honourable member's property? able member may be able to ask that question during another debate in this committee or in the House, but I remind him. that it has no relevance to the matter now before the committee. only in passing, Mr Chairman, and I shall-",55,Pairs

219,"Mr Drummond (New England) Taken The Place Of Wooden Cases, Has Been","I am one who profoundly believes, as the executive of the Australian Country Party has consistently urged, that an economic survey should be taken with a view to removing the imbalance between primary and secondary industries. I believe that the encouragement and protection of our secondary industries is of prime importance. I think that in such a survey the practices of certain overseas companies should be given very close scrutiny. I can recall the case of a certain company in England selling a product to a subsidiary company in Australia. That product was being sold chiefly to subsidiaries in Australia which is the best market for our primary and elsewhere that were producing exactly the same product, which was vitally necessary to a very important primary industry. In such circumstances you get to this position: Because the product is sold to our industry at a rate that is too high, that industry has to go to the Tariff Board to seek higher protection against the very product of the company that is making the rake-off overseas. The practice may not be widespread, but people with a knowledge of business have a shrewd suspicion as I do that it has been somewhat overworked. It is high time there was a searching probe into it. I believe that fair play is bonny play. The practice to which I have referred is not fair to the Australian consumer or the Australian manufacturer; nor is it the type of practice that should be permitted to continue. I hope I have made the point that a paper industry wholly financed by Australian capital is a most important asset to this country. I do not agree with the conclusions arrived at by the honourable member for Wakefield, but I must applaud the spirit that prompted his approach to this subject. I have been very interested in this debate. clearly adopted that argument. He has The expressed intention of the honourable shown that he is willing to grab at anything member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) to make in a report that will support his case for a so many speeches on these tarifl proposals reduction of tariffs. I do not propose to made me think of the days when people say anything about the Special Advisory wanted to flood the Australian market with Authority increasing a tariff to £9, then £20 cheaply produced overseas goods without and finally £30 or more, but I remind the any regard to the effect that those goods honourable member that the Government of would have on this country's industries. which he is a supporter does not believe in The honourable member referred to the import licensing. It believes in allowing tariff of 5s. a square foot on conveyor the Tariff Board to provide protection to belting. He told us what that would those industries that need protection. We amount to in the case of a large belt used in wheat silos at our seaports. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) attempted to point out to the honourable member for Wakefield that the tariff of 5s. a square foot was not high when one had regard to the amount of wheat that would be handled during the lifetime of any one conveyor belt. The honourable member for Wakefield seems bent on reducing the amount of protection afforded to Australian industries. Has the honourable member ever considered products? I ask the honourable member to consider the position of Australian storekeepers who sell eggs. The egg boards tell the storekeepers that they shall pay so much for the eggs they buy and that they may charge so much when selling them. The highest margin that the storekeeper may obtain is, I think, 7d. a dozen for handling the eggs. Is that not a trade practice? Is that not an action designed to prevent people from selling eggs at Whatever price they wish? Take the position of the poultry-farmer. The honourable member will agree that the farmer should sell his eggs to the egg board at a price fixed by the board, and that if the farmer sells his eggs elsewhere for less than the price fixed by the board, he should be penalized. Is that not a trade practice in the interests of the industry? Purchasers are compelled to pay the price fixed by the egg board. Yet when it comes to protecting an industry that gives employment to Australians and keeps money in this country, the honourable member says, "" Never mind that. Chop off the protection and let the £5,000 be sent overseas even though it will impair our trade balance "". The honourable member for Wakefield",57,Pairs

We have been told tnat citrus juices are being imported into Australia at a price which makes it impossible for Australian citrus-growers to compete. AllI can say is that honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot have tariff protection for primary producers and at the same time seek the removal of tariffs on imported rubber belting or paper, which protect the employment of workers in Australian industry. some meaning if the citrus-growers had tariff protection, but they do not. that matters. Is the honourable member for Wakefield prepared to speak out at his party meetings against the wrongful trade practices that have been mentioned here? Whenever suggestions are made that controls should be introduced the honourable member and his colleagues say that everything may be left to private enterprise. The Government claims that it is a private enterprise government and that it does not believe in interfering with the affairs of companies. The honourable member for Wakefield supports that view. I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Lalor .( Mr Pollard). The Australian Labour Party is a protectionist party. We believe that the Government has an obligation to see that industries for the protection of the paper industry in deal fairly and squarely with the people. We have heard that view expressed to-night by some honourable members opposite. I will not forget what they said. I will remind to establish a big pulp or paper-making them of their remarks whenever necessary. I am satisfied that they have expressed those views not with any idea of curbing the avarice of private enterprise but with the idea of reducing costs in this country. In my early political career, in the late 1920's, I read a booklet prepared by the late Mr James Scullin. He dealt with protection arjd referred to what was happening in Argentina with regard to harvesters. The Australian Government at that time had imposed a tariff in order to protect the harvester manufacturing industry in this country. The honourable member for Lalor will remember what happened. When the government of the day imposed that tariff, members sufch as the present honourable member for Wakefield protested against it. In those days we were endeavouring to afford some measure of protection to Australian industry. I have been prompted to take part in this discussion not just by my interest in the question of protection for the papermaking industry. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) has been quiet while this matter has been discussed. He knows what the Premier of South Australia is doing in endeavouring to have a big pulp mill established in that State. The honourable member knows very well of the pulp mills at Snuggery, near Millicent, in his electorate. He knows what was done and the protection that was needed. He knows of ths use that was made of the thinnings from the pinus forests in the south-east of South Australia in the making of paper pulp. The honourable member knows what is required in the paper industry in his electorate, but he has been quiet this evening because he is on the horns of a dilemma. I remind the honourable member that that matter is not before the committee at this stage. tection for ths paper-making industry, Mr Chairman. The honourable member for Barker knows very well what has been done South Australia. Establishing a paper mill is not like opening an electrical appliance shop or a small timber mill. If one wants plant, one needs a large amount of capital. Such an enterprise costs a lot of money. As I have said, the honourable member for Barker is in something of a dilemma this evening. He cannot stand up for protection for the paper manufacturers in the interests of the local production of paper without going against the honourable member for Wakefield.

He was told that the special procedure could be followed and that the matter could go to the Tariff Board within six months and then come to the Parliament for the Parliament to express its opinion, and that, if the Parliament contice. Trade practices enter into all these sidered that the additional protection given was unnecessary the matter could be taken up again. I for one want to make it clear that 1 stand for adequate protection for the industries of this country. I stand for the employment of our own people in paper mills and rubber mills, for example, in the production of the things that we need and can man, let me remind honourable members briefly of the £5,000 rubber conveyor belt that the honourable member for Wakefield mentioned earlier. duty on such an imported belt. the total cost of importing such a belt from the United States of America would be. A heavy freight charge would be incurred in bringing a belt from the United States or from any other country. Has the honourable member considered the wages that would be paid to the workers in this country engaged in the manufacture of such a belt and to those who transported it from the factory to the point of use? Has he considered whether the total of those amounts would be more than the £5,000 additional cost that he mentioned? I know that the honourable member for Wakefield considers that we in this country are inclined, through officialdom and our tariff authorities, to go to extremes in protecting Australian workers. However, I have found, Sir, that people in business in a small way who seek my help in obtaining protection find that they have a terribly bard job to convince the Tariff Board of the need for additional protection for small industries. SoI cannot accept the arguments that the honourable member for Wakefield based on various figures that he quoted, such as company considered the question of duty on imports of rubber tires, which are so much in demand for motor cars? He does not worry about how much the Australian manufacturers of tires make. Trade practices enter into the motor industry, also. One cannot buy an English Morris car or a United States car here without paying a price fixed by some trade practhings. cussing trade practices. the honourable member for Wakefield on trade practices will not hold water in the opinion of the people generally. As I have said, I am prepared to leave the question of raising duties to the Tariff Board. Let those who consider that they are hit by higher duties approach the board for reductions of duty. Chairman, I had not intended to speak on this matter, but I have been provoked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), who has reflected on my courage. Had he been in the chamber this afternoon, he would have heard me discussing other Tariff proposals. As he was not present, he probably was not aware that I had done so. The honourable member spoke about accepting the authority of the umpire-acceptin g the reports made by the Tariff Board and the Special Advisory Authority. I remind him that this afternoon he voted against the acceptance of proposals based on two recommendations made by the board. In other words, what the honourable gentleman says is that we ought to accept a recommendation for higher tariffs and that we should not accept a recommendation for lower tariffs. When I spoke earlier this afternoon on the subject of duty on polyvinyl chloride, I made a point that is applicable to the challenge that the honourable member has just thrown out to me. That point related to some of the possible dangers, not of protection, but of excessive protection. I pointed out that where, as in the manufacture of P.V.C, only one firm waa",59,Pairs

It is true that certain developments are proposed. operates a paper pulp plant in my electorate which is relatively minor compared with the establishments of other companies making paper pulp. The company in my electorate, I am very glad to say, has been able to hold its own. It looks as though another company will be able to establish a large-scale paper pulp industry in the south-east of South Australia, and we all hope that this will be done successfully. The situation in this industry is very similar to that in respect of the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride. Experts tell us that when the company that I have mentioned, with overseas backing, establishes itself in the paper pulp industry in the south-east of South Australia, there will be an enormous amount of excess capacity in the demand for paper pulp on the Australian market. Even if the Australian manufacturers of the committee to consider the motion as paper pulp command 100 per cent, of the a whole?

He recommended a 10 per cent, increase in the duty making it 65 per cent, on smaller or cheaper by overseas competitors. 1 find it very hard engines and 52i per cent, on larger engines. Then the Special Advisory Authority came into the picture because it was felt that the seven companies engaged in the manufacture of these engines were not receiving all the protection that they should power. I have listened attentively to the have been receiving. He recommended that the duty be increased to 77i per cent, on some engines and a good deal more than that on Clinton engines in relation to which the rate has risen from 42i per cent, to 85 per cent, within eighteen months. On the American Briggs and Stratton2 horsepower engines the duty works out at 93 per cent, and on the 4 horse-power engines, at 73 per cent. The main reason given to justify these high duties was that there was not sufficient output to carry the high overin the world. head cost of the machinery which is needed to produce engines efficiently. As I have said, seven companies were engaged in the manufacture of these engines. But since the higher duties have been imposed the number of factories producing these engines has increased from seven to nine, so there will be even less output per factory would have experienced far greater difficulnow to carry the high overhead cost of manufacture. Costs have risen, so fewer engines will be sold and, in turn, there will be still less output to carry the high overhead cost of manufacture. This is the position which arises from the introduction of this foolish kind of panic legislation. To me, these engines are tools of trade. I now have six engines on my farm, although I did have eight. One of my engines drives a lawn mower and the other five also work for their living. One of the engines is on the fire plant. I suppose I could use a wet bag. Another engine is on the windrower, but I suppose I could use a scythe. AndI suppose I could go back to turning the winnower by hand. I have an engine which drives the spray cart, but I suppose I could use a hand pump. I suppose that I could manage without engines as my father did, but I have been urged to be an efficient producer. 1 have been told to produce to the maximum at the lowest possible price. That is all very well. But when I go to buy the essential tools of trade to enable me to do this I am annoyed to find that they are 93 per cent, dearer than those produced to reconcile these two points of view. now discussing item 27 which relates to the manufacture in Australia of four-cycle interna] combustion engines of small horsecase submitted by the honourable member for Wakefield against increased tariff protection for this kind of engine. I grew up in the industry associated with the manufacture of internal combustion engines and, going back even 40 years, it has been one of my proud boasts that I have always forthrightly defended and supported the capacity of Australian manufacturers to make internal combustion engines which are as efficient as those manufactured anywhere The industry never could have developed in Australia if it had not received tariff protection. When we were absolutely dependent upon the capacity of Australian manufacturers to provide internal combustion engines for farms and industries, we ties than we did in fact experience, particularly in the critical wartime period from 1939 to 1945, if the Australian Labour Party in the 1930's had not accorded this industry tariff protection. The honourable member for Wakefield mentioned the cost of these products. The honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin) will confirm that in Ballarat is manufactured an effective and efficient internal combustion engine within the power range of one and a half and three and a half horsepower. There is made a prime mover of quality, not second to anything anywhere in the world. The manufacture of such an engine has been made possible only by tariff protection. If you say that Ronaldson Brothers and Tippett Limited of Ballarat or James N. Kirby Automotive Proprietary Limited of Sydney or Villiers Australia Proprietary Limited, an overseas company which has come to Ballarat to manufacture internal combustion engines behind the tariff wall, are inefficient, or that they are profiteers, or that they are acting in combination",61,Pairs

Those men and women consume Australian primary products and it is up to this Parliament to see that these secondary industries are encouraged and protected against the adverse competition of cheap labour countries. In ths absence of a protective wall in Australia those countries would exploit our people to a much greater degree than it is alleged Australian manufacturers now exploit thera. If ever there was a period in Australian history when it behoved this Parliament to give protection to local manufacturers for all secondary products it is now. If ever there was a period in our history in which it was essential for a responsible government to put into operation protective machinery for manufacturers it is now. If ever there was a period when we should drain off excess pronts from Australian manufacturers it is now. If the Government doss not do those things it is no reason why the Opposition should deprive the Australian manufacturer of the wherewithal to expand who are interjecting like to divert attention his industry and supply our need. It is the responsibility of the Government the primary producer. In the past the to do those things which the honourable British Navy has protected us and the member for Wakefield, on behalf of the United Kingdom has taken all our surplus primary producers of this country, says products.

As a primary producer, I realize thaf we need tp have secondary industries in Australia. We need to have a lot of them. But we want efficient secondary industries. Australian industries, particularly those which are not subsidized, have had to build up their markets against world competition. In order to do so it has been necessary for them to work more than 40 hours a week. It has been necessary to use all sorts of means to' meet advancing competition. I think we have to be grateful to the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) for stressing this fact to-day. I think the honourable member forWakefield believes that it is very easy for honourable members opposite to support a 35-hour week, increased wages and pther improved working conditions and then take it out of the primary producer with, increased tariffs.

But he said that the history of restrictive trade practices legislation in the rest of the world yet, the Americans can afford to put in was not very satisfactory. The honourable member for Lalor had his own ideas about the right approach to restrictive trade practices. So honourable members opposite have two different opinions which is not unusual for them. We are not dealing with restrictive trade practices but with tariffs. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr tection, especially when I know that they Drury) -Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the item before the committee. The matter under discussion concerns temporary duties on four-cycle air-cooled petrol engines with horizontal driving shafts. porary Chairman, I think I have finished. Temporary Chairman, I must support in this case the honourable member for Lalor{ Mr Pollard) because I am certainly convinced that the internal combustion engine industry is efficient. The honourable member for Lalor suggested that few honourable members would know anything about internal combustion engines and that few would know what a four-cycle engine was. I can assure the honourable member that I know something about internal combustion engines. I cannot understand the views of the honourable member for Wakefield ( MrI should say that this is a protection that Kelly) on this matter. If we are to increase the population of Australia we can increase it only by expanding our manufacturing industries. What we have to ensure is that we have efficient industries. Are our secondary industries efficient? I am convinced that here is an industry that is efficient and does not make large profits. Honourable members might ask what is the reason behind these very high tariffs, particularly when our competition is coming from a country that has a very high standard of living; but once they examine the industry, the problem is very easy to underParty over protection for our Australian stand. If they were to go through the American industries, as I had tbe good fortune to do, they would be able to understand why the Americans can put internal combustion engines on the Australian over 180,000,000 people compared with only 10,000,000 people, and with a very large export market, which we have not as very expensive machinery that our local manufacturers could not possibly afford. Because these huge machines make mass production possible, the Americans can export engines to Australia at a very low cost. Either we protect our manufacturers or we let them go to the wall. So far as I am concerned I will go all out to see that our local manufacturers get adequate proare operating efficient industries. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) mentioned something about a 10 per cent, tariff increase in April and, later on, a further increase. What happened last April was that when our local manufacturers got this 10 per cent, increase in their protection, the American manufacturers said, "" This is the end of season for us; we cent, discount to Australia"". That is exactly what happened. They gave a 9 per cent, discount. They will always be able to do that because we are down under in the southern hemisphere and our seasons are the opposite of the American seasons. American manufacturers will always be able to empty their end of season stocks into Australia at a very low cost and, if need be, below cost. Without prolonging the debate, I feel that was warranted. It is one industry that I was very close to while the Tariff Board inquiry was in progress, and it is one that I support. I feel that unless we continue to protect manufacturers such as the internal combustion engine manufacturers, we cannot develop Australia or increase our population as we want to increase it. tralian Labour Party supports high tariffs, but these discussions have produced further evidence of the widening gulf between the free trade Country Party and the Liberal industries.

The need to protect the internal combustion engine manufacturers is one of the reasons for the Labour Party's support of high tariffs. It is quite evident that some Coungreater degree and not a less degree of try Party members are parochial because they represent certain sections of rural industry, but these gentlemen have not the answer to the problem of finding employment for migrants. Can the primary industries provide jobs for our increasing population or for our migrant intake? Obviously they cannot. The Australian Labour Party will always support tariffs to prevent unfair the Government is right, and the Governcompetition from overseas. A while ago we heard the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Barnes) criticizing indirectly the 40-hour week. Why do he, his party and the Government not have the courage to get up at election time and say that they oppose the 40-hour week? It is all right for them, just after an great a dependence upon overseas trade. election, to come into this chamber and say that they oppose it, but just before an election they remain completely silent. The case put by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) proved beyond all doubt that this is an efficient industry. Therefore, the Australian Labour Party Opposition supports these tariff proposals for the protection of this industry and the protection of Australian workmen's jobs. Mr Temporary Chairman, in this matter I support the Government and, I am afraid, I must take issue with my friend the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). I feel that in his approach to these matters he has shown a certain pattern of thought, and it seems to me that he puts himself up as an opponent of protection, perhaps irrespective of the items that are coming forward. haps"". I think this is right; I think this shows an attitude of mihd which is both mistimed and misjudged. I say that it is mistimed because we need, at this present moment, more and not less effective protection. This can be shown by looking at out tradefijpur.esand by realizing that this year, on current. account, we will have a deficit of the order of £300,000,000. This is to prevent overseas interests from coming a trend that cannot be allowed to continue. It may well be-m y friend, the honourable member for Wakefield, might agree with this-that this will be partly offset by a change in the exchange' rate, but if this were not to be done then we would need a effective protection.

In this dfebate the honorabie member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) spoke about stationary engines which, of course, are used by primary producers. To my mind the honourable member for Wakefield has put the case that the tariff on stationary engines may put the price up to a level that will be detrimental to the primary producer: On the other side we have the case put by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope), that the Labour Party is always in favour of protecting industries and is in favour of high tariffs",64,Pairs

We have the two things together and there must be a fine dividing line between them. Surely no one in this chamber would suggest that tariffs on machinery such as stationary engines should be so high that they would make the economic outlook of the primary producer more difficult! Surely everybody realizes that primary production is the basis of Australia's stability! The irony of the situation lies in the fact that secondary industry has priced itself out of world markets and has made prices in Australia very high. That is proved by the fact that only 20 per cent, of our exports come from secondary industry and SO per cent, from primary industry. Secondary industry in Australia cannot operate inside its own price structure, and expects primary industry to pay for everything it needs to, manufacture its products on this high priced secondary industry market. Yet primary industry supplies 80 per .cent, of our exports, which are sold overseas in countries which have lower standards of living and lower prices than ours. That state of affairs just cannot continue, Mr other manufacturers mentioned. As the Temporary Chairman, if the price of stationary engines and things of that nature are so high as to be prohibitive to primary producers. Both the Opposition and the Government, including members of the Country Party, should know that most of our secondary industries cannot continue to operate satisfactorily unless we have healthy overseas balances with which to buy raw materials that are necessary to them. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the tariff item before the committee. We are dealing with import duties on four-cycle air-cooled petrol engines with horizontal driving shafts. ary Chairman, although, of course, there are some differences. If the price of these engines in Australia is forced too high by means of tariffs, the effect will be detrimental to our economy. If the Special Advisory Authority or Tariff Board has looked into the matter carefully and is quite sure-as the member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin), who represents the primary producers too, said-that these engines are not priced so highly as to interfere with the F.8556/62 -R -[49 ] economy of our primary industries, which is one of the main sources of our national wealth, I will be satisfied. Mr Temporary Chairman, you have been quite right in pulling up some honourable members for wandering off the subject. Although reference has been made to the use of four-cycle engines on farms they are not necessarily farm engines. between a four-cycle engine and a twocycle engine? members who have spoken to-night, have a couple of engines on my farm. The report from the Special Advisory Authority which dealt With this subject shows that the authority handled the evidence on its merits. In that report we find James N. Kirby Automotive Proprietary Limited, Ronaldson Brothers and Tippett Limited, Villiers Australia Proprietary Limited and member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin) explained, the production of these engines has been seriously reduced, as the result of competition by engines manufactured overseas. The report of the Special Advisory Authority statesThe Australian industry based its case for increased assistance mainly on a decline in its production, sales and employment caused by competition from imports. Further on it statesImports of engines (including engines with vertical shafts) in at least one recorded horse-power range are rising steeply. The evidence on which the Special Advisory Authority based his findings is mentioned and he worked out from the figures he had, but which are not before us, the degree of protection necessary. In its evidence the Kirby company pointed out that, in addition to the fact that its production was momentarily down, it had not received any firm orders for the supply of vertical shaft engines from lawn mower manufacturers for the coming lawn mower production season. At that time the position was really serious. Now that the lawn mowing season is in full swing the papers are full of large advertisements",65,Pairs

In the last two weeks I have noticed a very good choice of makes and models of lawn mowers advertised. With one exception, in an advertisement by a chain store which is not deeply interested in supporting Australian industry, all the lawn mowers advertised had Australian engines.

I find it somewhat difficult to stomach. honourable member for Perth( Mr ducer uses. He is making, in many cases, Chaney) and think that this decision is as poisonous as the product it deals with. Whatever one may say about the general level of protection for Australian industry, what justification can there be for protection whicli may mean high prices for products that are used virtually exclusively by primary industry? The only point on which I agree with the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) is that you cannot relate the question of stationary engines solely to primary industry, but must take into account the fact that they are used for many other purposes. That is not so in the case of insecticides and weedicides, unless we include among the users people who have these products to kill flies in their homes or pests in their gardens. These products are used principally in primary industry. Protection for any article means higher costs for the primary sector of our economy. I am not a free trader nor, I believe, are most primary producers. Protection at reasonable levels for economic and efficient industries is necessary in order to achieve the objectives which are shared by both farmers and other sections of the community. In this respect the farmers accept economic disadvantages for the sake of other and non-economic advantages-for example, the building up of population, full employment and so on. But one thing that the farmers do expect is that the policy will be administered successfully and with a sense of proportion, and with the knowledge that the primary industries are placed at a disadvantage. What happens when we apply these criteria to the decisions on insecticides and weedicides? On the one side you have the primary producer, the principal user of those products. He is is particularly so in the case of those who are competing on world markets. They are struggling in the face of higher costs and lower prices to compete with people outside this country. Such a man has to use insecticides and weedicides, at worse, if he wishes to have an income at all, and at best if he wishes his produce to be of the best quality-insecticide s and weedicides, which are expensive by any standards, even if obtained from the world's cheapest sources. Insecticides and weedicides are commodities which only the primary proa return on capital of 2 per cent, or less but, unlike the manufacturers of the weedicides and insecticides, he cannot use the argument of an inadequate return on capital as a basis for preferential treatment in the form of protection. That is the primary producer's side of the picture. Let us look at the other side -that of the producers of the insecticides and weedicides to whom, as a result of these duties, we are providing very high protection indeed. They are giant chemical firms with international connexions like I.C.I, and Monsanto, and the manufacture of insecticides and weedicides represents only a small proportion of their vast operations. The number of people directly they employ in producing insecticides and weedicides is small. The Special Advisory Authority accepts their arguments that the",66,Pairs

Neither the Tariff Board nor the Special prices. That is my plea to the Government in this case, and there is a precedent for such action. The Government took that action-and rightly so-in relation to nitrocame in. Obviously imports were not the genous fertilizers, a similar product which is used almost exclusively by the primary industries and which enters so largely into their costs of production. The Government decided that it was necessary to have an Australian industry producing nitrogenous fertilizers and, instead of imposing the very high duty which would have been necessary to protect the local industry if that course of action had been chosen, it gave the industry the protection of a bounty, and the price immediately went down. I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to have another look at this matter and see whether the protection cannot be provided by the same means. much appreciate the intervention in this debate also by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes). Everything that he has had to say has been, as usual, valuable and carefully thought out. I do appreciate his support. Of all these examples of unnecessary and unwarranted increases of duty, this is perhaps the worse-and that is saying a good deal. Let us consider, first, the weedicide 2,4-D. This is a product that is commonly used on my farm and on farms throughout Australia. It is manufactured by the group of companies which include Monsanto Chemicals (Australia) Limited, Union Carbide Australia Limited, and Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited. Sir Frank Meere, the Special Advisory Authority, does not bother to tell us the extent of the imports. He just says that Australia produces over 91 per cent, of the demand. Obviously, therefore, excessive imports do not constitute the trouble. ever, consolidated group profit of £1,427,000 (after But, he said, the local manufacturers are not getting enough, and he has recommended increased duties specifically for the purpose of allowing them to increase their prices from 4s. 3d. to 5s. ld. He does not hide anything, he sets it out for all to see. So we do not have price-fixing in the downward direction, we have it in the upward direction. Now take the case of the insecticide, D.D.T. In 1959-60 Australia produced 84 per cent, of the demand, imports fell during the next year, although Sir Frank Meere does not tell us how much D.D.T. real trouble. The trouble was, of course, that the manufacturers were not able to charge enough for their products. That is what Sir Frank Meere says. But he has remedied the situation and has allowed them to raise their prices. He has imposed a duty which amounts in total to 124 per cent, if you include the dumping duty. If you take out the dumping duty it is 91 per cent. Sir Frank has allowed the manufacturers to increase the price from 3s. to 3s. 3d. per lb. The original rate of duty imposed, on both 2,4-D and D.D.T., increased spraying costs on my farm by £100 a year on my estimate. These emergency duties will further increase spraying costs by from £30 to £50. It is very hard to get an exact estimate because it is difficult to ascertain the f.o.b. price. In any case, it would appear to be a very considerable extra impost for me. This does not allow for the formulators' profit, which has been referred to. This is the extra cost which can be justified by the Special Authority's advice to the industry as to the margins by which prices can be increased. The burden of these additional duties will amount to between £30 and £50 annually according to the spraying programme that I follow on my own place. But I suppose it does not matter about me. I merely produce for the export market. I have no political friends. I am not supposed to worry about these extra burdens so long as the big companies are content. And they are content! Let me quote some statements that appeared in a half-yearly report of I.C.I. This is good readingThe downward pressure on selling prices continued during the six months to March 31. Howincreased provision for taxation and depreciation) showed an overall improvement of almost 8 per cent. The result has been aided by further efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs of operation and I emphasize thisby the granting of emergency tariff protection for some of the group's more important products . . . Should profits earned in the second half of the current nnanciai year continue at the same rate as in the first, earnings rate on average capital employed would appear to be 10.8 per cent, per annum.",67,Pairs
254,Mr Kelly (Wakefield) [10.30],"I verySoI can take some comfort from this. ThoughI may feel depressed at the fact that my spraying costs have increased by from £30 to £50 a year, at least I.C.I, is happy. Since the report of the Special Advisory Authority was received, a full Tariff Board report dealing with chlorine products and weedicides has been presented. This report recommended increases of the original duties on most of these weedicides and pesticides. It recommended duties higher than those that were in operation before the board commenced its inquiry, but of course the duties recommended were not nearly as high as those suggested by the special authority. In fact the board recommended a duty of 40 per cent, on D.D.T., whereas the special authority's contribution to the problem was a recommended duty of 90 per cent, to 100 per cent. However, the Minister, after sitting on the board's report for two months-and if the duties are to go down there is always a long incubation period-di d not accept the Tariff Board's recommendation, and has left in operation the high duties recommended by the Special Advisory Authority. His reason for doing so is that the Tariff Board stated that, just as its report was being prepared, new evidence was presented by Union Carbide and Monsanto. We do not know what this new evidence is, because we are not told. All we know is that the additional burden which primary producers were asked by the special authority to bear is to continue in operation, in the face of the report by the Tariff Board. The matter has now gone back to the Special Advisory Authority and must again go back to the full board. It is interesting to compare the difference my cost of production, so that I can meet in the approaches of the Tariff Board and world competition. They then go on to the Special Advisory Authority. The comurge me to produce goods of better quality. ments in the two reports on paradichloroIt is wonderful to listen to, and it is also benzene, which I shall call P.D.C.B. for pretty to watch.

Standards seem to benzenes, the board is of the opinion that ad valorem rates of 25 per cent. British preferential have slipped somewhat. After the ceremony tariff, and 32i per cent, most favoured nation has finished, the official party has left the (the existing rates for P.D.C.B.), would provide a arena and the desultory applause has limped reasonable degree of assistance to Union Carbide to a lame conclusion, I am left to wonder in its production of P.D.C.B. The board proposes to recommend accordingly. However, the approach of the Special Advisory Authority was quite different, and I think the committee should look closely at this because it is most interesting. The authority saidThe industry's current list price of £197 10s. per ton is not competitive with the current dutypaid landed costs of the imported material and does not cover local manufacturers' total production costs. If the requested temporary duty of 3d. per lb. is granted, the industry proposed to advance its price to £215 per ton. Well, as I said before, you must pay a tribute to the Special Advisory Authority for frankness in these matters. The Government seems to have a grim determination to protect large companies at the price of grievously increased costs to farmers who have to sell on the export market. Let me put it again on a personal basis. Honourable members have been taunting me with the accusation that I have approached this matter from a narrow, parochial viewpoint. Well, I accept the criticism. The previous protection granted increased my spraying costs by £100 a year. This additional duty will put them up further by £30 to £50 a year. In other words, when I come to sell my wool overseas in competition with other countries that are not cursed with a local uneconomic chemical industry, I meet my competitors on £150 worse terms. And, by the way, the engine that I use to drive my spray plant will cost me more, because I will have to pay 93 per cent, duty on it. This does not improve my temper, either. As a matter of fact, my temper has not improved at all during these spring months, despite what the poets may suggest. At this time of the year Ministers of all shapes and sizes, when opening the spring shows, exhort me, with magnificence eloquence, to reduce stomachs when speaking, as if to emphasise their earnestness. I know that in times gone how I am to reduce my costs of production and improve the quality of my produce if the price of so many things that I buy is so much higher than my overseas competitors have to pay. If this kind of thing continues the Government must face the grim alternative of having to subsidize wool-growing. If this is the Government's intention it should start to put some money into kitty, because the sums required will not be paltry. It will cost over £8,000,000 to subsidize the Australian clip by ld. per lb. I repeat that if increased costs are to be lucky we are to have this industry in loaded on to our shoulders in this way Australia. there can be no alternative but to introduce a subsidy. The Government should realize that. If it is necessary to afford protection Authority has said that although the to the local chemical industry, surely that manufacturers raised their prices as a protection should be afforded by way of a result of his previous report, the prices bounty which is paid by the taxpayer incharged by the formulators went up by stead of by way of a tariff which is paid by more than was justified. That may well the exporter. I regret to have to make this speech in banner for the merchants, but it seems to serial form but reports come in continually. be a queer solution to this practice to Since preparing the remarks that I have increase the duty on 2,4,5-T by ls. 3d. just made. I have received two reports of per lb. so as to enable Union Carbide to the Special Advisory Authority. One of increase its price also, so that the same those reports confirms the emergency duties thing may happen again. that he imposed earlier. That had to be done following the Minister's refusal to implement the lower duties recommended formulators, but perhaps they feel that they by the Tariff Board on 28th June. The have as much right to a reasonable margin second report of the Special Advisory of profit and a fair return on capital as Authority recommends increasing to 40 per I.C.I, and Union Carbide. Or is the fact cent, the duty on 2,4,5-T, which is another that they are not giant companies sufficient weedicide. Evidently this industry was to preclude them from participating in overlooked in the previous mad scramble. his bounty? So here we have protection of an uneconomic industry in the face of a considered opinion by the Tariff Board. In his last edition the Special Advisory Authority saidAn increase in duties on insecticides and weedicides must unfortunately result in increased costs for Australia's important primary industries. That is a moving passage. The authority continuesI believe howe.ver that it is in the primary procontrol hoary cress, skeleton weed, St. ducers' interest to have these products manufactured in this country. The fact that the recent unexpected heavy demand for weedicides was successfully met by the Australian manufacturer supports this conclusion. The Special Advisory Authority does not argue the case. He blandly remarks that we farmers are lucky to have the industry in Australia just because we have been able to get increased supplies when we wanted them. That seems to be a silly statement. You could think of many reasons to justify this Australian industry, but surely no one would try to use this argument even in extremity. After all, the evidence is that there are many manufacturers in other countries who are only too willing to supply what we want at much lower prices than we have been forced to pay. I would like the Special Advisory Authority to face a meeting of farmers and tell us how In these last reports the Special Advisory be so, and I do not excuse it. I carry no As I have said, I do not defend the proposals now before the committee refer to weedicides and insecticides. Anybody who knows anything about rural problems knows that during the last decade there have been marked advances in the control of noxious weeds and pests. To-day we have counters to tbe cockchafer beetle and to the red-legged earth mite, to name just two insects. We have products that will John's wort and Californian thistle.

You would not know one end of a beetle from another or one weed from another. The honourable member for Wakefield is not the only primary producer who must bear the burden of additional costs imposed by tariffs on weedicides and insecticides. I, too, have an annual bill for those products, but I am not unmindful of the fact that Monsanto, l.C.I. and other industrial concerns have establishments in my electorate. I am not unaware that the employees of those organizations residing within the industrial area that I represent provide a certain market for the primary products that I produce. If those industrial concerns exploit me and make excess pronts, the Government has ample power to draw off those excess profits by taxes. This Parliament, if it has not already the power to deal with restrictive trade practices which may be engaged in by a combination between Monsanto Chemicals (Australia) Limited and Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited and any other manufacturer, should have the power to determine whether such manufacturers shall continue to charge excessive prices for their products. The way to attack these problems is by exercisin Australia and ing such powers, not by adopting the method suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield, which, in effect, would deprive these manufacturers of the protection that enables them to produce the products that we require.

268,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [10.58],"has a comparatively high proportion of primary industry, and this will be the situation some certainty about the competition it will for many years to come. Accordingly, we should enable efficient manufacturing concerns to be built up for the production of insecticides and weedicides. My reading of the report on this subject made by the Tariff Board suggests that Australia's baselocal market with wholehearted confidence. chemicals industry is on the way to becoming efficient in the production of these chemicals. The demand for them is increasing all the time and I see no reason why we cannot build up an efficient locallybased industry in this field of manufacture. We have heard all the classical arguments suggesting that we ought to protect Australian manufacturing industry. It is true that at this stage in our history we need to diversify our industry and thereby provide greater opportunities for employment. As other honourable members have stated, there is opportunity to discuss the different kinds of protection which might be given. I have some qualms about affording protection by raising tariffs. Bounties have been suggested as an alternative. At least bounties have the virtue of spreading the cost burden. It is not borne only by the primary producers. I suggest another alternative quantitative restrictions. 1 notice that the first application by local manufacturers restrictions. My first argument in relation to tariffs is that they increase costs. There is no doubt about that. The other argument is that, having increased costs, there is no guarantee that they will afford protection to the local manufacturing industry. If tariffs were increased to whatever levels we prescribed, there still would be no guarantee, especially when there was a state of over-supply in world markets, that goods from overseas would not enter this country. In my view, if we want to afford protection the much more efficient and decisive way to do this would be to establish import quotas. If we do not want any foreign goods to enter the country, we should say so. If we want a certain percentage of foreign goods to enter the country, we should say so. By imposing tariffs we increase costs without giving any certainty of protection to local manufacturing industry, whereas with import quotas or some form of import control local industry has have to endure from foreign-produced goods. Tariff protection does not help an industry to make a decisive judgment about the kind of competition it will have to meet, so it does not go into production to supply the We should consider some form of protection other than the patchwork arrangement represented by the temporary and variable tariffs recommended by the Special Advisory Authority. I return to my point that Australia, by virtue of its size and its relationship to the other land masses of the world, will continue for many years to rely very heavily on primary industry. Being so reliant on primary industry, there will be not only a sizeable but also, I suggest, a constantly increasing market for weedicides and insecticides to protect our primary industries. The classical argument in favour of any kind of protection is that not only will it provide employment and not only will it diversify our productive effort and our economy, but also it will help to conserve our overseas balances. This industry could well make a contribution in that regard. I am in favour of protection but I am not was for quantitative sure that temporary variable tariffs are the best way of affording it. -The point made by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), which was supported by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), should receive more attention from the committee. They suggested that a bounty might be a more acceptable way, in the long term, of doing something in relation to this problem. In the short term, I am certain that the Government has taken the correct action, although over the long term a bounty may be the more appropriate way of affording protection. When the balance of payments position settles down a little more it may be possible to give these individual items closer scrutiny. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) shares my view on this. This is not the time to take finicking little points, but I suggest to the Government that we need better machinery to deal with these matters.",73,Pairs
269,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [11.4].,"The honourable member for Wakefield has shown a great zeal and mastery of detail, but even he has not access to the full facts. Some time ago the honourable member for Barker suggested to the Government a select committee should be set up to look into these matters. Unfortunately, this proposal was not acceptable to the Government. When matters of this character are coming before the Parliament, I suggest that an officer of the department be made available to honourable members of both sides of the chamber so that they may ask him questions and receive appropriate answers on questions of fact. 1 would not expect such an officer to express opinions on policy, but honourable members are entitled to the truth when questions of fact arise. in the criticism by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) of the attitude of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr this Parliament. Why should my electors Kelly) on these matters. The Parliament should not overlook the fact that although the honourable member for Wakefield criticizes the Government's policy of protection, that criticism is never backed up by his vote. If he sincerely wants to substantiate the charges he has made in relation to the increase in his own costs of production, he should vote against the Government when the opportunity offers. Only one vote is needed to turn out the Government which, according to the honourable member for Wakefield and others, is not fit to govern this country. He complained that the proposed protection would increase his own costs by £100 or £150 a year, and he stated that this would apply to all primary producers. He then said that this was unjust and an imposition on the primary producers. He will take all the protection which membership of the Liberal Party gives him in this place and in his electorate but, after critidoes not care what happens as long as cizing the proposal, will not have the courage to vote against it. I am sick of being kept up half the night by his sham fight. As knowledgeable as he is on these matters, he is only a sham fighter. If he criticizes these proposals and wants to oppose them, he should join the Opposition when the opportunity offers and vote against the Government which, he states, imposes these burdens on the primary producers he is supposed to represent. Even his own colleagues differ from him. I do not think he is a hero. If his electors are being treated unjustly, he should vote according to his feelings, not according to what he thinks will help him in the Parliament. I hope that he will not keep us here for the rest of the night by putting up this sham fight and making himself a hero in this place, but not giving effect, by his vote, to what he feels will help thousands of others who, he says, will be compelled to bear an additional burden of £100 or £150 a year. A few other members of the Liberal and Country Parties should do the same thing. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) advocated a bounty instead of a tariff for the very good reason that he wants to make the people in my constituency contribute to higher profits for the primary producers he misrepresents in and others be called upon to pay a bounty so th%t the wealthy interests which support him will make more money at the expense of the consumers? Members of the Country Party want flood relief for six months and drought relief for the next six months. In addition, they want the people to pay bounties to the primary producers. They want socialism when things are bad and capitalism when things are good. They cannot have it both ways. The fact of the matter is that industries are entitled to protection. The industry under consideration is giving benefits to the primary producers and, therefore, is entitled to protection. I have heard criticism by members of the Australian Country Party in discussions on the issue of the Japanese Trade Agreement. The honourable member for McPherson( Mr Barnes) said that we were at war with Russia yet to-day he is sponsoring the sale of Australian wool to that country. He the people whom he represents get a greater return. that the honourable member come back to the matter before the committee.

272,Mr Daly,"Very well, Mr Chairman.I agree that this industry and others are entitled to protection and I say that the Government is denying protection to industries, particularly to those which have a beneficial effect on primary industry as this one has. This policy nearly cost the Government the last general election. It will not be able to repeat that performance too often. These measures have been introduced only because the Government became frightened of the Australian electors. The Government put countless thousands of Australian people out of work because of its failure to protect industries such as this. responsibility to protect Australian industry These tariff proposals have been introduced, not because any member of the Government believes in them, but because the Government is fearful of the political consequences. This is a death-bed repentance in a roundabout way on the part of the Government to save itself. I have no desire to delay these proceedings, but I cannot sit idly by and see a member, who is as silent as the grave in the caucus room, indict his Government in this chamber while refusing to vote with the Opposition when the opportunity offers.

The fact that wheat-growers for the simple reason some people have to pay a little more is the price we pay for employment for Australians in preference to Japanese and other people in cheap labour countries. The present conditions in industry exist because the Labour Government was prepared to protect Australian industries in the 1930's. Members of the Government parties have sought to destroy that protection. They are now condemned for it by the Australian people.

280,Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) [11.1],"Asubject because of the uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation and high cost of living in ZoneA and, to a lesser extent, in Zone B, in comparison with parts of Australia not included in the prescribed area . . . To comply with that section we must therefore recognize the disadvantages to which people in a prescribed area are subject, as compared to the conditions for people living outside the prescribed area, and the disadvantages we must look for to establish the prescribed area are those uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation and the high cost of living. There is no doubt in my mind, and no doubt in the minds of a large number of people in Western Australia, that in that State the present area outside the zones extends too far into areas where the lesser disadvantages of zone B are quite apparent and, also, that zone B extends too far into the area where the greater disadvantages of zone A really apply. Or, to put it more simply, the present southern boundary of zone A should be still further south, and the southern and western boundaries of the existing zone B should be still further south and west. I suggest to the Treasurer that it would be more in keeping with the intention of section 79A if he altered the boundary for zone A by commencing at the west coast at latitude 27°, continuing to longitude 117°, proceeding thence to the junction of 117° longitude and 28° latitude, thence in a direct line to the junction of latitude 30° and longitude 121°, thence to the junction of latitude 30° and longitude 123°, and from there taking a direct line to the south coast. I suggest that zone B should be altered to take in all that area between zone A and a boundary commencing on the west coast at latitude 29°, proceeding east to longitude 116° from theTe following a direct line to that part of the existing boundary situated approximately half-way between Lake King and the rabbit-proof fence, and then along the existing boundary to the south coast. I appreciate that no matter where the zone boundaries are drawn there will be some taxpayers who are just slightly outside the prescribed areas and some just inside those areas, but I suggest that because of that inevitability it would be better for the schedules to regard areas which may be on the border line as warranting inclusion, rather than to exclude areas which really do warrant inclusion. In other words, I suggest that in a matter such as this it is much better to be a little more generous than to be extremely mean. For instance, if climatic conditions, isolation and cost of living are properly considered, it would mean that the towns of Wiluna, Sandstone, Laverton, Agnew, Cue and Meekatharra and several other gold-field and pastoral areas and places along the trans-continental line should be moved into zone A rather than be part of zone B. Incidentally, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that when these zone concessions were placed in the act the towns of Wiluna, Sandstone and Laverton had a railway service, but for the last few years there has been no railway service and the people in those places are relying on one plane service a fortnight. So it is easily seen that the isolation qualification certainly applies, and if anybody goes into those areas he will certainly agree with me that the climatic conditions are very uncongenial and that the cost of living is extremely high. The same position applies, but to a lesser extent, as provided by section 79A, in regard to areas which should be included in zone B but are now left in the noconcession area. The whole district of Geraldton, for instance, is excluded from zone B, although Geraldton is accepted as being a very high cost town. Also, it is locally accepted that it has many disadvantages compared with the metropolitan area and other areas farther south. Even though Geraldton is excluded from zone B we find a peculiar position arising because part of an adjoining districtthe Upper Chapman district-whic h is very close to the town of Geraldton and very close to the south coast is included in zone B, whereas parts of the Geraldton district, ten times farther east and several times farther north, are excluded from that zone. That state of affairs is due largely to the fact that the present boundaries follow the boundaries of several road board or shire council districts, and these boundaries do not go in a straight line from, say, the south-west corner of the district to the north-west, but wave about all over the place. That is the reason for the anomalous position now applying. boundaries were altered? in 1945. Referring to Western Australia, the second schedule-the zone B schedule -states . . . inence by that coastline westerly to the south-western corner of the Road District of Failes, L. J. Phillips River in the State of Western Australia thence generally north westerly by the boundaries Falkinder, C. W. J. dividing the Road Districts of Gnowangerup Kent Lake Grace Kulin Kondinin Narembecn Merredin and Nungarin. . . I will not read any more of that, but it is easy to see that it would be very difficult for anybody to determine where zone boundaries run just by reading the schedule, or even by referring to an ordinary map of Australia. You must go to the road district maps, and those maps do not refer to towns, so you have a most difficult task. The Taxation Branch does not rely on maps. The taxation officers have a list of towns at which they look when a man puts in his taxation return. They check to see whether a particular town is inside or outside the zone. Looking at a map, one would have no idea of the position. For these reasons I have suggested that the boundaries, rather than slavishly follow road district boundaries, should as closely as possible be related to parallels of latitude or meridians of longitude, as the case may be. I realize that that may not be completely possible, but I say that if it were done as nearly as possible it would make the position much clearer. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

285,Mr Hasluck,"The answers to the honorare used for the manufacture of steel?honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Australia is not yet exporting iron ore in commercial quantities to Japan. To date, only sample shipments have been sent. Australia does export coal to Japan. In 1960-61, Australia exported 1,699,834 long tons of coal valued at £A.6,857,851 (f.o.b.) to Japan. Other major exporters of coal to Japan include the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Canada and America. In 1961, America was the largest supplier-providin g more than 50 per cent, of Japanese imports. 2. The coal is undoubtedly used for the manufacture of steel and for steam raising purposes. 3. Yes, Japan does sell steel to New Zealand in competition with the Australian product. In 1961, Japan's total exports of iron and steel amounted to 2,303,067 metric tons valued at £A. 171,018,000 (f.o.b.). Japan's exports of iron and steel to New Zealand in lhat year were 6,192 metric tons valued at £A.306,000 (f.o.b.). This can be compared with Australia's exports of iron and steel to New Zealand which were valued at £A.l 1,843,169 (f.o.b.) for the year 1960-61. Australia's figure represented an increase of slightly more than £A.2,5O0,0OO over our exports for 1957-58. 4. In the past month or two Japanese steel has been underselling the Australian product on the New Zealand market. This has been aided by a reduction in freight rates from Japan and the fact that the New Zealand Tariff has been reduced from free British Preferential Tariff 20 per cent. Most-Favoured-Nation to free British Preferential Tariff5 per cent. Most-Favoured-Nation. National Development. Mr CoUard asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, upon notice1.

If so, what work will constitute each stage, and what is the estimated cost of each stage? 3. What is the expected approximate date for completion of thc final stage? 4. How much of the cost of each stage will be borne by the Commonwealth? 5. If the developmeni is not to be carried out in four major stages, how will it be done, what will be the cost, and how much will be borne by the Commonwealth? National Development has supplied the following information:The Western Australia Grant (Northern Development) Act 1958-1959 provides for the payment of up to £5,000,000 as assistance towards the cost of approved developmental projects in that part of Western Australia lying to the north of the twentieth parallel of latitude, undertaken by the State during the five years commencing 1st July, 1958. In offering and administering the grant the Commonwealth has made it clear lhat prime responsibility for the development of the area continues to rest with the State. The selection, planning and execution of the projects assisted has been left to the State. Under the act the Commonwealth has contributed to June, 1962, £2,600,000 towards the cost of the Ord River Diversion Dam and the Main Channel from that dam. It is estimated that a further £1,400,000 will be contributed by the Commonwealth in respect of the two projects in 196263, completing the total grant of £5,000,000 available under the provisions of the act. The other matters raised in the honourable member's question relate to the technical details of the Ord River irrigation scheme proposal. This is a State matter. Some details of the proposal have been published by the State Department of Public Works but I suggest that the honourable member might approach the appropriate State authorities for whatever up-to-date information is available.

A select committee of the Legislative Council for Papua and New Guinea is currently considering the structure and composition of the Legislative Council, and related matters, and is expected to make its report about 15th October, 1962.

If so, are many timber mills which closed during the past two years because of that policy still closed? 3. WiU the Government take action to stimulate the timber industry so as to increase production and overcome unemployment? able member's questions are as follows:1. The native Australian timber industry has been depressed during the past two years, particularly in Queensland and Tasmania. 2. The umber industry is gradually recovering but some of the mills which closed during the past two years are still closed. 3. The Government is aware of the situation in the timber industry and has taken a number of measures designed to assist it. For instance, in bis Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that able member's question is as follows:(a) Section 114 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution provides, inter alia, that a State shall not without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth.

(b) Details of ex gratia payments in lieu of rates and service charges during each of tbe five years to 30th June, 1961, have been obtained from all departments and are summarized as follows:1936-37. 1937-38. 1958-59. 1959-60. 1960-61. £ £ £ £ £ 251,875 296,915 304,767 305,175 311,332 * 78,592 * 82,695 * 87,998 * 96,797 * 97,011 94,938 98,221 108,578 119,059 156,338 30,109 38,484 40,656 40,435 58,841 29,703 34,034 36,462 41,516 44,028 7,184 7,169 7,400 7,764 9,353 492,401 557,518 585,861 610,746 676,903 in 1962-63 the Commonwealth would provide, directly or indirectly, over £91,000,000 for housing which accounts for approximately 50 per cent, of total timber usage. The Government has also imposed temporary quantitative restrictions on imports of timber from July last on the recommendations of a special advisory authority following an application by the local industry for urgent protection against imports. The restrictions, which limit imports to the average level of those in 1960-61 and 1961-62, are of a holding nature pending a report of the Tariff Board which is currently inquiring into the local industry's long term protective needs.

A record is not maintained of the countries to which deportees are returned. With the exception of illegal entrants whose mode of travel to Australia is established, the country to which a deportee is sent is determined by the re-entry authority held by or obtained on behalf of that person. Consequently, deportees are as a matter of practice returned to their own countries or to the place of their immediately former domicile. In connection with illegal entrants (deserting seamen and stowaways) whose mode of travel to Australia is known, the carrier companies which brought them here are required by law to take them away. The department, in these cases, does not deport to a specific country but merely requires the responsible carrier company to remove the deportee from Australia. 4. During the fiscal year 1961-62 thirteen persons against whom deportation orders had been issued were subsequently permitted to remain in Australia. Statistics for previous years are not available. 5.

The time taken to place migrants in employment after their arrival in Australia depends on a number of factors: The nature of their occupational experience and qualifications; their preference as to the industry in which they wish to work, and where they wish to settle; their knowledge of English; their mobility and the current demand for labour. On the average, the lapse of time is a matter only of a few days. It is not possible to be more precise. 4. On arrival in Australia, migrants who are nominated by the Commonwealth go to either migrant accommodation centres or Commonwealth hostels whence employment is arranged.
