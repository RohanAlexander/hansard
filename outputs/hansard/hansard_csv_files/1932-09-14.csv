Section 28 of the Industrial Peace Act readsNo award or order of a special tribunal or local board shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus, or injunction in any court on any account whatever. In view of the fact that the coal-mining industry is governed by an award of the Coal Tribunal set up under this act, the provisions of which have been overridden by a State tribunal, does the Attorney-General intend to take 'appropriate action against the State Government ? If not, will he endeavour to avoid the threatened dispute by calling a compulsory conference of the parties concerned as provided for in the act? vised, I do not anticipate that there will be any general stoppage in the coal mining industry of Australia. The award of the Victorian State tribunal was made, I understand, pursuant to the provisions of an act recently passed by the Victorian Parliament after the federal award applicable to Wonthaggi had been set aside by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The act passed by the Victorian Parliament was supported by the honourable member for Wonthaggi in that Parliament. It has never been suggested, so far as I am aware, except by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), that any award made under the Industrial Peace Act is in any way inconsistent with the Victorian award. such an award it would almost certainly have expired, for no award has been made under the Industrial Peace Act since July; 1928. If there were such an award in force the matter would be one for decision by the appropriate tribunal, and not for a Minister of the Crown. that section 6 of the Constitution provides that there ""shall""-no t ""may""be a session of Parliament once in each the film known as "" The Five-Year year.

If so, is he a wars have not been passed by both Houses of Parliament before the end of the year? vernment is to end this session before the year closes. If that can be done, the difficulty contemplated by the honourable member will not arise. I sincerely hope that it will be possible for Parliament to complete all the business befcre it by the end of the year. Minister believe in the fixation and observance of the basic wage as laid down by the Federal Arbitration Court? If so, will he instruct the Attorney-General to intervene in the application now before the Federal Arbitration Court by the New South Wales Government for the setting aside of the federal basic wage of £3 13s. in the New South Wales railways and tramways, and the substitution of a wage of £3 10s.? vernment is not to interfere in any way with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. policy of the Government not to interfere with the Arbitration Court, will the Prime Minister operate the same policy in respect of the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator and prevent the decisions of that gentleman being nullified by the action of honourable members of another place? is now referring to a matter which has been specifically placed within the power If there ever were of this Parliament. In taking certain action respecting two determinations by the Public Service Arbitrator, Parliament was acting entirely within the law.

With regard to London debt due to the public, the only practicable way in which the matter can be approached is by the further improvement of Australia's credit so that we may secure reductions by exercising our optional rights of conversion over £96,000,000 of debt which now bears interest at rates from 5 per cent, to 6£ per cent., and by further conversions as opportunity arises.

Has his attention been drawn to the following statement of the President of the Electrical Association of New South Wales:"" It is unfortunate that there should be a large number of the old telephone receivers in stock, but if the post office had followed the usual commercial routine, the major portion of the capital cost of those instruments would have been written off within five-years from their initial installation . . . fair for the Post Office Department to put difficulties in the way of its introduction until the old instruments have all been reinstalled""? 7. If so, what action does he propose taking in regard to the whole question? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The ""Neophone"" is. not available in the American telephone service. It is a development of the British Post Office and Messrs. Siemens Brothers. Its advent does not demonstrate that the Australian telephone service is behind that of other countries. 2. The statement could hardly be accepted as ono of scientific accuracy, but the transmission qualities of the instrument are good and slightly better than the instruments which have hitherto been standard in telephone administrations. It w ill be recognized that the telephone instrument is not the only item affecting the transmission of clear speech. The satisfactory transmission of speech over very long distances in Australia compares most favourably with what has been accomplished elsewhere. This high quality of service is regularly being rendered on instruments which are not of the ""Neophone"" type. 3. The department's permission is of a tentative character, and may be withdrawn whenever that step appears to be desirable. The department may or may not wish to take over instruments which have been purchased privately. That question will be better left for negotiation and determination when the time arrives. 4. If the instrument is the property of the subscriber and is removed from the telephone service the department would have no wish to acquire it . 5. Such a statement has been noticed in the press. 6. Yes; but to write off the cost of a telephone in five years would impose a heavy burden on telephone subscribers, for it would cause an altogether unnecessary inflation of telephone tariffs. Tlie department's attitude will be governed entirely by what it believes to be in the best interests of telephone subscribers as a body, and the question of economics is obviously an important factor. The department has already shown that it does not wish to arrest progress, even in the direction of withholding permission for the installation of an instrument which, in certain circumstances, may be more conveniently used. Naturally, however, those who wish to acquire a more modern instrument must expect to contribute to the enhanced cost, for it would be unreasonable that the increased charges should be passed on to the very large number of users who w ill not find it essential to make such a change. 7.

Ii' experience should demonstrate that it would be wise to continue, after Mr principle of appointing a Besident MinBruce returns, to have a .Commonwealth Minister resident in London Prime Minister himself. man may rest assured that there is no possibility of that happening. Should experience prove that the Commonwealth would benefit by having a Resident Minister in London to perform these duties it ' will be necessary, after two years, again to amend the High Commissioner Act. Mr Bruce being now in London, and about to take up the duties of the office, it. is necessary to pass the bill without delay. I hope that honourable members will realize the desirability of having in London at the present time a Minister knowing the political and financial circumstances of Australia, and able to carry out the important and delicate duties which have to be undertaken. It will be agreed that Mr Bruce is at least as well qualified to perform the work of the High Commissioner's office as any gentleman who has preceded him as High Commissioner, and I am confident that the right honourable gentleman will render real service to Australia while representing the Commonwealth in London. bill is a much more important measure than although isiily new section to the High Commissioner Act 1909. If it merely provided for a temporary arrangement under which a Minister visiting London on a special mission would be empowered to carry out the duties of High Commissioner, there could be no real objection to tbe measure, and in suah circumstances I would not offer any. But it involves more than that. An announcement was made some time ago by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government that, in effect, a new policy was to be adopted; that we were to be governed partly from London; that we were to have a Besident Minister in .London; and that he would be the Bight Honourable S. M. Bruce. When this bill is passed, it will give the authority of this Parliament to theister abroad. That being so, one would, have expected the head of the Government, when introducing this startling; innovation so far as Australian politics are concerned, to put forward sound reasons to justify it. The Prime Minister said, in the first place, that there was some important work to bet done in London by the Minister whom it is proposed to appoint. I believe that there is important work to be done in. London. I take no objection to the presence in London of a Minister at the present time, and so long as importantduties remain to be done, such as the conversion of loans, I approve of a Minister from Australia being present in London. But is it contemplated that this work will take two years, or even one year to accomplish? The conversion of our loans overseas to a lower rate of interest is urgent. The Prime Minister,, when sitting in opposition, once declared publicly that, were he in power, his first act would be to go to London and arrange for the conversion of our overseas indebtedness at a lower rate of interest; then he would come back to Australia and arrange the conversion of the Australian debt. In my opinion, he was putting the cart before the horse, but, at any rate, so urgent did he believe the conversion of our overseas indebtedness to be, that he would have undertaken the task immediately. My government believed that it, may at first appear, the first duty v/as to convert the Ausit contains practically tralian debt so as to give a lead to overone clause, adding a seas bondholders; then we could approach the overseas bondholders, telling them that we had put our own house in order, and asking them to meet us. A considerable time has elapsed since the Prime Minister assumed office, but nothing has been done to arrange for the conversion of our overseas indebtedness. I do not propose to offer any criticism at this juncture which might hamper the activities of the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) while he is in London on a delicate mission. Indeed, anything I can do to help him I will gladly do, because it is essential to Australia that interest rates be reduced to something corresponding to the price",19,Second Beading

84,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [3.39],"Thelevels prevailing when the debts were contracted. That, however, does not justify a proposal for keeping a permanent or Resident Minister in London. There is no doubt that this appointment marks the beginning of a new policy. If this Government is in office when the period provided in the bill expires, the Prime Minister will be able to find the Same excuses for keeping the Resident Minister in London for a further term that he has now put forward for his appointment. The presence of a Minister in London at the present time to consult with financial institutions, with the heads of the Government, and with subscribers to Australian: loans, is very important, nordo I believe bhat this work could be done so effectively by an officer, however capable, as by a Minister. I maintain, however, that, once the negotiations have been completed, and the contacts established by a responsible Minister, the officer we now have in London as financial adviser could carry out the detailed work quite as capably as any Minister. I shall go further, and say that Mr Collins, with the experience he had in the Treasury in Australia, and the further experience he has had in London, would probably be able to carry out the detailed negotiations even better than could the Minister. What need is there to give power to the Resident Minister to administer Australia 1 House? is Mr Collins, who has ^really done the work for over a year. The High Commissioner is the representative of the nation, and if the nation can afford so costly a representative at the present time to maintain our prestige, well and good. In these times, however, I do not think that Australia can afford to maintain such a position, and it is my opinion that, when the present term expires we should do in the case 'of the High Commissionership what we have done in the case of the office of the Australian CommissionerGeneral in the United States of America. acted on his own initiative. ber for Balaclava does not know everything about these matters, although he thinks that he does. I offer no criticism of our erstwhile representative in the United States of America. That gentleman knew the opinion, of the Government, and he tendered his resignation to me in a proper public 3pirit. I accepted the resignation in the same spirit.. The position in the United States of America became vacant by the resignation of the Commissioner-General, and we did not fill it, but we allowed the permanent secretary to carry on, with the result that nothing has been lost, and no interests have been injured. I say deliberately, and by virtue of the inside knowledge I possess, that Australia would be just as capably represented at Australia House for the next twelve months or two years if we allowed Mr Collins to carry on, as it has been during the last two years. Honourable members have to determine whether there is any justification for our representation abroad on an elaborate scale, when we are forced at home to out and slash our expenditure in order to: meet our obligations. The Prime Minister,, when, introducing this measure,, made only one reference to costs. He said that a saving would be effected by adopting the new proposal, but he gave no details. I have seen press statements to the effect that Mr Bruce will receive the same salary a3 would be paid to a High Commissioner. I do not know whether there was any authority for those statements. mation this House has had of the matter. vided for in the Estimates. Mr Bruce will receive the salary he would have received had he remained here, and an allowance to make up his salary to what the High Commissioner has been receiving. There will be a saving, therefore, of the amount he would have received had he remained here. the amount of the saving will be deducted from the lump sum voted for ministerial salaries. However, we could save the whole of the High Commissioner's salary by not making an appointment, and, so far as the special mission is concerned, all we should have to do would be to continue paying his ministerial salary to Mr Bruce, plus",20,Second Beading

That would he considerably less than the extra amount which he is to be paid, which is equivalent to more than £2,000 per annum. We should keep that point in mind when we are told that a saving is to be made. The best way to effect a saving is to make no appointment at all, but to allow Mr Collins to continue in charge at Australia House. That would not be a tremendous obligation to impose on Mr visiting Great Britain, should return to Collins, who could be under the direction of Mr Bruce while the right honourable member was in London, and-could be instructed afterwards by the Cabinet. All Mr Bruce would then be entitled to draw during his special mission would be his ministerial salary, plus an allowance for expenses. The Government proposes to provide for the right honourable member not only a ministerial salary, but over £2,000 a* year for expenses while Besident Minister in London, and yet we are told that that will effect a saving. It will not properly attended to when he represented be a saving -A saving could be made by not filling the position of High Commissioner, and Australia would not suffer to any appreciable degree. I make that assertion advisedly. What is to be the position of the Resident Minister in London? Will he take instructions from the Cabinet? He will occupy a unique position if he does that. Will he act on his own initiative, or will he be part of the Cabinet, and keep in constant touch with Ministers in Australia by means of cablegrams and letters a most unsatisfactory way of conducting administration. Mr E. honorablo member himself knows that.

A Besident Minister in London could not maintain satisfactory communication with the Government in Australia for a lengthy period by means of telegrams, radiograms, or letters. Therefore, the Minister in London must act largely on his own responsibility. rather than an official, is required there. give definite instructions to an official at Australia House, but it will be impossible to give instructions to a Minister. If our representative were instructed, he would cease to be a Minister, and would become a mere official. My confention is that the right honourable member for Elinders( Mr Bruce), having completed the special mission upon which he is Australia. The principles of democracy demand that the representatives of the people in this Parliament shall keep as closely as possible in touch with their electorates. To make the right honourable member a permanent Besident Minister in London would be to disfranchise his constituents. looked after in his absence. it before. There is great reluctance on the part of the Government to state the real reason for sending the Minister abroad. It is said that there is special work for him to do; but that is not an adequate reason. Special work has had to be done at Ottawa, Lausanne, and Geneva. Is it seriously suggested that it is essential to have a Besident Minister in London because special work must be done there?

I read of the case for trade preference presented by him on behalf of Australia at Ottawa, aud I thought that he made out a strong claim. I am very doubtful, however, regarding his judgment as to what should be conceded by Australia, and I am waiting with grave anxiety to know how his judgment has been exercised in relation to concessions. I was not particularly impressed by the right, honourable member's judgment on the economic position generally, when he was leader of a government, because I recall the warnings given by members ofmy party and by myself with regard to our and 1928. The Bruce-Page Government was then warned of the disaster likely to overtake this country if its policy continued. I recall the light and airy way iu which those warnings were dismissed by the.right honourable gentleman, who had not sufficient judgment to see what was likely to result from the action then taken. I am opposed to any government of Australia from abroad, and I object to the appointment of a Besident Minister in London. I shall support the visit of a member of the Cabinet on any special and important mission, and I grant that there is important, work to lie done in London by the right honourable member on this occasion. I wish the right honourable gentleman every success in his mission, and I hope that the result will be a reduction of the rate of interest on our overseas loans; but, on. the completion of his mission, he should return to Australia to represent his constituents in this Parliament. General) the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has called fact that this bill proposes a change, at least for the time being, in the character is able to make a contribution to the of Australia's representation in London, and has justly asked for reasons in support of that change. Those reasons were given by the Prime Minister in moving the second reading, and I propose shortly to develop one or two of them. I dissent from the view of the Leader of the Opposition as to the possibility of Australia being represented in London by someone other than, an official. I consider it most important to have efficient representation of Australia in London, representation of a. character such that our representative may stand alongside, and, I hope, often above, the representatives of other countries. To have an official in a world centre such as London as the representative of a dominion or a foreign country is particularly unfortunate in many respects. It necessarily and inevitably results in the impression being conveyed that the country so represented is of second-rate importance, and unable to obtain any one of distinction to represent it abroad. The Australian representative in London has a tremendous field trade balance in 1926, 1927 for useful activity, and is able to exercise a wide influence in promoting the well-being of our' people. Discussions with people abroad may at the present time turn largely on finance. But there are other vitally important subjects. Australia's principal markets are in Great Britain, and it is important that we hold and extend them. The competition for them is intense at the present time, and the Commonwealth must be kept well before the minds of the British people in order that we may have the full advantage of not only the quality of our products, but also that sentimental interest in the dominions which is of great importance to Australia's exporting trade. man with commercial capacity rather than a politician. whose ability and distinction appeal to the minds of the British people is worth a great deal more than a mere office man, however great may be his commercial [3.58] -The Leader of knowledge.

Australia must do everything possible to maintain its commercial reputation and prestige abroad, for I assure honourable members that prestige is a highly important element in both finance and trade. This bill is not brought forward for the purpose of introducing a^new general principle. From time to time the relative advantages of a High Commissioner or a Besident Minister to represent dominions in London have been discussed. I have never accepted j t as a general principle that Australia would be most effectively represented by a Besident Minister. While that system would have advantages it would have also great disadvantages. It is true that Canada has on occasions been represented by a Besident Minister, but it is very much easier for him to keep in direct contact with his colleagues than it would be for an Australian Minister resident in London. Amongst the advantages of having a Besident Minister would be that he would have an authority abroad which no other appointee could have. He would be able to speak directly for his Government, and in all negotiations would achieve more in that any appointment under this legislaa shorter space of time than would any -official. He would also be in closer -contact with his Government. element of authority which he would enjoy would play an important part in dealings with representatives of other countries. When it is known that the representative of a dominion has full authority to aet for the Government of that country, much more can be achieved than when discussions with a High Commissioner or other official are known to be merely preliminary and provisional. On the other hand,' a system of represenI ask the House to accept the bill, not as tation in London by a Besident Minister would possess distinct disadvantages. It could not be adopted as a general principle, because often it would be impossible for a Minister to be absent for a considerable length of time from this Parliament and from his constituency. Therefore, the innovation now proposed may be regarded as only an experiment to meet special circumstances. In the highly-important financial negotiations that must be conducted during the next few months, it is of the utmost importance that the man who speaks on behalf of Australia shall be vested with the maximum of authority. Direct conversational dealing is worth many months of indirect negotiation through an official. The Minister without Portfolio ( Mr Bruce) possesses special qualifications for doing the work for which he has been appointed, and it would be very difficult for the Official Secretary, competent as he is, to achieve as much as the man with the status of a former Prime Minister and late AssistantTreasurer of the Commonwealth. The loan conversions will involve mainly direct negotiation with individuals and institutions, and as a result of my own experience in London recently, I am convinced that the Minister will achieve much more than could any official, however competent. The passage of this bill is necessary to enable the right honourable member for Flinders to control the stalf of Australia House. Its operation is limited to two years, and the Minister in London will exercise the functions mentioned in the bill only during the pleasure of the Governor General. The object of that provision is to put it beyond doubt tion will not be even remotely binding on any subsequent administration the High Commissioner? plus an allowance of £2,000, both amounts being subject to a 25 per cent, reduction under the financial emergency legislation.

The Government does not intend to prolong this appointment beyond what the necessities of the case demand-.

I consider that the Commonwealth is fortunate in being able to obtain the services of the right honourable member for Flinders in London at this juncture, and for the special task which he has been asked to undertake. I congratulate the Government upon the step it has taken. My only criticism of the bill is that it does not go far enough. I object to the limitation of the appointment to two years; that restriction could have been imposed later if the experiment proved unsatisfactory. I am disappointed also that there is no provision for negotiation .with the States for the abolition of the office of Agdnt-General, so that Australia might be wholly represented by a Minister of this Parliament. as political plums. policy contained in this bill because, while it continues, the position of High Commissioner will no longer be a political plum. I have no complaint to make of the gentlemen who have filled that office in the past. All had distinguished themselves in the public life of Australia, but none of them returned to this Parliament to enrich it with the increased 'knowledge which they must have gained by their residence and contacts abroad. In future, if the system of appointing a Resident Minister in London be continued, a member of this Parliament will discharge that duty, and he will be obliged to return here to give to Parliament and to his constituents an account of his stewardship. One reason why I have always advocated the appointment of a Resident Minister in London is the .need for widening the circle of men in this Parliament who have definite and intimate kaowledge of conditions and governing authorities on the other side of the world. If there is one matter in respect of which Australia compares unfavorably with some of the other dominions, it is the failure of its people to realize the international position they have attained since the Great War. The Commonwealth must have international contacts. The increasing extent and distribution of its trade make it essential that this Parliament shall contain men with experience abroad. I have always hoped that the constant return to the Commonwealth Parliament of men who had served for a year or so as Resident Minister abroad would gradually build up from all parties-becaus e as governments changed the ministerial representation abroad would change-committee s of members, qualified to advise governments in regard to external affairs, thus creating a definite interest in Imperial and foreign policy. A striking feature of the debates of this Parliament is the entire absence of comment on foreign relations ; we seem to be absorbed in our internal politics. to discuss other matters. of the business-paper does not vary much with changes of government. One explanation is that there are not in this Parliament sufficient men who have had extensive experience abroad and made -intimate contacts with governments and public men in other countries. AlthoughI have always advocated the appointment of a Besident Minister in London, there was, in the past, one valid objection to it, namely, the difficulty of maintaining close contact between the Minister overseas and the Government here, but since the' invention of wireless telephony that disadvantage has been removed. There is no reason why the Minister overseas should not, if necessary, be in daily personal contact with the Government of Australia that will remove the grave danger that there was previously, of the representative overseas committing his Government, without previous discussion with it, to an undesirable policy. Another reason why there should be a Besident Minister representing the Government of Australia in Great Britain, is that the status of the Governor General has altered during the past few years. At present that office is held by an Australian who has not had the opportunity that previous GovernorGenerals had of being in touch with the British Government or with His Majesty himself. better representative.",24,Second Beading

I recognize the difficulty of obtaining the services of a man suitable for the position. A member of this House having a doubtful electorate could not afford to be absent from Australia during the last year of a Parliament, but that difficulty could be overcome to some extent by appointing to the position during the first year of Parliament a representative of the House ef Eepresentatives, and during the last two years of Parliament, a representative of the Senate. Thus, during a period of six years at least two members of this House, and four members of the Senate would hold the position of Resident Minister in London. I have no doubt that if a Minister were absent in Great Britain, and an election took place, some other honourable member would he prepared to handle his constituency for him. If that were done we should save considerable expense in connection with the enforced visits of Ministers overseas. visits ? Dr. formation of the Loan Council and the overseas of a capable Minister.

When that takes place the High Commissioner, who is probably a political appointee, is no longerin close contact -with the Government that he is supposed to represent, and that Government does not feel disposed to consult him to the extent that it would consult a member of its own Cabinet, if he were resident in London. I welcome the entrance into this Parliament of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Casey), who has had considerable experience of imperial and foreign policy. Because of his knowledge, he is a valuable asset to this Parliament. If every year or second year, men with similar experience and qualifications were returned to this Parliament, we should be able to appoint a committee on imperial and foreign affairs with the object of framing a definite policy and laying down a nationaltradition in respect thereto.

I should like to know from the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) whether this Resident Minister in London is to receive instructions from "" the Minister"". If 30, what Minister? Will it be from the Prime Minister as head of the Government, or is the Right Honourable S. M . Bruce to be the dominating personality, dictating the policy of the Government from London? Many people, including the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), and even the Prime Minister himself, have said frequently that the right honourable member for Flinders is the man who dictated the policy of the Nationalist Government, and in 1929 those two gentlemen denounced him from every political platform from which they spoke. To a great extent, those denunciations won their return to Parliament. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that the right honourable gentleman should do everything to facilitate' the banishment of the right honourable member for Flinders to London. Temporarily, at least, he will be out of the way. Clause7 of the act readsA person appointed to be the High Commissioner shall not during his tenure of office be or act as director or agent of or hold any office in any company or syndicate whether incorporated or unincorporated or hold any other employment, or engage in any business, whether within or without the Commonwealth. Will the Prime Minister explain whether that applies to the position of the Resident Minister in London? I waited in vain for the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) to give some cogent reason justifying this appointment. The honourable gentleman stated that, after Mr Bruce returned, an appointment would be made for a period our markets. Is it intended that the of five years.

Notwithstanding these times' of distress, the Estimates reveal that this year there is to be a 100 per cent, increase in the cost of the upkeep of the official residence in London. Is it that the residence that was good enough for Sir Granville Byrie is not good enough for the Bight Honourable S. M. Bruce? mates it will be found that the estimated upkeep of the official residence in London for the year 1932-33 is £520 as against an expenditure of £243 in 1931-32. refers to portion only of the total allowv ance.

Has the Prime Minister had a conference with the State Premiers regarding the abolition of the positions of State AgentsGenerals with a view to eliminating this duplication ? If so, the position of High Commissioner could be filled by an able representative of the Commonwealth, who would perform the duties common to both offices. The Attorney-General declared that, as a general principle, it would not be advisable to have a Resident Minister in London, and futilely endeavoured to justify the . action of the Government. I am of the opinion that the right honourable member for Flinders will still dominate the policy of the Government from London, particularly insofar as finance is concerned. With all due respect to the right honourable gentleman, I submit that he has the outlook of an Englishman rather than that of an Australian.

I have yet to read a report from Sir Granville Ryrie, who was once a Minister in a Nationalist Government, indicating that he did anything to open up bigger and better markets for Australian primary producers. Already we have in London representatives of the Commonwealth Marketing Board and the EmpireMarketing Board. Are they not performing their duties properly? Is it necessary to have this Besident Minister seeking bigger and better markets? I believe that to be merely another excuse to justify Mr Instead, he passes the task over to an Bruce's appointment. I am disappointed that the Prime Minister could not say how long the right honourable member for Flinders will occupy the position of Besident Minister in London. We know that the bill provides for an appointment of two years, and when the project was first mooted the Prime Minister said that the appointment would be for twelve months. It might be for six months or any other period. Surely the Government can be more precise. A great deal has been said about the qualifications of Mr Bruce for the posiplacing the Government under different tion. Honourable members opposite have pointed to him as an outstanding figure who has done much for Australia. I remember listening to an eloquent speech by the right honourable member for Flinders when Prime Minister. It was delivered at Adelaide, and sought to justify the policy of his Government in borrowing £40,000,000 a year to develop Australia by the importation of goods from abroad; for the natural corollary of borrowing from abroad is increased importations. That policy had a particularly disastrous effect upon our secondary menced by saying that he was not industries. Yet the gentleman responsible for it is being honoured by appointment to the important position of Resident Minister in London! It was claimed that Mr Bruce would not receive the full salary paid to a High Commissioner; that his allowance as Honorary Minister would be deducted from that amount. I contend that if the right honourable gentleman can be spared from Australia for twelve months the position of Honorary Minister, which he occupies, could be abolished, with a resultant saving to tlie country. It has been claimed that, as Besident. Minister in London, the right honourable member for Flinders will play a prominent part in the conversion of Australia's indebtedness. Surely that is a task for the Prime Minister-no t for an Honorary Minister. During the last federal election campaign, the Prime Minister said that, if elected, one of his first jobs would be to proceed to London to convert the whole of Australia's indebtedness at a reduced rate of interest. The right honourable gentleman has not done so. Honorary Minister. Not one 'sound argument has been advanced by honourable members opposite in defence of the appointment. Obviously, it is merely a subterfuge to find a position for the right honourable member for Flinders, who unexpectedly performed a political "" comeback ""-, and disconcerted his colleagues. I predict that in the next twelve months there will be considerable political intrigue with the object of removing certain honourable gentlemen from the treasury bench and leadership. listening to the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) I found it difficult to think that he was not speaking "" with his dialectic tongue in his dialectic cheek"". If anybody knows the difficulty of effecting the conversion of huge sums of money on the London market, it is the right honourable gentleman, for he made tentative attempts to do that when he was last in London. The right honourable gentleman comprepared to undermine the position of Mr Bruce in London, and then immediately proceeded to do so. The right honourable gentleman and others who followed him questioned his judgment and claimed that Mr Collins could perform the task ahead of him equally well. That is more than open to question. I appreciate Mr Collins as a civil servant. I worked with him, and am his friend.

Mr Collins could not even begin negotiations on equal terms with the Governor of the Bank of England, or with the British Treasury, but the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) will be able to do so. It has been asked in certain quarters what is the right honourable member's mission in London. It is a simple one; the attempt to convert our loans from a. high to a lower rate of interest. I know the speeches on this occasion of the of no one with better qualifications for the task. The first business to be undertaken is the conversion of the New South Wales loan of £13,000,000 that falls due in November. If that conversion succeeds, the conversion of the bracketed loans falling due within the next few years will remain to be undertaken. Mr Bruce's mission is to effect these conCollins, our financial adviser in London, versions, so far as it is humanly possible had a more intimate knowledge of the to do so; and then he will return to this country. Details will, no doubt, be attended to by Mr Collins. Nobody suggests, for example, that Mr Bruce should remain to sign the new scrip to be issued.

The remarks of the Deputy were likewise, in my opinion, animated solely by political motives.

In the circumstances, the statement was mischievous and unfair. The measure has not been discussed by the Opposition on tunity for backbiting, and for what the House will recognize as a mean and dirty attack unjust attack on a man who is not here to defend himself. I do not think that I have ever listened to weaker opposition to any measure than Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), the Deputy Leader( Mr Forde), and the leader of what has been called the Lang group ( Mr Beasley).

We have already read something, particularly in the financial press of England, of the good effect produced in financial circles by the advocacy of Australia's interests by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) Avhen he was recently in London. We have learned how he was able most effectively to dispose of certain ill-informed and groundless prejudices against Australia and her methods of finance. I believe that the right honourable member for Flinders will do this task as well as any man could. The Government could not make a better choice. He is a well-known figure, he has an international reputation, he has a personality which inspires confidence, and he has many valuable contacts, both in the business world and with financial institutions, which must be of incalculable value to Australia Avhen we are seeking to convert large sums on the London market. The additional advantage of ministerial authority which he will possess canance of the task which Mr Bruce is to not be overlooked. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that Mr Bruce's position in London would be virtually a sinecure. That, I think, is the best joke we have heard yet in connection with this proposal. The honourable member for West Sydney said that Mr Bruce had not an Australian outlook, and this was repeated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Well, I do not know that West Sydney has a monopoly of Australian outlook, and certainly, within the last nine months or so, the people of Australia have shoAvn that they do not regard the West Sydney outlook as the Australian outlook. This is demonstrated by the present personnel of this House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke of marketing arrangements overseas, and appears to think it absurd that MT. Bruce should be expected to do anything to advance Australia's trade in Great Britain. His argument reminded me of the very narroAv view held by some -members of certain trade unions that one man must do only one thing; that, for instance, a plumber must never touch anySurelyi f a Minister goes to London it is not out of place for' him to do anything and everything to advance Australia's prospects and trade. There is no need, even though his principal mission be in regard to finance, to exclude rigidly everything else. We know that iu 1923 it Avas this same gentleman, the right honourable member for Flinders, who did a great deal for a number of our important exporting industries by obtaining certain preferences from the British Government. Although their extent was then limited, Australia obtained preference for dried fruits, wines, and sugar, three concessions which were extremely valuable to the people of Australia, and particularly to some of the constituents of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Avho has been at such pains to belittle Mr Bruce. Some of the gibes of honourable members in respect of the emoluments of the High Commissioner are very paltry. The Prime Minister has shown that there will be an actual saving as the result of the neAv arrangement; but, even if .there were not, when Ave consider the importundertake, and the enormous benefits which will accrue to Australia if he is successful, we realize IIOAV petty are complaints about the salary of the Besident Minister in London. Consider, for instance, the first task which Mr Bruce will undertake-the conversion of a loan of £13,000,000 for New South Wales, which is falling due in ""NoAemr ber. If it were possiblefor Australia, owing to the efforts of a man of the standing of Mr Bruce, to secure terms only 2s. 6d. per cent, lower in the interest' payable on the loan, it would mean a saving of £16,000 a year. I do not think it would be expecting too much, or exaggerating the possibilities of the situation, to say that Mr Bruce might be able to obtain that additional advantage when another man could not. Then there is a larger conversion which it'might tribunals. The Leader of the Opposition 'he advantageous to undertake later. We were told by the Prime Minister in his budget speech that, of the £474,000,000 which we owed in Great Britain apart from war debt, about £307,000,000 was borrowed at 5 per cent, and over. No less than £93,000,000 was at more than 5 per cent., and up to 6£ ;.per cent. last week that we have current option conversion rights over £96,000,000 worth -of our overseas debt, on which we pay 5 per cent, and up to 6-J por cent, interest. There is nothing to prevent us from negotiating with the overseas bondholders at the present time, or at any time we think fit, because the first of the when, they themselves were prepared to two maturity dates in connection with these particular issues has already passed. If Mr Bruce were able to obtain an advantage of 2s. 6d. per cent, less interest self honorably as leader of the Bruceon £96,000,000 worth of debt, that alone would represent a saving of £120,000 a year to Australia. The Government could not have made a better choice for this position, and I support the bill. is hardly necessary to say anything in support of this bill, because the appointment of such a man as Mr Bruce is obviously a good one. He has peculiar characteristics, he has travelled, he is educated, things, a gentleman, which one cannot say of some of the representatives of Australia who have been sent abroad in the past. I have risen chiefly because of the attacks made on Mr representatives of a democratic moveBruce by the honourable member for East. Sydney( Mr Ward), the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and the Deputy Loader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said that Mr Bruce had carried Australia to disaster, and treated the warnings of various personshimself included, I suppose-in an airy manner; and that, consequently, he was thrown from office in 1929. Honourable members know well that the main issue at that election was arbitration-the removal of a great many petty industrial matters from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to that of State used all his oratory on that occasion to defeat the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), stating that there was no need to economize, no need to cut down the costs of industry by reforming the arbitration system. But what'did the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters do after they had brought about We were also reminded the fall of Mr Bruce and his Government? They found themselves up against financial and economic problems, and were compelled to bring in wage reduction bills, which cut the earnings of the Avorkers very substantially. Yet they have the audacity now to charge Mr Bruce with, having neglected his duty, bribe the people by offering what they could noi deliver. For six years, the right honourable member acquitted himPage Government, whose term of office was one of the most prosperous periods in Australia's history. The right honourable gentleman has been attacked to-day because it happens that his interests are not entirely political; but I claim that one of the greatest curses in Australia, to-day is the professional politician. Many honourable members on the other side of the House represent that class. They have the gift of the gab, and having acted as union secreand he is, above all taries, often through being indifferent tradesmen, they are regarded as suitable candidates for parliamentary honours. These men have to do-as they are told; yet they pose in this Parliament as the ment. The man who has been criticized in this House to-day has shown his ability in other than political walks of life. In reply to the gibe that he does not know this country so well as some petty-minded Australians do, I point out that the fact that he went abroad for some of his education stands to his credit, rather than to his detriment. He spent several years in doing his part during a national crisis, while certain other honourable members seemed not to remember to do so. That, too, may be said to the credit of the right honourable member.",33,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending

Australia, and took no part in assisting to get this country out of its difficulties. I am in a position to state that he could then have had a safe seat in this Parliament, had he chosen to take it. I accidentally met him when he knew that the figures in his own electorate were against him. On that occasion, I had been a member of this House for only three or four weeks and had successfully faced a second election, but in view of the attack made upon Mr Bruce by honourable members opposite, I make"" no apology for saying that I offered to resign if he cared to take my seat in Balaclava. able member for Beid( Mr Gander) is a seat-warmer for the ex-Premier of New South Wales, but, as I have pointed out, when I made that offer I had heen a member for only a few weeks, and I realized that it was a tragedy for the services of a man of the calibre of Mr mystery. Apparently, no good reason can Bruce to be lost to Australia. The right honourable gentleman said that he was going on a holiday, but he promised that when he returned from Great Britain, he would fight for his old seat, and win it back. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), who left the Blinders seat for a safer electorate, can tell us whether the right honourable member for Flinders carried out that promise. West Sydney remarked that Mr Willis had complained that the United Australia party had "" cruelled the pitch "" for him, because it refused to i>e a party to repudiation of overseas interest payments, and that he could have secured lower interest rates overseas if the Lang policy had been adopted.

I regret that a most worthy member of this House has been unfairly criticized. [10 ] The international situation is most complex. Affairs in Germany have come to such a pass that there may be civil war in that country, and Bussia is mysterious and menacing. Honourable members opposite address each other as comrades, and profess to believe in tbe brotherhood of man, but in the arena of domestic politics, they fight bitterly between themselves. Paradoxically, they favour a high tariff, which makes a country selfishly national, and is often the cause of international disputes. The party opposite is alive only to the petty, local interests of Australia, but we are fortunate in having, in Mr Bruce, a man who sees affairs in their imperial and international aspects. I support the bill. oppose this measure. I do not say that I know that the honormy opposition to it would have disappeared if the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), and several of those supporting the bill had been more frank in explaining the supposed necessity for it . Its real object seems to be shrouded in be advanced for clothing the Besident Minister in London with the powers of the High Commissioner. As a matter of fact, under present conditions it is not necessary to have a High Commissioner in London at all. Mr J. B. Collins has practically carried out the work of that officer for many years. Judging by the powers proposed to be given to the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr The 'honourable member for Bruce), under this more or less spectacular measure, it would seem that the House has not been informed of the real reason for the bill. I do not intend to make a personal attack on Mr Bruce in his absence, but I am entitled, I think, to offer criticism of a political nature. The injurious effect on Australia of the administration of the Bruce-Page Government is still remembered, and, unfortunately, this country, will for many years have to bear the burden which that Government imposed upon it..

During thisdebate, many encomiums have been heaped upon the right honourable member for Flinders. One can readily find a reason for that. When 'he Comes back, in all probability he will be in a' position to reward, those who have defended him in his absence from the charges levelled against him as a public financier. One Can appreciate the desire of certain honourable members to stand in well with a man who will probably occupy a high position in this country before the expiration of the twelve months for which he is to be appointed Besident Minister in London. His first duty, it seems to me, is to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the people honourable member for Flinders is very of Australia, and that will be a difficult job. his capacity as an administrator, but I claim that during his term of office as Prime Minister he showed blundering incapacityj and a total disregard for the Welfare of Australian industries. There was lavish expenditure during his regime; public money was wasted,and from ten to fifteen years will be required to enable the Commonwealth to recover from the bankrupt condition in which he left it. This is the man who is held up to-day as the only person suitable for the special mission on which he has been sent to London. As a matter of fact, the job for which he is ostensibly going there, has already been done. WhatI am afraid of is that the right honourable member, with his kindly regard for the overseas financiers and the bondholders, will not strike such a bargain for Australia as could be obtained by a representative other than himself. my opinion, he has neither the necessary capacity, nor the temperament required to enable him to carry out delicate financial negotiations. The right honourable member has not an Australian outlook. I speak as the result of about ten years' experience of him in the public life of this country, and that is also the conclusion which many thousands of people in Australia have reached regardwould be much better! ing him.

No doubt, the Government thinks that it is doing right in selecting the right honourable member for this work, but the Opposition is entitled to protest against his selection to carry out the conversion of Australia's' overseas loans. If the main reason for the appointment of the right honourable gentleman to this high position is not his personal rehabilitation in the eyes of the Australian people, one wonders-and I regret that the Prime Minister' was not more frankfor whom the right honourable gentleman is"" seat-warming "" in Flinders.

It is common knowledge that the firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce has suffered heavy losses during the last two years; in one year the loss was £80,000. No doubt the public duties of the right honourable member for Flinders will dovetail very happily with attention to his private interests abroad. Those who are for ever gibing at professional politicians will approve of the appointment of the right In honourable gentleman as representative of Australia in London. Contemptuous reference is made to those men whose only source of livelihood is their parliamentary allowance. God help Australia if it should ever become dependent on men who subordinate their parliamentary duties to their private business interests. Mr E. J.

There is no need to alter the law to enable the right honourable member for Flinders to be appointed to represent Australia in London, and there is certainly no justification for paying him more than his ministerial salary. He will control a capable staff in Australia House, and I have no doubt that after the preliminary negotiations are completed the detail work of loan conversion will be done by men who understand these matters much better than the right honourable member for Flinders. the ordinary course of business. Opposition said that the conversion negotiations would be conducted up to a certain point by the Minister now in London, but that the detail work could be done by Mr Collins, who has a more intimate knowledge of public finance and loan operations than has the right honourable member for Flinders, or any other person who is not constantly in touch with the financiers of London. contention was completely misrepresented, inadvertently I believe, by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). The explanation of this measure by the Prime Minister was not frank; possibly he thought that the time was not opportune to take the House into his confidence. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) also showed a keen desire to withhold from the House the real reason for the step that is proposed. Other honourable members supporting the Government do not know the real reason, but accept the ostensible one in the hope that their encomiums of the right honourable member for Flinders and their defence of his The political reputation will be suitably recognized on his return. debate seems to have centred on the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), but I do not find in the bill any reference to him, although we .know that he is to be appointed acting High Commissioner. I have arrived at the conclusion that it is immaterial whether one votes for or against the bilL The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has asserted that a vote for the second reading will be an endorsement of a new system. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, assured the House that the bill does not introduce any new general principle. Perhaps the Leader of tbe Opposition is right, but governments will please themselves, as they have done in the past. The operation of the bill is limited to two years, but if a government desires to send some of its members abroad, it will find excuses.for doing so. For a considerable time, at least one Commonwealth Minister of the Crown has been absent from Australia. The Scullin Ministry sent four Ministers abroad. To date, the present Government has sent is three abroad, and I doubt that that will be the end of these trips. I regard many of them as merely political plums, and I am certain that if the present Government or any future Government wants to send other Ministers on trips at the public expense, it will do so, whether this bill be accepted or"" rejected.

Undoubtedly the need exists, but I could not help recalling some earlier appointments of High Commissioners and Agents-General. If rumour be correct, Sir Granville Ryrie was appointed High Commissioner because of his political services to his party, try expended £2,000,000 on the steamship and to get him out of the way at a time when his vote was uncertain. Sir Henry Barwell was appointed Agent-General for South Australia purely for political reasons. Had he stood for the Senate, he might, have prejudiced the chances of the Nationalist or Liberal candidates. Therefore, the salary of the Agent General was increased, and Sir Henry Barwell was shipped to London. Happenings of this character make me feel that ability and efficiency arc not the factors which govern these appointments abroad ; the primary consideration is the interest of the political party iu power.

I only regret that an attempt is not being, made to save still more. I have known every High Commissioner for Australia. I was in London when sites for Australia House were being inspected. One site offered faced Trafalgar Square. It had a wide frontage but a shallow depth. My old friend, Sir George Reid, observed concerning it, "" Too much face, and too little belly to build Australia House on"". Subsequently, the present site was chosen. Sir George Reid was the first High Commissioner, and a very good one he was. Next came Mr Andrew Fisher; then Sir Joseph Cook, and then Sir Granville Ryrie. It will be noticed that all the occupants of this position, except Andrew Fisher, were decorated with the tuppeny-ha'penny tin-pot thing termed a title. Only Andrew Fisher was plain Mister. charged any other occupant of the office. I like Sir Granville Byrie, because he is a plain, blunt man who speaks from his heart. He said when he was appointed that he did not know why the honour had been conferred upon him, and added that he would do his level best. He certainly made friends in South Africa when he told the Boers that they were brave men who had fought a desperate fight for freedom. I oppose this bill. It is an infamy, in present circumstances, to inflict upon the great Australian public the heavy expense which this office involves. In answer to a question which I asked in this House on the 20th September, 1928, I was told that up to the 30th June, 1928, the building had cost £621,700, and that the site had cost £379,800, making, in all, £1,001,500. The administrative costs then were £720,602. of Australia House? siderable depreciation in real estate in London as elsewhere. I made an inquiry on that very point, and the reply I received was as follows:Tho High Commissioner's office advises that it is practically impossible to estimate the value of the building and site but that there is no doubt that both would show a considerable increase on the cost. We know very well that in consequence of the high taxation in England many aristocratic homes have been sold. Still, I do not think we would lose much, if anything, if we were to sell Australia House even now. We have all heard the old adage that promises, like pie-crusts, are made to be broken, and another equally common saying that the path to hell is paved with good intentions. It will be remembered that just before the consummation of federation, when we were discussing, on the public platforms of this country, the benefits that would flow to Australia if the colonies federated, it was often said that one result of federation would mean that we should be able to do with one agentgeneral for the Commonwealth and the States, whereas then six were needed, But he disone for each State.

178,Dr. Maloney,"There has been confour agents-general too many. I believe that if the people of Australia were consulted by ballot.they would indicate by an overwhelming majority that the office of State agent-general should be abolished in every case. In reply to my inquiry as to the number of persons employed at Australia House, I obtained the following figures:Temporary, 313 j permanent, 29; total 342. I was also informed that only 58 of these were Australians. I have no objection to British people. My mother was an English woman, and I love the land from which she came. But I think more Australians should be employed at Australia House. Whenever the British Government establishes an office of any kind in Australia the largest percentage of the staff is English. I ascertained when I asked the series of questions to which I have already referred, that 100 typists were employed at Australia House. They were described as clerks and typists. In this Parliament House, which is the home of the Commonwealth Government, and in which all our laws are made, we have only fourteen typists. Why then, should there be 100 at Australia House? I know, of course, that Mr Percy Coleman, the former member for Beid, made a valuable report on the expenditure at Australia House, and recommended many economies; but I think the office should be closed and the building sold. If that were done an end would be put to a lot of humbug and nonsense. In these clays it would be possible for us to have a representative in London in a modest office, and the members of the Government could, if they so desired, talk to him by telephone almost as easily as they can talk by telephone to officers at Civic Centre. There is no need for us to continue spending large sums of money on this office. I believe we should do better from a commercial point of view if we empowered the Government to grant travelling expenses to bona fide commercial travellers sent to England to represent specific interests. possibly be made for such persons to be allowed a certain percentage on the increased sales pf Australian products in England, as shown by customs house figures, following their various appointments. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) had something to say, and I fear in a derogatory way, about professional politicians. As a matter of fact, the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has always been quoted by me as a politician who, immediately he assumed government office, resigned from the directorate of his firm so that he could devote the whole of his time to his political duties. A ll honour to him for so doing. I make these remarks in reply to the unkind criticism of the honourable member for Balaclava. I wish, also, to say a few words in reply to the observations of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) about the "" paltry salary."" In doing so, I shall refer to Switzerland, the only real democracy in the world. In Switzerland, the people control the parliament, not only on election day, but on every day in the year. The Swiss people had a great compliment paid to them when, with only the reversal of the colours, their flag was adopted as the red cross emblem. On one occasion the Government decided to appoint a Swiss as a kind of commissionerin the United States of America. The officer appointed was to, as it were, sit astride the two continents. The Federal Government fixed the remuneration of the office at £400. The Swiss parliament always fixes a specific sum when making such appointments, and there are no additions to it. The officer, in this case, was to use the consular offices in America. The Swiss people were not consulted about the appointment, and were so incensed at the action of the Government that an initiative petition was circulated, with the result that the Government had to cancel the appointment. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. Dr.' MALONEY I say, with all reverence, that God never created anything His equal or His superior. Why, then, should the electors, who are the Arrangements might creators of Parliament, once in every three years, allow ^the created Parliament -to make, itself more powerful than the electors? If the people of Australia really had the power to control the Parliament that they have created",41,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending
179,Dr. Maloney,"Well, we still havethey would not allow the payment of salaries up to £5,000 a year. It is ridicusecondary industries. My investigations lous, in view of our limited population, to countenance, any longer, the maintenance of an excrescence like Australia House, costing as it did over £1,000,000, including the land on which it'stands, and a further £1,000,000 for other costs. This is unjust to the people who elected.us, and it is not true democracy. I have always held that the law-maker fills the most important position to which man can aspire. Any man who gains the suffrages of his fellow citizens to become a member of Parliament, and therefore, a lawmaker, should receive the highest salary that is paid in the State, excepting perhaps that paid to scientists aud experts who are invited from time to time to report upon our railways and other institutions. For 50 years in and out of Parliament, and for 43 years in Parliament, I have endeavoured to make the people the controlling power in the country. Until that has been done this will not be a true democracy, for the created thing has more power than its creator. Honourable members are doing a disservice to their country in delaying the passage of the measure. I rise to reply to some statements which, if left unchallenged, would convey an erroneous impression concerning one who is not present to reply to them, a gentleman who has always manifested a very high sense of national duty, and' at the moment is on .the other side of the world in furtherance, of the interests of his country, the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce). The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) declared that he was not going to indulge in a personal attack upon the right honourable member for Flinders-and promptly proceeded to do so. In attempting to belittle the administration of the right honourable gentleman, he alleged that Mr Bruce had worked to the detriment of our secondary, and in favour of our importing industries. I find, on examining the Commonwealth Year-Booh, that the contrary is the case. During the regime of the Bruce-Page Government there was a rather large increase in the number of factories in Australia and a noticeable increase in the number of persons engaged in our also make it apparent that, despite the protestations of honourable members opposite, the number of factories declined somewhat, and the number pf employees in secondary industries declined considerably during the period that the Scullin Government was in office, and that despite the huge array of tariff schedules introduced by that administration. An attack was also made upon the borrowing policy of the""Bruce-Page Government. Every honourable member knows perfectly well that the great increase in borrowing that took place in the six or seven years during which that Government was in power was chiefly on behalf of the States, not of the Commonwealth. It was largely because of the endeavours of the right honourable member for Flinders, in collaboration with the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page),.that the Loan Council came into being. That body had the effect of steadying Australia's borrowing, and of making it possible to obtain loans on better terms. Certainly it has stood as a bulwark of safety during the rather disastrous period through which we are passing. The honourable member for Darling stated that the right honourable member for Flinders is a person devoid of Australian sentiment. There are two classes of Australians, those whose outlook is bounded by our shores, and those who realize that the security and safety of the Commonwealth are bound up with Imperial relations, and a sound international outlook. If the sneer of the honourable member for Darling places the right honourable member for Flinders in the second category, it becomes a high compliment. The same honourable member insinuated that the right honourable member for Flinders is not temperamentally fitted for the task that he has undertaken. All who know the right honourable gentleman would scout the suggestion that he is temperamentally unbalanced, incautious, apt to be swayed by illogical contentions, or by sentimental appeals. Honourable members who cannot do better than make such ludicrous attacks upon a person",42,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending

Then the accusation was levelled at the right honourable member that, while overseas, he will sacrifice the interests of the think he ever did. This personal attack nation to his personal advantage. The honourable member who made that accusation should feel ashamed. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) declared that, the right honourable member for Flinders obtained the bulk of his education abroad, aud considered himself so superior to the people of Australia that, when the war broke out he enlisted in Great Britain. Those who are familiar with the right honourable gentleman's history are aware that he had a splendid athletic and scholastic career in one of Melbourne's public schools. On the second point I may say that instead of returning to Australia to enlist, and so wasting time, the right honourable member for Flinders, being in. England at the time, seized the earliest opportunity to enlist, so that he might give his services during the dark days of 1914-18, au example which might well have been followed by a goodly number of honourable members on the other side of the HouseVery few members of this House, I am sure, really believe that the Government could have appointed any one else who would perform this work as satisfactorily as Mr Bruce could do. For once, I shall venture to assume the role of. prophet. I am quite certain that after he has accomplished his mission, and performed a great national service for Australia, Mr Bruce will return, with his reputation enhanced both at home and abroad.

This bill introduces a new principle.' The propositi to send a Resident Minister to London has been discussed before, but it has always been regarded as impracticable. I wtis surprised, therefore, to learn that the matter had been revived by this Government, and that it was proposed to appoint such a Minister. I like to see new ideas introduced-w e do not have enough of them in Australiaand if this is going to be an improvement on the ghastly failure of the high comtnissionership during the last fifteen years, it is to be welcomed.

185,Mr Thompson,"Yes, it is, and Ito that kind of work. A t any rate, he has maintained the prestige of Australia. The point at issue in connection with this proposal is not the merits or demerits of the right honourable member for Flinders. We who have known the right honourable gentleman, and have seen his work as Prime Minister, regard him as the outstanding man for a position such as this. We have no doubt that the Government has chosen wisely. Nevertheless, this appointment represents a new departure in Australian politics, and I should be surprised if it turns out to be more thana temporary experiment. I am not hostile to the Government on this issue, but I remind honourable members that a condition upon which members are elected to this Parliament is that they remain in Australia and personally attend to the needs of their constituents. It is obvious that if the right honourable member for Flinders, useful as he may be to Australia while abroad, is to remain in Londonf or two years, he w ill not be able to represent the people of Flindersi n this House. It may be that the electors of Flinders are sufficiently patriotic, or will be so nattered at his having been picked on for this experiment, that they w ill be quite"" satisfied to allow their representative to go abroad practically for the whole term of Parliament, and, if so. it shows that they have been able to take a larger view of the matter than we may expect the electors of most constituencies to do. remedy in their own hands. f a i r to put any electorate in the position of having to take it or leave it? Isi t f a i r to say to the electors of Flinders, or any other constituency, "" This is the man we have selected to send abroad. He is going to London as our ambassador for two years, and we are handing over to one of his colleagues the task of representing you as well as his own constituents "". Government has not taken any steps-to find out whether the electors of Flinders are agreeable to this most radical change. I presume that, the prestige of Mr Bruce is so high to-day that the great majority of his electors are prepared to subscribe to that change; but does not that of itself indicate that the Government is able to do this only because of his high prestige and outstanding personality. No other electorate would subscribe to the arrangement for a moment. If a man who was standing for Parliament were to tell the electors that, if elected, he had a chance of going abroad as ambassador for two years, I feel sure that he would not have a chance of being returned. It is evident, therefore, that the Government is merely making use of the services of Mr. Bruce while they are available, and is not contemplating making this for m of representation a permanent one. Therefore, in my opinion, the position could have been met without introducing this bill, merely by allowing Mr Bruce to go to Londonf o i ' six or twelve months in order to carry through tlie necessary financial operations. It would only be necessary to announce to the people that, in due course, he would be returning to Australia, and that the position of H i g h Commissioner would then be reconsidered. There is no doubt that the High Conimissionership will have to be reviewed in the near future. Some honourable members have referred to the high cost of Australia House, and have questioned the actual value of the H i g h Commissionership to Australia. It is extraordinary that, although originally the High Commissioner was supposed to perform' all the functions of a Besident Minister, and almost those of an ambassador, in London, he has never have their actually done anything of the kind. We have always had the spectacle of a stream Yes ; but is it of Ministers going to London on one pretext or another. The last Government cannot dispute that, because it sent as many of its members abroad as did any other government. Indeed, on one occasion, it sent nearly half the Ministry. rected; it sent only four. This sending of Ministers abroad has proved of how I am assuming that the little use the H i g h Commissionership has been to Australia. On the financial side, also, it has failed us. A little while ago we found it necessary to send a high Treasury official, Mr Collins, abroad., as our financial adviser, and for the last twelve months he has been virtually in charge of Australia House.",44,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending

I feel sure that, perhaps before twelve months have gone by, the Government will be forced to alter its policy of having a Resident Minister in London. 1 do not think that it will be possible or practicable for the right hontralia. A great deal has been said about orable member for Flinders to stay away from Australia and continue to represent a section of the electors of the Commonwealth. On the surface the proposal is a most extraordinary one, and I think the Government will be forced to make an alteration, because the new arrangement will be found to be impracticable. In the meantime, there is no High Commissioner in London, and we must have some one there with the necessary status and authority to handle the gigantic financial operations now crowding on us. The right honourable member for Flinders understands high finance, and can handle big operations, and as a Minister he will have the necessary prestige to move effectively in London financial circles. I disregard the suggesmembers will admit that they have been tion that the position will be merely a social one.; but a country's ambassador must have social prestige, and the right honourable member for Flinders will represent Australia with dignity. He will certainly create a favorable impression on the other side of the world. He has been attacked on the ground of his alleged financial incompetency and the record of the Bruce-Page Government has been cited, mostly by persons who were not in this Parliament when it was in power, and are mere newcomers to politics. I venture to say that the most vitriolic of the clitics of the right honourable member for Flinders have not taken the trouble to look up the figures of the Bruce-Page regime. whose accuracy cannot be challenged. In -its six and a half years of office, the Bruce-Page £220,000,000. claimed that the qualifications of the right honourable member for Flinders are vitiated by the financial record of his government, and I want, briefly, to indiThe Government has cate the merits of the financial administration of that Government to show why we have so much faith in this particular appointment. One of the outstanding qualifications of the right honourable member is the great success with which he handled the financial problems of Austhe tremendous borrowings of the Bruce Page Government, and about its extravagance. As a matter of fact, in the six and a half years it was forced to borrow £207,000,000 on behalf of the States. Members of the Labour party in the State Parliaments were just as insistent as other parties in forcing the Commonwealth to borrow on their behalf, so that money could be spent on State public works. to permit the honourable member to adduce many more figures relating to the financial administration of the Bruce Page Government, I might just as well allow him to traverse the whole of the record of that Government. Honourable given .great latitude during this debate, but I must now insist on some attempt being made to connect remarks with the bill. correction, Mr Speaker, but some honourable members, having already cited figures, I thought it proper to reply to them. Briefly, I may say, that the Bruce Page Government established sinking funds which reduced the war debt by £45,000,000. That was done under the leadership of a gentleman who, some honourable members say, has not the capacity to be a Besident Minister in London or to carry out important financial transactions. The record of the Bruce-Page Government stands for itself. It is true that there was a lot of money to spend, They are figures and that the right honourable member spent it like a gentleman, but during the whole of that time there was an insisGovernment borrowed tent demand from all quarters that the Commonwealth Government should spend",45,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending

In those years, the Government which did not borrow at the rate of £40,000,000 a year was regarded as a "" d u d "" ; as one that was not doing its job. It is of no use saying now that the happenings of that period were evidence of the incapacity of the right honourable member for Flinders, or that he was the most disastrous Prime Minister whom Australia has ever had, and certainly the worse man we could send to London to handle important conversion operations. apart from the point 1 have raised, that it is very doubtful whether the electors of Flinders are getting a fair deal, I cannot find fault with the present proposal. So far as the personality of the man chosen is concerned, the case is complete. I think that 90 per cent, of the people of Australia, even the supporters of the vociferous party opposing the Government, if asked their opinion, would say that they have perfect the right honourable member for Flinders to represent Australia in these important financial transactions abroad. The whole of the debate seems to have centred upon the gentleman chosen as Resident Minister in London, and very little reason has been shown by supporters of the Government why any one should be sent to the other side of the world as Resident Minister. I have heard it suggested that one reason why the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has been chosen is that he was not prepared to take a subordinate post in this Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio, and thought that it would probably sound much better if his title were Resident Minister in London; and that if a conversion loan is successfully floated he will return to take up the posiof the bill. tion he has occupied since the general election, although not nominally-that of leader of the Government and Prime Minister. I am not satisfied that the Government has given us the full reasons why the right honourable member for Flinders has been sent to the other side of the world. With all due respect to those who say that the negotiations at Ottawa were carried out satisfactorily so far as Australia is concerned, I beg to differ from them. I say that the interests of Australia were sacrificed, and the people of this country will realize that in the near future. We find, on reading the press reports, which the Prime Minister says are substantially correct, thatAustralia undertakes that protection by tariffs shall be afforded only to those industries which are reasonably assured of a sound opportunity for success, and undertakes also that during the currency of the agreement the tariff shall be based on the principle that the protective duties shall not exceed such a For these reasons, levdl as will give British producers the full opportunity for reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production. Who is to determine this ? In my opinion the right honourable member for Flinders is transferring the seat of Government of the Commonwealth to the other side of the world. From London he will indicate which Australian industries the British capitalists think should be sacrificed. He is certainly qualified to undertake faith in the ability of that task. .So far as his Australian outlook is concerned, all that we can say about him is that it was the misfortune of Australia that he was born in this country. It is all eyewash for the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) to try to justify this appointment by saying that it is very necessary that members of this Parliament should have a knowledge of foreign affairs and international events, while a film depicting development in another part of the world is not permitted to he screened in Australia. bers of what other honorahle members have said; the Chair must insist on the strict relevancy of the debate to the provisions for Balaclava spoke of professional politicians; of men unsuccessful in other callings, but having the gift of the gab, being able to secure positions in Parliament.

Of course, in dealing with the appointment as Resident Minister in Loudon of a member to whom honourable members opposite, and in the Country party, look with reverence, thousands of pounds can be spent without comment; but within a few days, when supporters of the Government will be dealing with invalid and old-age pensions, they will consider every penny! We are told that the palatial qnarter3 provided for the High Commissioner in London are not sufficient to hoii3C the right honourable member for Flinders. What are his special qualifications, of which so much has been said to-day? If we require a representative in London merely to wear a top bat at the right angle, or look well in spats, no doubt the right man has been chosen for the position. I understood that we were to hear some useful remarks from the honourable member for Corio( Mr Casey), but despite his experience on the other side of the'world, the only contribution that he made to this debate was an objection to the insinuation that the right honourable member for Flinders was not a suitable person to represent Australia abroad. I make no apology for what 1 have said concerning the right honourable member. He has not an Australian outlook, and he cannot possibly look after the interests of the people of this country in a proper manner. If the desire was to appoint a British Imperialist to represent us in London, the right man has been chosen. He will make a. good representative of Britain, but a poor one of Australia. The object of the Ottawa Conference was to organize the British Empire as a solid economic unit, so that it would be in a favorable position to compete with other similar combinations of peoples, including those of the United States of America; which are making inroads upon the British markets. Great Britain does not desire the secondary industries of Australia to be built up. It wishes to see them sacrificed, and desires that we shall confine our attention to the proup of Australian industries. duction of the raw materials required in factories overseas. I remember, a few months ago, the Government and its supporters scoffing at certain suggestions put forward by my party for the conversion of loans at reduced rates of interest. That policy was said to be one of repudiation. It was declared that my party was proceeding on wrong lines, and that there should be no compulsory conversion of loans. When the party opposite, in conjunction with the then government, appealed to the public for the conversion of internal loans, it promised that compulsion would not be applied; but the Government said to the bondholders: "" We shall give you until a certain' date to convert voluntarily, and after that you will have to convert"". Let the Government lay its cards on the table, and say frankly why the right honourable member for Flinders is being sent abroad. It should let the people know that Australia's interests are being sacrificed. The people will realize that, in any event, a few months hence. Many members opposite will in all probability be remembered solely as one-Parliament members. .Their return at the last election was due to the fact that on that occasion the electors suffered from a form of temporary insanity. The sooner the people have an opportunity to return to power a government with a truly Australian outlook to correct the wrongs committed by the present anti-Australian Government represented on the other side of the world by an anti-Australian Resident Minister ber may not apply the term "" anti-Australia]!

I feel sure, also, that -if the people had an opportunity to express their views on this subject, they would be overwhelmingly in favour of the appointment, because they know that, by his ability, courage and diplomacy, he would be able to carry through entrusted to him. The majority of honourable members will agree that no member of this House could better discharge the responsible duties which will fall to the lot of the right honourable member for Flinders while in London. I rarely take notice of the interjections of the honourable member Sydney( Mr Ward), or, for that matter, of the interjections of other members of the group to which he belongs. They represent only about 5 per cent, of the electors of this country, and are remarkable more for the noisy expression of views than for common sense in its application to the practical affairs of everyday life. I strongly deprecate the unfair attack made by members of this group this evening upon the right honourable member for Flinders, who has given such sterling service to this country, and is destined to render still greater service during the next few years. The overwhelming majority by which the bill will be carried will truly reflect the estimatidn in which the right honourable gentleman is . held by the people of Australia. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Parkhill) did not deal with the merits a defence of the appointment of the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) to an entirely new position created by this Government. It is not my intention to say anything about the right honourable gentleman who, for the next year or two, is to be Resident Minister for the Commonwealth in London; but I do not share the views of the Minister for the Interior, who has just treated the Apparently, honourable members House' to an idolatrous panegyric of his Cabinet colleague, and I may add that his opinion is not endorsed by a considerable number of people in this country. This is not because tkey have any personal animus against him, but simply because their conception of Australian sentiment is not his. The Minister for the Interior deprecated the personalities which, he said, had been indulged iu by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) ; but, apart from criticism that is personal or offensive, tlie projected appointment by this Government, of a Resident Minister in London is a fit subject for criticism. The Minister for successfully any mission the Interior deplored any criticism of the right honourable member for Flinders, but in his own references to the honourable member for East Sydney he said things of an offensive character such as, so far as my knowledge goes, have not been said by any other member of this House. upon to withdraw. honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) to explain his statement that the Minister for the Interior made offensive remarks concerning another honourable member, and was not reprimanded by the Chair. remark of the Minister for the Interior concerning the anti-Australian outlook of the right honourable member for",49,Earle Page Sinc E The Commissioner Will Warrant The Sending

General( Mr Latham) in support of the bill to-day, said that the appointment of the right honourable member for Flinders was made because of his financial ability and prestige. The Minister emphasized the latter point, and suggested that the right houorable gentleman had been selected for the position because of his wide knowledge of the financial problems which confront Australia. I , and other honourable members on this side, take the view that we need to cultivate an Australian sentiment, not necessarily in antagonism to Great Britain, but because our trade interests need special attention. The Ottawa Conference decisions reveal the fact that wo must be prepared to fight for the preservation of our trade interests, just as the British delegates at Ottawa fought for the trade interests of the Mother Country. The renvesentotive in Great. Britain of White TIous"" does not sink his individuality as an American citizen. He does not pose as an Englishman, in order to make himself acceptable to the people of Great Britain. They know that he comes to them as a plain American, representing the views of the Government of the United States of ""America, and does not deem it necessary to go to the court of St. James in court dress. That, I suggest, is the spirit which the representative of Australia should emulate in the Mother Country. I am opposed to the bill, because such an appointment has never been found necessary before, and because the Ministry has advanced no sound reason why it should be made. The other dominions have not taken similar action. The Dominion of Canada, which lies closer to the heart of the Empire, and could more readily spare a Minister fov a few months, has not deemed it necessary to have a Besident Minister in London. The Government's proposal is a departure from established precedent. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) made a strong point when he urged that the electorate represented by the right honto be considered iu this matter. Personally, I have nothing against the right honourable gentleman, but I entirely differ from him on political matters, and I share the view of the honourable member for New England that the electors concerned should have been consulted. The right honourable gentleman conducted his campaign from abroad to a large extent, and I feel sure that had the electors been told that, within a comparatively short time of his election he would be sent as Besident Minister in London fov a. period of two years, he would not have been returned. Mr Collins, the Official Secretary of Australia House, was appointed by the Government led by the right honourable member for Flinders, and is well equipped to carry through successfully any loan conversion operations that may be deemed necessary. The new Besident Minister will be obliged to wait until the London market is favorable, just as Mr Collins would have to wait, had he been entrusted with the mission. Some time ago, it was anticipated that loan conversions on a large scale would take place.

He cannot do this job better than it could be done by Mr Collins, and, as the proposed appointment involves an entirely new departure, something without precedent in Australia or in any other portion of the Empire, the Government will have to support it with stronger reasons than have yet been given to this House before it will be approved by the people. Even the Attorney-General( Mr reduce appreciably the interest payable Latham) has stated that he regards the proposed appointment as an experiment. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) declared that he has advocated for years the appointment of a Besident Minister in London. He has also advocated for years, without result, the creation of new States, and, apparently, will continue to do. so for many more years.

Without this legislation he can still take charge of the staff while he is in London, but I hope he will not remain abroad for more than a few months, because the present Ministry is not over-rich in ability, and if the right honourable member for Flinders is as capable as his friends have declared during this debate, his right place is in Australia.

At the outset I wish to nail the oft-repeated lie that the right honourable member for Flinders was educated abroad and has no sympathy for Australia. He was born in Australia and received his school education here. At the outbreak of war he was in England completing his education, and in order to avoid the loss of time that would be involved in returning to the Commonwealth to join up with the Australian Expeditionary Force, he enlisted in a British regiment, and while serving with it was gravely wounded. This bill has been introduced at an opportune, time. Australia has experienced two years of serious depression, but now, because governments are restoring the country to a firm financial footing, our credit overseas is so improved that an opportunity presents itself to on the external public debt. If Australians are true to themselves, the New South Wales loan of £13,000,000, which will fall due in a few weeks, will probably be converted at a lower rate of interest, which will represent a saving of between £150,000 and £160,000 a year. I remind the House that large loans are not converted by merely publishing a notification in a newspaper. Careful negotiations are necessary between the financial houses and the representatives of the borrowing dominion. The doors of banks aud other financial institutions are strongly guarded, and do not open to ment of Mr Collins, who has given extraordinarily good service to Australia, but he has not access to those financial circles in which it is necessary to explain Australia's present situation and its prospects. A favorable impression in those circles is essential if we are to effect a conversion upon satisfactory conditions.

Whatever may be done for us by our representative in London, our fate will be more or less in our own hands. If we make fools of ourselves and follow false prophets who would lead us to destruction, we shall not satisfactorily convert the overseas debt and reduce our interest bill. On us alone the success of the impending transactions depends, and our mouthpiece will be the Resident Minister in London. His appointment has been described as a political plum. Having been very closely associated with him prior to his departure from Australia, I am able to say definitely that he did not desire to go abroad, but went from a sense of public duty. operative for two years does not necessarily mean that the right honourable member for Flinders will remain abroad for that period.

I predict that future Mr Collins, whom I generations will proudly refer to the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) as a great Australian. Other public men of the past have been subjected to similar criticism and attack, but to-day we honour them for their loyalty to principle, their integrity, and their wisdom. Far too much debate has taken place on a comparatively simple proposal. It is true that no appointment of the nature now proposed was ever previously made in Australia, but the present financial situation is without precedent in Australian history. I have been recollecting the cabled correspondence between the then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) when he was in Loudon and his colleagues in Australia in connection with the proposal of the then Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to issue a fiduciary currency. Message after message came from the right honourable gentleman to warn Cabinet that if this proposal were perThe fact that this bill may be sisted in, onr credit in London would be destroyed and Australia would be unable to meet its obligations.

If any commercial concern had an important mission to accomplish, would it not select for the purhonorable member for East Sydney( Mr pose a person who was acceptable everywhere, and who thoroughly understood the business? In this case the Government is not incurring additional expenditure. I differ from those who say that the right honourable member for Flinders is in any way anti-Australian. I have sat in the Commonwealth Parliament for as long a period as the right honourable gentleman, and can say of him that I have not met one whose integrity or chivalry was higher than his. I , as an Australian, am glad to have been associated with an Australian of his type. I believe! that he will render inestimable service to the Commonwealth, and that in no sense will he let Australia down. I cannot understand how the idea has occurred to the minds of some persons that, the right honourable gentleman was an ti-Australian a,t Ottawa. I should have been pleased had he given way a little more to the Mother Country in order to obtain for Australia a greater measure of reciprocity. Much has been said regarding the necessity for saving money. If we were to calculate the cost involved in the discussion of this matter, we would realize how much could have been saved had it been debated on its merits. right honourable member for Flinders( Mr land ( Mr Paterson) this afternoon deBruce) ought to feel flattered at the attenlivered an excellent speech, probably the tion that has been paid to him during the course of this debate. Most of the speeches have been purely partisan, and those who have opposed the proposal of the Government have made out a very poor case. The point has been made that this is a departure from established practice. I remind honourable members, however, that the subject was discussed at the Imperial Conference that was held in 1925 or 1926, when it was decided that, in the near future, each of the governments there represented should have a Besident Minister in London. I am in favour of this step, because I believe that one who has had experience in the Cabinet must have a thorough grasp of Australian affairs. Australia is the first of the dominions to take this step, and I believe that, in thus acting, we are serving the best interests of the Commonwealth. The Ward) has decried the right honourable member for Flinders; but I consider that he is the right man in the right place, and I hope that he will continue to work on Australia's behalf in London for some time to come. One of his first duties will be to arrange for the conversion of the New South Wales £13,000,000 loan, and I feel confident that he will bring that operation to a successful issue. [9.40] I regret that the tone of this debate has been so considerably lowered since it was initiated. I cannot find in the bill any reference to either the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), or any other person. I hope that the personal element will be kept out of the discussion. In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), may I point but that he did not oppose Mr Bruce's remaining in London for the period necessary to complete the pending loan conversion; but, as a matter of fact, suggested that that was a wise course to adopt. The real principle has been cleverly side-tracked by some of the professional debaters in the House who, as the Minister has pointed out, have put up a straw man merely for the purpose of knocking it down. The honourable member for Gippsmost logical to which we have listened; but he made it on wrong premises, because he focussed attention on the wisdom of allowing a Minister to remain in London until the loan conversion operation was completed. Not a single member has opposed that. I have listened to every speaker, and have not heard one object to the right honourable member for Flinders remaining in London for the purpose of effecting a reduction in the interest on our overseas indebtedness. My only complaint is that that problem was not tackled long ago. I have accidentally come across a speech that was delivered in the House of Commons in April last by Sir Bobert Home. He",53,Parkhill Wha T I Orable Member For Flinders Had A Right

House of Commons that Australia could -not possibly meet her obligations if Englqnd remained any longer on the gold -standard, and said that it was almost -criminal to suggest that the smaller countries, the new countries, the primary producing countries, including Australia, should be expected to meet their obligations unless prices were increased, and there was a departure from the almost criminal practice of making debtor countries pay twice as much as they borrowed. He further .said that instead of the people of Great Britain taking a hostile view of a suggestion by Australia that repayment of loans should be postponed or that interest * rates should be lowered, they almost welcomed such overtures. Yet this matter has been held up here because of party political differences, and meanwhile, Australia has been suffering. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that . the right honourable member for Flinders should be allowed to complete the pending loan conversion; hut I and the Opposition as a body are opposed to the principle of having a Minister resident consider, is an honest attitude to adopt. [, and the school of thought to which I belong, believe that there is danger in Australia being governed according to expert outside advice. We are suffering to-day as a result of the acceptance of the advice of supposed experts who have visited Australia during the last four or five years. and many also is suffering as a consequence of the acceptance of the advice of financial experts, particularly in Great Britain. three or four years ago is now obsolete in Great Britain, and is entirely contrary to the opinions of the experts of to-day. T object to the way in which the debate has been conducted. It has been turned to new premises altogether. The Opposition has been charged with being opposed to the loan conversion operations. Honourable members supporting the Governor. Holloway. ment have even pointed out the amount of money that would be saved by these operations, as if the Opposition were all centred upon not allowing the Minister to remain in London to carry on that work. Actually We are opposed to this bill because we think that by allowing a Commonwealth Minister to be permanently resident in Loudon, we shall add to the danger of this country being controlled from overseas. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.46] -With the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), I deplore the tone that, has crept into this debate. It seems to me that we should endeavour to help Australia in this time of depression, not only by giving due consideration to the problems that beset, us but also by aiding the Resident, Minister in London to arrange a successful conversion loan. The tone that has been adopted in this debate may considerably embarrass the conversion of that loan, because, instead of the Resident Minister receiving the wholehearted support of this House in his efforts-to secure the conversion of the loan, accusations are being levelled at him by the Opposition that will embarrass him. Notwithstanding the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that no objection is permanently being taken to the proposal that the Resiin London. That, I dent Minister should remain in London until such time as the conversion is accomplished, some honourable members object, to the appointment of a Resident Minister in London at all.

The general tone of the speeches from the Opposition suggest that in tlieir opinion .he has an. anti-Australian outlook, but I , for one, certainly prefer the outlook of -.the right honourable member for Flinders to that of ""members of the Lang party who represent a group of persons who have no claim at all to be considered as Australians.

Had he no other qualification than the fact that he was instrumental in bringing about the fall of the Lang Government, it would be sufficient to establish his status in the eyes of oversea financiers. The members of the-Opposit ion have professed to show great consideration for the constituents of the right honourable member for Flinders, whom, they say, are likely to be disfranchised while he remains overseas. Let me suggest that they should rather watch their interests in their own constituencies, because their positions in this House may, in the near future, be seriously jeopardized, because of the attempts they have made by mischievous statements to prevent the successful conversion of the loan. support the bill. At no time since the war has it been so necessary as it is to-day should be eligible for such a position until to have a responsible Minister resident in London. The confidence of oversea investors in Australia is being gradually restored. In November, loans amounting to £13j000,000 have to be converted. Some heavy loans are maturing next year, and there is the probability of a big conversion taking place. We could not have chosen any more suitable person for the position of Resident Minister in London than the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Brace). I cannot understand the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who has contended that the work of conversion should be left entirely to Mr Collins, our principal officer in London. What would the Opposition have to say if the Government failed to ensure the success of the conversion loan by neglecting to send a capable representative overseas? sion should be left entirely in the hands of Mr Collins. Opposition said that this matter could well be left in thehands of Mr Collins, and that there was no necessity for this appointment. I have nothing but contempt for honourable members who have attacked the right honourable member for Flinders. I am entirely opposed to the permanent appointment of a Minister in London. That would hardly be a wise procedure, in view of the great distance to the Old Country. If I thought that the object of the Government was to make this position jiernianent, I should protest against the bill, but I do not believe that that is the desire of the Government. I hope that, in the near future, the Besident Minister in London, will be able to make such financial arrangements there as will permit him to return to this country. We should not appoint a politician to the position of High Commissioner. We must encourage trade and business enterprise. Instead of appointing some one from our political ranks, we should appoint a business man who would be able to inspire confidence in the British commercial world, and to stimulate our trading relations with Great Britain and Europe in general. I should like embodied in the bill a provision to the effect that no member of Parliament at least eighteen months after he had ceased to be a member. We can best build up our-export trade by appointing the most suitable representative overseas. I hope that the Government will give consideration to my suggestion, particularly in respect to, not only the High Cornmissionership, but also to appointments to the High Court.

I am not very much concerned about sending a Resident Minister to London to enable him to become better acquainted with foreign policy. from the countries which breed international difficulties the better for Australia. to the intrigues of Europe out sending Ministers abroad in an endeavour to participate in them. One argument used in the debate is that because we have always had a High Commissioner, we should appoint' either a High Commissioner or a Resident Minister in London. It has also been argued by the supporters of the bill that this position has always been filled by a political deadrate of interest on our overseas debt. Honhead. Evidently, past governments have appointed political dead-heads to this position in London in the belief that they would adequately represent Australia. Yet it is now claimed that we must send a first-class Minister abroad to take up the cudgels on behalf of the people of Australia. doubt that the right honourable member for Flinders is a capable Minister. The right honourable member for Flinders overshadows every other member of the Ministry. It was evident while he was in Australia that he dominated the Cabinet and the party of which he is a member. I have not the slightest doubt that when he is abroad he will also continue to domifrom the people. nate the Government, and that the real Government of the Commonwealth will be transferred from Australia to England. The question of whether it will be difficult to convert Australia's overseas indebtedness is one on which there appears to be a difference of opinion. Our overseas indebtedness will be converted regardless of whether the right honourable member for Flinders is or is not in London. The time is rapidly approaching when overseas bondholders will have no alternative but to agree to a conversion of their holdings at reduced rates of Mr Rosevear. interest. There is nothing extraordinary associated with the conversion of loans. There have been two remarkable instances of successful conversions since the termination of the war. The conversion of Great Britain's Avar debt to the United the assistance of a resident minister in Washington. That conversion Avas effected not because America's regard for the mighty dollar had lessened, but because America's capitalists realized The further we keep away that Great Britain could not continue to pay the interest that was then being charged. For precisely the same reason We are quite close enough the Government of this country forced witha conversion loan upon local bondholders, but at the same time it alloAA'ed the overseas -bondholders to go scot-free. Eighteen months ago Ave advocated a policy of interest reduction Avhich honourable members opposite denounced, but which this Government now supports. We realizedit Avas impossible to continue to pay the present orable members opposite who called it repudiation at that time now have to admit that a conversion is absolutely necessary if Australia is to carry on. If our suggestions had been adopted eighteen months ago the amount representing the difference between, our revenue There is not the slightest and our interest payments would have been sufficient to provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of our unfortunate fellowmen who are now walking the streets in search of Avork. The policy of this Government has led it into difficulties, and it is now endeavouring to recover its position by demanding further sacrifices The overseas bondholders, as well as the Government, realize the actual position. The serA'ices of a High Commissioner, a Besident Minister, or any other representative in London, Avill not be needed to bring about conversion of our overseas indebtedness. Our loans will be converted; there is no doubt about that. The rates of interest may not be at the figure that the GoAernr ment desires, but they will be governed by what the bondholders consider is the country's capacity to pay, as was the case in the conversion of Great Britain's war debt to America. The rates eventually fixed will be such that the people of Australia will have to keep their nose to the grindstone for many years to come. The Government, which is now forced to face the facts, should have done what is now proposed eighteen months ago. A reduction in overseas interest will be one of the remain in London for two years if there greatest factors in solving Australia's present difficulties. There is no need to appoint a Resident Minister in Loudon to arrange a conversion; the bondholders will be forced to convert, but it will be at a figure closely approximating the country's capacity to pay. [10.5] -It is not my intention to prolong the debate by repeating the arguments that have been advanced, by some honourable members opposite; but their bitter references to the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), who, they presume, is to be appointed Besident Minister in London under this bill, cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. I feel quite sure that honourable members opposite do not really believe half of what they have said concerning the right honourable member. Bather do they recognize his ability, value and influence; it is their fear of him politically extend our trade, confer with the reprethat has impelled them to make the statements they have made. They are anxious to harass the Government of which he is a member, and to endeavour to destroy his influence and power, which have been of great value to Australia. For party political reasons they have attempted to belittle the right honourable member in the eyes of Australians. The bill is to amend the High Commissioner's Act, hy making provision for the appointment in Great Britain of a Minister or a commissioner authorized by the Executive Council or the Governor General. It does not provide that the functions of the Besident Minister shall be confined to converting our overseas indebtedness; but it is apparent that one of his most important duties will be the handling of a big conversion loan. I contend that there is no one in Australia more likely to secure a better hearing from Great Britain's financiers than the right honourable member for Flinders in his efforts to convert Australia's overseas €580,000,000. It has been suggested by honourable members opposite that all the work needed could be completed within one year, and that there is uo necessity to appoint a Minister for two years. There is nothing in the bill tocompel the Minister appointed to is not sufficient for him to do; but, in view of the highly important duties which he will have to perform, the term provided is not unreasonable. The Besident Minister is to act as High Commissioner, andinthat capacity will be expected to use his ability in increasing trade between Great Britain and Australia. London is still the financial and commercial centre of the world,* notwithstanding that other countries have much larger populations. Every nation of any importance has its ambassador in London, and it is with these that our Minister will confer with a view to securing new treaties and new markets for the products of our primary industries. The United States of America is represented in London by an ex-Treasurer, and it is only right that the Commonwealth should have the most able representative in Great Britain for at least the term provided in ' the bill. Such a representative can negotiate treaties, sentatives of other nations, and generally act in the interests of the Australian people. I am sure that whether the duties which fall upon the shoulders' of the right honourable member for Flinders relate to the conversion of our overseas indebtedness, the carrying out of services usually rendered hy the High Commissioner, or the negotiating of trade agreements, they will be discharged with dignity and honour to himself and with credit and benefit to Australia. All who are prepared to give honour where honour is due will admit that the right honorable member for Flinders has, throughout his public life, endeavoured to do the best he could for Australia, and has rendered this country invaluable service. It has been argued that the appointment should not be made, because it"" will mean that the electors of Flinders would be left without parliamentary representation. I consider, however, that these debt ' of approximately electors are being honoured in the highest degree, for no other honourable member of this Parliament will be entrusted",56,Parkhill Wha T I Orable Member For Flinders Had A Right
223,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"with such important aud responsible duties in relation to-our financial and commercial operations. I believe that the electors of Flinders will realize this, and will be proud that their representative has been honoured by appointment as the Resident Minister in London. 1 am interested to learn that the right houorable member for Flinders( Mr satisfactorily. Money, like every other Bruce) has already been selected as Resident Minister in London. I thought that perhaps the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who .represented this country abroad in the critical years between 1914 and 1918, might have been chosen. hoped that the right honourable member for Flinders will live up to the high hopes that have been expressed in relation to him this evening. Australia has, in the past, borrowed heavily abroad. overseas indebtedness considerably exceeds £500,000,000. It was not necessary to appoint, a Resident Minister overseas to raise this money. Australia, in the past, has been able to borrow money as and when she desired it at the market rates. In the last year or two, we have had a financial expert abroad to watch the interests of the Commonwealth. Mr Collins, who formerly filled the chief position in the Commonwealth Treasury, is a financial adviser to the Government. appointed overseas, and given the duty of watching Australia's interests in regard to conversion operations and other financial transactions, it would appear to be unnecessary to keep Mr Collins there. continue to advise the Commonwealth Government in financial matters after the right honourable member for Flinders assumes his new duties? honourable gentleman, we are told, has the facts of our financial business at his finger tips, and is a financial expert of the highest calibre. fore, that we shall not duplicate services by allowing Mr Collins to remain in London while Mr Bruce is doing the work. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr this connection. Expenditure is also inSfiiUin) said this afternoon that he was opposed to the principle of the appointment of a Resident Minister overseas. It was then said that it would not be necessary for the right honourable member for Flinders to remain in London until the last document had been signed. What loans will have to be converted this financial year? We know that £13,000,000, borrowed by New South Wales will have to be converted, but this State, and other States as well, have, in the past, conducted their own conversion operations commodity, is available at market rates, independent of the personality, pleasing mannerisms, or method of approach, of individuals. In fact, a man who can tell the best story is, by common consent, the one who needs watching most careI t is to be fully, for he is the most dangerous. The straightforward honest man usually has a definite proposition to submit to his creditors. Men who have no such proposition have need to tell a good story. OutThese are usually the people who, to use an Australian phrase, ""bite you."" Australia will, doubtless, be able to get what money she needs at market rates at the time the conversion has to be effected. We well remember that in 1920, the Queensland Government found it necessary to convert two loans, one of £12,000,000, and the other of £10,000,000, but the Commonwealth Nationalist Government did its utmost to render conversion operations impossible unless the Queensland Government undertook to If a Resident Minister is grant an extension of leases to certain pastoral lessees. Is it now proposed that the Resident Minister in London shall be in a position to barter? Will the Nivison Group also There would have been very little discussion on this bill had the Prime Minister given us sufficient information when he introduced it. All he said was that This right the appointment was to be made for two years, but might be extended. We know very well that once a new principle is established it is very difficult to abrogate I hope, thereit. Whenever appointments such .as that now contemplated are made, the appointee takes all possible steps to consolidate his position. Usually, he begins by building up a big staff around him. There are already indications of that in curred in regard to housing, and that, too, has happened in this case. At a time like this, when .the country is taxed",58,Parkhill Wha T I Orable Member For Flinders Had A Right
224,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.12],"to the utmost, aud the call is for economy, ministerial rank. Surely there is some we should economize at the top. If we cut the roots of a tree often enough, we shall destroy the tree, whereas by lopoutstanding ability, why did the United ping its branches we improve it. When I recall that loans amounting to over £500,000,000 have to. be converted overseas,"" I am reminded that not many months ago a voluntary conversion took place in Australia. It was, however, voluntary only in name, because those who did not convert their holdings voluntarily were compelled to do so. The Australian bondholder, as well as the man who fought in the Great War, has made his sacrifice. The London money market is improving, and to-day money is cheaper than it has been for some time. Other countries are obtaining loans at low rates of interest, and Australia, which has been a good customer of Great Britain, and has met all its obligations in the past, can look forward to renewing its loans at the ruling rate of interest. Since money lenders are not renowned for lending money for reasons of sympathy, the Resident Minister in London will have to barter with them in the same way that he and his colleagues bartered at Ottawa by giving away Australia's -industries. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr others. I am not deceived by these words Prowse) regretted that we did not give away more at Ottawa than we did. Our export trade in mutton has been limited by the Ottawa agreement to such an extent that Australia is in a"" more unfavorable position than before. What has this country received as a result of the Ottawa Conference? because the country will have to foot the bill. with the bill? to do with the appointment of a Resident Minister overseas. The right honourable member for Flinders, whom I recognize is an outstanding personality, although in London, will continue to dictate the policy of this country. But he in turn will have to submit to dictation by those who dictated the policy agreed to at Ottawa. The gentleman who will control our destiny did not enjoy the confidence of his party sufficiently to obtain full inconsistency opposite. If the right honourable member for Flinders has such Australia party first place him in a subordinate position, and then, at the first opportunity, shanghai him overseas? I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) say that he would look after the electors in the Flinders electorate during the absence of their representative. In order to serve the interests of Flinders, the honourable member is prepared to neglect the interests of Bendigo. Were he really concerned about the best interests of the people whom he represents, he would fight for the continuation of the gold bounty, with a view to reviving the gold-mining industry in his district. In my opinion, the principle of government from London ia bad, but if it is necessary to have a Resident Minister in Britain, why not have one also iu Japan, and China, and, indeed, in every country with which we do business? What has beeu said to-day about the right honourable member for Flinders has been said in the past of Sir Granville Ryrie, Mr Andrew Fisher, Sir Joseph Cook, Mr Devereux, and of praise. Australia .should be represented in Britain, not by politicians, but by men trained in the commercial world. Half a dozen commercial travellers in London would do more good for Australia than could be achieved hy the same number of politicians, who would only pile up expenses. ciate myself with those who have expressed their opposition to this bill! The House has been given scanty information as to the purpose of the measure. If honourable members on this side have criticized the qualifications of the gentleman whom it is suggested shall carry out the duties of High Commissioner, the responsibility lies with the Government, which appears to be basing its case upon the abilities of the suggested appointee. While Prime Minister of Australia he showed remarkable ability in concealing the fact that he possessed any. The chief memory that we have of him is that he took over from the Hughes Government a surplus in the vicinity of £7,000,000",59,Parkhill Wha T I Orable Member For Flinders Had A Right

Another reason which probably actuates the Government in this appointment is that the position of the Prime Minister is similar to that of the individual mentioned in Pope's poem, who, like the Turk, could "" bear no brother near the throne"". In this instance, it also suits the right honourable member for Flinders. On the one hand, it removes a dangerous rival, and on the other it enables the person concerned to pay a good deal of attention to his private business overseas. member be fair? quote from a journal which cannot be accused of being unsympathetically disposed towards the Nationalist member for Flinders or the Nationalist party. My reading is from the Melbourne Argus of the 23rd December, 1931, and is as f o l lows :It is possible tliat Mr Bruce, notwithstanding his long experience both as Prime Minister and Treasurer and his prestige overseas, will not be a member of the Ministry at all. Mr Bruce, who is now returning to Australia from a trip to England, has his hands filled with the affairs of the business of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, which he has again taken up since his temporary retirement from politics. It is questionable whether he will be able to spare the time to attend to the administration of an important public department. That appeared at a time when there was considerable discussion regarding the possible personnel of the new federal ministry. The quotation indicates that that gentleman was more concerned at the time about his own commercial affairs than about the affairs of the nation. that writtten ? a newspaper which is a strong supporter of the present Government. It may be interesting to see how f a r the principle contained in the bill conflicts w i th the H i g h Commissioner Act 1909, which it is intended to amend. Section7 of that act reads_A person appointed to be the High Commissioner shall not during his tenure of office be or act as director or agent of or hold any office in any company or syndicate whether incorporated' or unincorporated or hold any other employment, or engage in any business whether within or without tlie Commonwealth. That section is not being repealed by this bill. Though nominally the right honourable member for Flinders is to become Resident Ministeri n London, he will at the same time perform the duties of H i g h Commissioner. That is in direct conflict with the provisions of section 7 of the principal act. Apparently, the Government has not yet considered thai point. the honourable member make his remarks W h y cannot the honourable relevant? member for Flinders, who is a director of a company, is to carry out the duties of H i g h Commissioner. that the right honourable member was a director of a company? ties of the past six months, and previously, that is evident. orable member does not know the right honourable gentleman's private busineSs. have referred should have been considered by the Government before it introduced the bill .

I move the following amendment:That the words "" two years"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" six months "". The supporters of this bill have argued that the main purpose of appointing a Resident Minister in London is to effect the conversion of our overseas debt. If we accept that argument, we take leave to point out that, unless this conversion is carried through within six months, Australia's finances w ill be in a very sorry plight. The taxpayers cannot continue 42 interest.

No reason has been.given for extending the period to two years. the amendment is designed to weaken the proposition before the committee, it meets with my approval, but I wish to make it clear that while I vote for the amendment, I do not accept the principle of the bill even to the extent of six months. I prefer to vote straight out against each clause, but if the amendment goes to a division, I shall vote for it as being the lesser of two evils. I cannot oppose the amendment. That would be tantamount to accepting a longer term. On the other hand, to vote for the amendment is tantamount to a declaration that it is necessary to have a Resident Minister in London with these powers for six months. That, I dispute. The arguments advanced about the loan conversion are to a large extent a subterfuge. I do not dispute the importance of that work, and the need for a Minister to be in London while it is being done has never been challenged by any one on this side of this chamber, at any rate not by me. How could I challenge it in view of the importance of the conversion operations ? I must agree with the mission now being undertaken, even if a Minister has to remain in London longer than six months. think he need stay longer than six months.

271,Mr Baker (Oxley) [11.17],"If thisreading of the bill, ha expressed tbe opinion that the appointment 'should be t'or a longer period than two years; that, in fact, it should be approved as a principle. This bill is a violation of the spirit Dein, A. K. of the act of 1909, which it seeks to amend. chat, if the act were so construed as to render the right honourable member for flinders ineligible, it might also be suggested that it should apply to.al l members of Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Constitution does restrict members of Parliament by preventing them from holding an office of profit under the Crown, and provides, further, that no member shall be absent from a session of the Parliament for more than two months without leave. Certainly it was never contemplated that legislation would have to be introduced to provide for such a position as has now arisen. Evidently those who framed the original act thought that a definite restriction should be imposed upon the business activities of any person occupying the position ofHigh Commissioner. mere transfer of the duties of H i g h Commissioner to a Besident Minister does not alter the principle laid down in section 7 or reduce the opportunities of the occupant of the office to further the interests of any fir m with which he is itonnected. The suggestion earlier in the debate, that some personal advantage might accrue to a representative of m important firm holding this office, was ridiculed. It is apparent, however, that great care was taken in the framing of this clause, because the Government realized that the principle contained in section 7 must be violated if the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) were to occupy the office of High Commissioner, while retaining his connection with a private .business firm. For that reason I shall rote against the clause. Question^-That clause 3 be agreed to -put . The committee divided. (CHAIRMAN-MB . BELL.) Noes 16 Majority Ana. Blacklow, A. C.
