It , however, accepts-and I am sure that the country, too, does-the general principle and structure of the regulations as being indispensable to the total mobilization of this country in order to meet the circumstances that now confront it. The Government is quite ready to have the regulations examined by a special committee representative of both Houses and of all the parties in the Parliament. Leader of the Opposition) -by leaveThe Opposition is very pleased that the Government is agreeable to an examination of the regulations by a special committee, because it believes that it would be unwise to allow Part3 of Statutory Rule, No. 76, to remain in its present form, as it would have damaging and disadvantageous effects upon our war effort. In principle, the regulations are similar to those promulgated successively hy the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) and myself, as Prime Minister, inasmuch we enforced restrictions in order to prevent the diversion of money from the war necessities of the desire to nation. We consider, however, that in these regulations the. Government has gone too far and has acted too harshly.

51,Mr Brennan (Batman) [3.35],"I ndo other in tlie present set of circumstances than acquiesce in the motion, hut I must express some disappointment that a motion of this kind should be sprung upon us for the first time on the meeting of the Parliament. Members come long distances to assemble in this Parliament, and it is their duty to do so. long distances, too. not come to this Parliament, and I verily believe that they w ill never interfere with the functions of this Parliament. But that is by the way. There are matters which might .be discussed with advantage by members of Parliament, even in the exceptional circumstances will largely engage the attention of the Prime Minister and, it may be, other Ministers. A f t e r all, though the Government is the selected instrument responsible to Parliament, it is not the Parliament; and with the Parliament, as such, remains the duty of consultation upon matters which Ministers think it right to bring before the Parliament. I take this opportunity to say that my own view is that in these times of great, anxiety every elector of every party is entitled to feel that he has a representative or almost daily, at least for a short period, in the Parliament, and who is, therefore, in consultation with his fellow members and in consultation also, either formally or informally, with members of the Government,, aud that .members of the Government have the advantage of the advice and suggestions, and, possibly, personal information, which may be available, and normally is available, to the rank and file of the Parliament. This is due also, because great responsibility rests upon the Government at the moment, and it is not sufficient that Ministers work laboriously and with intelligence, as they do, at their allotted tasks; it is desirable also that they have the support of and consultation with individual members. In that way Parliament, as a democratic institution, should be in constant touch with tliose who make Parliament and are its masters, as Parliament is the master of the Government. There are matter? whicli, I suggest, could well have been discussed by this Parliament. Some have been mentioned to-day-regulations , for instance. If this Parliament had been meeting regularly, even for brief periods, certain regulations which now have the effect of law would not have been allowed to have such effect. Wo intelligent honorT h e Japanese travel able member on either side of the House would have allowed that to happen had the way been open for h i m to prevent it. We must never, for one moment, whether we be supporters of the Government or members of the Opposition, lose our sense of responsibility for the examination, with the utmost care, of regulations; especially at a time when regulations which niu -t necessarily be given tbe effect of law rapidly, and with very little time for consideration and, consequently, with very little consideration. Because of the need for the careful examination of regulations T suggest that Parliament s'hould sit more regularly. I do not oppose this motion as Ihe Prime Minister has stated that it is important that it should be agreed to. He is the head of the Government, and must have the final decision in such matters. Leader of the Opposition) [3.41] -The who meets daily, Opposition thoroughly concurs in the decision made by the Prime Minister, and it is willing that the Houso shall adjourn to-day till Thursday of next week. It recognizes, of course, that in consequence of this adjournment honourable members will not have the opportunity of a three-day debate, but its view is that the loss of three days of debate is preferable to the loss of three minutes of war preparation. Consequently we are whole-heartedly behind the Prime to the Government, Minister in this matter. entirely agree that, for the purposes outlined by the Prime Minister, it is necessary that the House shall adjourn to-day. I wish, however, to indicate that I expect more satisfaction than has so far been given concerning the rather cavalier manner i u which honourable members are being treated in relation to the distribution of regulations, a matter to which the honourable member for Batman refuvved.

55,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [3.42],"1the supporters of the present Government were sitting in Opposition they demanded frequent meetings of the Parliament. We metaphorically tore the walls down beccuse the Government of the day was governing by regulation. We are still being governed by regulation, and at an accelerated pace, but with this difference, that last year honourable members were being supplied with copies of regulations before information concerning them appeared in the press. The procedure at present seems to he to cause garbled statements of the effect of regulations to be published in the press, and to oblige honourable members to come back to Canberra in order to obtain copies of the regulations. We have to come back here in order to know, what has been going on, for mouths, under regulations. challenge truthful contradiction of my statement that, unless other honourable members have been treated differently from myself-anc l I do not think that they have been treated differently-the y have not had any regulations sent on to them since the Parliament adjourned in the middle of last December. Copies of newly issued regulations were formerly forwarded to the postal addresses of honourable members, but since last December each honourable member's correspondence box in this House has been stuffed with sufficient regulations to fill a sugar bag. honourable member who supports the GoWe speak of these publications as regulations, but really they are the laws under which people are being governed to-day. I have had responsible members of organizations, and also private citizens, inquire from me concerning the effect of certaiu regulations, but I had not seen the regulations for my copies had not been sent on to me. I hope that the Prime Minister will see that whoever has been responsible for stopping the forwarding of tbe regulations to honourable members shall be dealt with appropriately, and that, in the future, all copies of regulanot indicate that time would be made tions addressed to honourable members shall be forwarded promptly to their private address and not he allowed to accumulate in lockers in Parliament House. not oppose the motion, but I wish to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear). At no time in the history of Australia, not excepting the period of the last war, have regulations been issued-man y of them properly issued-of greater consequence to the ordinary citizens, and in greater number, than at present. They are necessary in order to meet war conditions. Yet, by some extraordinary combination of circumstances, copies of them have not been forwarded to honourable members. This is the first time in my experience as a member of this Parliament that copies of regulations addressed to me at Parliament House have not been forwarded to my private address when Parliament has been in recess. Had it not been for my attendance at Canberra a. couple of weeks ago in order to attend the meeting of the Opposition Executive, I should not have seen a copy of a single regulation issued since the end of last year, although in that time numerous regulations have been issued which vitally affect private rights and the liberty of the subject. the Government that these were not forwarded. Inquiry should be made of the clerk whose duty it was to forward them. ascertain who is to blame, but whoever is responsible should be dealt with. I am merely corroborating facts stated by an vernment. On the broader issue of future meetings of the House, I understand that it is proposed that honourable members shall re-assemble for two or three days next week, and that Parliament shall then go into recess. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) was asked specifically this afternoon whether, in view of the fact that a committee had been appointed to report upon a certain regulation, honourable members would be given an opportunity to discuss the issues involved. His reply was not altogether satisfactory. He did available for such a discussion. The regulation referred to is only one of about a hundred which also have a more or less important bearing upon the everyday life of our fellow citizens. I trust, therefore,",18,Special Adjournment

""When I found that copies of regulations addressed to me were not beiug forwarded to me in the proper manner, I took action, as did the secretary of the Leader of the Opposition. I also purchased a copy of certain regulations from the Sub-Treasury in Brisbane. Other honourable members could have purchased a copy of the particular regulation in question, if necessary. There was no need for any honourable member to wait until he returned to Canberra to peruse copies of regulations. Any honourable gentleman who was deeply interested in the matter could have communicated with the Clerk of Papers at Canberra and asked that any matter addressed to him here should be forwarded to his private address. I am sure that such a request would have been complied with. Prior to the rising of the House on the 17th December last, I directed to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) a question in which I specifically asked that the Parliament be not kept in recess for too lengthy a period. I was subjected to some criticism for having dared to ask sueh a question at that time. The Prime Minister replied that, although it had been said that the House would not meet again until the following March, he could not conceive of the circumstances being such that the Parliament would be enabled to remain in recess for so long. Since then we have had disaster after disaster, the major one beiug that tlie whole of one of our divisions is in the hands of the Japanese in Singapore. Other matters of the very grea test moment to this nation ing figures in that debate was the present have arisen; yet this Honse has been kept in recess, and is now asked to remain in recess. main in recess. ment is a useful instrument, or it ought not to meet. The most appropriate time for it to meet is during the greatest emergency in the history of this country. On the 17th December, the Prime Minister admitted to me that he recognized that members of Parliament had the same duties to. perform on behalf of the country as members of the Government had to perform on behalf of the Parliament. Last week we sat in secret meeting for two days. The suggestion was made in many quarters that we ought to have continued sitting on Monday and Tuesday of this week. I have reached the limit of my patience. I affirm very definitely that there is a tremendous feeling of disquiet throughout the country. This Parliament is the proper place for the revelation and discussion of what is in the minds of the people. If our efforts to voice the views of the people are thwarted, democracy has no meaning in war-time. In certain circumstances, I agree, Parliament might abrogate some of its privileges. The circumstances that I visualize would be such as would exist under a government representative of all the parties in this House. There would then be some justification for Parliament not meeting. With one-party government, the majority of the members of the one party occupying some remunerative post in the Government, the time has come when those who represent the Opposition must give expression to what is in their minds; and that can be done most appropriately in the Parliament itself. I trust that when the House meets next week the Prime Minister and the Government will not again attempt to adjourn it for a lengthy period. [3.55] I well remember a Friday morning eighteen months ago, when this House was engaged iu a debate very similar to that in which it is now engaging, the subject being the length of the then proposed adjournment. One of the leadPrime Minister( Mr Curtin), who declared that it was unwise for the Parliament, in time of war, to meet less often than one week in every mouth.

We heard a lot last week, and it is now proposed that we shall adjourn until next week. I do not intend to oppose that proposal, because I can well believe that the Prime Minister would not make it unless there were weighty reasons in support, of it. I endorse the statement of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) that there is abroad in this country to-day a spirit of disquiet, of criticism, of quesof any regulations that were gazetted. tioning, in regard to thc activities of this Since this House rose in December, I Parliament. That has not arisen since the present Government came into power: it has been in existence for quite a while. The manner in which the parliamentary business of this nation has been conducted during the war does not appeal to the electorate. There have been occasions when we could adjourn for a little while. The peopio are drawing very sharp contrasts between the sittings of this Parliament and those of the Parliament of fhe United Kingdom, which is-or was until a few days ago-much closer than we to thc seat of wav. The Houses of Parliament at Westminster have been bombed and blasted to smithereens, yet the House of Commons still meets. Mr Winston Churchill explains, and before which he defends, his policy.

The frequency with which the Prime Minister has made a last appeal to the miners to return to their work reminds nie of Madame Melba's numerous last appearances on the platform. When does the honourable gentleman intend to make his final appeal? We know that there are difficulties on the waterfront, in regard to shipping. A degree of restriction has been imposed upon open criticism of Mr Archie Cam cron. certain measures; at least, we understand so, from a question that was asked by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr his department, subject Spender) this afternoon. Every honourable member desires to assist the Government, if that be possible. We must be shown some consideration. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) has raised a point that I had intended to raise. Last week, upon my return to Canberra, I found my letter box crammed full with regulations. of the honourable member. not. Before this Government came into power, I received through the mail copies have not seen a regulation. Honourable gentlemen who are now Ministers have said on different occasions that if they were in office they would not govern by regulation, because they did not approve of such a practice. few of those who are now in the Ministry. We are entitled to have regulations posted to us. I am quite sure that newspaper proprietors do not regard it as a part of their duty to endeavour to educate me in regard to what the Government proposes to do. Therefore, the information should come to me through official channels. I learned through the press that some It is the authority to .which important regulations had been promulgated, but I did not dream that there was such a huge pile of them as I found here last week. If honourable members There are a few received them through the post, it would be their own fault if they did not acquaint themselves with what they contained. I agree to the proposed adjournment; but from consideration of the regulations, to which some reference has already been made, it is vitally necessary that the House of Representatives shall proceed to a thorough review of the war. I have mentioned the spirit of disquiet that exists in the community. It is a spirit that will not be kept bottled up for very long. It will not be allayed by press advertisements, or be brushed aside by speeches broadcast by Ministers. It cannot be dismissed by the declaration that",20,Special Adjournment

W it h the best will in the world, a goveniment whicli is compelled to issue regulations of this kind must cause public inconvenience and, in some instances, injustice. With that I do not quarrel; it is an inevitable corollary of the greater injustice of war itself. cussions from time to time. MrM c EWEN I agree. I have no doubt that, no matter -what government is in power, opportunity should be provided for discussion. The point I am making is that every endeavour should be made to minimize, as f a r as possible, the inconvenience inherent in this for m of government. The worse effects are produced, in my opinion, by the making of a general announcement, before the regulations themselves are promulgated, that regulations of a certain character are to be issued. Becently, an announcement was made, I think by the Prime Minister( MrC u r t in ), that the Government had decided to bring down, under the National Security Act, regulations for the purpose of limiting busiuess transactions, freezing certain assets, preventing the transfer of property, and mobilizing man-power and national resources. I am prepared to believe that this announcement was made by the Prime Minister for the purpose of letting the public know that the Government was aware of the imminence of the threat to public security, and that it is taking the steps necessary to meet that threat. However, the net results of the announcement, coming as it did before the details of the regulations themselves were known, was to create a doubt in the minds of many people regarding the for m which the regulations were likely to take, and I do not know how it more than one person told me that he had drawn money from the savings bank because of a fear that the Government intended to freeze savings bank deposits. The Government w ill have my support, I have no doubt and, I have no doubt, the support of nearly every other honourable member, in its policy of governing the country by regulation during the period of the war. I have no doubt that it w ill , in general, use its powers wisely, but I urge that, in future, the regulations be issued first, rather than that they be the subject of public discussion first and issued afterwards.

The rates are as set out in the notifications sent to the chairmen of the committees, and are not related at all to the pegging of wages or hours of labour; they are what is considered by the Government to be a reasonable allowance for expenses which members incur while doing work which is a little outside their ordinary duties. External Affairs) [4.40] -by leaveThe war against Germany and Italy has now become a world war. As a consequence, international relations cannot with advantage be discussed apart from the war policy and the war activities of the nations. Post-war planning itself cannot be dissociated from statements of war aims. And war aims, in tlieir turn, have a bearing upon the vigour of a nation's war effort, and, indeed, may become an instrument of war. I therefore turn at once to the war situation. It is nowevident that Japanese gains ductive capacity of the North American iu the Pacific, though temporary in character, have transformed the entire strategy of the war. Just prior to tihe 7th December last, the position of the Allies was broadly as follows:-The only large-scale land operations were on the Russian front. There, after a fierce struggle for five months between perhaps the most formidable forces that have ever been locked together in the history of warfare, the German Army had not only been completely blocked near Moscow and at the entrance to the Caucasus, but was being forced to retreat along the greater part of the front. Russia was at last benefiting from its "" scorched-earth "" policy-the policy of sacrificing for the general good every hit of property and of denying to the enemy every atom of material wealth. In the Middle East, too, the position had improved. Grave dangers to the Allies had been removed from Syria and Iran. Further, after some months of preparation, an Allied offensive had been launched in the Western Desert with the object of destroying the German and Italian armoured forces in Libya. The rest of the picture also looked reasonably attractive. The great, arsenals of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom were turning out the materials of war in ever-increasing quantities and these were being directed chiefly *o the British Isles, to the Middle East and to Eussia. For the time being, the menace of Japan seemed remote, unreal. Outside the two battle areas, the main Allied task was to keep the communications across the Atlantic open. It appeared as though the submarine menace in those -waters was being controlled. True, no continental land offensive was in operation, but the island of Britain seemed quite secure. In their turn, the United States of America and all the British dominions seemed far removed from every zone of danger. It may be that the attractiveness and the apparent stability of this situation helped to induce a feeling of overconfidence. The magnificent fighting qualities shown by the Russians, the success of the campaign in Syria, where the Australian Imperial Force had done so well, the belief in the enormous proContinent, the success of the convoy system in the Atlantic, together created a mental ancl moral Maginot Line behind which we might wait at our leisure for ultimate victory to bestow itself upon us. But the Japanese war has completely destroyed that metaphorical Maginot Line.

112,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Minister forto meet tbe first shocks of the Japanese thrust. It is idle to deny that the eleven weeks of Japanese attacks in south-eastern Asia and the Indies have created a situation of such acute difficulty that unless we re-organize all our man-power and all our physical resources, and reorganize them very speedily, victory will be very long delayed. The Allied position now is broadly this: The fight on the Eussian front is continuing. Eussia has achieved one of the few great land successes against the Axis. A German spring offensive seems possible, but the Russians seem intent upon denying the enemy every opportunity to stabilise bis line, and indeed are alliance. The United Kingdom and Russia still moving westward. The Russians are resolute to liberate their lost provinces. There is every reason to believe that they will succeed in doing so. But the Soviet is also a Pacific power, and recent public warnings suggest that, as a Pacific power, it cannot and will not tolerate any attempt by Japan to destroy the southern democracies. In the Pacific, the Japanese, having fully exploited the advantage of surprise, have overrun Malaya and reduced the supposedly impregnable Singapore in rapid time. As a result, their surface vessels have gained accGss to the Indian Ocean. They have separated the Pacific Allies into two land areas. The northern and western area is in India, and Burma, and the southern and eastern is partly in the Indies aud mainly iu Australia and New Zealand. I bave not forgotten one magnificent outpost of resistance. In the Philippines, with unconquerable will, the United States forces under General MacArthur are still rivallingtihedefenders of Tobruk and of Leningrad. The sea, land and air operations of the Jajianese have covered so wide a field iu so rapid a time, have had such important strategic consequences on the world war, and have bad such an effect ou economic forces and resources, that, without doubt, Japan's war activities constitute a gigantic threat to the fortunes of the anti-Axis powers everywhere in the world. Unfortunately, too, the military position in the Middle East has temporarily deteriorated. The Allied offensive, commenced in the Western Desert in November last, has uot been sustained and the enemy under Rommel has made very substantial advances. His forces in Libya are still active and their supply lines across the Mediterranean are still open. For some of these supplies, it is clear that the Vichy Government 'has been responsible. The ebb and flow of success in the four Libyan campaigns has been a puzzling feature of the war. On the other hand, the political situation in the Middle East has improved as a result of the new and important treaty signed at Tehran on the 29th January by whichtiheUnited Kingdom, the Soviet and Iranian Governments entered into an undertook obligations to protect Iran from the aggression of Germany and its associates. In return they have secured the co-operation of the Iranian forces and civil authorities within Iran, together with the right to maintain their own forces in the country and to make unrestricted use of communications through Iran. Japan's early gains have further complicated the Allied supply position. Portion of the output of the United States and the United Kingdom must now be directed to the Pacific, as well as to the Middle East, the Russian front and the British Isles. As a consequence, Allied forces have to be distributed over a tremendous area and extended lines of communication in all the oceans of the world have to be protected. The extra calls on production, shipping and naval strength are obvious. The difficulties have been increased by the fact that we have lost considerable resources of oil, rubber, ancl tin in the Far East. On the 1940 figures, the annual rubber production of Malaya was 3S0,000 metric tons; tin production, 80,000 tons; and iron ore production, 1,940,000 tons. The total annual petroleum production of Dutch Borneo was 1,680,000 tons, and of British Borneo 928,000 tons. From the remainder of the Netherlands East Indies, most of which is now denied to us, the petroleum production was over 6,000,000 tons. The rubber production of the Netherlands East Indies was 540,000 tons a year. Malaya and the Indies are, of course, the greatest rubber producers in the world. Whilst the temporary loss of these resources worsens our supply position, the Allies still command great material strength elsewhere, and such resolute action as that carried out by the Dutch in destroying one of the great refineries in. Sumatra has meant that our losses hav«> not always been Japan's sains. Thes« problems of supply illustrate the truth that you cannot treat the war against Germany as separate from the war against Japan, and then argue that Germany should be defeated first and Japan dealt with afterwards. If Japan's successes are allowed to continue, Germany's defeat will be indefinitely postponed. On the other hand, we should not underestimate the titanic strength of our American partner in the war against the Axis. Tbe whole of the man-power and industrial resources of that great nation of 130,000.000 people are dedicated to an Allied victory. In his message to Congress on the 7th January President Roosevelt announced a war nrograrnrrie for the coming year equivalent to £A.17,500,000,000 ' ancl forerhadowed the production of 60,000 aeroplanes, including 10.000 combat types this year, and 125,000 aeroplanes next year; rhe production of 45,000 tanks this year and 75,000 next year; and the building r f S.000.000 tons of shipping this year --""id 10,000,000 tons next year. In China alpo, we have gained as an ally a great and courageous people who, for more than four years, have shown the greatest tenacity against a skilful enemy possessing f a r greater mechanical resources. HereI would like to pay a public t r i had sent abroad valuable land, sea and bute to the valued services performed by our Minister at Chungking, Sir Frederic Eggleston. In a time of acute crisis, he has made it possible for the Chinese Republic and its Generalissimo to understand and sympathize with the special difficulties which this Commonwealtli has encountered by its many tasks in different theatres of war. The actions of the Japanese gained us other allies. January, in Washington, a declaration -of Allied solidarity was signed by representatives of 26 States. a l of those States were at war with iden! tical groups of enemy powers, each government Dr. Evatt. pledge to employ its f u l l resources, military or economic, against those members of the Axis w it h which it was at war, to co-operate with the other signatory governments, and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the common enemies. By adding up populations ancl industrial output of the Allied nations, particularly the British Commonwealth, the United States, the Soviet Union ancl China, it could be made to appear that Allied strength f a r outweighs Axis strength. This is a paper argument ancl the danger is that its comforting simplicity may help to create yet another imaginary Maginot Line behind which we can remain on the defensive and wait for victory. Men and resources are only effective if they are used in the right way in the right place and at the right time. All three are essential conditions of victory. In the end we can w in the war only by taking offensive action. The preliminary to the final offensive is the present organization of all Allied resource? whatsoever. Planning is not enough Theplans must be executed ruthlessly. In. one of his books, General Monash stressed over and over again the need for preliminary organization, and the even greater need for relating each step to the ultimate physical movements involved in co-ordinated military offensives. The Allies cannot be assured of victory until they perfect their system of co-operation., and see to it that their plans ave carric i into f u l l force and effect. In the last few months Australia's own position, has changed very rapidly. W r air forces. Our airmen took part in the defence of the British Isles, in the protection of British ships and in raids against Germany; our sailors served in the Mediterranean and other waters; our soldiers fought in Libya, Greece, Crete, Syria, Tobrnk a.nd other African fronts and some stood ready to share in the defence of the British Isles against have anticipated invasion. Thousands of picked On the 3rd young men were sent abroad in the EmpireA i r Training Scheme. We helped to provide a garrison for Malaya. Large Although not supplies of equipment were shipped away. In doing this we were unreservedly serving the cause of our Allies and also helpsubscribed to the common ing in our own defence. Now the position requires a new emphasis. No t because of our desire, but because of our necessity we seem certain to meet direct thrusts against our homeland and the territories of our near Pacific neighbours. A t the recent meeting of members of both Houses an opportunity was afforded of reviewing tbe state of our home defences, and I shall make no detailed reference to them now. Nor do I propose to review the cam7 paign in Malaya and Singapore, which has 'terminated in the agonizing captivity of many thousands of men of valour, including most of our own men in that theatre. I do not for a moment subscribe to the view that the causes of this disaster sliould not be investigated. Of course they should, lest similar losses be repeated. Unless we learn the lessons of such setbacks-and apply the lessons promptly all machinery in the world will not gain us the victory. The task of dispassionate analysis, fearless criticism, and careful judgment should be undertaken; and in due course no doubt that will be done. I suggest that one outstanding lesson of the campaign is the fundamental need for creating effective machinery to ensure that there shall be not only Allied unity of command but a guarantee of a common Allied strategical plan, backed by the pooling of Allied resources and the sound allocation of those resources to Allied forces. This task is enormously complicated because the powers allied against Japan-the America. China, the Netherlands, Canada. Australia. New Zealand, and the American Republics which have declared war on Japan, together with the Free Frenchare widely separated geographically and have widely differing resources. Tn practical terms, the co-ordinating of Allied effort includes at least(1) Machinery for the liigher direction of the war, so that, while decisions can be made with speed and firmness, due weigh: can be given to all phases of the conflict and to the special situaaccept it . This was not a mere lasttion of the various Allies; (2) The setting up of a unified command or commands to wage war against the enemy; (3) Machinery to handle reinforcements and supply in accordance w i th the decisions of the higher authority. One of the earliest actions of the Commonwealth ""Wau Cabinet and Advisory War Council after the outbreak of war was to consider the question of a supreme authority for the higher direction and co-ordinated control of Allied activities and strategy in the war in the Pacific. As early as the 11th December, we made representations on the subject to the United Kingdom Government. Our view then was that an inter-Allied body should be established, preferably in tbe Pacific area itself. No action along these lines was taken, for the War Council set up to assist Mr Duff Cooper after his appointment as Resident Minister of Cabinet Rank at Singapore was purely a the administrative British body without any inter-Allied character. Afte r Mr Duff Cooper returned to England, it acted solely for local defence purposes in Malaya. The first inter-Allied meetings were the regional conferences held at Singapore on the ISth December, and at Chungking on the 23rd Deceniber. Tliese conferences put forward recommendations to prepare the way for common action against common enemies as seen from the respective centres, but they provided no permanent organization. As a matter of fact the conferences were not called together again. The shape of a permanent organization did not appear until four weeks United States of after the war started. As a result of the the United Kingdom. Roosevelt-Ch urchill conversations in Washington, the text of an agreement for a unified command in the south-west Pacific under General Wavell was presented to the Governments concerned nt the end of December. To this, tbe Commonwealth Government gave its immediate assent. But when, on the 4th January, a further communication revealed that the arrangement proposed for the liigher direction of the war in the Pacific did not provide for any direct consultation on the part of the Commonwealth, the Government was unable to minute protest for, in assenting to the unified command, the Commonwealth Government had informed Mr Churchill that it expected Australia to be included in the joint controlling body referred to in the agreement. Thereupon the Commonwealth Government tried hard to secure the establishment in Washington of an inter-Allied body for the higher direction of the war in the Pacific. We preferred Washington as the venue, but we desired above all that the Commonwealth should have the opportunity of conferring as an ally with the United States of America and China at the same council table and on a common footing. On neither point was our proposal acceptable although, as we subsequently ascertained, it was favoured, in part, at least, by New Zealand, China and the Netherlands, which are all so directly affected by the Pacific war. Eventually, in view of tbe urgency of the position, the Government accepted, on the 6th February, a proposal made by Mr Churchill for a Far Eastern or Pacific Council to sit in London and to be composed of representatives of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. We expressed the hope then and we hope still that the question of Allied machinery will be reviewed in the light of our recent military experiences. A hypothetical case will illustrate the way in which the Pacific Council fits into the general machinery. Let us assume that the supreme commander requires guidance or direction from the "" higher authority"" in relation to the supply of It must not be supposed that the circumreinforcements or the like. The procedure locution which may possibly occur is is something like this(a) The supreme commander in the we regard the present co-ordinating Pacific telegraphs his question machinery as satisfactory. True, the to a combined chiefs of staff complexity of the method of consultation committee, which has been set. results in part from the geographical up in Washington as the agency separation of the two predominant partto represent the United States of ners in the war against Japan. Each America and the United Kingpartner is also separated from the reledom services.

We have now been inLondon and the chiefs of staff formed that China and India have been Dr. Evatt. committee in ""Washington respectively, and the two staff authorities proceed to resolve any points of difference between them. (<£) When this has been done the British Chiefs of Staff submit a report to the Far Eastern War Councili n London.

If members of the council differ the British Prime Minister is to "" focus"" the divergent views and communicate with Washington. (g) If the chiefs of staif committee in Washington accepts them, they are presented to the President, who issues the necessary executive order.

Equally, it would be idle to pretend that the other day the Australian Commonthe subject was governmental or strategic, added by tbe United Kingdom to tbe Pacific Council in London. But at no point whatever does any representative of this country meet any representative of the Dnited States of America in any council, committee, or strategic body directly concerned in the controlling of the Allied war that in the last three months, Sir Earle against Japan, or, for that matter, Germany or Italy. I agree that this fact does not conclude the matter, for maehinery is not always an obstacle, and we are most grateful to the President for his everready appreciation of the Commonwealth's position. During the discussions on the machinery for the higher direction of the war in the Pacific, the Commonwealth Government also sought to obtain a clearer understanding concerning tbe position of the Commonwealth's accredited representative, who was accorded the privilege of admission to meetings of the United Kingdom War Cabinet. On several occasions, Dominion Prime Ministers had been invited to attend meetings of the War Cabinet in London, and at^our request a similar courtesy was extended to Sir Earle Page when-he arrived iu London as the accredited representative of the Australian Government. In practice, Sir Earle Page was asked to attend Cabinet whenever matters which were considered by tbe British Prime Minister to be of direct and immediate concern to Australia were under consideration. But in time of war, practically all matters of foreign relations and high policy must necessarily affect all the British dominions. Accordingly the Commonwealth Government asked that its representative should have the right to be beard in the United Kingdom War Cabinet, "" in the formulation and direction of policy "". This request was agreed to by Mr Churchill. But when the Advisory War Council interpreted this decision as carrying with it membership of the War Cabinet, the British Prime Minister took the view that this was not in accordance with constitutional practice. But British constitutional practice has a way of adapting itself to changing conditions, especially in times of war or emergency. Subsequently Mr upon this postulate. Ohurchill explained publicly that his cabled decision to grant our special request gave us no more rights than Sir Earle Page had already been receiving. Canada's understanding of the position was expressed in the Canadian House of Commons by Mr Mackenzie King on the 28 th JanuaryMr Churchill's statement next discloses Page, representing the CommonweaUh Governmeut of Australia, has heen accorded the privilege of being present at the Cabinet Table in London when war matters and Australian matters were under discussion and also in similar circumstances in the Defence Committee. It is clear from the statement that this privilege, while broadly interpreted, has, however, been extended only aa a matter of courtesy. What recently has heen asked specifically by the Australian Government and agreed to by the Government of Great Britain is that an accredited representative of the Commonwealth Government of Australia sliall have the right to be heard in tlie War Cabinet in the formulation and direction of policies. Similar facilities Mr Churchill states will, of course, be available to New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. New Zealand decided to follow the Commonwealth's suggestion and take advantage of the new position, but Mr Mackenzie King explained that for the time being Canada did not propose to avail itself of the right or privilege. South Africa took the same view as Canada, Field-Marshal Smuts sending a special message to the effect that Australia's magnificent war effort and the present danger in the Far Eastern situation entitled it to generous treatment. In these circumstances the matter has not been pursued farther. We thought it better to continue Sir Earle Page's representation on the present footing, believing that, as the war crisis deepened, no suggestion or expedient would be rejected merely because it was novel. The subject of unified commands in the Pacific is one that is difficult to discuss with frankness in a public statement, as actual problems of strategy must arise. One thing is plain enough: In dealing with an enemy whose movements are not dictated by degrees of latitude or longitude, an over-strict delimitation either of strategical areas or of the jurisdiction of commanders may be dangerous. The Commonwealth Government has tried to secure action based The third, of the general problems of co-ordination is that of reinforcement and supply. A Raw Materials Board aud a Munitions Assignment Board are now functioning in the United States of America, with parallel bodies in London. Tbe Commonwealth Government has appointed its accredited representative in London and the Australian Director General of War Supplies Procurement in Washington as its representative for consultation by these bodies. Again, however, the only countries directly represented on the boards themselves are the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We are associated with these authorities which hold the keys to the essential supplies and munitions. We are not members. For reasons which are obvious, the deciding of the question of p.riorhty for the dispatch' of troops, and inas our representative with a status pracstruments of war, and for their transport to widely separated fronts, is one of the major problems now facing us. It is common knowledge that we lost Malaya and Singapore largely because of the inadequacy and insufficiency of aircraftThere were special difficulties in the way of rapid reinforcement with effective implements, and these are well understood. None the less, it is suggested that the function of planning for the effective and timely reinforcement of key positions in Allied plans will best be performed by an authority which can dispose of divergent, conflicting, or competitive claims or arguments on the body where the advice of all the Allies can be given in consultation. The establishment of such an authority will help to end retreatism and to open the way to the ultimate offensive. Before the attack on Malaya started, the Commonwealth Government had made representations for the adequate defence of this region and, throughout the campaign, with the full support of tbe War Advisory Council, it repeatedly stressed its views both on strategy ami the urgent need, for reinforcement. From our own limited resources, we at. ouc.e sent all the reinforcements that were requested. Every requisition was fulfilled immediately. Whatever the fate of this country, the judgment of history will be that we have not spared ourselves in our endeavours to carry out the responsibilities that have come to us as a British dominion and an Allied nation. I think that we have also contributed in some degree to the strengthening of the Allied Ih: Evatt. front in the sphere of international relations. I shall not repeat what I said on previous occasions to the House; and I have already referred to Sir Frederic Eggleston's most useful service at Chungking. Arrangements were recently completed for an exchange of Ministers between the Netherlands Government in London and the Commonwealth Government, and for the appointment of an Australian Consul General in the Netherlands East Indies. The distinguished Netherlands Minister has not yet been able to take up his post at Canberra, but Mr Eugene Gorman is on his way back from the Middle East to take up the position of Consul-General tically equivalent to that of a Minister. Further steps have recently been taken towards an exchange of representatives with the Soviet Union. As I indicated in a. statement to the House on the 27th November last, earlier proposals for an exchange of consuls with Russia, or for the sending of a small Australian delegation to the Soviet Union, had to be deferred, owing to the intense concentration of Russia in its fight to the death with Hitler. We have recently re-opened the matter with thc Soviet Government, in order to obtain a general agreement on the question of representation. We regard Russia not merely as an ally, but also as a great power which is destined to play an important part in the Pacific, not only during the present war but also thereafter. It is on this common-sense footing that we have taken the keenest interest in developing our mutual friendship ancl co-operation; .and both Sir Stafford Cripps and our High Commissioner in London have helped in this development. The war has happily brought about very close contact between Australia, and the United -.States, now become a powerful leader of the nations fighting aggression. Before war came to the Pacific... the United States had already given considerable material aid against the Axispowers. Up to the end of November last, the United States Congress had appropriated a total of $12,972,000,000 for its. lend-lease prograiromej and, of this, over $9,000,000,000 had been allocated to a. variety of purposes, which included the production of aircraft, tanks, ordnance, ships, and general equipment, the repairing of ships, and the provision of foodstuffs. As American war production got under way, the actual delivery of aid to the belligerent countries was being accelerated, and the Allies had already received the direct benefit of over .$1,000,000,000 worth of the lend-lease aid. An agreement had been made to provide $:i.,000,000,000 worth of lend-lease aid to Russia by next June, in addition to earlier exports of Russian purchases. The acceleration of production and delivery which had already become marked will, no doubt, assist the much greater effort that has been promised now that the United States has entered the war. Rut the recognition of the immense strength of our new ally does not mean that we hope to creep into safety behind America. The Australian Commonwealth will maintain a front-line spirit ancl will continue to make a front-line fight. We have done, and shall continue to do, everything we can to facilitate American plans. We shall contribute all that we can from our necessarily smaller resources towards the common cause. In connection with the lend-lease aid to British countries, the question of an agreement setting out the general principles of assistance has been under consideration for some time. Under wartime conditions, it was impossible for the British Commonwealtli to go on indefinitely providing dollars from its own resources for the purchase of American goods, and it was partly to meet such a situation that the lend-lease system was devised. Under section 3 b of the LendLoase Act, it is laid down that the conditions on which any government receives aid ""shall be those which the President deems satisfactory, and the benefits to the United States may be payment or repayment in kind or property or any other direct or indirect benefitwhich the President deems satisfactory"". A preliminary agreement, setting out the conditions in respect of the United Kingdom, which has made itself the channel through which lend-lease aid has flowed to countries of the British Commonwealth, has now been signed in Washington (vide appendix, page 57). This preliminary agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America relates t.o the principle applying to mutual aid in the prosecution of the war against aggression. It provides for a mutual contribution by the signatory powers to the defence of each other; controls the useto which transferred articles may be put: and sets out conditions under which intact defence articles may eventually be returned. It can easily be imagined that very few defence articles are likely to have remained ""intact"" at the end of the war. The final determination of the obligation which Great Britain will assume towards the United States of America is postponed. However, it is provided that, in making that determination, the terms and conditions. . shall be such ns not to burden commerce between the two countries, but to promote mutually advantageous economic relations between tbem mid the betterment of world-wide economic relations. To that end they sliall include provision for agreed action by tlie United States of America and the United Kingdom, open to participation by all ntlwr countries of like mind, directed to the expansion by appropriate international aud domestic measures of production, employment and exchange and consumption of goods which arc the material foundation of liberty and welfare of nil peoples; to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce ami to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers; and in general to the attainment of all economic objectives set forth in the ioint declaration made on the 12th August, 1041, by thc President of the United States of Am'ericn and the Prime Miuii<ter of the United Kingdom. It is provided that, at an early convenient date, conversations shall be begun between the United Kingdom ancl the United States of America with a view to determining, in the light of governing economic conditions, the best means of obtaining these objectives by their own agreed action, and of seeking agreed action by other like-minded governments. It will readily be seen that this provision -whic h takes it place as Article VII . of the agreement-foreshadow s an agreed settlement of the whole subject of postwar trade reconstruction, looks towards increased consumption of goods by the peoples of the world, postulates an attempt to solve the problems of employment and exchange, and goes some distance to assure the world that the four freedoms of the Roosevelt-Churchill Atlantic Charter of August last, to which Russia has since assented-freedo m of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear and freedom from want-wil l be uot mere platitudes but living actualities. Tbe proposed text of the agreement was submitted by the United Kingdom to the Commonwealth Government, and after close consideration it was decided that the future collaboration between the United States of America, the countries of the British Commonwealtli, and other countries of like mind, envisaged by Article VII . , could well help to provide French assistance is facilitating the a basis for the post-war economic order. Moreover, the Commonwealth Government was already committed in principle to such collaboration, by its adherence to the Atlantic Charter and by the subsequent multilateral declarations at Washington of the 1st January last. Consequently, it urged upon the Government of the United Kingdom, that an agreement with the Government of tlie United States of America should be concluded. Canada. South Africa and New Zealand have all concurred in the arrangement. The lend-lease arrangement between the United Kingdom and the United against unneutral conduct on its part States of America illustrates that the towards Britain. The United States, general question of post-war reconstruclargely because of its traditional symtion is already assuming importance in pathy with the French Republic, has been the war aims of the Allies, who are not very anxious to give to the present Vichy content to wait upon the creation of new Government every opportunity to try to machinery of international organization perforin its duty; but its patience is fast after the peace treaty has been signed. becoming exhausted. Another example of post-war planning is the constitution of the Inter-Allied Oommatter of deep interest to Australia. On mittee which met in Londoni n June and the 17th December, Australian and September, and at which representatives Netherlands forces landed in Portuguese of Australia and other Dominions took territory upon the island of Timor.

That quesagainst a Japanese attack, which on tion involves prior arrangements iu reasonable grounds was believed to be regard to foodstuff supplies and shipping imminent. Certainly no violation of and cannot well be deferred until the Portugal's sovereignty was at all involved. fighting ends. Still more recently, Russia We believed that we were acting in has suggested the establishment of a postaccordance with what Portugal itself war organization on lines which extend wished. beyond tbe matter of food relief, and violently, we were prepared to retrace our which have commended themselves to the steps, an order to avoid embarrassment Commonwealth Government. This is a war in which much has beeu ment with the Portuguese Government suffered in order to prevent domination was made for the withdrawal of the Ausof the world by sheer force, and in order tralian and Dutch occupying forces, proto maintain established principles of viding that Portuguese forces were sent decency and freedom. During the war, to carry out the defence of the colony Dr. Evatt. out of a proper respect for the opinionsof mankind, we have made open profession of these ideals. It is unthinkable that we should not make a serious attempt to see that those ideals are carried into effect. Tliere are certain aspects of the international situation to which I shall make brief reference. In Western Europe, the Vichy Government appears to be collaborating closely with Germany and Italy. The two latest instances are directly harmful to us. The evidence is clear that transport of Axis supplies across the Mediterranean for Libya. In the Far East, the Governor-'General of French Indo-China is apparently willing to place some of the French shipping in Asiatic waters at the disposal of Japan. Of course, it is not right to judge the French people by their present Government. The Government, vanquished in war, is in an extremely difficult position owing to the ever-p resent fear of German force, applied mercilessly but carefully and skilfully. At the same time,, the Vichy Government gave certain undertakings In regard to Portugal, I refer to a When Portugal protested between London and Lisbon. An agreeagainst Japanese invasion. Despite our great anxiety as to the military position, we accepted the bargain solely out of our desire to prevent embarrassment either to Britain or to Portugal. The Portuguese relieving forces were actually en route to Timor with the full knowledge of tlie Japanese when the latter launched an attack on Dilli on the 21st ""February. That was the very event we had foreseen and sought to guard against. The Portuguese Government has formally protested to Japan against this cynical attack. It will be interesting to observe whether Portuguese troops will now insist upon the evacuation of Dilli by Japan. The Japanese entrance into the war, ancl the German and Italian declaration of war on the United States, have had a marked effect on the other American republics. All , except Argentina and Chile, which are maintaining a text-book interpretation of neutrality, have now either declared war or broken off relations with Axis countries. At the PanAmerican Conference at Bio de Janeiro on the 25th January, a resolution was made the effect of which was to recommend to each State to break off relations with the Axis. The resolution was not in itself binding upon any State. Nevertheless, the general principle of American solidarity was reaffirmed, and the United .States of America and its American allies were declared to be non-belligerents. In the case of announced that the British Empire would also be treated as a non-belligerent. The principal effect of this will be, that repair facilities will be available for the vessels of the Allied countries concerned in the ports of the State which declares them non-belligerent. The major part of the export production of South American countries is being acquired by Allied powers. After preparing a review of the international situation generally, one is acutely aware that to-day there is in reality only a war situation. We are now faced with the necessity of defending Australia on our own shores. In defending Australia, Australians are also fighting as much for our Allies as when they were fighting abroad; for the holding of Australia is essential to the final offensive by which victory will be gained. Therefore, when the invader comes, he will be fought here by a people who know that they are not only defending their homes, but are also standing on one of the critical battle-grounds in the history of mankind. We shall be defending liberty in its mostelemental form. We have done Japan no injury, unless it be an injury to join with our Allies in resisting not so much an attempt to control south-east Asia as a plan to dominate the whole of the illimitable Pacific. Ultimately, that insensate plan must and will be checked. In holding Australia, we shall be fighting not only for New Zealand and for every Pacific island but for Canada and the United States of America as well. Yesterday President Roosevelt said as much. Nor is this all. We recognize the equal importance of holding Burma and India. We are aware of the great struggle of the Chinese people to maintain their integrity and rebuild their nation, just as we recognize and svmpathize with the aspirations of the Indian people to become one of the self-governing British nations, and as such to take part in the defence of tbe Allied cause in Asia. Our actions as a nation must be governed by two broad principles-first , absolute solidarity with .all the enemies of the Axis; second, the defence of Australia not only as our homeland but also as a key area in the plan of Allied and Empire strategy.

[Title] of the Opposition) [5.19] I am sure that the House joins with me in expressing appreciation of the trouble to which the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) has gone in the compilation of the information he has just conveyed, ancl of the opportunity that is thereby afforded to us to debate and review the international position in the light of what we have heard. In my opinion, the position is summed up, so far as this Parliament is concerned, by the concluding paragraph of the statementOur actions as a nation must be governed by two broad principles-first , absolute solidarity any other strikers in Australia, and it with a l l the enemies of the Axis; second, the should exercise its power. As a matter defence of Australia not only as our homeland but also as a key area in the plan of Allied and Empire strategy. Tbe time has come when we should refrain, as much as possible, from making speeches, and should concentrate on action! Members of Parliament muss face their responsibilities. We met a little over two months ago for the purpose of declaring war on Japan, Finland, Hungary and Rumania. At the same time, honourable member knew the real reason we pledged ourselves to take every step he should be the first to discipline the necessary to defend the Commonwealth men. and its territories, to carry on hostilities in association with our Allies, ancl to responsible for that dispute. achieve final victory over our enemies. Since then, unfortunately, the war, which has been going on since September, 1939, has come nearer to our shores. Within uufair to say that, but the fact remains the last few days, a part of our own territhat so long as we have industrial unrest tory has been occupied by enemy forces, and strikes at a time when there is and Darwin has been bombed.

Our very existence depends upon tralia, and how vitally necessary it is that production should be maintained, and even increased. Yet, at the vei? moment that the enemy is attacking our shores, and is already in possession of some of our overseas territories, there are people in Australia who disregard the danger with which we are confronted, and seek to carry on as in peace-timeto carry on in a way that should not be tolerated by a responsible government. The time has passed when these matters can be settled by conferences ancl promises. The Government has the power to discipline the coal-miners, or of fact, strikes have not been confined to the coal-fields.

There is also an urgent need to maintain essential transport services. Goods must be sent to Darwin and other places far distant from the source of supply. People should not be allowed to use motor oars to go to commercialized sport, or for pleasure purposes generally, while petrol is needed to carry supplies to Darwin and elsewhere, places at which the enemy may soon gain a foothold. The war has come closer to our shores than many of us thought possible some time ago, even those of us who may have believed that war with Japan was inevitable. We must learn the lesson of the attack on Darwin. This war cannot be won in Australia. If tbe Japanese were to take Australia they still would not have won the war; and if they should be beaten in Australia we still should not have won the war. We must work for the closest unity and co-operation between ourselves and all of our Allies. ""Whilst our immediate danger is a threat from Japan, we must not lose sight of the fact that Germany is still a mighty with. We may take some consolation in the fact that the position of the Allies to-day is materially and numerically better than it was twelve months ago, but we have to recognize that Japan has scored great successes. Japan has entered the war against us, and Russia has come in on our side. The United States of America has come in whole-heartedly with us because of the attack by Japan. I think it will be agreed that, in the balance, we are in a better position to-day than we were twelve monthsago. We must not consider the position from the point of view of Australia only. we have our responsibilities to Australia, but Australia has its .responsibility to the Pearl Harbour, bringing into the fray the other members of the alliance. We must not delude ourselves that we can win this war on our own; we must bave the assistance of our Allies, amongst which the United States of America is in the best position to help us. However, we should not relax our efforts simply because the United States of America has come in with us, or because equipment from that country is coming to us in ever-increasing Mr Fadden. quantities. Our own production cannot be maintained, much less increased, by a policy of holding conferences, and trying to appease strikers. Definite action must be taken, and if the Government does what is necessary it will receive the whole-hearted support of the Opposition. gratulate the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) upon the statement which he has made. We meet to-day in tragic circumstances. Eor the first time in its history, this peaceful land has been, if not invaded, at any rate subjected to hostile attack. Innocent lives have been sacrificed. It looks as if we have beeu, to some degree, caught napping. A secret meeting of members of Parliament was held recently, and what was said at that meeting must remain secret. Anything which I may say this afternoon I learned outside that meeting. We gather from the press, and from other sources, that at Port Moresby the siren sounded simultaneously with the dropping of the last bomb by the Japanese. At Darwin, the alert was sounded when the bombing began. Evidently there has been something wrong with our reconnaissance. Surely effective precautions should have factor to be reckoned been taken, and I , for one, hold that a very careful inquiry should be made, and that those responsible should be punished. In these two instances, the catastrophe of Pearl Harbour was re-enacted in miniature. The two outstanding events which have occurred since the outbreak of war are, to my mind, almost miraculous. When our fortunes were at a very low ebb, Hitler struck at Russia. That brought into the war on our side the whole weight of Russian man-power and resources, at a time when they were urgently needed in order to take the pressure off Great Naturally, Britain. Again, on the 7th December, 1941, Japan launched its attack against whole of the man-power and resources of the United States of America. The voice of the isolationist is no longer heard in that great country, and the Americans will remain in the conflict until the Allies triumph. Those two events are so wonderful that I believe that a Divine Power is with us in this mighty struggle. But we must do our part, and be found worthy of our trust.",38,States Op America On The Principles
118,"Mr Bakes, (Maranoa) [5.33]","I conThe Commonwealth Government has formulated an economic plan for harnessing to the war effort the whole of our man-power, money and resources. The Government should use that authority to the fullest degree in the defence of Australia. But so soon as an effective plan is announced, objections are raised against it, even before its principles have been carefully examined. The Government regards this economic measure as the most effective way in which to defend Australia and I hope that it will be fully implemented. Much"" equality of sacrifice "". sion has been used widely during the last two years. How can we approach the ideal of equality of sacrifice? I propose to make two constructive suggestions. First, with a full realization of the implications of my remarks, I suggest that every worker in the Commonwealth, from the Governor General, the six State Governors, Cabinet Ministers, members of Parliament and judges downwards, should be placed upon the same rate of pay as that of a private soldier, namely, 6s. a day, with allowances for maintenance, clothing and dependants. I make that suggestion in no spirit of levity, but with all the sincerity and strength at my command. The soldier risks his life for 6s. a day in the defence of Australia; the least that we who are not in the firing line can do is to accept the same rate of remuneration as those magnificent young men in the fighting forces. As an alternative, the non-combatant members of tlie community and the soldiers should be placed upon the basic wage. In this hour of peril, no decent worker should expect or wish for more. I am in complete accord with the opinion of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that in this period of stress the Parliament of the Commonwealth should remain in session. This is our-firing line; we must be here. If we set an example to the people, we need have little fear of Australia being occupied by the Japanese. ""We must preserve Australia inviolate, because we love our traditional freedom, and, in addition, Australia offers a wonderful springboard from which to launch a counter attack against Japan. When Bussia drives back the German invader, I feel confident that it will turn east and launch an effective assault upon Japan. I have much pleasure in recording my approval of the paper that was read by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt). I speak in no spirit of complacency. I am not a young man, but I love Australia. It must not .be conquered, because the world would be for ever poorer if Australia fell. We must play our part. Let us in this National Parliament set an example to our young men who are perf orming such magnificent has been spoken about deeds of heroism. negativedThat thc debate be now adjourned. My main purpose in participating in this debate is to endorse the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) as to the propriety of applying to people in Australia a general rate of remuneration based upon a soldier's pay. In the present emergency, the proper course for the Government to adopt is to tell every body to pursue his present occupation until he is transferred elsewhere by a government direction. But his remuneration for his efforts should be only such as is required to secure to himself and each member of his family a standard of living that is not substantially greater than that of a soldier, taking into account the fact that a soldier is not required to provide for his own food, housing or clothing. It is interesting, while discussing the matter of soldiers' pay, to reflect that Australia pays its soldiers at a much lower rate tlian Canada does. A letter from Canada dated the 6th November, 1941, and published in the English Tribune of the 5th December., 1941, stated tliat a Canadian private receives $1.30 a day. As a dollar is worth approximately 6s., his payment is equivalent to 8s. a day expressed in Australian currency. In addition to that, he receives $35 a month for his wife and may receive up to $24 a month for his children. That is to say, the maximum that he may receive is $99.30 a month, or, expressed in Australian currency, £29 16s. a month. That rate of pay is approximately equal to the average that",39,States Op America On The Principles
119,This Expres,Motion (by Mr ABOHIE CAMEBON),40,States Op America On The Principles
120,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [5.46],"obtains in Canadian manufacturing industry, slightly lower than the average wage paid in Ontario, and slightly higher than that paid in Quebec. In my opinion, the rate of pay which is appropriate to the fighting man should also be appropriate to the civilian. My own belief is that the best way in which to awaken Australians to a realization of the danger that threatens them is to place every one, soldier and civilian alike, upon the same standard. In my opinion more decentralization of effort is necessary in this country. The Commonwealth Government should work more with State governments, and through State governments, than it has beeu able to do, or possibly willing to do, mated by a spirit of optimism and they in the past, and should make use of the vast reservoir of trained administrative ability that is the offices of local governing bodies. Power should be decentralized. Everything should not have to be done at Canberra. State Ministers and officials ancl municipal officials should be empowered to make decisions in their own localities. A great deal of the trouble is owing to tihe fact that every decision, no matter how trifling, has to be made, if not in danger of mishandling the problems at Canberra, at any rate by a Commonwealth official. powers to State Premiers for the protection of thc civil population. In some States, particularly in New South Wales, the Premiers have distributed powers among local governing bodies, and there has been fairly wide decentralization. be a wider delegation than that. Many of the decisions made at Canberra could be made by the State officials or municipal officials, acting within their limited tlieir minorities are doing.

I instance the publicity given to the difference between the Prime Minister and the Victorian Premier iu the matter of Saturday racing. If instead of criticizing one another in the newspapers the Ministers had privately conferred, the difference would probably have disappeared. That is the way in which these matters should be dealt with. The Government should tell tlie people all it can without endangering this country. The people oscillate between pessimism and optimism. If one listens to the overseas broadcasts one comes away with a feeling that everything is not so bad after all. The broadcasts are anitell us that the position will certainly be saved; but experience has taught us to be found in that this sanguine spirit has no body of fact or reason. We ought to have official statements made by the Government and broadcast and published in the newspapers in the exact terms ordered by the Government which would explain the position to tbe people and set out tbe facts. Both Government and Parliament are created by industrial unrest. It is a great mistake for the Government to think that it will conciliate the membership of unions by itself dealing with their dissident minorities. Whatever may be the opinion of the rank and file as to the actions of a minority, if the Government puts out its hand against the minority and imprisons or even prosecutes members of unions, it will put the mass feeling of the union on their side. Unions are declaring themselves against what to have full power to discipline the minorities of their own members would be avoided. We have the Aus-",40,States Op America On The Principles

My own idea about the way in which to deal with labour troubles is that each person employed should have to become a member of the union an his industry, and that the union should have to accept him on exactly the same terms as every body else. I should not make membership a condition precedent to engagement, but I should require the employee to become a member within a specified period, and I should then make him responsible to the union and have him controlled by the union. I should invest the union with power to discipline him for failure in the war effort by fines, or, in very extreme cases, by expulsion. The unions would welcome those powers being conferred upon them. The Miners Federation would. It is pitiful to see .the way in which the oflicials of that union protest to the Government and the public that thoy are doing all they can to compel a small minority of people to remain at work. the full power of discipline. Mr .BLACKBURN -Why do they uot exercise it? know. given the full power with certain safeguards against tyrannical misuse of that power. They should have legal power to deal with dissenting members and members who against the properly expressed will of the federation refuse to work. We have to face the fact that there is a great feeling amongst the masses of people that it does not much matter what they do. That is the chief enemy. The worker says to himself, "" Every body is taking advantage of the present s it u a t i o n P e o p l e are charging comits own shelters for its workmen, missions for getting subscriptions to the Liberty Loan. Things like that tend to convince the workers that if every body is taking advantage of the present situation there is nothing wrong in their doing so too. There is an air of hopeless fatalism, a feeling that anything a man can do will not avert the worse, and that, therefore, each should make the best of his chances which will soon pass away. Every association of men and women should be used as a means to get the greatest possible measure of national unity in this country. This is not the time in which to apply class policies; no one wants to do so; the Government does not want to, and the policies applied by the Government should not lie taken as class policies if any other construction can be put upon them. We want the greatest capacity and the greatest determination to use all our resources, animate and (inanimate, real and material, in order to defend this country. was pleased to hear the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) refer to the control exercised by local governing bodies in tlie cities. Recently, on behalf of more than 2,000 people employed in the government workshops in Western Australia. I sought two things: one, a guard, and the other, air raid shelters. I communicated with the Civil Defence Council and was told that it was not its function to protect the men at that factory. I then communicated with the General Officer Commanding, Western Command, who said that he knew nothing about the inatter, but would try to find out. He then suggested that I communicate with the Department of Munitions, which I did, and I was told that peace officers would be put on guard at the workshops. I then tried to find out whose responsibility it was to provide air raid shelters for the men. Again the Civil Defence Council knew nothing. of the Department of Munitions to provide for the protection of government workshops. engaged in tbe manufacture of war materials in Western Australia erected but, for the protection of the workmen in the government factory there is nothing. The Munitions Department referred me to the Civil Engineer of the Railways. That department thought that he was doing something in the matter.

I am pointing out is the lack of an official to co-ordinate civil protection measures. The result is that every day press criticism is levelled against the Civil Defence Council. I do not desire to criticize what that council is doing, but the people in it do not seem to know where their job starts and finishes. Press criticism naturally creates a bad feeling amongst the public generally.

I had occasion to write to the Minister for Home Security( Mr why effective action has not been taken.

It was not its function to see to the installation of teleman-hours of work. That is a direct gift phones. Yet the Minister for Home Security told me that arrangements had been made last August for the installation of telephones in the homes of wardens.

I also wish to make passing reference to the numerous strikes that have occurred. I should not be doing my duty by my constituents if I allowed the opportunity to do so to pass, for the people of Western Australia have to their credit a larger number of enlistments in proportion to the population than those of any other State. I am frequently asked in Western Australia what the Government is doing in connection with strikes. I am sick and tired of hearing the explanation from Government sources that this Or the other thing is being done. If union officials are able to deal with the men who strike, as was indicated by a reply given from the treasury bench to the honourable member for Bourke a few minutes a.go, I should like to know Since the outbreak of the war almost 1,000 strikes have occurred in Australia.

This is the third or fourth time that I have felt called upon to make a protest in this connection. It is not necessary to go beyond the bounds of Canberra to see a great waste of petrol. Nearly as many motor cars can be seen in the streets of this city of about 12,000 people as can be seen in the metropolitan area of Perth.

Dalley has recently been in Perth and lie must know that my statement is true, although I am aware that he wa3 kept indoors on official duty while he was in Perth. I appeal to the Prime Minister and also to the Minister for Supply and Development to do what they can to conserve petrol. I was astonished to hear a ministerial statement that our petrol supply is extremely good at present. Such statements cause considerable dissatisfaction among petrol users. Our petrol supply may be good at the moment, but who can say what it will be like a month or six weeks hence? If any one of our big instaHations were to be destroyed by a bomb we should be in a sorry state at once. Ministerial utterances of the kind that I have mentioned are most unwise and should not be made. Such observations simply invite people to ask why they cannot get more petrol. Far too much loose talking is being indulged in and it is injurious to public morale. I trust that the petrol control regulations will be tightened considerably so that waste will be prevented. I frankly admit that I have been "" pimping;'"" "" : thip connection. WheneverI have seen [3] city cars in country districts I have sent their numbers to the Liquid Fuel Control that they have been reported, they will know that I may have been responsible. Thousands of motor cars are to be seen regularly at race meetings and the "" trots "" and also on the beaches. Petrol should not be available for such purposes. The sooner definite action is taken to prosecute people who improperly use petrol the better it will be for the country. I have heard the Prime Minister say on several occasions that the nation which has the last few gallons of petrol will probably win the war. I entirely agree with that view, and I ask the honourable gentleman to do bis utmost to prevent waste of this precious fuel. adjourned.

154,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [6.12],"Iauthorities who uo not seem to have a due appreciation of the meaning of "" waste"". I Jive close to an ordnance store, and within a period of five or ten minutes on auy day of the week it is usual to see 3-ton lorries travelling to and from the depot each carrying, on an average, not more than 1 cwt. or 2 cwt. That kind of thing is happening throughout the metropolitan area of Sydney. No regard whatever seems to have been paid by the authorities to the need for conserving petrol, nor does any attempt seem to have been made to coordinate tlie transport services between ordnance stores and the various military camps. I understand that it is the custom for each unit to have its own motor transport, and frequently several trucks may travel from 10 to 20 miles in the same directions carrying only 1 cwt. or 2 cwt. each. That kind of thing is profligate waste. While this is going on, many people in the civil community,who depend upon their trucks for their living, are beiug utterly ruined because they cannot obtain petrol for essential business purposes. I deeply regretted to-day to hear from the Minister for Supply and Development { Mr Beasley) that this Government is continuing the petrol rationing policy of the previous Government. When the Minister was sitting in opposition he frequently spoke at great length about the inequality of £he petrol rationing system, yet the honourable gentleman is now continuing rationing upon exactly .the same principles. I Jo not think any honourable gentleman will deny that some people in a small way of business have been practically ruined by their inability to obtain suiBcient supplies of petrol. It has. been possible for big firms which run a fleet of lorries to rationalize their delivery services and so maintain their activities, but this is not possible with people in a small way of business, many of whom rely wholly on their trucks for their living. Some of them are still purchasing their vehicles under hire-purchase agreements, and they are finding it impossible to meet their commitments. gentleman say that business people are communicated to honourable members, -ising their trucks uneconomically ? tfr. Ronevcar. so until recently. I know that until petrol rationing became severe some big business firms would readily have u.od a 3-ton truck to deliver, say, a pair of women's gloves. That kind of thing is not being done to-day, Jor the rationalization of the delivery of goods is now in operation to a large degree. It has been stated that persons in difficulty over petrol for delivery purposes may apply to the Liquid Fuel Control Board, but we all know that such applications elicit a stereotyped letter of refusal, the terms of which do not vary under any circumstances. I trust that the Minister for the Army will take immediate steps to put an end to the wasteful use of petrol in the military service, and to call for a report from a reliable and independent source on this .subject. I also trust that the Government will do everything possible to effect a more equitable distribution of petrol to civil users for essential purposes. The present basis of rationing s'hould be drastically altered. I have a matter of some importance to place before the Government. MT. CUBTIN -Having regard to the urgency of several matters which have developed during this week, I had hoped that honourable members would agree to the adjournment of ibe House at this stage, so that members of the Government and others affected could give their undivided attention to these urgent subjects without further delay, particularly as i l had been agreed that instead of the House meeting on the remaining days of this week it should be called together on Thursday and Friday, and, if necessary, on Saturday, of next week. usual hour for the suspension of the sitting for dinner. I should like to know whether the honourable member for Melbourne proposes to speak at any length. five minutes, Mr Speaker. This afternoon, I asked whether details of the reoort which the Minister for the Army expected to receive in regard to the either in secret meeting or publiclv.",44,Waste Rationing Meeting S Oi Parliament Bombin G Op Dabwin

159,Mr Calwell,"Not for more thanthe details of the attack were communicated by me in the statement that I read to the secret meeting. Amplification of details would he only in respect of particular works. that the Prime Minister gave all the information which he then possessed. Probably, there will be amplification of that detail in the report which the officers will present; but in addition, various rumours are circulating in regard to certain matters relating to the defence of Darwin, and it is possible that those officers will furnish some additional information. the duty of the Government to give to the House at a private meeting any additional facts which may be gleaned from the visit of those ofBcers. I hope that the Prime Minister will do this. I cannot state the subject of the rumours that are circulating, but I shall tell the Prime Minister privately what I have heard. If the rumours should be substantiated by subsequent investigation, the Parliament ought to be told everything. I am not insinuating that the position at Darwin was so bad as it was discovered to be at Pearl Harbour; but there are nevertheless some aspects which need elucidation. It seems remarkable that certain things could have happened if the garrison and every body else associated with the defence of the town had been prepared for an attack. On the promise of the Prime Minister that we shall have ample opportunity next week to discuss matters of general administration, I shall postpone until then the further remarks that I desire to make in regard to the laxity of administration which existed at Darwin prior to thc Japanese attack. I listened with very great interest to about setting up a private body? the eloquent, earnest, and thoughtful statement that was made this afternoon member that the matter will be during the course of another debate, by investigated. the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker). I compliment him upon it. A change has been made in the system rumours he has mentioned, in order that of news broadcasts. A broadcast of news I may have some knowledge of them. I is made from Canberra ahead of the shall then tell him whether or not they overseas news. Moving around the country and, indeed, in the city also,, one finds that this is generally resented. People of importance who Wish to devote the few minutes at their disposal to listening in to the broadcast of overseas news, in which they are very deeply interested, find that they have first to listen to the news that is broadcast from Canberra. Doubtless some of this latter is important; but much of it is neither important nor significant. Very nasty remarks are made concerning it. It is described as government propaganda. I do not subscribe to that view. There is the belief that it is put over in order to push Ministers into the public eye at a time when the people most desire to hear what is occurring overseas. I suggest to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), either that the old practice be reverted to or that the Canberra news and the overseas news be broadcast at stated times, so that those persons who wish to listen only to one will not be obliged to listen to both. Mr CTntTIN (Fremantle-Prime Minister) [6.25] -IT S replyI assure the honourable memher for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that thc flat-rate rationing of petrol will be reviewed by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley).

Not only have we had the reports which would ordinarily be received, but to-day we have bad, in addition, reports from other ofncers. These do not add anything to the broad picture, but merely fill in details. I can only say to tbe honourable gentleman that it would not be to the advantage of Australia for a public statement to be made of the extent and nature of the damage which the enemy inflicted on Darwin, because that would reveal to the enemy the degree of its success or failure in the attainment of its objectives. National security makes it essential that when the enemy launches an assault Against any part of Australia, however disturbing it may be to us, we must not reveal the degree of our discomfiture. be valid if we were given the information at a private meeting. gentleman will have a conversation with me, I shall be glad to learn what he has in mind. Speaking broadly, I shall notput myself in the position of either denying or admitting something, merely because the enemy desires to verify its knowledge of -what we are doing or have not done. With respect to the matter raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins), I can only say that I sincerely hope that a government instrumentality will be fairly, properly, and usefully employed. I know that there have been expressions of discontent, and criticism of the way in which the news service has been conducted. Whether or not that is justified, I do not know, because I Have not had an opportunity to 1 listen to the broadcasts. I assure the honourable gentleman that I shall take the matter up, and that, if improvement can be made, we shall make it. We shall not tolerate .anything that is not satisfactory.
