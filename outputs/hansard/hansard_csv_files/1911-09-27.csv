So far as it has gone, tbe debate has shown that the Opposition lacks a case, and has, therefore, been forced to build up its charges against the Government on assumptions. Although the Prime Minister definitely stated that preference to unionists is to be applied only in the employment of casual labourers, members opposite are trying to get the public to believe-n o doubt for party ends-that the Labour party intends to remove from the Public Service generally every person who is not a trade unionist. orable members have suggested that that will happen. The right honourable member for Swan spoke of the step whicE has been taken as the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge, and expressed, the opinion that in the future the principle would be applied to permanent hands. The inference which the public is expected to draw is that the Labour party intends to dismiss from the Public Service all who are not unionists. An Opposition, 'in making an attack, ought first to make sure that it is on sound ground! Honourable members opposite have had the Prime Minister's declaration of the position of the Government in this matter, but they ask, "" Why, then, has the Minister of Home Affairs directed that a list shall be furnished to him giving the names of employees who are not members of unions?"" Any Minister has the right to ask for a return showing who in the employment of his Department are unionists, and who are non-unionists; but the asking for such a list does not Jl)ou5c of Crprrscntattbrs.

That assumption, however, has been made by every honourable member opposite witb regard to the action of the Minister of Home Affairs. think that his minute means the dismissal of non-unionists. not with what they think, but with the facts. bilities? All the safeguards surrounding the application of preference to unionists were removed from the arbitration and conciliation law last year. commenced my speech the members of the Opposition evidently resented my statement that they wish the public to believe that it is the intention of the Government to dismiss every non-unionist from the Public Service, their interjections show that I was right. the policy made public last week applies ^ only to the casual labour employed chiefly * in manual work. Furthermore, it is not the instruction of the Government that none but unionists shall be employed. Over more than five-sixths of the area ot Australia there are no trade unionists, and if works are carried out there the oflicer in charge will engage the non-unionists who apply to him for employment. All that the policy of the Government means is that where a man is wanted for casual work, extending over one, two, or three months, and a trade unionist applies, he shall have preference, all other things being equal. tell us this? Why is it left to the honourable member to make explanations? has told the House what I am telling it. All last week the Opposition wasfishingfor information on which to found a motion of censure, but being unable to get it, honourable members have been driven to use a circular issued by the Director-General of Works, all the instructions issued in which, Servicei f a non-unionist is ready to accept as tlie Minister of Home Affairs has stated, did not emanate from him. Honourable members would have done better to wait for something definite. Notwithstanding the assistance which the Opposition is receiving from the daily press of Victoriay the public sees that there is no case against ployes forced the employers also to combine. the Government, that Ministers are doing nothing more than they always said they would do, namely, granting preference to [31]2 unionists where opportunity offers. It has been objected that the Government might have granted preference to unionists in the arbitration law when it was amended last session, instead of leaving the matter to the Court, but when the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, the Attorney General interjected that to grant preference to unionists would be unconstitutional, and the honourable member replied, "" I am not too sure about it, because I have not considered the matter, but it might be unconstitutional."" Obviously, then, there is a doubt as to our constitutional position, and the Leader of the Opposition yesterday said that we had gone further than, from his point of view, we were entitled to go. Had we made it mandatory in the Act to grant preference to unionists, we might have found that the provision was unconstitutional. That, however, is not a reason why, when everything is equal, Ministers should not give preference to unionists. As a matter of fact, Ministerial act what the Constitution forbids. a difference of opinion among legal men as to what our constitutional powers are in this matter, and consequently it would ill become me as a layman to offer an opinion on the subject. signs for the Federal Capital being prepared by blackleg architects? that. by blackleg architects? opposite say so. The architects in question are non-unionists. Labour party is to grant preference to unionists. What has led up to the adoption of that policy? Every honourable member opposite has declared his belief in unionism, but none of them is willing to allow the employment of unionists in the Public whatever positions are vacant. As the honourable member for South Sydney pointed out yesterday in his brief review of the history of industrial unionism from the early days, collective bargaining by means of unionism pn the part of the emThe day came when it was a case of one powerful combination playing off against another.

17,Mr Charlton,"The policy of thecombination, found they could supply a certain commodity from certain industries under their control, and at the same time keep certain other industries idle, with a view to enforcing their demands. As the result of that it was found necessary, at any rate in Australia, to pass legislation in an endeavour to regulate the conditions. It can be clearly shown that the Commonwealth Parliament has already established the principle of taking cognisance of trade unions. That is the only means that we have of regulating the industrial concerns of the community. Why, then, should we in any way assist to break down those combinations by encouraging non-unionists? been offered to non-unionists. there has been, and that preference is given to a brand of unionism that is not the real unionism. Those are the brand of unionists that many honourable members opposite like to assist. This Parliament passed a Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I am surprised to hear honourable members opposite contending that since that Act was passed there have been more strikes than there were before. If they were as conversant with the working of the Act as they ought to be, they would find that a large number of disputes where interruptions of work have taken place are due, not to strikes, but really tp locks-dut. The honourable member opposite who laughs shows his ignorance. He does'not understand the question. will laugh, too. will not laugh. It is only those who have not sufficient knowledge, and do not care about learning, that will laugh. The following is the definition of a lock-out in the Act:"" Lock-out"" includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employee's, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees, to accept any term or condition of employment. Any man who cannot contrive a lock-out without bringing himself under that definition must be very foolish. Any employer can bring about a state of affairs which will cause discontent among his workmen, without needing to close any part of his industry or to assist another employer to do so. He can do certain things which his employees will be forced to kick against, and which will make them stop work. Then it is called a strike, and so honourable members opposite say that it is the workmen who are responsible every time. I can point out several cases where interruption of work has occurred, and which were really locks-out. The proprietors in certain collieries even reduced the price due to the men. They said, "" We do not lock you out; the mine is open, but you must accept these conditions."" Was that treating the men equitably and fairly ? within the meaning of the Act. that under the definition in the Act it is not a lock-out. The trouble comes in when the men refuse-and rightly so-to accept the reduction. They say, "" If the law of the land professes to regulate industrial disputes between you and us, that law should apply equitably. If you want to reduce wages, and we will not agree, you should go to the Court and get a decision."" But the employer says, "" My mine is not closed, and you can cut the coal at a cer'tain tonnage rate."" Then the men stop work, and the papers from one end of Aus* tralia to the other cry out about the men striking, when, as a matter of fact, a lockout has taken place. If we added to that definition the provision that no alteration of existing conditions of employment shall take place without it being mutually agreed upon or decided by the Court, the Act would operate fairly and equitably between master and man. As now worded, it does not, and the men are often forced in defence .of their rights to refuse to accept certain conditions which are offered to them, and then they are accused of striking. Honourable members opposite need never expect anything else until they gave a greater measure of fair play to the industrial unions which come under the Act. If I had time. I could cite many cases where what I have described has happened. This has been the means of breaking down the faith of unionists in arbitration and of leading to the state of affairs which existed previously, and which is not good for employer, employee, or the community generally. Then honourable members opposite say, "" What about the freedom of the employee? He should be given the utmost freedom to do what he likes; we are in favour of trade unions, but every man must have the utmost freedom to do what he pleases."" That is a revival of the old cry of freedom of contract. In days gone by it was alleged that the individual ought",14,Preference To Unionists

They would as soon support an honourable member on the other side as me. mental condition? member may be surprised, but I have stated the position. WhatI was contending was that trade unionism must go hand in hand with political unionism. Trade unionists have battled for centuries to improve their conditions, and have now reached the stage when they come under the law as organizations, and they are therefore bound to endeavour to send men into Parliament who will be prepared to look after their interests. What was the position in the past ? Labour had no representation in Parliament, and the laws were made by one party only, a party that always looked after vested interests. tinue to work outside the halls of Parliament while there is a power above them in Parliament making the laws to which they must submit, they can do no effective work. Their only hope now is to elect their own representatives to Parliament who will do what is possible to realize their aspirations by placing on the statute-book the necessary legislation to better the position of the toilers of the country, and secure for them the rights to which they are entitled. as the honourable member has described, that he suggests should be given this preference ? 1 to suggest that. I have here a work by Isador Ladoff dealing with this very question, from which I shall make a short, quotation. The writer saysI f this is true in respect to the exploiters of labour, can it be otherwise in respect to the exploited labourer? If politics prove to be the mightiest weapon in the hands of the capitalists, would it not prove suicidal on the part of Labour organizations to keep out of politics? "" Politics are corrupt,"" claim the simon-pure trade unionists. Granted that this is true, we still ask these venerable advocates of non-resistance to political evils the following pertinent questions : Is the fact that a weapon is misused by some miscreants an argument against its rational and beneficial use? Should we refuse the use of a sharp knife Tor cutting bread, beI t is for this cause some criminal uses a sharp knife for cutting his victim's throat? Are not the exploited labourers committing an offence of omission in refusing to become a factor in politics because the capitalist and his retainers are guilty of a crime of commission in using politics as a means of perpetuating and intensifying their dominion over labour? But the ""pure and simple "" trade unionists are ready with the retort that they are not objecting to the exercise of civic duties by the labourers as individuals, but as members of a Labour organization. The flimsiness of this sophistic distinction without a difference is too obvious to need further elucidation. Later on, he saysBut political action, far from being a menace to trade unionism, is as a matter of fact its most reliable support. The real foundation of trade unionism is skilled labour, as was the case with the guilds of the middle ages. The most successful unions are those whose craft demands the highest individual training, and it is hardest to organize unioDs among ordinary labourers. The tendency of our modern industry is to do away as far as possible with the necessity for skill on the part of the labourers. In other words, the tendency of modern industrialism is in the direction of undermining the very foundation of trade unionism. It is only by conscientious and systematic exercise of political action that the labourers may expect to battle successfully for their economic rights.

This community will never be free from industrial troubles without the representation of industrial bodies in this Parliament to secure legislation in keeping with the demands of Labour. Quite a number of honourable members, in speaking yesterday, appeared to be without ammunition to sustain the charges made against the Government. As a consequence, they resorted to what I consider very unfair means in prosecuting their attack. I allude chiefly now to the honourable member for Kooyong. Dealing with the question of preference to unionists, the honourable member went so far as to say that it means "" the spoils to the victors,"" and "" corruption."" He made another statement in which he charged the Labour party deliberately with inviting violence, and said, further, that they incited to murder. liberately in this Parliament. member endorse the statement? I wish to say that, even in a censure debate, it is playing it rather low for an honourable member to make use of a statement of that kind by an individual, as an excuse for charging the Labour party with inciting to murder. contemptible act for any honourable member to be guilty of. Are we to be publicly branded as men who are prepared to go to the extreme of corrupting our Government Departments ? Are we to be assailed with the accusation that we are likely to incite persons to murder ? In connection with certain statements made by some honourable members opposite, I would be equally justified in retorting that the party to which they belong are responsible for those statements. But I know that all the members of that party do not approve of them. They do not approve of revolutionary bloodshed. Yet some honourable members on the Opposition benches have the temerity to charge us with inciting persons to murder, although they know perfectly well that the statements upon which their accusation is based are not approved by this side of the Chamber. declaration? look after himself. I am merely speaking on behalf of the Labour movement, and I say that the history of that movement proves that it is one of the cleanest that has ever been known to the politics of Australia. The honourable member for Kooyong ought to be the last man in the world to level the charge which he did against the Labour party. I have always endeavoured to do what was right-to act conscientiously-and I will not allow such an accusation to pass unchallenged.' I say that any man who makes a charge of that description against others should be clean himself. He should first put his own house in order. He should not allow it to be stated inferentially that when he was in a position of authority he was guilty of certain things. What do we find in connection with the honourable member? I hold in my hand the report of a Select Committee in regard to the transfer of a Mr J. R.

I merely wish to say that if ever there was anything bordering on corruption in a public Department it was to be found in this particular case. A man named Jackson was employed in the Victorian Postal Department, whence he was transferred to the Lands Department whilst the honourable member for Kooyong occupied the position of Minister of Lands.

60,Mr Charlton,"They have simplytimes when the worker could not call his soul his own, when his very life blood was ground out of him! Honourable members opposite are prepared to assist this newlyformed association, which is running counter to the Acts passed by this Legislature. My honourable friends contend that preference for unionists is only for the advantage of members of trade unions. I shall show that the men forming the new union to which I have referred, and whom honourable members opposite will not disown, will get more preference than the members of any unions in Australia to-day. Listen to thisThe Society's Labour Bureau secures to "" Free Workers"" employment in the best workshops and factories, free and willingly. There is to be no trouble for these people as to obtaining employment. We have an instance of that in connection with the Sunshine works. 1 am sorry that there should be trouble there now. But when you force genuine unionists to work alongside free labourers there is bound to be trouble. The same has occurred at Lithgow. The two classes of men cannot work amicably side by side. It must be remembered"" that trade unionism to-day is too strong to be overthrown. Men have become wise enough to realize, not only rhe importance of Industrial organization, but of political combination, so as to return sufficient members to the Legislature to look after their interests. Of course, the object of the employing class is to break up unionism. Having realized the impossibility of breaking it up at the ballot-box, they have introduced this new system. The men who give their support to "" the new unionism"" will be able to get employment at any time and in any place. They will secure preference over the old unionists by assisting the employers to break up unionism. But are the men who haye stood the brunt of the fight, the men who have paid their contributions year by year to trade unions, the men who have done their utmost for the uplifting of their fellow workers, to have their standard of living lowered by the introduction of this element? I say, without fear of contradiction, that the trade-union movement has done a vast amount of good work in this country. The working classes would not be in so good a position as they are to-day had it not been for united action. But all the advantages that they have secured will be brought to nought^ if this new movement, which is running counter to the recognised trade-union movement, is to prevail; and if honourable members opposite are going to support these men, and to claim employment in the public service for them in preference to bond fide trade unionists, I have not the slightest doubt that they will find the people of Australia against them. any proof that the employers are behind this new movement? must be dull j I did not think he was so thickheaded. escape from this fact-that if my honourable friends are opposed to the granting of preference to unionists, "" other things being equal,"" they are holding out assistance to those who are concerned in this new movement, which, if successful, will bring about disaster in the Commonwealth. For that reason, and that alone, there is sufficient justification for the action the Government have taken. No one can reasonably censure them' for insisting on the principle of preference to unionists in connection with casual employment under the Commonwealth. This principle does not affect the permanent employee's at all. They are governed by the Public Service Act, which is administered by the Public Service Commissioner. On Sunday last, when I was reading a book in the public gardens, i l overheard a conversation on the part of two men, who appeared to be permanent employee's of the Commonwealth. These men spoke of the danger of being dismissed in consequence of this granting of preference to unionists. One of them said, "" Have you not read the leading article in the Age, which says that this applies to us?"" I am very much inclined to think that the people of Australia, and especially of Victoria, are too ready to pay attention to articles which appear in the daily newspapers. After all, an article is merely the opinion of one individual, namely, the editor of the newspaper in which it appears. The party to which I belong never had any such thought, and honourable members opposite, if they would do us justice, are well aware of that. They know that the Public Service Commissioner has to deal with all the permanent employees of the Commonwealth, and that there is no proposal to interfere with them. Since the Labour Government came into office, there has not been a single charge laid at our door of an attempt to interfere",19,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

They are disconcerting to the speaker, and prevent him from pursuing his argument. member for North Sydney took up a very peculiar position last evening. He argued that the members of the party supporting the Government were sent to this House mainly by one particular class of workers, namely the Shearers Union and the rouseabouts. for me, I have no members of the union referred to in my electorate. miich like to represent such a body of men as shearers and rouseabouts. But the honourable member went on to say that the Shearers Union .does not number above 50,000 persons, anff yet has been able to place the Labour party in their present position. I would ask him how 50,000 men could return a sumcient number of honourable members to govern this country? I think that he must admit, on calm reflection, that there is some other reason for the attainment of our position. misunderstands me. I did not say that. honourable member that he did make the statement. Indeed, he went further, and said that only about one-sixth of the electors are trade unionists, and that the remainder are outside the trade unions, and have always supported, the Liberal party. If , as he says, we have one-sixth of the electors on our side, and his party have the remainder on their side, I do not understand why he and his associates are not controlling the affairs of the Common^ wealth. It all goes to show that the Shearers Union is only a small factor in ' connection with the political machine. Certainly, the Shearers Union embraces politics, and is affiliated with the Political Labour League, as are many other unions. There are some unions which are not so affiliated. My contention is that trade Government unionism must embrace politics. It cannot be content to go along in the old groove, because the combinations against trade unions are to-day too strong. The combinations on each side have grown to such ab extent that we must legislate to control them. We must try, as far as possible, to get some machinery to mete out evenhanded justice to aU. That is what we 011 this side are trying to bring about; that is why we were returned here by the people of Australia, and not by any particular trade unions. If I had to depend upon the support of trade unionists oriTyrI would not be here to-day.

They had to show that they I wish I had. I would very possess some ability in order to attain the offices. They are not paid agitators, as is often claimed here, but men who are honestly trying to do their best in the interests of the whole community. They are not desirous to have any upheavals, but are anxious to get legislation of a satisfactory kind, in order to prevent such things, and think that preference to unionists must berecognised in connection with any particular legislation, before it can gain their approval. The proposal of the Government is not mandatory at all. If I were sure that it was permitted by the Constitution, I would vote to-morrow to make preference to unionists mandatory; and in doing so, I would consider that I was doing my duty not merely to my constituents, but to the whole of the people, inasmuch as I would be taking such action as was necessary to prevent industrial upheavals which would be detrimental to the best interests of Australia.",20,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

Commonwealth is the direct employer of this particular class of labour. It requires certain work to be done.

When, however, unions require the safeguards of the State, the State has a right to inquire what the objects are; and if it be found that unions are being used for political propaganda, and wrested away from their original objects, the State has a right to make such stipulations as will safeguard those objects and put the unions in their proper place in the community. When unions ask for special advantages, the State has a right to enforce certain safeguards, so that the unions may keep to their industrial sphere, and may not use their funds for the purpose of carrying on political propaganda. That has always been my attitude in this House, and that is the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, and, I believe, of every honourable member on this side of the Chamber. We are not against trade organizations, and we are specially favouring some free-workers' organization, which is said to have sprung into existence.

It is quite true that after a man has been given employment he may have questions put to him by the check weighman, but his being a unionist is not made a condition of his obtaining employment. As a matter of fact, what happens is that a coal-miner, having obtained employment, is asked at the end of the first fortnight to pay a fortnight's contribution to the union.

If he did not pay the contribution I expect that, as I have already said, he would be summarily dealt with. In other words, the union representatives would call the attention of the boss to the fact that he would not join a union. That has been the rule, I believe, in all coal-mining associations in the Old Country for the last 200 years, and there has never been any trouble on that score. The miners there have won these advantages for themselves by their own voluntary organization. They have never come to Parliament to ask that this kind of thing should be done for them. If a union can, by voluntary effort, while acting within the law, win for itself these advantages, more power to it ; but that is altogether different from the proposition that unionists should ask Parliament to direct that a man, before being given employment, shall produce a union ticket. liament.

The point I am endeavouring to make is that I have never been associated with a union which has aimed at securing, as a condition of employment, the production of a union ticket, or any proof that the applicant for employment belongs to a union. The Prime Minister told us yesterday that in connection with their proposal to give preference to unionists they would take no notice whatever of a man's political opinions. Such a matter, he said, did not concern them as a Government. I have no doubt that the right honourable member made that statement bond fide.

The honourable member and I are doing very well here, and had better let well alone. I am not anxious lo try conclusions with the honourable member in that regard, but I am pointing out that preference,' as proposed to.be carried out, does mean exclusion. The"" honourable member for Corangamite denied that the other day to his constituents. It has been denied by the Prime Minister. It has been denied by nearly every speaker opposite, but here are the facts. A man who is not fortunate enough to belong to a trade union cannot get a job under the Government when there is a trade-unionist offering for it. He must stand outside and pay the taxes so that another man may get a job from which he is debarred, not because he is a non-unionist in principle, but because he happens to be in a district where there is no union for him to join. there is no preference. member evidently has not considered this to hear the Government corroborate that matter.

You cannot begin to test present time is to make union tickets interthe principle until that is assumed. Therechangeable. fore, before a man can get a job as a carter or driver under the Government, he must occurred""? first produce a certificate that he is a member of the Carters and Drivers Union. Similarly, if he wants a job under the Gothe case of a number df unions. In the vernment as a labourer, he must produce case of the Australian Workers' Union and a certificate that he is a member of the Railway Workers' Union. Labourers' Union. So long as there are members of unions offering for this work, every one else is shut out, although it may not be a man's fault that he is not a unionist, and though he may have been a unionist long ago. SoI say that this proposal of the Government penalizes some of the straightest and best unionists, so far as the principle of unionism is concerned, that ever existed on this planet. It does not mean only the ruling out of non-unionists who do not believe in unionism, but individuals who are unfortunate enough to reside in a place where there does not happen to be a union which they can join. It means something further. It means, I take it, so far as its interpretation by the Government is concerned, that a man may not transfer from one union to another, in order to secure employment. If a man is a member of"" one organization he may not apply for a billet under the Government in a Department which is controlled, as to its labour, by another ""organization. He must confine his application to positions strictly within his own particular sphere as a unionist, so far as Government work is concerned. Mr J. H . CATTS -That has never been stated.

209,Mr Joseph Cook,"I speak of thelittle union at Lithgow, they now detach the matter from its context, and seek to make it appear that I then advocated something which I am not advocating to-day. I have said that every man should be equal before the law for the reason that every man pays taxes, and is obliged to defend his country. These obligations are laid upon every man irrespective of social or political organizations. They are laid upon nil alike in respect of their manhood, and unqualified in any way. Every man is charged alike for services rendered by the Government. Letters and telegrams are delivered to men whether they are unionists or non-unionists. Every man may use the telephone under the same conditions, whether he be a unionist or a non-unionist. There is no preference to unionists in carrying out these services and charges. We can make no distinction, no discrimination, no qualification of any kind as between individuals, so far as the general functions of government are concerned. While we deal out fair play to every man with respect of those vital things which affect his standing in the community, it is now proposed to depart from that rule, and to treat unionists differently from other persons. Moreover, this departure seems to me to be doing despite to the spirit of that law which was passed only last session. Honourable members will recollect that the Government brought forward a Bill whichprovided for the granting of an unqualified preference to unionists, and that they were obliged to remodel it because they found that their proposal was unconstitutional. We all remember how, ultimately, they decided to leave the granting of a preference to unionists to the discretion of the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Now they are going behind the decision of Parliament, and are attempting to do something which departs considerably from the spirit of its action. Then the Public Service Act prohibits the granting of a preference of any kind. It lays down the hard and fast rule that there shall be one standard for entrance into our Public Service-the standard of efficiency and good conduct. And if the Government are going to grant a preference to unionists in the case of casual employees, why not extend the principle to the permanent officers of the service? Why should they be debarred from participating in this preference-me n who have established themselves in the good opinion of the Public Service Commissioner, of this House, and the country -me n who have shown that they are equal to the faithful discharge of their duties? If we are going to be logical, why not carry the matter still further, by providing that promotion within the service shall be preferential? If preference to unionists is a good thing, why should it not be made a condition of promotion within the service, as well as of the securing of casual employment? Why is this preference desired ? Here are some of the statements made by honourable members opposite in this connection : At a meeting the other night, the Minister of Trade and Customs referred to the Lawyers Union, and affirmed that lawyers had to pay £50, and subject themselves to other forms of discipline and organization, before they were permitted to practise at the Bar. Of course, there is no analogy between the two cases, inasmuch as the lawyers themselves do not make these stipulations. The law of the country gives the Chief Justice the right to impose these conditions, purely in the interests of clients. A standard of ern-; ciency is required [ of efficiency. I always thought it was. reached the standard are not making bread and butter. that is so. But as we cannot make a rule to fit every case, we have to do the next best thing. By requiring lawyers to reach a certain standard of knowledge, and to be possessed of experience and ability, clients are guaranteed that the advocates whom they employ will be qualified for the work which they are called upon to perform. But what has that to do with the granting of preference to unionists in the case of casual employees? The Minister of Trade and Customs also stated that the doctors had a union, and that the members of that union would not work with non-union men, and insisted upon union rates of pay. I believe that is the case. In many parts of Australia the British Medical Association has recently laid down a scale of fees to be charged by doctors to friendly societies. The doctors affirm that those union rates are reasonable. The Minister of Trade and Customs stated the other night that he approved of the doctors",29,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

Minister was dealing with it, and it is my duty to tell him that a very large number of unionists in Australia are in revolt against the union fees which the doctors have seen fit to impose. Strikes are actually occurring amongst the doctors throughout the country in consequence of their endeavour to enforce these fees. doctors. favour of the unionists or the non-unionists ? I think I have shown cases in which that to ask my honourable friends opposite where they stand. If my memory serves me aright, there is a strike of doctors at present in the city of Goulburn. Does the honourable member for Werriwa support the doctors in their demand for union rates and for the granting of a preference? Is he with the doctors in defence of their unionism, or is he with the men who decidedly -object to the union rates which the British Medical Association has laid down? Really, my honourable friends ought to leave these parallels alone, because they have nothing whatever to do with the particular case which we are considering -referring to what he called a "" scab,"" who At the same meeting the honourable member for Batman saidThe Government was only applying to its own and a non-unionist who had not had faciliemployes what the law insisted should be applied to others. I have never known of a more direct missult Mr to ROBERTS -W statement of the facts than that. Does he is anything like a "" scab."" the law insist upon the application of a preference to unionists? The honourable member ought to know better. If he does out that the non-unionist will be denied not, the lookout for him, as a lawyer and employment under this Government prea legislator, is a poor one indeed. The ference scheme as long as there is a man law insists upon no such thing. It simply actually in a union who can take the job. declares that the President of the Arbitration Court may grant a preference at his the honourable member thinks. discretion. Thus, my honourable friends will not tell the people outside the facts of in the Act of 1904. the situation. They continually slur them over, and tell their hearers fairy tales which a strong argument of my honourable friends are miles distant from the facts. Then the honourable member for Coapplied under the 1904 Act under such rangamite declared last night that preconditions as to make the granting of it ference to unionists was required to practically useless. I have heard that prevent that class from the possiargument used from the front bench-it bility of victimization when an award has been described as "" preference under had been given. How can that apply to the proposal of the Government? Is it suggested that if preference to unionists be not granted the Government Departments will victimize a man ? Have we come to that under labour rule in the Commonwealth? Do unionists diesire protection from the victimization of these Departments ? It would appear so from the statement of the honourable member. I repeat, are we to infer that unless a preference be granted to unionists men in the Public Service will be victimized under the Labour regime. The honourable member went a little further and said that preference to unionists really meant protection for unionists, and did not mean that non-unionists should be dismissed or refused employment. must be so-in which non-unionists must be refused employment whenever there is a unionist to take it. And remember, always, that non-unionists may very often be so by reason of their circumstances and surroundings, and should not be condemned simply because they do not belong to unions. No one has insisted upon that distinction more than the honourable member for Darling, who is now on the high seas. a non-unionist was not entitled to Christian burial ? would take another man's place; but he made a distinction between such a person ties for joining the union. a mere e all do; it is an innon-unionist to assert that opposite has been that preference was",30,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

223,Mr Anstey,The same provision was,31,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics
224,Mr Joseph Cook,"1 believe thatimpossible conditions."" Why, then, does my honourable friend suggest that what is now being done is the same as has been granted since 1994? Then we have been told that preference is required so as to protect unionists who have worked for and paid into their unions. By parity of reasoning, that is an argument against the Government grant of preference at all, because all men pay into the Government union. All men in this country are in the great general Government union. All men, if they are good citizens, work for the Government in conntexion with the various social institutions of the country. If preference is to be granted to unionists because they work for unions, and pay into them, by parity of reasoning the Government should not grant preference to individuals in their service, because all have to pay, and because all good citizens work for the maintenance of the union. The very argument offered by honourable members as a reason for granting preference outside is a reason why it should not be granted by the Govermnent themselves. Then what has become of the "" equality ot opportunity "" which has been the watchword of reformers for ages past, and especially of my honourable friends opposite? opportunity for all men. Here is a direct blow at that principle. The breaking down of caste and privilege, a work of almost superhuman dimensions, has been steadily sought to be accomplished throughout the length and breadth of this country, and, indeed, in every other country. Trade unions, I believe, have done immense service in times gone by in the direction of breaking down such privileges, and confirming the principle of equality of opportunity. But now, having broken down almost the last vestige of privilege, having made every one equal at the ballot box, having made every one free as far as the expression of his opinion goes, having respected every man's mode of worship, having abolished every semblance of favour in connection with the laws and the Public Service of the countrynow, forsooth, my honourable friends are seeking to set up another kind of privilege under the sagis of the Government. They are seeking to impose new barriers against the free expression of opinion. They are declaring at this time of day-in this twentieth century that Government preference shall be given to men who work in their political unions, who contribute funds to support a particular political party, and that no others need apply so long as vacancies can be filled by unionists. the honourable member advocated doing when he was secretary to a union at Lithgow? member knows nothing about it. member has admitted. ferring to the honourable member for Nepean, who made a certain observation.

239,Mr Thomas,"Except for Mr Smaileter-General is quite right. If a certain reverend gentleman had not been taken ill and gone to bed I should not have entered politics at that time. All that I want honourable members to understand is that I did my best to keep out of politics. I always tried to the utmost-and I was always successful in my efforts, too-to keep out of the union every tinge of politics and the influences which were sought to be insinuated into the union from the political organizations in Sydney. I believe that there was no political labour league at Lithgow until a few years ago, so that when honourable members taunt me with having belonged to a Political Labour League, and all that kind of thing, they do not know the circumstances of the case. However, let us get away from that matter. My point is that we have broken down all those vestiges of preference and privilege which have marked the evolution of our history, and that honourable members opposite are beginning to set up another kind of privilege. They are departing from the old-time system of voluntary trade unionism. bemg purely political in its objective, it is seeking to part from the old-time voluntary collective bargaining ' methods by which all the real good which they have to-day was achieved. My honourable friends are embarking on a course which, I believe, will yet prove their undoing, and lead to disaster in this country. At any rate, I , for one, will not consent willingly to the erection on the old solid basis of trade unionism-whic h has stood so well to the workers in times gone by-of a system of tyranny and class privilege which, I believe, will be a bane to the workers themselves, and lead, if carried to its logical effect, to the undoing of this great country. [4.43] I have always listened with pleasure to the honourable member for Parramatta; but I must say that this afternoon he has gone further out of his way than usual to misrepresent the case. Of course, in argument, misrepresentation may be a strong weapon, and it may be almost a waste of time for me to refer to any points in the honourable member's speech. It might be better, perhaps, for me to commend the speech to the workers of Australia, especially to those who were responsible for sending him to Parliament. I am not one of those who join in the interjections which are usually fired at the honourable member in regard to having been elected as a Labour member, and that sort of thing. I think that the trade unionists who elected him are quite sufficiently punished for their actions when they see where he stands to-day. But in his speech there are one or two things which I must rebut from our side of the question. He would lead the public to believe that no man can enter a trade union without the payment of a huge sum. No honourable member knows better than he does that that is not true. The men who have always fought for preference to unionists have inscribed on their banner the principle that no unreasonable bar shall ever be put in the way of a man wishing to join a union. In New Zealand, where preference to unionists was first carried into practice in the Australasian Colonies, Mr Seddon, when he was asked by the unionists to make preference compulsory, laid it down that the imposition of high fees to join trade unions must be swept away, and a rule was agreed to, and embodied in the law, that any man could, on the presentation of 5s., and other things being equal, join his The new unionism has come, and, union. I shall never support any other system. I think it would break down the whole system of trade unionism in this country if we were to allow any union to put up a big barrier against outsiders becoming unionists. I admired the honourable member for Parramatta when he was so frank as to state that he would allow trade unionists to organize, but would refuse them political liberty. That is honest, anyhow, and trade unionists now know where they stand in regard to the'Opposition. thing, of course. able member said that he would allow unions to form and organize, but would not allow them to have any politics. He would refuse them liberty in politics, and yet on top of that he prated about the great liberty which has been gained by unionists. I would also remind the honourable member for Parramatta that our public servants have not forgotten that they did not have full civil rights as citizens of Australia until a Labour Government granted them to them. Not only is this Government the friend of unionists in fighting for political liberty, but it has conferred full civil rights on the public servants.

Of course, honourable members may go back, and quote their attitude on such-and-such a date, and show that they did agree to preference at a certain time. But we are so used to.honourable members on that side -to the Leader of the Opposition in particular-paintin g the glorious ideal there might be, and practising something totally different, that I take very little notice insounds all right j and the honourable member deed of what they did in 1904, or any other year. sentation by the honourable member for Parramatta was his statement that if a non-unionist went to the Prime Minister he would get no chance of being employed until every trade unionist in Australia was satisfied, or had employment. He would imply by his remark that if there were some unionists at Cape York, no non-unionist would get employment in Melbourne until they were brought down all that way. able member is aware of the extent of Australia. He knows how far men are distributed apart, and also the intention of the Government, as stated by the Prime Minister, as well as their practice. He knows as well as we all do that where there are no unionists to take the jobs non-unionists get them. Where men are required by a Department, and there is no union in the particular industry affected, non-unionists will be employed because there are no unionists. I only want the honourable member to be fair, and not to misrepresent the position. I have always maintained that we are delighted and willing, through the press, from the platform, and in this House, to fight a fair, square, honest battle on our principles, but we do not desire misrepresentation. I give credit to any honourable member on the other side who will oppose trade unionism? or preference to unionists, compulsory or otherwise, if he does so honestly, without misrepresenting the facts. I see that the daily newspapers have drastically misrepresented the Minister's proposal. In fact, when I glanced at a newspaper and saw what he was alleged to have done, I came here prepared to repudiate him;. I would not support any Minister, even though he were a Labour Minister, who would do such deliberate acts of injustice as. were alleged in the daily press. It seems to me that the Opposition is so short of real matter to bring up that they must follow the ridiculous fight which they put up a week or so ago when they erected a scarecrow about disloyalty merely in order that they might knock it down. So empty are they of genuine argument that their whole battlecry is one of misrepresentation. The honourable member went on to say that we had gained for the Australian workmen ""equal freedom before the law."" That is, in that regard, a worthy lieutenant of Another beautiful misreprethe Leader of the Opposition. The fact is, however, that there is no position in life where men are more unequal than before the law. Equality before the law means equality of cash ; the man with a big purse gets well ahead every time. 1 can well understand those who belong to the wealthy classes objecting to arbitration and preference to unionists, or to workmen consolidating so as to obtain the benefits of the law on more reasonable terms than hitherto. It is only by combination of this kind that workmen can hope for at least some equality in the future. However, I shall not waste further time on the remarks of the honourable member, but turn my attention to the Leader of the Opposition. I had not intended to speak on this subject of preference, but proposed to leave it to honourable members who are more directly interested in trade unionism than I am. My constituency is one of very mixed interests, containing a large number of raw producers on the land. Those men I have always urged to form unions, so that they may conserve their own interests, as do other wage earners in the community. I hope that every department of industry will be organized. Why should the man who works independently, and sells his produce in the market, not combine with others of similar occupation? Why should these men not fight for their own interests against those by whom they are robbed? If these producers would only take a leaf out of the book of the shearer, the carpenter, and the miner, they would get much more for their productions. Last week I paid a visit to a large farming centre, where I was met with the statement that a member of the party on this side of the House had said that trade unionists should be prepared to shed blood if necessary. The Leader of the Opposition insinuated, in the course of his speech, that the Labour party endorsed that sentiment; but I desire to give it the strongest repudiation.",33,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics
244,Mr Joseph Cook,"Oh, no !",34,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics
245,Mr Frank Foster,"The honorThose who oppose preference to unionists are really preparing bloody revolution, instead of arbitration and peace, as a means of solving industrial difficulties. We see the spirit that is moving men in London and Liverpool, and also on the Continent. the spirit of revolution-the weapon of the strike. What these men desire is not arbitration, or any peaceable arrangement, but rather a repetition of the French Revolution, in order to cut away the fetters that now prevent their obtaining justice. And our friends opposite are helping that movement when they oppose preference to unionists. What is the good of saying that there is freedom and fair competition amongst workmen? God help the unfortunate "" free worker"" when he has a wife and family at home wanting bread ! He is at the mercy of the employer, and always will be, until he joins his fellows in a union that will not only fight his battle, but, if necessary, provide him with food. But this union is just what honourable members opposite, whether knowingly or otherwise, are opposing-the y are, as it werer crucifying the weak. Much has been made of the return for which the Minister of Home Affairs asked as to the public servants who belong, and those wHo do not belong, to trade unions. I should like to see another return, showing by what preference members in the Public Service have gained their positions, especially those who have not passed through the ordinary channels of examination and promotion by merit. If there is to be such a noise about the return requested by the Minister, let us haye a return showing the preference given in the Public Service since Federation began. ber support a motion for such a return? only too pleased to do so. I believe in purity of administration, and no Government, Labour or otherwise, shall have my support unless its administration is pure. Last night the,right honourable member for Swan quoted the following words of President Roosevelt1 believe in corporations; I believe in trades training in order that our manhood may be unions. Both have come to stay, and are necessities in our present industrial system. But where, in either the one or the other, there depulsory preference to unionists in order velops corruption, or mere brutal indifference to that we may have an army of able-bodied the rights of others, and short sighted refusal to look beyond the moment's gain, then the offender, working men to fight the foes that beset whether union or corporation, must be fought; and if the public sentiment is calloused to the iniquity of either, by just so much the whole public is damaged. That is quite right, but the honourable member is unfortunate in the quotation, seeing that, in America, the brutal combination of wealth has actually created conditions which, I am afraid, can only end in revolution. The right honourable member What is that spirit? It is is only too willing to quote Roosevelt in regard to the combination of working men, but he omits any quotation in regard to the combination of wealth. In the United States the private employer, as a person, has been practically abolished. In no country in the world is the worker further separated from his real employer. So greatly have the trusts organized industry, that the people are asking why they should not form one unified trust, consisting of the whole of the people, and take over all industries in that country. Honourable members opposite pretend to be very much afraid of this matter of compulsion. Listening to the Leader of the Opposition one would imagine that the Government were proposing a complete innovation, and that in every other respect the people of .Australia had absolute freedom to do as they pleased. I suppose the honourable gentleman will not admit that a father is compelled to register the birth of his child, and that there are such things as compulsory insurance, compulsory voting, and the compulsory payment of taxes. pelled to register his dog. Every law passed by the Legislature practically means compulsion in one direction or another, yet a storm is raging over our proposal for compulsory preference to unionists. We have in force the system known as compulsory training, under which men are compelled to join a union known as the Australian Army and the Australian Navy, in order that we may defend ourselves against foreign aggression. Shall we then deny the right of working men to organize an industrial army in order to defend themselves from internal foes, who would rob them of their bread? Shall we not make war on poverty, on misery, and the possibility of revolution in this country ? No. We must have compulsory military fitted to stand up against a possible enemy; but it is altogether wrong to favour comthem-the foes of low wages, miserable homes, and abominable conditions such as should bring the blush of shame to the",34,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

On the one side we have the great organizations of capital; on the other we must have a great organization of labour, so that the two parties may meet, not in bloodshed, not in revolution, but on an equal footing to discuss their differences in an intelligent manner. I propose to make a short quotation from the Lords of Industry, a recent work in which the writer, H . D. Lloyd, deals trenchantly with the law of competition as being allowed to solve questions of this kind. Honourable members who fight against preference to unionists really desire that the law of competition amongst starving men shall prevailNew facts, like the union in one person of the common carrier and the owner of the highway, are baffling our statesmen. A few individuals are becoming rich enough tn control almost all the great markets, including the Legislatures. We feel ourselves caught in the whirl of new forces, and flung forward every day a step farther into a future dim with the portents of struggle between Titans reared on steam, electricity, and credit. It is an unfortunate moment for the breakdown of the science that claimed to be able to reconcile self-interest with the harmony of interests. He refers there to the old theory of political economy in regard to supply and demand. Later on he writesEqually beyond the reach of this competitive science is the Socialistic drift of modern governists are offering non-unionists shall be emment, which forbids self-interest to commit murder by the sale of adulterated food, which taxes property by a majority vote for the education of the masses and the regulation of their plumbing, and which in Great Britain offers to pay at the national expense the arrears of hundreds of thousands of Irish tenants. The labour question is the appearance among working men Of the same spirit of combination that has given us railroad pools, the telegraph consolidation, the up for preference to unionists in oil monopoly, and countless smaller "" corners,"" and it cannot be solved by a science of competition. Honourable members will admit that the day has come when we must frankly face this question. There has been much backing and filling, much dodging, and much resort to subterfuge; but I would give nothing for the integrity of the man who would seek to dodge this question. Let the employers be frank and straightforward. Let them tell us openly that they are organized, and determined to maintain the organization with which they fought the proposals which we submitted at the recent referenda with a view of securing for the Parliament power over trusts and combines. Let them honestly meet us, fighting as we are for the right of the people to meet them on an equal footing. We are willing to rely on the people in carrying on that fight. We are willing to be put to the test on election day, but ive are determined first of all to clear the track of the deliberate misrepresentation from which we have suffered. I desire to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition upon the new role he has assumed : that of a leader of anarchistic thought. His speech yesterday embodied some of the finest ideals of anarchy of which I have ever heard. "" Eliminate all restrictions,"" he said in effect, ""eliminate everything that restricts the people, and let them do as they please."" That really.is the ideal of theanarchists"" No law and no compulsion."" I compliment the honourable member upon his attitude. It is a phase of his political life that deserves some consideration from the House, and we should watch it carefully. I am thankful to the Opposition for raising this question, and am very pleased that they have cleared the atmosphere. There were various canards as to what the Ministry intended to do in regard to preference to unionists, but to sum up the whole position, we find that they are actually going to commit the crime of declaring that if two men of equal ability apply for temporary employment in the Government service, the man who is a unionist shall be given the preference. Further, they propose lhat where no unionployed as long as they are otherwise suitable. That is a teirible crime. I congratulate the Ministry upon practising what they preach. They have always preached preference to unionists so far as private employers are concerned, and I am glad that they have the backbone to stand connection with temporary employment in the Government service.

253,Mr Frank Foster,"This is a warunionism. Unionism, however, has made such strides that it is impossible now in any employment to have only non-unionists, and those who desire to prevent squabbling and strife should stand solidly behind the Government, and support the policy of granting preference to unionists. Those who believe in Christianity know that preference to Christians has always obtained in countries where the Christian religion is followed. When honourable members speak about the way. in which unionists have treated non-unionists, I would call to their minds the treatment that has been meted out to atheists by Christians in bygone days. Thank God, to-day, the Christians, because of the preference given to Christianity, have no need to talk about preference, and in a very few years every working man in the Commonwealth will be a member of a union. When that day arrives an end will come to the abominable industrial strife between unionists and non-unionists. Our friends oppositeare trying to fasten on us some quarrel with unionism, but I , personally, have no such quarrel, because I know that unionism has done much to improve the condition of the workers. Our quarrel is with unionism run mad I am sorry that the Minister of Home Affairs is not in his place. I told him that I intended to praise him, and I cannot praise a man so well behind his back as before his face. There is a good deal to be said in excuse foi him. We must remember his environment in early life in the great Republic whence he came. We know how things are done there. "" Spoils to the victors "" is the settled law, though its disadvantages are generally admitted by the community. In the United States, when one Government is succeeded by another, almost every member of the police force, and of the Public Service, is removed from office, and his place filled by a supporter of the new Administration. altered that. like to alter it, but it is difficult to do so. not be so bad, but, as it is, many men When a man has been waiting for years for a change of Government in order to get a place, he objects to an alteration just when' he thinks that the change is coming. Naturally the Minister of Home Affairs, having had his early training in the United States, thinks that "" spoils to the victors "" is the proper policy to put into force here, and, therefore, under his instructions, a circular was issued by ,the Director of Public Works which, after settling certain rates of pay, says that absolute preference must be given to unionists. The debate has toned down that declaration of policy to a great extent. The circular also says that in discharging present men non-unionists must be discharged first. It is claimed that the Director of Public Works, in giving that instruction, went too far, and I accept the statement, though had such a mistake been made in connection with a minute issued by any member on this side, the party would have been condemned unreservedly from one end of Australia to another. The director states, too, that the Minister desires to be furnished at once with a list of the non-unionists emplo}'ed, and he asks that the necessary inquiries be made, and the information supplied at once. No doubt the intention is to prepare a black list, or to give opportunities for the approaching of non-unionists with a view to compelling them to join unions. has denied that. denial. Certainly the compilation of a list will make it possible to do what I have suggested. I do not see why the names should be supplied, and hope that the Minister will withdraw the instruction. In the United States the application of the "" spoils to the victors "" system has given the most dreadful results. Even Judges lose their positions, and are replaced by others of a different political faith, whenever changes of parties occur. Consequently, there is not the impartial administration of justice there that we have in all other English-speaking communities. Lynch law prevails, and murders are frequently committed with impunity. Dynamite outrages are not uncommon, and there are depots where dynamite is stored for use in industrial disputes. Under the Minister's ukase, a man must be a unionist or starve. If the unions were perfectly fair in their treatment of their members, the position would conscientiously object to joining unions.

I hope that try has been striving for industrial peace for over twenty years. If honourable members opposite know better it is for them to say so on the floor of the House.

I have heard it repeatedly stated in this debate that the best industry, who were, of course, both in: workers are the unionists. If they are, why do they want preference, seeing that other things will not be equal? unionist is a better man than the other he will get the job without preference being required. A very dangerous principle is creeping into the unions of this countrythat is, they are limiting the work. I have been told by many a unionist that he is not allowed to do a fair day's work nowadays. honourable member an instance. Several years ago a firm that I know of used to have five loads a day carted from the wharfs to their warehouse; now only three loads are carted in a day. One of the men tried to do more, as it was a very easy day's work. then? same as now. that if he did more than three loads a day they would deal with him. He did not discontinue, and after a very little time they hit him on the head with a brick, and laid his skull open! The honourable member may laugh, but it is a very serious practice that is creeping into many industrial unions, and many unionists do not like it, because they want to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. It is for honourable members opposite, if they object to the practice, to raise their voices against it. If the principle introduced by the Government is to be the law of the land, we must have the unions run on fair lines. I have heard several honourable members complain in the House of that horrible speech of Mr Cohen's, and I hope to hear them say something about it outside as well.

The people agitated amongst themselves, and got their members to bring before their Parliaments the desirableness of introducing industrial machinery to make strikes a thing of the past.

It is a sign of the economic conditions. that prosperity leads to strikes. They used, at one time, to be put down to want of food. A good many of these strikes have been actually conducted after the award of the Court, or the Wages Board, was given. Many of them have been actually conducted in spite of the law. On 13th January last the timber workers of Western Australia struck. There is in that State a proper Arbitration Court, before which those workers were asked to bring their case.

It is very disheartening, after all the endeavours of the public to secure industrial peace, that we should appear to be as far off it as ever. cognition of unionism; that is the cause of all of them. unions, there would be some other cause. A suggestion was made in this State that the builders' labourers should be brought under a Wages Board; but what does Mr That the determination of the Board only apHannah, their secretary, say to that? During the day MrH . Hannah, secretary of the Builders Labourers' Union, received a letter will approach the tribunal established for from MrH . Stevens, Assistant Chief Inspector of Factories, stating that a request had been received by the Department from the Master Builders Association pf Melbourne for the appointment of a Special Board for builders' labourers, and that it would be duly considered. Mr Watt had, he wrote, directed him to say that he would be glad to know the views of the union regarding the matter. The management committee of the organization has directed the secretary to reply, stating the reasons why it is opposed to a Wages Board. I should like honourable members to listen to these reasons, because my reason seems to reel when I read themThey are, that a Wages Board does not recognise a union. Therefore, before we can have industrial peace, we must have every union recognised, and that means preference to unionI shall not read the ists throughout the land. That is a clear stateme'nt that we must have preference to unionists before we can look for industrial peace. that people who are opposed to unionism can get an award from a Wages Board. they should not do so. If they are honest, decent men, why should they not have the same privileges as unionists? The second reason is that I t does not deal with the whole of the conditions appertaining to an industiy. Then we are not to have industrial peace until Wages Boards are empowered by law to settle every condition appertaining to an industry. Will honourable members consider for a moment what that means? I suppose that it means that a Wages Board should have the right to settle what, for instance, shall be the profits of an industry. In these circumstances, industrial peace would appear to be like the will-o'-thewisp ; the nearer one gets to it the further away it appears to be. These are two of the conditions which, according to Mr Hannah, must precede the millennium of industrial peace. member quoting from? Hannah's letter which appeared in the Age of 23rd September. The third condition which is to precede industrial peace is seen in the objectionplies to certain portions of the State.

The honourable member for South Sydney told us last night that a great deal of industrial unrest arises from the fact that under existing conditions few people can ever become employers. In this connection, I have made a suggestion, which I now repeat. I ask what is to prevent our friends of the Labour party buying shares in these big industrial concerns, if they think they are so profitable? The honourable member knows perfectly well that if the workers chose they could soon own all the property in'this country. they become more intelligent. that it was a bad day wiien the small manufacturer was superseded by these large concerns.

I have felt inclined, many a time, when a man would not join our union, to try a little moral suasion on him: member mean by moral suasion? tween me and honourable members opposite is this-that I have never yielded to that temptation, whilst my honourable friends, by this very measure which they are insisting upon, have yielded to it. They are using the forces at the command of the Government of this great country to compel men to join their unions, and to contribute to their funds. That is the compulsion to which I object, and I shall always object to it. The barons extorted Magna Charta from King John because they were fighting for the freedom of the individual to buy and to sell as he chose, and to enjoy a measure of freedom. The battle of freedom has evidently not yet been won; but, despite this Government, I have no hesitation in saying that Australians never will be slaves. help contemplating, with some degree of satisfaction, the circumstance that this Government has been in office for eighteen months, and that this is the first attempt that has been made to challenge its administration. Nearly every Government makes some mistakes, and leaves itself open to censure on some points. I cannot but believe that the Opposition in this Parliament has done its duty as an Opposition well. watched with microscopic observation everything that the Government has done. After the Government has been in office for a year and a half,, the Opposition now come along with a motion of censure on the single ground that Ministers have shown themselves in favour of preference to unionence under proper safeguards. Now, the ists. The Opposition in another Parliament in Australia have not waited eighteen months to find a cause of blame. They find fresh causes every day. But so successful has the Commonwealth Government been in the conduct of public affairs that it has practically escaped censure, except on account of this one subject. I had not the pleasure of hearing the speeches delivered from the Opposition benches yesterday, but I have heard the speeches made to-day, and have particularly paid attention to that of the honourable member for Fawkner. I cannot help thinking that the great bulk of what be said is very much like ""the flowers that bloom in the Spring."" It had ""nothing to do with the case."" The honourable member referred to the carrying out of Government works by day labour, as contrasted with contract labour. No doubt it was a very interesting subject to pursue; but what it had to do with this question I cannot understand. also referred to King John. number of matters that were quite beside the case. I have tried to focus the idea in relation to which the Government are being censured. What is it that they have done? Honourable members opposite have taken a great deal of trouble to tell us that they do not object to trade union's as such. There is nothing wrong with the unions. Of course any man, unless he were blind to the teachings of the last century, would admit so much. They also say that they do not object to preference to unionists. the Act of 1904, which gave preference to' unionists, said so. here then. for Fremantle had been here we may be quite sure that he would have gone with the party with which he is associated. Every one who was here at that time supported the principle of preference. The honourable member for Parramatta has quoted a number of sections of the ConHonorable members opposite have stitution to show that that instrument is against preference. Buti f the principle of the Constitution be against preference now, it was against it in 1904 when the honourable member supported the embodiment of the principle in an Act of Parliament. He told us that he did not object to preferdifference between honourable members on this side of the House and honourable members opposite on this matter is this.

360,Mr Hall,"Thjey do >not mind ascountry to go to the Arbitration Court and get a judgment is a matter of the expenditure of hundreds of pounds, and even then it is doubtful whether judgment can be obtained within a reasonable time. Mr them. Justice Higgins himself used the phrase that in order to approach the Arbitration Court to-day one has to pass through a "" Serbonian bog of legal technicalities."" The difference between us, therefore, is that honourable members on this side want to give preference in reality, while honourable members opposite want to send the workers into a Serbonian bog of legal technicalities. That is the true distinction. I want to point out to honourable members that an appeal cannot be made to an Arbitration Court without there being a quarrel. State quarrel, too. arbitration is to get a settlement of industrial disputes. It has been said, not once, but I suppose a score of times, by the Chief Justice of Australia that you cannot get to the Arbitration Court by merely having the appearance of a quarrel, by a secretary to a union merely writing a few letters demanding certain terms. fore the House? which we have had from honourable memhers on the other side. They have said, "" We do not object to preference, provided that it is got through the Arbitration Court."" 1 desire to show that, in making that statement, they really meant that they do not want preference to be given to unionists in any circumstances. They might as well get up and make that admission as pretend to be in favour of a preference which they know can never be made effective. The Chief Justice has continuously said that in order to get to the Arbitration Court there must be, not merely a paper dispute, not merely a demand by a number of workers^ or their secretary, for different conditions, but a real and substantial dispute existing. nearly culminate in a strike-no t merely a strike in one State, but a strike extending throughout the Commonwealth. to Wages Boards.

We have no power, I repeat, to create Wages Boards, and honourable members on the other side know that, apart altogether from the Court, preference to unionists is continuously granted by the employing classes. When a union has a quarrel and it is settled without recourse to arbitration, very often it gets preference to unionists. What is the contention on this side? Here is a Government which believes in carrying out certain projects which in times gone by were carried out by means of private enterprise. The Government proposed to build the transcontinental railway, when, by the way, the honourable member for Swan intervened and tried to block its construction by giving notice of a motion of censure? railway to be constiucted by contractois every contractor would have a perfect right to make a bargain with the unionists whom he employed; to lay down the terms and agree with them to give preference. member think that the difficulty, in getting to the Arbitration Court is a sufficient justification for the Minister usurping its power ? that.

Whatever may be said as to modern unionism, and its efforts to become a political force, no one will deny that in its day unionism has done a great deal, not only .for the workers, but for the community as a whole. For my own part, I am prepared -to support the idea of the unionists using their greater power by calling to their aid political effort to back up their industrial -effort. Men who are seeking anything have a perfect right to use the best weapons at their hands to secure it. The best weapon the unionist has to secure what he wants is the ballot-box, and so long as he relies upon it as the best weapon to his hand, so long is he likely to achieve the best results. It is to be remembered, however, that the great bulk of the workers in industries where fair wages and tair conditions of labour are observed owe a great deal to the unions for the position they occupy today. In every industry in which there is no union will be found a tendency to depress wages, and to keep the workers in a very wretched state. 1 look, by way of illustration, to the boot trade. There we have the male section of the trade organized in unions, but the female section unorganized, and .honourable member propose these casual and the part of those who form the unions; temporary hands shall join? affected. If , for instance, two men applied for labourers' work, one being a member of the Labourers Union and the other a non-unionist, the unionist should receive the position. Minister follow? That has not been settled. limitations are sufficient, and the instructions are definite. If two men apply for a position, one being a unionist and the other a non-unionist, the unionist, other things being equal, is to secure it. In every industry in which the workers are not organized, we find conditions under which it is impossible for self-re'specting people to pay their way and live. Take the position of the boot-trade workers to-day. In that trade the men are well organized. They have put their money into unionism, and have spent a great deal in industrial fights and legal fees. It has cost them some thousands of pounds to go to the Courts of ihe I wish honourable country; but on the whole they have obtained fairly good value for their money. Indeed, the value they have secured is as good ""as that which fhey could have obtained in any other way. They have substantially improved the lot of the average worker in the boot trade; but where women are engaged in the trade, and are unorganized, it will be found that it is most difficult for a self-respecting young woman to earn sufficient to enable her to pay reasonable board and living expenses. Wages Board? organized to take action. gaged in the boot trade belong to the men's union. trade in another State are now spending some hundreds of pounds in an effort to organize the women, so as to secure for them better wages than they are receiving. five Wages Boards for women engaged in the apparel trade alone. order to raise any business from the condition of a sweated industry to that in which a decent, self-respecting man or woman engaged in it can live, unionism is and, to say tlie least, those who have borne",46,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. spend so much time, money, and energy in organizing the workers in the industries with which they are connected, and in raising the standard of living, it is not unreasonable in them to expect to reap such rewards as the preference to which honourable members opposite take exception. In every industry in which conditions have been improved, large financial sacrifices have had to be made at one time and another by those who have been instrumental in organizing the workers, and the leaders of every movement for reform have been more or less victimized in consequence of their efforts to help others. Men such as the honourable member for Maranoa have suffered personally because they have assisted to improve the condition of those following the same occupation. Almost invariably union leaders have to forego chances of promotion. Foremen are required, men to take charge of operations are needed, and an employer in making promotions naturally chooses those who have always fought for his interests, and puts on one side those who have fought for the interests of their fellow-workers. ber instance specific cases? connected with the Arbitration Courts or with industrial enterprises knows of innumerable cases.

If a man claims from me £ 1 0 to which he is entitled, 1 pay the money. member does not pay away other people's money. a company, as Ministers are managers of the affairs of the Commonwealth, I would settle fair claims without compelling creditors to take me to Court. fair that unionists should have preference, they should not force them to go to Court to get it. Every member of the House believes in preference to unionists under certain circumstances. Efforts have been made to drag in questions affecting religious and political liberty. as industrial liberty? facture high-sounding sentences and finej perorations. It has been suggested that in giving preference to unionists we are set-; ting up unfair distinctions of the same character as if we gave preference to men of one particular religious belief over those, of another. That suggestion came from the Leader of the Opposition himself. lieve that, let them test it in this way:' They voted to give a Judge of the Arbitration Court power to give preference to unionists in certain circumstances. Will they give the same Judge the power to grant preference to, say, Roman Catholics in certain circumstances? They know very well that they would not. The two cases are entirely different, and there is no analogy whatever between preference to unionists and the suggested religious preference. Honourable members opposite believe in preference, on conditions, the conditions being those mentioned in the Act of 1904. We believe in preference to unionists, on conditions which were set out ber's party believed in unconditional preference, and, as they could not get it, they got as much as they could. religion, it is always a good thing to let a man state his own beliefs, and not to have them stated for him by those who are interested in misrepresenting them. We believe in preference, on conditions, the first being that other things are equal, and the second that the union which gets the preference shall allow all the men in the in the honourable dustry to join that union at a reasonable figure, if they want to. With those safeguards no evil can arise from giving preference to unionists. The action of the Ministry does injury to nobody. It certainly does no injury to the community as a whole, because if 500 men are wanted to do a certain work, and there are 600 men in the industry ready to take it, 100 of them must be out of work, and it does not matter to the community at large whether the 100 happen to be the unionists or not.

If he is too mean to part with his money for that purpose, it is good enough for him to run the risk of remaining unemployed, when other men, who put up their money to benefit the trade, are offering themselves for the work that is going. has been said outside the House by honourable members opposite that this debate is a waste of time. I do not view it in that light. It is a very necessary debate, and the more one listens to the arguments adduced, the more necessary it seems to me that we should apprise the people of the very peculiar move that has been made by the Ministry. I hope I shall be able to confine my remarks to the motion. I do not propose to discuss the question of unionism, or preference in the abstract. Every man can join a union if he thinks fit, and so the question of unionism is really not raised by the motion at all. It is a motion censuring the Government because they have now endorsed the action of the Minister of Home Affairs, as. shown in his circular, and are introducing preference by Ministerial act. We have already settled the question of preference to a certain extent. It is embodied in an'Act of Parliament, which was amended by honourable members opposite on that very point. They wanted to make the provisions as to preference more drastic than they are now; but they found they could not do so. They had the numbers, but, unfortunately for them, their first draft would not have stood the test of the High Court. They, therefore, put in as much as they possibly could in the direction of preference. The Judge ol the Arbitration Court is ordered to jive preference, if certain conditions set out in the Act are, in his opinion, fulfilled; but now we find that a Minister can do more in the direction of preference by a stroke of his pen than can the Judge, even with the powers conferred upon him by the Act. That is a very serious departure, and is altogether against the traditions of British administration. The preference given by the Act is judicial, and we know where we are indf-r it. Whether we agree with it or not, we have to obey it, because it is the law of the land; but Ministerial preference, as now practised by the Government, is a very -different thing, and opens up vast possibilities for Ministers to exercise the power, if they like, in a corrupt way. The whole thing smacks of Tammany, and although I have nothing to say against the bona fides of present Ministers, who will, no doubt, act honorably, we have to look at the possibilities. After these Ministers have left office, as they must in time, we may have people in office doing all sorts of corrupt things by Ministerial act, and so the. fair name of Australia-and it is a fair name, so far as the administration of Government Departments goes-ma y be brought into the disrepute that attaches to certain methods in the United States of America. We do not want that to happen in this country. We have heard a great deal on the other side about people paying into union funds, and about unionism in general ; but all that is really beside the question. The Government have not given us a straight answer to the charge levelled by the motion. We have learnt from them that they intend to grant preference, other things being equal; but ""other things being equal"" will not stand the non-unionist in much stead. I am afraid he will have a poor chance of being considered equal to the unionist. The Minister of Home Affairs has led the way in this matter. A few days ago he took the bit in his teeth, bolted with the Ministerial coach, and carried the Prime Minister far beyond where the right honourable gentleman would like to go. He issued a circular instructing his officers to give absolute preferenee to unionists. He comes before us now and says that the word ""absolute"" does not mean absolute, that it means ""other things being equal."" I have no doubt whatever that, in giving his instructions, the Minister intended that an unconditional preference should be given to unionists.

The Leader of the Opposition very rightly said that history shows that great struggles have taken place to secure religious, political, and industrial liberty. should leave religion alone. ber for East Sydney leaves it severely alone, and I wish he would leave industrial liberty alone in the same way. The proposal we are now discussing is an infringment of industrial liberty. The Government are not holding the balance equally between all parties in the community when they offer to a certain section a definite reward, or to those who do not belong to that section a bribe to induce them to join it as soon as possible if they wish to secure work in the service of the Government Departments. If that does not lay Ministers open to a charge of adopting the principle of "" spoils to the victors""-if it does not frighten people into the belief that corrupt practices may follow such a procedure, and that we may get what is known as ""Tammany"" rule in another part of the world, I should like to know what would, if Ministers have a right to extend a preference to unionists, what is to prevent a succeeding Government from extending a preference to non-unionists? Is a political fight to be waged every now and then over this preference question, merely because a particular Government happens to be in power? Is that the position which is to be set up when we have a country to develop, and our position to consider in the international race? Are great elections to be decided upon issues of that kind ? Yet it is easily conceivable that such a state of 'things may be brought about. If one party is prepared to extend a preference to unionists, why should not another party arise with a banner inscribed "" Preference to non-unionists?"" Seeing that we cannot get a direct statement from any Minister as to how far this principle is to be applied, I would like to know if it is intended to grant a preference to unions of -employers when they tender for contracts? The action of the Government also exposes -us to another danger, in that it does away with what should be the proper tests for -employment in our Public Service, namely, experience, merit, and efliciency. Hither-to we have prided ourselves upon the fact that under our Public Service Act promotion was to be by merit. But casual employees, who are sometimes without bread and butter, "" You shall have a billet if you can show your union ticket, but not otherwise."" If we are going to reduce Australia to that level, we shall do a most improper thing, and one which the Prime Minister in his heart does not endorse. ought not to be so impertinent. tinent to the right honourable gentleman, I apologize. ought to do so. the Prime Minister quite understood me. I merely said that in His heart he does not endorse the state of affairs which I have pictured. The Government are extending this preference to unionists at a time when it is not required, and when there is no strike to settle in regard to the temporary employees in our public Service. Owing to the new unionism which has arisen, there have been too many strikes in Australia of late. There were no less than seventy-five during the year ended 30th June last. That is a fine record for a country which is striving for industrial peace. There is no need to differentiate between the 19,000 temporary employees of the Commonwealth. The principle of granting a preference to unionists is an unfair one to apply to them. It savours of taking advantage of their necessities. They are not in the strong position of a first-class boilermaker, or of any other unionist outside our Public Service, who can always get a good job if he is a good man. It has been urged during this debate that unionists are always employed in preference to non-unionists because they are better workmen. If that be so, where is the need for this preference? I repeat that this is not the time when the principle should be enforced, because we are undergoing a period of industrial unrest. The day has passed when the old unionists fought for something in the shape of principle. At present our workmen are required to labour for only eight hours a day, and under proper conditions. In the States there are Wages Boards, and in the Federation there is the Arbitration Court, to insure that fair wages are paid to the employees in any industry. won by unionist agitation.",51,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

But do the unionists of the present day strive to uplift the masses? No. observe that the unionist objects to work alongside the non-unionist. the honourable member did not live in the good old days. live 200 years hence when this legislation will have ceased to have effect. The Government have chosen a very inopportune time to extend a preference to unionists without qualification, because at present we are not enjoying industrial peace. To take advantage of a man's necessities by compelling him to become a unionist is distinctly unfair. We have been told that by paying into a fund the unionists have secured certain benefits, and that, consequently, other individuals, who have not paid into it, ought to be compelled to do so. But that is only one side of the picture, and it is the lesser side. Although some people may be a little mean in staying out of unions wbich confer benefits upon them, that is not what we have to consider. I say. that a far more dangerous thing is done if the Government infringe in this way the liberty that so.much blood has been shed to obtain. That is the other side of the picture. May, intimation to the Postal officials that he would like to see preference to unionists established in connection with his Department.. In August, 1910, the Minister of Home Affairs issued a circular instructing his officers to give preference to unionist painters, ""other things being equal."" After that, the Trades Hall had nothing to say for the Minister for a few months. Then there was a secret meeting of representatives of the Trades Hall with the Prime Minister, after which it was announced that preference to unionists was going to be the policy of the Government. meeting; the papers are on the table. meeting, because the Prime Minister informed us that the secrecy was not in accordance with his wishes. After the issue of these Ministerial edicts, the Trades Hall passed a resolution approving of the action of the Minister of Home Affairs, and"" we find the Government galvanized into action, and introducing preference in this insidious manner. What has been done constitutes a grave danger, and leaves the Government open to serious attack on this ground alone. They know that their strength comes from In nine strikes out of ten we the Trades Hall. They know that unionism is the backbone of their party. They know that they have to obtain the nomination of unions before they can stand for Parliament. The whole Labour party is supported tooth and nail by unionists. But the Government, having been beaten at the referenda, have been whipped up by the unionists, and now intend to prey on the 19,000 necessitous people who are doing temporary work for the Commonwealth, to make them become unionists, and swell the Ministerial army. If a Minister can, by a stroke of the pen, do that sort of thing, the possibilities of corruption are very grave indeed. shown their business capacity. able member would show his. The charge is not against unionism, nor is it against preference in the sense in which it has been preached hitherto, and is embodied in our legislation. The charge is against granting preference by a Ministerial act. That is the reason why this no-confidence debate has been initiated. We want the people outside to know what their present masters are prepared to do. When in this Last House we were considering a site for Comthe Postmaster-General gave an monwealth offices in London, we insisted that tbe Government of the day should not be allowed to close a bargain until Parliament Had had a say in the matter. That was not nearly so serious as is this question. Nevertheless, we would not permit the Minister to take action "" off his own bat."" It is still more necessary to prevent Ministers from doing this sort of thing, which means far more to the community than the selection of a site in London. It is too big a thing; too many people are involved, no fewer than 19,000 being affected by this decision, which also attacks the living principles of liberty and justice-to give no secret a Minister a freehand in this way, without Parliament having a chance to consider the matter. The Government say that they are managers for the people. No manager who studied the interest of his employer would do such a thing as this without giving his employer the right to express his opinion. Who are the Government employers?

They are spending the people's money. iThey occupy office under the Constitution, which requires them to hold the scales evenly and fairly, and to do justice to all. I do not deny the right of unions to do their best for the attainment of their own principles. They have a perfect right by all legitimate means to do so. But that is quite a different thing from the central Government, which represents all the people, taking action in the interests of a mere class. The non-unionists who will be affected by this decision will have to pay their taxes just the same as the unionists. But simply because some of them may have grit enough to stand by their own conscientious objections, they will be denied employment by the Government. Of course, that does not trouble honourable members opposite. They have no pity for the working man. They only study the interests of the unionists. They come here mouthing about what unionism has done, and the privileges which it has won for the workers. We admit that it has done something. But Liberalism throughout the ages has done far more to secure those benefits which the working classes enjoy to-day than any union has done. m'ember going to connect these remarks with the motion before the House? Speaker. It is through the efforts of Liberalism in the past that we enjoy the measure of freedom which is ours to-day. We have whittled away privilege in every 'direction. Now the Government are going to reverse the process, and to set up another privileged class. The unionists are to be the aristocrats of the future. They are to be the privileged people of the community. We are going to set up an aristocracy of Labour. We have heard much declamation against tyranny and cruelty. What is the difference between tyranny practised by an hereditary aristocracy and tyranny practised by a trade-union aristocracy? It is tyranny just the same. Indeed, it is likely to be much worse, because, being inexperienced in the use of power, the new tyrants will not know how to exercise it wisely. The chances are that we shall see in the future much more cruelty, tyranny, and short sightedness than has been witnessed in the past. Hall, Melbourne, recently passed a commendatory resolution concerning the action of the Minister of Home Affairs in extending preference to unionists, to the temporary employees of his Department. It was carried with loud cheers. Then a gentleman named MrL . Cohen, Vice President, in seconding the motion, saidThe Minister for Home Affairs, Mr O'Malley, was deserving of the highest commendation of the council. The Federal Ministry was carrying out the platform of the Labour party. I have shown that this principle was never on their platform, and that they had never preached itThe members were elected to give preference to unionists. Certainly in accordance with their platform, but not in this wayNon-unionists should be put off the face of the earth. Senator Rae had said that any violence done to non-unionists was justified. 'He agreed with that view. (Dissent.) If they were shot or put to death it was no more than they deserved. This statement was made the other night at the Trades Hall to a body of men, who, for all practical purposes, are above the Government. there was dissent when Mr Cohen made that remark. that this is a fair statement of the views of honourable members. I do not say that every or any member opposite would be guilty of using such un-Christian terms in respect to anybody, and I cannot underoath of allegiance to obey the King's laws, which is imposed on every member of Parliament, could find it in his conscience, or anywhere else, to give utterance to such a barbarous sentiment. I do not say that all honourable members opposite are tarred with the same brush. I do not mean to suggest that they applaud such statements; but this Ministerial preference is introduced at a time when too much of that sort of language is indulged in. It tends to show that the old trade unionist-the man with some manliness and some principleshas passed away, and given place to a set of demagogues qr agitators, who, having no principle to fight for, must stir up strife in order to keep themselves secure in better billets than they ever had before. If we have come to that pass in the community it is time that we took cognisance of the action of any Minister who gives aid to a movement of that sort.

Would the deputation from the Trades Hall have waited on the Prime Minister if the Postmaster-General's intimation of May last were being acted upon in regard to the thousands of employees in his Department? Would these gentlemen have visited the Prime Minister if the Minister of Home Affairs had been giving absolute preference in his Department? There has been a great stirring up of this question of preference by Ministers since the Trades Hall intervened.

They have introduced a principle which is not included in their platform, and they are acting in a way which is altogether opposed to the best traditions of British administration, and which, thank heaven, was never resorted to by any other Government in Australia before them. orable and learned member who has just resumed his seat indulged in a fine arraignthe honourable member not to do so. ment of the Trades Hall, which, I may inform him, has no power over the actions of the Labour party in this House. it, does it? ber has wasted a lot of breath and time.

Would those employers send like cheques to trade unions in Australia? If we ever have trouble in Australia with regard to industrial matters, the way to it will have been paved by the action of these gentlemen in subsidizing free labour. tleman going to connect these remarks with the question before tbe Chair? ciliation and Arbitration Act provides for preference to unionists under certain conditions ; yet we have in this Commonwealth gentlemen who are subsidizing the .Free Labourers Union, which is out practically to fight other unions that are recognised by the law. When capitalists proceed to set working men against working men, the time must be coming when we shall have industrial troubles; and if ever blood does flow along the streets of Melbourne, or any other city in the Commonwealth as the result of industrial disturbances, it will be because of the action o i capitalists in subsidizing one set of workers to fight another set of workers for their food, their clothing, and their homes. I am proud to be associated with a Labour Government that is prepared to come out and to grant preference to those who are trying to build up the Commonwealth. I am proud that the Government are prepared to give preference to those who join together in an effort to provide, in a proper way, homes and decent food and clothing for their wives and children, and if that happy result can be brought about by industrial unionism, then this Government is certainly right in recognising anything in that direction that will tend for the good government, peace, and well-being of Australia. is to be regretted that during this debate I am not a thought-reader, most of the speakers on the Ministerial side of the House have dealt with preference to unionists, applied in a general way, as part of fhe policy of successive Commonwealth Governments. That is not the question before the House. The question we have to consider, in the terms of this motion, is whether it is not an abuse of Ministerial power for the Government to discriminate in favour of any one class of the community, seeing that it holds office as a custodian of the public money",56,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

This last step on the part of the Cabinet-thi s determination to use their Ministerial power in the interests of a particular class-is one which, if carried to its logical sequence, will mean the overthrow ot all power, authority, and discipline in this Parliament. if the Government use their power in the interests of one particular class, they will be able to bribe that class, in return for certain services, in a way that will bring about a condition of demoralization and corruption in Australia. In connection with this proposal, we aie confronted with the further serious danger that the Executive power of the Commonwealth is, apparently, to be used to force public servants to join unions, so that those unions may become affiliated with outside organizations in a way that will enable them not only to grip the policy of Departments as outside organizations have done, but to grip the administration of this Government. We have already declined in the general ethics and morale of politics in Australia, since we have in power a Government that is admittedly under the control of organizations outside Parliament altogether. every one in the community who has studied able member obtain his figures? the question, save those who are under the control of these organizations and who, wealtli Statistician.

I repeat that it was never anticipated that these outside organizations would grip the administration of Australia and direct this Parliament as to the way in which the public moneys should be expended, seeing that those moneys had been subscribed by the whole of the people. It is not difficult to see that if these outside organizations, and organizations of public servants, were pooled into one general body we should have substituted for our present free democratic institutions a kind of oligarchy that would expeditiously overthrow power, authority, and high-toned administration within this Parliament. The destruction of parliamentary authority, and the undisciplined bureaucracy that would be substituted for it, must bring us closer to disaster than most people imagine, unless it is nipped in the bud.

[9.22] -Before discussing the motion I should like to refer to some of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Wimmera, who gave us a long dissertation about the tyranny of unionism. Those remarks come with a very bad grace from him, because if there was any one who should not have given utterance to things of that kind, it was the honourable member. He should have a very keen recollection, as some others in this chamber have, of the fact that his own father, good Democrat that he was, was made the victim of a form of tyranny that has never been equalled or surpassed by any union.

When I was afforded an opportunity like this to show that tyranny has been practised on the other side, I think I had., a right, in defence of this party, to bring it forward. The honourable member quoted largely from the Age newspaper, but he did not quote from tliat journal when it took a certain attitude on the financial agreement which he advocated, and for which the Age described him as a ""bogus Protectionist."" member going to connect these remarks with the question before the House? the honourable member at the last election took up a certain position on the national policy of the country, the Age was very uncomplimentary to him. ber must not try to evade my ruling after I have called him. to order. I ask him now to confine his remarks to the matter before the Chair. heard some other remarks from the honourable member for Wimmera, and this is the last to which I will refer. He spoke of a certain family having a strong interest in the Public Service. I do not know whether the honourable member referred to his own family, because he has one brother in the Police Force, and another in the Lands Department. I wish to state, in as few words as possible, what I believe to be the Ministerial attitude in connection with the ukase or edict which has been issued, and to explain why I shall vote as I intend to do on this motion. It seems to me that neither the Ministry nor any member of it is guilty of the charge involved in this motion. The motion readsThat, in the opinion of this House, the preferences in obtaining and retaining employment recently introduced into his Department by the Minister for Home Affairs are unjust and oppressive. I claim that in their answers to questions put by the Leader cf the Opposition in this Chamber, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs have repudiated that charge. The Minister of Home Affairs could not have been giving preferences in the retention in employment of officers of the Public Service unless he took up the attitude that he was going to dismiss officers at present engaged in order to give preference to some persons outside the service who are unionists. What fuller answer could honourable members opposite want than is contained in the explanation given by the Minister of Home Affairs which appeared in the Argus of to-day? I quote the following:The Minister for Home Affairs( Mr O'Malley) last night offered a further explanation of the minute issued by him a week or two ago, and which he has stated was exceeded by his oflicers when they issued the instruction to works officers on Thursday last that in discharging hands non-unionists should be discharged first. The honourable gentleman made it clear that the officers misinterpreted his minute. He also saidHe had not expected his officers to interpret it in the way they had. The circular issued by the Department last Thursday to works officers need not be recalled, as it became non-effective. It had not been in accordance with his instructions. In reply to the question put by the Leader of the Opposition on the subject of the application of the principle in regard to retaining employment in the Public Service, the Prime Minister anterfere with any one at present employed in the Public Service. The Leader of the Opposition, in submitting the motion, made use of the following wordsWe have no intimation yet as to the methods or machinery which have been devised for the application of the proposed preference to unionists, and we must wait till we get the Prime Minister's reply for light to be thrown on all the dark corners of the question.",60,Member Abou T Two The Latter Are Opposed To The Present Day Tactics

604,Mr Parker,"The honourable gentleman admitted in his opening remarks that he did not know anything of the methods or machinery to be devised for the application of the proposed preference, and said he must wait for light to be thrown on the subject by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has replied to his questions, and the explanation of the Minister of Home Affairs has appeared in the Argus. I wish to know what further explanation honourable members opposite require to show that we do not propose to do the things we are accused of desiring to do. The only honourable thing to have done, in the circumstances, was to have withdrawn the motion, seeing that Ministers cannot be proved guilty of the charges laid against them. It appears to me that honourable members opposite have been bayonetting an imaginary foe for the last two days. They have been attempting to breathe the breath of life into the nostrils of their dead motion. They appear to be very angry and ill at ease, because Ministers have not admitted just exactly what they wished them to admit. The Leader of the Opposition saidUnder the new order of the Minister for Home Affairs we are to have a number of temporary employees of the Commonwealth Public Service selected on a new plan by preference to unionists, to be put into their positions without regard for the qualifications required foT the positions. That was a most unjust interpretation to place upon the action of the Minister of Home Affairs. stated that preference was to be granted to unionists, other things being equal. How, then, could the Leader of the Opposition affirm that a preference was to be extended to them without regard to the qualifications required for"" the position? The honourable member for Ballarat also askedW ill non-unionists appointed on tlie ground of greater personal qualifications or capacity be liable to be displaced in favour of unionists applying for appointment ? In reply to his question, the Prime Minrather than extend a preference to unionists ister statedNo alteration in the present method will be made in these respects.

The reason why so ifoeing equal. the iob. If my honourable friends opposite take up the position that the non-unionist should get it, are they not seeking to extend a preference to non-unionists? The Labour party are committed in their platform to the granting of preference to unionists. All we ask is what has been agreed to by the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Parramatta. The former admitted last night that he was a member of a Government which adopted the principle of preference to unionists. ployes in Government Departments. ciple is the same. ministered by the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. orable member for Parramatta does not deny that he was an out-and-out supporter of this principle some time ago. There are other gentlemen whose names I could mention in this connection. One of them is the present High Commissioner, Sir George Reid. He was the greatest opponent of unionism, and yet what was his opinion of it? He saidI know what I would do if I were in the position of a worker. I should join a union. The Minister distinctly I do not care what the unionist gets so long as he does not obtain it with legal sanction. he favoured the granting of preference to unionists in the case of Government employee's.

The honourable member will not be in order. conclude by saying that I have no sympathy with such remarks as members of the Opposition have attempted to saddle on this side of the House. I have no sympathy with those who advocate strikes in this country. that if such a meaning can be read into the action of. Ministers in issuing this edict for the granting of preference, as honourable members opposite have sought to read into it-if it were capable of such an interpretation-I should be just as strong in condemnation of such a policy as they are. But the points that have been raised have been effectively answered by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs. The charges outlined in this motion of censure, that the Ministry are giving preference to those in the Public Service, without taking into account their qualifications, and also giving preference in the retaining of employment, have been denied. Leader of the Opposition said that he would accept the Prime Minister's word. Prime Minister absolutely denied that the Government have any such intention, and 1 am prepared to accept his assurance. In supporting their proposal, we are only supporting what is on our platform. All things being equal, we propose to give preference to unionists, and in doing ""so, we shall be simply carrying out the pledges which we made to the people of this country eighteen months ago. I think that at this stage of the debate we can sweep aside certain issues which, so far as the motion is concerned, may be described as false issues. place, it does not call in question at all the wisdom of unionism. It is admitted, so far as most of us are concerned, that -unionism is, and has been, an essential means of improving the condition of the workers. In the second place, it is not a question of whether unionism has, or has not, helped on the matter of industrial reform; that is admitted. Further, it' is not a question of whether organizations are, or are not, necessary for the purpose of Arbitration Acts, It is conceded that they are necessary. And, lastly, even the principle of a discretionary preference-that is, a preference which is administered by a Court exercising a judicial discretion in the matters before it-ha s not been called in question. What, then, is really the issue that the House is called upon to decide? It is one particular form of preference only, and that is an absolute preference. The House is asked to say whether, in its opinionthe preferences in obtaining and retaining employment recently introduced into his DepartI say emphatically, however, ment by the Minister for Home Affairs are unjust and oppressive; prejudicial alike to the public interest, to the Public Service, and to the relations between Parliament and the public servants. That is the real censure which is brought against the Government. All the other matters on which hours have been spent in debate are so much dust, as far as we are concerned. What we are condemning the Government for is that they are introducing, not a discretionary preference, but an absolute preference. The proposal is, that where two persons of equal ability apply for employment-temporar y employment, so far-in the Public Service, othe'r things The being equal, preference must be given to the unionist. That is a mandatory preferThe ence, an unconditional preference. equal. tions ? If the two men are equal, and one is a unionist, and the other a non-unionist, there is to be no selection between them; but the matter is to be determined by the one fact,, that one of the men is a unionist. There is no other condition. In such a case the mere fact that a man is a unionist is to give him an out-and-out preference as regards employment. it is an exaggeration. a certificate of character, and a very high one, too. when two persons are equal in point of ability, the Public Service of Australia is to bow to the mandate of a union, and to accept its ticket as a certificate of character. the matter? a decision, I would decide the matter as it",63,Moloney W E Swered That It Was Not Proposed To In

We raise no objection to legitimate methods; but there are certain duties we require the public servants to fulfil in the interest of the taxpayer. The first consideration is efficiency. The honourable member for Corangamite gave a most eloquent discourse on the virtues of unionism, and what it has accomplished. He almost shed tears over sacrifices made-no t by himself, by the way, but by others-in the cause of industrial unionism. It is perfectly true that industrial unions have done a great deal in improving the condition of the workers in Australia; and we all rejoice at the fact. At the same time, it must be conceded that this has been brought about not alone by trade unionism, but a great many sympathetic men of enlightened judgment also have done much to enable unionism to succeed, and to further industrial progress.

I am not finding fault with the honourable member on that account. ber for Maribyrnong takes that view, I can only give him up as hopeless. I think every candid member opposite will admit that the argument advanced by Ministerialists has been that, seeing the unions have done so much, unionists ought to be rewarded. Hunter was very clear on the point; and he is to be congratulated on the plain honest way in which he put his case. The honourable member contended that the unions must be political, with political objects, and he pointed out that in the opinion of some unions the Labour party are not going fast enough for the unions. The honourable member went on to point out that the unions desired their own members to be selected to serve in Parliament in order to carry out their policy, beany person administering the public affairs cause the unions, which were political, ought to have political representatives. Under all the circumstances, it is quite clear that some honourable members regard these public offices as rewards for services lic money. rendered in the cause of unionism. The third reason for preference was given by the Prime Minister himself, when he referred to the administration of the land, between the, years 1893 and 1899. The right honourable gentleman said that, in Queensland at that time, public servants dared not express themselves in favour of the Labour party. If that was so, it was a shocking state of affairs, and I have no sympathy with it. ber can recall to mind, if he chooses to do so, one of those little incidents. thing of the kind; but what I ask the honourable member to do is not to repeat the offence. The Prime Minister finds fault with the Government oi"" that time, because it penalized servants who dared to favour one section of the political parties of the State. He is entitled to credit for the stand that he takes up in that Tespect, but his remedy for the^vil is not to do away with political influence, but to jrive a preference to unionists who may happen to be of one political complexion. He does not recognise that, as the result of this action on the part of the Government, men on this side of the House will be able to say later on that, during the years 19111912-no t after 1913-n o man desiring work in the Public Service dared declare that he was a non-unionist. Is that the remedy for the evil which the right honourable gentleman deplores ? What is the evil at the bottom of the Prime Minister's charge? It is, in effect, that men occupying public positions, intrusted with the administration of public funds, under the obligation of their office to act justly as beThe honourable member for tween man and man, absolutely fail in their duty when they give preference to one particular class. Men who do that are certainly worthy of the severest censure. The Prime Minister declares, however, that hitherto the administration, of the Commonwealth."" has been clean. That is our record up to date. Are we going to endanger it? If the Government think that there is a danger in this respect, what is the proper course for them to pursue? Is it not to pass a law that of the Commonwealth and occupying either a chief or a subordinate position money shall, in making temporary appointments to the Public Service, discriminate on no ground other than that of merit.

I desire to be straight. I always am; but the honourable member's ways are his own. The fourth argument is that, in private employment, some persons unjustly discriminate between unionists and non-unionists, and will employ a non-unionist in preference to a unionist. That is the charge made against private employers. Buti f private employers do take up that stand is that any reason why the Government should take away from themselves the right to discriminate-the right to pick and Department, the prompt despatch of the business choose between the best men. cause a private employer has in this way done a wrong, then the Government-the agents of the people, the representatives of the nation, the trustees of the public moneys-ar e also going to do a wrong. Because private employers, according to the Government, give a preference to non-unionists, the Ministry are going to employ only unionists. bers of the Labour party have declared that unionists are often treated unfairly by private employers of labour. Those four are the main reasons which have been advanced, none of which justifies this action. It is to be regretted that the Prime Minister, because of indisposition, for which we all are sorry, was unable to make a full statement of the position; but he promised that one of his colleagues would supply reasons for it. standing of the honourable gentleman's statement. At any rate, although the debate has lasted two days, no Minister has explained the full purport and effect of the policy of the Government. We have not been told why this new rule has been introduced, nor how it will be applied. Today we heard, for the first time, that the Postmaster-General gave effect to it in May last, though ifjhe honourable member for Werriwa said that he did not know when it came into operation. fence gave effect to it in March. formed why the rule was introduced, nor have we been told the area in which it is proposed to apply it. We have not heard from the Minister of External Affairs whether it will be applied to all the public works which are to be carried out in tbe Northern Territory, to the large railways and harbour works which are to be constructed there. In this matter, I would like to ask if the provisions of the Public ServiceAct have been complied with. Section 40, sub-section .1, of that Act saysWhenever, in the opinion of a Minister of a of a Department renders temporary assistance necessary, and the Commissioner is unable to provide such assistance from other Departments in the State in which such assistance is required, the Permanent Head or the Chief Officer shall select in such manner as may be prescribed from the persons whose names are upon the prescribed register in the State in which such assistance is required such person or persons who arc available as appear to be best qualified for such work.

728,Mr Groom,"That can be got over byWe have been given to understand that there is to be absolute preference to unionists, other things being equal. That policy has. been condemned as unjust and oppressive, as likely to operate against the public interest, and to prejudice the relations of Parliament with the Public Service. Parliament, in establishing an Arbitration Court, determined that it was necessary to organize the parties coming before the Court, so that cases might be properly presented; and agreed that it is fair, where the Court has given consideration to all the circumstances, to allow a preference to be granted to unionists. The Court may grant a preference where it thinks that course justifiable, but it may also decline to do so. That, however, is a different thing from what is now proposed. In a book entitled, State Experiments in New Zealand, by Sir W. P. Reeves, tlie writer, quoting the case of the Christchurch engineers, which arose in 1888, cites the judgment of Mr Justice Edwards:The claim of the union to a preference of employment, in my opinion, necessarily fails when it is ascertained that the union is not really representative of the greater number of ing the observance of awards. the workmen employed in the trade, and the claims of the union have not resulted in any practical benefit to the bulk of the workmen. whether the union contains a preponderparty judgmentance of the members of the trade which it represents. who has been a member of an Arbitration unionists, it is our belief, all things being equal, Court, says that a Court always asks that some at least of the employers will prefer whether a union represents the majority of non-unionists those employed in the trade or calling unionists being the victims."" which it stands for.

What is he trying to find out? will jump. tionNot the least important matter for consideration in each case must be whether or not the union is practically open to every person employed in the trade who desires to join it . No regulation has been framed which makes that a condition of employment in the temporary positions of the Public Service. Are we going to have a law framed to give effect to the policy of the Government, and is it proposed to regulate the unions of Australia, requiring them to fulfil certain conditions laid down as necessary to be complied with before preference will be granted? If a union does not fulfil those conditions, a judicial tribunal, acting upon equity and good con-, science, refuses to grant preference. Sir W. P. Reeves says in his work thatA union which may not strike, and may not shut out any decent workman in its trade who wishes to join it , is a union left with little power for mischief, however much it may do, legally and peaceably, for its members and their fellow-workmen by organizing, probing grievances, negotiating, arbitrating, and watchOne gentleman who was exercising the judicial office said from the Bench, when We, who believe in preference, say this:"" We do not desire to have any undue advantage over the non-unionist; we desire to have a free to unionists, and, consequently, we ask for preference, with a view to preventing for South Sydney in the Arbitration Court He said, '' We ask for preference with a view to preventing unionists -being the victims.""

The order is preference to unionists as against preference to non-unionists. able member for South Sydney justifies preference to unionists on the ground that without it they are going to be victimized, and the honourable member for Gwydir echoes that sentiment.

I could quote the different cases in which preference has been granted or refused. In the case of the Laundry Employes Union, the Court refused to grant preference to unionists for certain reasons, one of them being that the number of employees in the industiy was about 1,200, and the number of unionists 250, so that they stood in the proportion of four non-unionists to one unionist. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is a ridiculous reason anyhow. ence was refused. Another reason, which particularly applies to temporary employees, was given in that case in the following wordsExcept so far as the small proportion of the employees are concerned, there is no constant employment. . . . It might occurI suppose it would occur very frequently-that a hand would be required immediatelv. That is the case the honourable member for Parramatta gave this afternoonIt may not infrequently happen that an employer carrying on his business some distance from Sydney might require an employee imme-1 diately; and the majority of the Court does not consider that it would be right to impose on an employer the inconvenience, and it may be the great delay, in applying to the headquarters of the union in Sydney for an employee before work can be proceeded with. That was the judgment of Mr Justice Cohen and Mr Wright. Where you have casual employment, and the registered office is miles away from where the work is being carried on, owing to the impracticability of carrying on operations, prefer, ence has been refused. That is a fair and proper thing to do, but in this case no such condition can arise. The officials cannot put on a non-unionist at any distant place. They must wait and see if other people are available, ancl then, things being equal, preference is to be given to the unionist. And yet we are seeking to govern a vast continent. if the honourable member was in charge of the gang. should try to obey the Minister's instruction implicitly. Let us ascertain how the principle has been administered under the Commonwealth law. Mr Justice O'Connor, in the case of the Australian Workers Union, said, on the question of the granting of preferenceThe granting of preference to members of the union puts a limitation on the employer's freedom of choice in selecting his workmen, it also places at a disadvantage in obtaining employment all persons exercising the same avocation who are not members of the union. The Act recognises rights in the latter class of persons, and makes it necessary for the President before hearing the application to notify by advertisement all persons and organizations interested and desirous of being heard, and directs the Court to hear all such persons and organizations applying or represented. Further on he saidThe claimants, however, have failed to put before me any reason for exercising my discretion in favour of granting preference. Mr Reid, relying on the legal position that I was bound to make the order, has abstained from urging any argument in support of my exercising my discretion to grant it. He therefore felt that he could not grant preference.

He then dealt with the question of the political objects of the union, as followsThere is no suggestion throughout the rules that the political ends aimed at are to be limited to the subjects set forth in the proviso to section 55. In the face of these declared objects of the union, it is impossible to hold that the rules -of the union do not permit the application of its funds to political purposes.

Then, among other considerations, be referred to the judgment of Mr Justice Cohen that, in giving preference, it is a fair thing to bear in mind the fact that unions have sacrificed funds in order to get a judgment. That is a consideration which may have weight where men spend a lot of money in securing evidence to present their case. That cannot be said of a office and asks for employment.

There is a general desire among the employers who have given evidence to be fair, and to get the best men that they can at the Is that enough for honourable members price. The burden of proof lies on the claimant opposite ? to show that preference ought to be granted, and that burden has not yet been satisfied. That was Mr Justice Higgins' view when asked to give judgment, and he refused the preference asked. That is a strong case for refusing preference, and should appeal to the minds of the Government when they are asked to give employment in the Public Service. The honourable member for Adelaide asked me to read the statements of Mr Justice Higgins, published between the passages I quoted. I am prepared to do so. Mr Justice Higgins saidI t must not be forgotten that one of the objects of the Act is to "" facilitate and encourage the organization"" of unions of employers ancl employees (section 3); for without such organization-a t all events on the side of the employees-the arbitration system and the industrial agreements are unworkable. The Act does not allow individual employees to present to the Court their grievances; and it makes the funds of the union liable for breaches of the award. It may seem very shocking in some quarters, but it is my clear duty in obedience to the law to treat unionism as a desirable aid in securing industrial peace. Now, there is much force, one must confess, in the position taken by the claimant here, and by Cohen, J., in his judgment in the trolly and draymen's case (1905, Ind. Arb. Rep.,. N.S.W., pp. 44-45), that the union men have to fight for non-unionists, as well as for themselves, in the effort to obtain better terms from the employers; that the unionists have to pay subscriptions and levies, sacrifice time and energy; and (not infrequently) their employment; and that the non-unionists often assist the employer against the unionists in the struggle, and yet come in and enjoy the fruits of the unionists' exertions and sacrifices. All the union asks is that, where other things are equal, the employer sbould be ordered to take a unionist in preference. A priori, one would think that, as between two men of equal qualifications, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, an employer would be inclined, after struggle in this Court or elsewhere, to employ the non-unionist, as being more docile and helpless, and as not being protected by the award, and that he would be inclined to punish men who have been active for the union. This morning's newspapers afford such men. The claimant wants to check any such practice; and its fear is by no means undifferent complexion on the judgment. degree. I have given all the reasons for preference; I have shown that the Judge considered every one of them-and what did he do then ? He declined lo give preference to unionists. Now what is the position of the Government? In this case a man, as a member of the Engine-drivers Union, took his case before a judicial Court; all the evidence was heard, the greatest impartiality was shown, and he was told that he could not get preference. He goes away from the Court, and applies to the head of a political Administration, and what he has been refused by the Court he is granted by the political Administration. All these men have been refused preference in a judicial Court, and they have now got, by the exercise of political effort, what they could not get by judicial means. man read the last sentence of the Judge's remarks on preference, commencing, "" Circumstances may change "" may change, and if they do preference to unionists may be given; but it is not said that in future it will be given in all cases. I have fairly stated the whole case, with all the reasons which would actuate the Court in granting preference, and those which would actuate the Court in refusing, it. I have shown that the Court refused it, and it will be a very serious thing if a political body grants it where the Court has refused it. Honourable members who have spoken in this debate on the other side have suggested that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been of little or no benefit to unionists. I made inquiries on the subject this morning, and I find that sixteen cases have been brought before our Industrial Court. Awards have been granted in those sixteen cases.

769,Mr Groom,"Of course circumstancescases have come before the tribunal under the conciliation power, section 16A. Who introduced the sixteen cases? Every one was brought before the Court by an industrial organization, and as the result every one of the unionists secured improved conditions. My honourable friends will see that we have already accomplished a great deal for industrial organizations. When they say that unionists are asked to give up everything ing-and to come under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, they forget that that Act confers upon them very great privileges. It takes away from the employer the right to lay down his own rates of wages, and to prescribe the conditions of employment. The unionists on the other hand have sacrificed the right to strike. I believe thoroughly in this system of arbitration, and I hope that .the industrial unrest which we are now experiencing is merely the discontent that is inevitable during the transition period. I am not going to lose faith in this method of securing industrial peace. If both sides will approach it in the spirit in which it ought to be approached, that is the true arbitration spirit of giving and taking, we shall ultimately make the scheme a success. My honourable friends opposite forget that, under the Act, unionists may obtain permanent advantages. They have the right to go before the Arbitration Court, and no non-unionist has that right. Further, the employer is bound by an award for many years. He cannot alter it of his own volition, and the Court can bring its whole power to bear upon his property to enforce that award. In addition, unions are permitted to enter into private agreements with employers, and those agreements are just as binding as is an award of the Court. agreements, representing about twenty different cases, have already been made under the Act. ments, a preference has been granted to unionists. This Parliament is doing its best to encourage industrial peace, and it has given to unionists something which is not a shadow, but a solid substance. Are we going to condemn the whole system by saying that we cannot accomplish all the industrial organization that we desire without degrading our Public Service? One cannot help thinking of history in this connection, and realizing that it is repeating itself. On page 232 of Vol. II . of May's Constitutional History, I find the followI t has been noticed elsewhere, that while the number of places held by members of Parliament was being continually reduced, the general patronage of the Government had been extended by augumented establishments and expenditure. But throughout these changes, patronage was the mainspring of the organization of parties. It was used to promote the interests, and to consolidate the strength of that party in which its distribution happened to be vested. The higher appointments offered attractions and rewards to the upper classes for their political support. The lower appointments were not less influential with constituencies. The offer of places, as a corrupt inducement to vote at elections, had long been recognised by the Legislature, as an insidious form of bribery. That is the history of the Old Land. honourable member's party. orable member's party from that history. That is the history of party government in other lands. It is not so in Australia. We are proud of the institutions that we enjoy. We have brought from the Old Country all our traditions of administration. There our forefathers fought the evils of bribery and corruption by public patronage, and put an end to them. When the Commonwealth was established, it was the proud boast of every member of this Eighty-six private Parliament when he returned to his constituents that we had passed a Public Service Act which abolished political patronage. We all claimed .that there was only one qualification recognised for entry into our Public Service-that of merit and ability. We ought to be careful to safe : guard the sacred traditions that we then established. I was indeed surprised to hear the honourable member for Hunter openly declare that unions are political, that they must be political, and must not only secure social reform, but become an",73,Moloney W E Swered That It Was Not Proposed To In

The Prime Minister has said that no political distinctions are to be drawn-that an applicant for Government employment will not be asked whether he is a Free Trader or a Protectionist. But the test is to be applied to him when he is asked whether or not he intends to join a political organization. This is not a new question here. When it was before Parliament in 1904, I fought hard to enable a fair preference .to be granted to unionists. I even went so far as to say that if a union chose man, between taxpayer and taxpayer, beto be political in its objects, we could not find fault with it. The right of association is sacred, and we must protect that right. I declared that if a union which was political in its purposes went before the Arbitration Court, and asked for a decision on an economic question relating to wages, I would not exclude it, because of those purposes. It would be entitled to a fair hearing on its economic complaints. But when they asked for preference for a political union, the effect of which would have been to compel a man to join a body with whose political principles he might not agree, that preference should not be granted. We gave perfect political freedom to the unions, but we laid it down that when a union claimed a preference, which meant compelling other people to join against their convictions, the sacred rights of liberty should not be interfered with.

The position is perfectly, clear today. I say that this preference which the Government has introduced is, to use the words of the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, unjust, because it discriminates between man and tween citizen and citizen. It is pernicious, because it rests employment in public works upon other grounds than fitness and -merit. It is oppressive, because it compels men, if they want to secure temporary employment in the Public Service, to sacrifice their liberty of judgment and their freedom of conscience. It is prejudicial to the public interest, because it excludes the consideration of ability as the sole claim for appointment, ancl substitutes the consideration of party allegiance. It is further prejudicial, because it creates in those engaged on the public works of this country a division of party strife. It is likewise inimical to good government, because it seems to be the first step in the introduction of that pernicious system which all civilized nations have swept away-the system of partisan appointments in public administration.
