175,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Ethiopia; And,"Wednesday, 21 March 2007 ----International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Harmony Day Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.30 am)-Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. On 21 March 1960, dozens of people died in Sharpeville in South Africa when police fired at a peaceful demonstration against the apartheid ‘pass laws’. In 1966 the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the day to commemorate the Sharpeville massacre. Only a year later, in 1967, Australia had its own watershed moment: more than 90 per cent of Australians voted in a referendum to acknowledge Indigenous Australians as citizens and to give the Commonwealth government power to make laws regarding Indigenous people. It was a monumental step towards reconciliation with our first Australians; as a nation we acknowledged almost 200 years of troubled history, and that is why Harmony Day, which is also today, is so important. It is a celebration of the strong and diverse society that we have built together, and an acknowledgement that more must be done. For me, our Indigenous people cannot be on an equal footing without meaningful employment and a decent education. If you do not have a good education, you cannot get a decent job; if you do not have a decent job, you cannot get ahead in life, you cannot give your children the best start in life-and so it goes on until disadvantage becomes the only thing passed down the generations. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to respect yourself if you live like a secondclass citizen. Mutual respect and recognition are not possible without self-respect. My focus is on real results for Indigenous Australians and I will certainly focus on the things that are working to deliver Indigenous people from disadvantage. I have just returned from an extraordinary road trip around Australia looking at the things that are working in Aboriginal communities. I believe that we have a continuing national responsibility-and have had since 1967-to do our best by Indigenous people. Today is yet another opportunity for us to recognise our mutual responsibilities to keep up hope and to work for real and lasting equality. Water am)-One of the hallmarks of the Howard government has been the government’s ability to tackle very big-picture items in the country for the benefit of Australians. We have been able to do that initially in the face of some community opposition-and, of course, a lot of opposition from the opposition-and we have done it because we know that it is right, and right for the country. I am reminded of things that generally people do not talk about: the big changes in Centrelink, for example. Many of us will remember what the old Department of Social Security used to be like. Centrelink is now a better customer service organisation than even private business in the way that it looks after its customers.

177,Mr Lindsay (Herbert,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.32there have been massive changes for the benefit of the country, and the Howard government will go down in history as being a reformist government in the interests of our nation. One thing that we are presently engaged in is addressing the serious problems of water in the country. We have taken on the states and we have clearly signalled to the nation that we are going to fix the water mess that exists in the Murray-Darling Basin. We have promised an investment of $10 billion in that particular program and we are determined to do what needs to be done to make sure that we have a proper and sustainable water supply. But we are also looking at Northern Queensland, and that excites me because John Howard has appointed Bill Heffernan to look at those issues in the North. We currently have massive amounts of water that flow down the tropical rivers and out to sea. There is an opportunity to use that water and there is a whole range of ways in which that water might be used. One of the possibilities is to raise the height of the existing Burdekin Dam by just a metre. That would increase its storage capacity by some 83 per cent. It currently holds 16 times the volume of Sydney Harbour-that gives you an idea of how much water we are talking about. Quite often these days we see water levels of more than a metre over the spillway of the dam, so there is an opportunity to collect that water. It may be used for further agriculture in Northern Australia. It could also be used for the people in the south-east corner of the state. I am currently involved in an investigation into getting that water to where it needs to go. I certainly encourage Bill Heffernan to talk with the people I have been talking to so that we can manage water better for our state, for our local region and for our country. World Police and Fire Games Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.35 am)-TodayI would like to take the opportunity to share with the House a remarkably exciting event which is currently taking place in my electorate of Adelaide, that being the 2007 World Police and Fire Games. It began on 16 March and will last through until 25 March. I have been amazed by the excitement that has been generated by this event. This is only the second time that these games have been staged in Australia. The World Police and Fire Games were previously held in Melbourne back in 1995. To give you some idea of the size of this event, in Adelaide this week we have some 8,000 competitors and some 4,000 visitors from almost 60 countries around the world. I would like to give particular credit to the thousands of South Australians who have put their names forward to be volunteers. We have a proud tradition of volunteers. They are the backbone of our community. This has once again been shown with the 2007 World Police and Fire Games, where some 2,300 volunteers are helping to make the games an absolute success. I would also like to give credit to some of the organisers. WhilstI do not have time here today to go through all of the people who have played a role, I would like to congratulate the chairperson of the 2007 World Police and Fire Games Board, Mr Bill Spurr, from the South Australian Tourism Commission. I would also like to give credit to the South Australian police commissioner, Mal Hyde, as well as the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service chief fire officer, Grant Lupton. There is a huge amount of excitement in Adelaide. Everybody is being a part of it. The 79 sporting events are all free for the public. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the organisers, to give credit to the thousands of volunteers and also to welcome all of the MAIN COMMITTEE overseas visitors to the city of Adelaide. We trust that you will have a fantastic time. And, of course, I also wish the Australian competitors the very best of luck. Queensland Air Museum successes and achievements of the Queensland Air Museum, situated at Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast. It is a wonderful establishment that has helped to preserve a wide range of interesting memorabilia relating to Australia’s aviation history. Items on display at the museum include some 40 aircraft and various hangars. Interestingly, the Air Museum was originally established in Brisbane in the early 1970s and then relocated to a two-hectare site on land at Caloundra’s aerodrome in 1986. Since then, it has continued to expand and to grow. It has been fortunate to enjoy the enthusiastic support of many local people and also people from other parts of the state. This is an attraction that has operated on a shoestring, with some 160 volunteers, predominantly former RAAF and RAF service men and women, and civilians who have been involved in the aviation industry. The Air Museum has proven to be of significant importance to those who have an interest in Australia’s unique past and in particular aviation history. Some 12,000 visitors pass through the doors of the Queensland Air Museum each year. As is often the case with attractions that are operated mainly through the love and enthusiasm of members, these sorts of attractions can sometimes become the victims of events occurring around them. Growth and expansion often mean that these facilities become vulnerable to outside forces and they often do not have the resources to help them deal with the associated problems. Airports are always constructed well away from built-up areas, but, as is commonly the case, the town grows and expands, and eventually engulfs the aerodrome so that, in due course, it is out of place in its location. The future of Caloundra Aerodrome is under a cloud. There are proposals to redevelop the airstrip, which would mean that tenants at the site, such as aircraft engineering, flight training schools and charter businesses, would need to relocate to a new aerodrome. Unfortunately, the cost of relocating the Queensland Air Museum would be prohibitive. An estimate by the museum’s operations manager, Bill Coulter, which was mentioned in the local newspaper put the cost of dismantling and trucking the many aircraft to a new location somewhere in the vicinity of $5 million; it could even be more. The truth of the matter is that, if the land on which the Air Museum stands is to be developed for other purposes, it is highly likely that this attraction will simply be forced to close up shop. This is something that I know would cause great distress to museum volunteers and local residents; it is also something I greatly oppose. This unique facility, which houses a special array of aviation artefacts, has taken some 37 years to accumulate. It would be a tragedy to lose it. It really is important that the Air Museum continues to ensure that our aviation history is appropriately recorded and that it continues to bear witness to the unique aviation history of this nation. I commend the Air Museum to the House. Phillip Island Vietnam Veterans Museum the Vietnam Veterans Museum on Phillip Island in Victoria. A crowd of over a thousand people was there.

179,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.41 Am),"I rise today to speak about the recent official opening ofans community to get together and to celebrate a real achievement, an achievement they can all be very proud of. I would like to particularly mention John Methven and his wife as leading lights with respect to what has been done there. I would also stress that what has been achieved has been a group effort, which many people associated with the exercise can be very proud of. The museum is a work in progress, but it is something that I would urge all members to visit if the opportunity presents itself. I would certainly urge members of the public to take the opportunity, if they are down near Phillip Island, to have a good look at something which showcases a range of very important memorabilia from a very important part of our history. The museum is great to walk around. I spent several hours there trying to get around it, but I will need to go back again to have a proper look. Some of the more interesting artefacts are the wooden marbles that were used by the government of the day for the draw of birth dates, which decided who would be a national service inductee. There is a Centurion tank, a 105millimetre Howitzer gun, Land Rovers, a ‘Huey’ Cobra AH-1F helicopter complete with a 20millimetre Gatling gun, and a holographic light and sound display that outlines the history of Australia’s involvement in the war. Not only that; there is also a range of other, smaller artefacts, including lots of pictures from the time. It was intriguing to walk around and to see photographs of people that I have dealt with in the Vietnam veterans community over the last couple of years in particularseeing them looking much younger and serving their country so many years ago. It was clear that this is something that they can all be very proud of. It is something which the community should get behind. The fundraising efforts that were undertaken to get this far have been very impressive and have involved the Vietnamese community as well as various ESOs, the community in general and also, for example, the Vietnam Veterans Motor Cycle Club in Victoria. They can all be very proud of what they have done. They stressed that it is all about working together; it is all about recognising the fact that there are, as they say on their website, no second-class citizens in our community. It is something that I would certainly urge members of parliament to go along and see. I was very proud to be there-very proud to be associated with the opening on the day and very proud of all those involved in achieving a very worthwhile museum. Stirling Electorate: Crime my electorate of Stirling-the issue of crime. Whilst policing and community safety is primarily the responsibility of the state Labor government, I am pleased to report that the federal government is playing a role in ensuring that people in Stirling live in the safest community that is possible. In Stirling we have received $410,000, which has gone through to the City of Stirling for its Reel Connections program. That is an important step forward in crime prevention and focuses on local youth and people in the northern suburbs surrounding Mirrabooka. Mirrabooka is an area in my electorate that is traditionally extraordinarily diverse. It has always been a focus for new arrivals in Western Australia and waves of immigrants have moved through there since the end of World War II-southern Europeans in the fifties and Vietnamese arriMAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members
180,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (9.44 Am),"I rise to talk about what is a very important issue invals in the seventies; now we are getting new waves of immigrants passing through Mirrabooka primarily from Africa but also from the Middle East. The Reel Connections program is an important grassroots approach to dealing with crime prevention, and it will make a real difference to the lives of many of our young people as well as local residents and families. It is, unfortunately, a fact of life that some of our local young people are getting themselves into serious trouble and engaging in antisocial activity. Sadly, this includes acts of violence between young migrants and Indigenous youth. The Reel Connections project will help to bridge these cultural gaps, provide understanding and improve the personal safety not only of our young people but also of the wider community. The project aims to reduce the level of antisocial behaviour and crime in and around the Mirrabooka regional centre by using a unique multimedia information and training program. During this project it is estimated that up to 120 young people will gain experience through a 10-week multimedia course, recording their own experiences and stories. These works will then be distributed throughout the entire community to educate people, both young and old, about tolerance and about how we can learn to accept people from different backgrounds. Many of these youths, their creativity and talent having been positively directed, will then be able to go on to further training or to other job opportunities with immediate accreditation and skills they have acquired through this program. Another part of the project will be to work to disseminate safety information and information on certain aspects of the law and citizenship to provide further life skills training. It will assist young migrants and Indigenous youth to understand their legal rights and responsibilities and ultimately improve their personal safety, and, by doing so, it will improve the safety of all my constituents in the electorate of Stirling. Gorton Electorate: Caroline Springs an article that referred to Caroline Springs, a suburb in the electorate of Gorton. The article indicated that Caroline Springs did not exist eight years ago, but now it is at the heart of the fastest-growing area in Australia’s most rapidly expanding city, Melbourne. The article said: Caroline Springs, 800 hectares next to the Western Highway, is home to more than 12,000 people, mostly young families breaking into the property market. Along with development in neighbouring Taylors Hill and Burnsideit went on to saythis planned community 22 kilometres west of the CBD has helped turn once-sleepy Melton Shire into the city’s growth hub. This is in fact the case. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia-the fastest growing area of Melbourne-and there is much need for services to be provided to the community in that area. In fact, as has been said in articles published in newspapers in Melbourne, Caroline Springs ‘has parks, a man-made lake’-in fact, two man-made lakes-‘and six schools’, and the town centre includes ‘a supermarket, police station, pharmacy, newsagent and several food shops’. Unfortunately, Caroline Springs, or any other suburb in the electorate of Gorton, does not have a Medicare office. I have been taking complaints from constituents concerned that there is no Medicare office within my electorate. That is a problem that existed prior to the creation MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
181,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (9.47 Am),"Three weeks ago in the Age, there wasof Caroline Springs, and it is now compounded by what has been an exponential population growth in the region. The three offices that are probably closest to the constituents include Melton Central, Airport West and Highpoint. However, there is much need for constituents to visit a Medicare office. In my view, the best place for a Medicare office would be Water Gardens Shopping Centre. It is a very large shopping complex right in the middle of Sydenham and Taylors Lakes, and very close to Taylors Hill and Hillside, and, indeed, to Caroline Springs. That would provide people wanting to obtain services from a Medicare office with the opportunity to do so. We will be petitioning the Commonwealth to make a decision to have an office in place as soon as possible. If Medicare office locations are based on merit, I think that decision will be made in our favour in due course. La Trobe Electorate: Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club to attend the official reopening of the Bob Griffiths green at the Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club. I first acknowledge the great work of the following committee members: Mr Robin Southern, President of the Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club; Mr Max Frost, Vice-President; Michael Walker, Secretary; and Colin Benson, Kim Walters, Jim Patterson, David West; Tas Boyce, Geoff Bell, Paul Hutchison and Neil Thurling. On that night there were some awards handed out which I would also like to mention: Bob Griffiths was the recipient of the Royal Victorian Bowls Association Medal of Merit; Jim Miller and Bob Griffiths, once again, received super veteran badges; and Robin Southern, Trevor Robertson and Ken Williams all received coaches badges. For several years this must have been the unluckiest bowls club in Australia. Who would have thought that, when we are in the midst of having some of the driest years on record, the Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club would have managed to have been flooded out not once but twice, destroying the greens and the possible future viability of the club. Given the disastrous impact the loss of a green had on the club’s finances, it is no exaggeration to say that, while things were looking fairly grim for the club, they never gave up and always wanted to make sure that they stayed alive to provide support for the local community. In April last year, I attended a crisis meeting, at which things looked fairly grim. Considering that this club has been in operation since 1929 and is one of the few clubs in the area, it would have been an absolute tragedy for all people, whether young or old, had the club not survived. I know that Upwey High School has students there undertaking bowls training. It is just a fantastic club. The Australian government, under the Regional Partnerships Program, has made a contribution of $40,000 to complement funding and in-kind support from the Shire of Yarra Ranges, the Bendigo Bank, Belgrave Taxation Services, Robin Southern Coaching and the Victorian state government. The Australian government funding went specifically to replacing the lights and to drainage works. I would like to congratulate the club president, Robin Southern, for his tireless work in getting it all together. I would also like to congratulate the following committee members in particular for their efforts: Mr Ken Walters, Mr Max Frost and Mr Michael Walker. It was a fantastic project. I would also like to mention both Sofia and Maya from the Melbourne East Area Consultative Committee who worked tirelessly with the club to get their application up to speed.

The Governor King Day Club is a new addition to the family. It meets at the St Marys RSL and I place on record my appreciation of the St Marys RSL, and particularly the sub-branch, for the way they support the Governor King Day Club. They provide facilities through which veterans and the families of veterans, particularly their spouses and/or widows, are able to meet once a week and go on outings. It is really important that, given the service these good people have given to our country, they should be able to avail themselves of membership of such clubs. So congratulations to Governor King Day Club-two years old and going strong. Secondly, I refer to the Blacktown Bungarribee Day Club, whose coordinator, Beverly Fayle, I think has been the coordinator since its inception. What an outstanding lady she is. This club meets at the Blacktown RSL and has been serving the community for 22 years. It was opened on 15 July 1985 by the then state president of the RSL, Sir Colin Hines. The club is perhaps not as strong as it once was but, again, it provides an important opportunity for veterans, their spouses and widows to meet once a week. When I was talking to members of the club they told me how important it is for them, and that it is the one outing they particularly look forward to each week. Lastly, we celebrated a St Patrick’s Day mass and blessing at the Jubilee Hall, Patrician Brothers College. I did not ever own St Pat’s College, but under the new boundaries I do and I am very excited about that. I was particularly pleased to see Brother Pat Lovegrove and Brother Bernard, two former distinguished principals of the school, and also the current principal, Santo Passarello. The Patrician Brothers have served Blacktown and its surrounding areas very well. In fact a Liberal Party member of parliament, Alex Somlyay, the member for Fairfax, is a former student. Congratulations to the Patrician Brothers. Next year the Patrician Brothers will celebrate their centenary. (Time expired) Casey Electorate: Mount Evelyn Primary School am)-I rise today to pay tribute to one of the great primary schools in the heart of the electorate of Casey, the Mount Evelyn Primary School. One of the great aspects of being a member of parliament, and I know all members in this place will agree, is having the opportunity to visit primary schools to see first-hand the great work being done not just by teachers but also by parents in a partnership to build a school community and to see the students involved in a wonderful education process. On the evening of Thursday, 15 March, I had the pleasure of attending a twilight school assembly at the Mount Evelyn Primary School, where they spoke about important values of the school community and presented leadership badges and certificates to the school leaders. The school had been through a significant consultation process with parents, teachers and students to develop an important values booklet, which was funded by the Australian government. It took a great deal of commitment from the parents, the teachers and the students to ensure that MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Statements By Members

The parents from the school council participated in a weekend retreat to discuss what they thought were important values, together with the teachers and the students. The values that the school has decided upon include: respect, responsibility, care, integrity, enjoyment, sense of community, excellence and sustainability. As I mentioned earlier, I had the pleasure of presenting badges and certificates to the school captains and vice captains, who will undertake an important role in implementing these principles throughout the year. I give particular credit to the chosen school captains, Joshua Dobson and Nikki Bedwell, as well as to vice captains Marcus Crew and Holly Bedyn. Their parents, and in one case grandparents, were there and I could see they were very proud that their sons and daughters had been chosen for leadership roles. I wish them all the best for the school year. I pay tribute to the principal, Mr Phil Comport, and to the many parents who took the time to turn up to the school assembly and show their dedication in building in Mount Evelyn not just a great primary school but a great community. 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded.

Sir Denis James Killen AC, KCMG Debate resumed from 28 February, on motion by Mr Howard: That the House record its deep regret at the deaths of the Honourable Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG AO, former Federal Minister and Senator for New South Wales and Ambassador to the United States of America and the Honourable Sir Denis James Killen AC KCMG, former Federal Minister and Member for Moreton, Queensland; and place on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious service and tenders its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement. Ordered that further proceedings be conducted in the House. Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 March, on motion by Mr Macfarlane: That this bill be now read a second time. Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Bill 2006. The purpose of the bill is to bring about an agreement of all Australian jurisdictions committed to bringing the regulation of the electricity and gas markets under a new national governance arrangement. This is important because the national gas laws will reduce the regulatory burden on industry. It will improve service provisions, it will bring about certainty and it will protect the long-term interests of consumers. That is extremely important. This national governance arrangement will be important to the energy industry. It will be particularly important in my electorate because of the jobs that are associated with the gas industry; the generation of electricity from gas is an important job generator in my electorate. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Statements By Members
185,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),Order! In accordance with standing order,176,Australian Energy Market Amendment Gas Legislation Bill 2006
186,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (10.00 Am),"I rise this morning to address the AustralianOne of the important aspects of this legislation is that it recognises the fact that gas, like electricity, is not just confined to a market within a state. Energy now flows across bordersboth electricity and gas-to provide an energy source in other states. That is never more apparent than in the south-west corner of my electorate in the Cooper Basin, where there is a Santos investment at the Ballera gas field which flows to Moomba in South Australia. Santos also provides a gas pipeline to New South Wales. That gas also flows through a network of pipelines to Brisbane, Mount Isa and Gladstone. This is a clear demonstration of how the gas that comes out of the Cooper Basin in Queensland is transported through those pipelines into other states and into those energy markets. This bill will give great confidence to companies that invest in exploration in the gas industry and will also aid in the development of markets flowing from the gas that they find. It also will ensure that there is national competition in the marketplace-which we all want to see. I know consumers will benefit from that. It gives certainty to those investment companies and their shareholders that there is a competitive market out there. This bill will give them the confidence of knowing that there is a market and that there is regime that will encourage competition and further exploration. The Surat Basin is an underdeveloped coal basin in my electorate. It has great potential, not only for the extraction of coal but also in the production of coal seam methane. Coal seam methane is a very clean form of energy. It is a technology that, in the last 10 to 15 years, has been refined and developed largely by Australian companies. I think we are going to see more and more coal seam methane extracted from coal fields. This is important in that, should those coal seams one day be exploited, they will be a safer mine to operate, because the coal seam methane has been extracted from the coal bed, making it a less dangerous environment in which to operate underground coal extraction. Origin Energy is the company in my electorate that is involved in the extraction of coal seam methane. It plans to build two power stations at the site where it is extracting this coal seam methane. One will be at Spring Gully. I hoped the company would put in a second one there, but there is some debate at the moment about whether that will proceed or whether it will be located at what is known as the Braemar interconnection site for the electricity grid that is being established in these fields to feed electricity into the national electricity market. I recently had a briefing in my home town of Roma, and Santos, BHP, General Electric and Energex have been the recipients of some $75 million from the Commonwealth government to bring together a range of technologies that will see them build a 100-megawatt power station utilising coal seam methane as its energy source. The $75 million is important because it will assist in the construction of that power station, a zero emissions power station. With the debate about climate change and emissions, not only here in Australia but also world wide, it is important that we are able to prove and to see proven these known technologies, and it will be this power station at Fairview, north-east of Injune in my electorate, that will be the first in the world to bring together all those known technologies with the support of government money to build that power station. Importantly, the power that is generated from that power station will then be fed into a power link grid to take it into the national power grid, which then obviously feeds into the national electricity market. It is a very important project, once again demonstrating this federal government’s commitment to investing in new and clean technologies that reduce emissions. In this case, it is the generation of power MAIN COMMITTEE from coal seam methane gas, and it is another example of the federal government’s commitment to addressing the issue of emissions within Australia. The investment will see the coal seam methane extracted and used to generate electricity, but the carbon dioxide that is produced when that coal seam methane is burnt in those turbines will be extracted at the exhaust level and then returned underground, whence it came. This coal seam methane area is something like 700 to 800 metres below the ground, and when the carbon dioxide is returned to the coal bed it actually attaches to the coal. Unlike the methane before it is extracted, which is quite volatile and mobile, the carbon dioxide that is returned to the coal bed actually attaches to the coal. It actually makes the coal seam much safer should it ever be extracted. Being such a deep deposit, it is probably unlikely that we will see it extracted in our lifetime. But we should never say never in life. Should it ever be extracted at some time in the future, it will be a much safer deposit because it will not be as volatile as it currently is with the coal seam methane in the coal bed. The other important thing is that the water that is extracted as part of the process of extracting coal seam methane will be used for the cooling of the power station. So we will have a power plant, in situ, that is using coal seam methane technology to generate power and the water that comes up with the coal seam methane will be used to cool the power plant. That is a tremendous step forward, given that water is such a valuable commodity in Australia today. We know just how valuable it is wherever we live in Australia-whether it is in the outback or in an urban situation. The water that is currently in many of these extraction sites is evaporating into the atmosphere and will now be used in a productive way to cool the power plant, rather than evaporating into the atmosphere and being wasted. The power generated feeds into the national grid, which provides an opportunity for the investment company to sell power into the national power market, thereby creating an enormous number of jobs. I am quite excited about this project because it is the very first not only in Australia but also in the world. This project uses the known technology of extraction of coal seam methane. It generates power at the site, strips off the water and uses it for cooling the power plant. But, importantly, the carbon dioxide created by the power that is generated will not be emitted into the atmosphere as the emissions are pumped back down the hole and will ultimately rest in a carbon sink. Once this technology is further developed it will afford the opportunity for other power plants, such as coal-fired power plants, to utilise it and bury the carbon dioxide that they would otherwise emit into the atmosphere. I am not quite sure whether that will come about. We have to prove the first step of the technology and get it to work. We will then have an opportunity to return the carbon dioxide which comes from coal-fired power stations to the coal bed and have zero emission power stations. It is a win all round. This amendment bill will, I am sure, bring about greater security for the generation of power in Australia and will give security and confidence not only to companies that invest in the exploration of gas but also to the investors who invest in pipelines across Australia. The regulatory regime is constant across state borders and I believe that will help to further develop the industry. I support the legislation. welcome the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Bill 2006 today. The proposed national regime will replace the nine different regulatory regimes operating across the country and streamline access to gas pipelines. That is certainly long overdue and welMAIN COMMITTEE",176,Australian Energy Market Amendment Gas Legislation Bill 2006
187,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (10.13 Am),"I am grateful to have the opportunity to come. The amendments contained within the bill confer the powers of regulation and management of the proposed national gas regime to Commonwealth agencies and to the federal minister. I note that the bill’s provisions reflect the agreement undertaken by Commonwealth, state and territory governments at the Ministerial Council on Energy. The regulatory framework proposed in this bill, of necessity, now relies on the states and territories passing complementary laws. That is something which, in due course, ought to happen to enable a regulatory framework of this scope to be enacted. The timing of this bill, designed as it is to allow for the establishment of a national framework to regulate access to gas pipelines, could not come at a more crucial moment, because gas has come in for a hard time in the parliament and in public debate over the last couple of weeks. As debate has raged over how we should deal with the threat of climate change, with the spectre of a potential four-degree increase in temperature hovering and the creation of a world described by NASA scientist Jim Hansen as ‘practically a different planet’, the Howard government has taken a surprising and disappointing stance and, at times, seems to almost completely discount the contribution gas is capable of making to address climate change. Given the consequences of even a two-degree increase in temperature, it is extraordinary that the government would be dismissive of such a vital source of energy-yet that is exactly what it has been doing. Whenever the issue of baseload power provision has been raised by anyone in parliament, on television, radio or in print, the federal government has fallen over itself time and time again to say that only coal or nuclear power have the capacity to provide baseload power in Australia. It is the case that the Prime Minister and other ministers mention gas on a couple of occasions here and there, but the general thrust of the government’s position and comments, including statements made by the Prime Minister in question time, is that it will fall upon coal or nuclear power to provide baseload power in the future. That is just not correct. Consider the international experience. The truth is that, in 2000, gas provided 54 per cent of Russia’s energy needs, 52 per cent of the Middle East’s energy needs and 16 per cent of North America’s energy mix. Gas is more than capable of providing a share of Australia’s baseload power and, importantly, it is also extremely flexible. The fact is that most of the growth in our energy consumption is in demand for intermediate and peak power. That is really where the demand for energy comes from and that is where the demand for energy must be met-in intermediate and peak power. It is on those hot summer afternoons, when everyone turns up their air conditioning full blast-that kind of demand-where gas and also solar power are particularly well suited. In fact, gas is such a flexible source of power that it can be used to provide baseload power, the power that is needed to keep everything quietly ticking over during the night and, with the flick of a switch, it can be used to provide a couple of minutes of peak power or 12 hours of intermediate power. Apart from its flexibility, gas also has between 30 per cent and 50 per cent less carbon emissions than coal. That is quite a significant reduction. Furthermore, all the work that has been done to develop clean coal technologies, such as geosequestration, could also potentially advantage gas, as many of the same principles can apply to bearing the carbon load from gas as apply to bearing the carbon load from coal. MAIN COMMITTEE Traditionally, we have not used gas to provide baseload power in Australia because the price of coal has been so low. The price of coal-fired baseload is around $30 per megawatt hour, compared to around $38 per megawatt hour for gas-fired generation. This has meant that, whilst domestic gas prices in Australia are amongst the lowest in the OECD and the lowest in the world, gas is still more expensive than coal under existing policy settings. Despite its flexibility and availability, Australia has gas reserves of more than 110 years worth at current rates of production, and this does not include the large volumes of Queensland and New South Wales coal seam gas. Yet just last week the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Turnbull, told the Sydney Morning Herald that it would be ‘short-sighted and selfish for Australia to use its large gas reserves to cut emissions in Australia, because the rest of the world did not have that luxury’. That is an extraordinary position to take, particularly as Australia’s greenhouse pollution is expected to soar by some 27 per cent by 2020. If we wish to avoid this kind of emissions expansion-and the need for us to reduce emissions is indeed urgent-then we clearly need to invest in gas and other clean energy sources here in Australia. It is difficult, I think, for people to understand why the Howard government is so keen to perpetuate the myth that only coal or nuclear power can provide baseload energy demand. I believe the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources needs to stop talking down Australia’s gas and renewable energy sectors and start doing his job. This is not about the gas industry’s technological inadequacies-and the bill before us clearly shows what the potential for gas is-but the minister for the environment’s indifferent approach on climate change is seriously to be regretted. We argue that any government that takes the risks inherent in climate change seriously must also take the role of gas in the country’s energy provision very seriously. Federal Labor certainly does, as does the industry itself. Just two days ago AGL announced its decision to join the Chicago Climate Exchange. This is further compelling evidence of the lost economic opportunities created by 11 years of climate change denial and complacency under the Howard government. AGL’s historic announcement demonstrates the company’s commitment to tackling climate change but also highlights Australia’s isolation from global efforts to cut greenhouse pollution. As it turns out, clean energy companies are continuing to seek opportunities outside of Australia. AGL’s move to the Chicago Climate Exchange shows how many golden opportunities are being missed. The fact is that Australia should and could be the regional hub for emissions trading and clean energy but, instead of a hub, there is a hole. Nothing can happen. Australian financial institutions are blocked until Australia ratifies the Kyoto protocol and establishes a national emissions trading scheme. AGL’s Managing Director, Paul Anthony, has stated that his company’s membership of the Chicago Climate Exchange allows it to ‘trade allowances with other companies around the globe seeking to reduce their own carbon footprint and access the global buyers for its many carbon offset projects’. It is clear the government’s failure to act is costing jobs and threatening our precious environment. A discussion paper released almost five years ago by the gas to liquids task force recognised the potential for gas to liquids technology. It stated: There is a significant potential market for ultra clean diesel, and this provides an opportunity in the future for GTLMAIN COMMITTEE gas to liquidsdiesel. So what is preventing the gas industry from taking a more substantial role in Australia’s energy mix? Firstly, investment in energy infrastructure requires very long lead times and certainty. The Howard government’s failure to provide the security of a carbon signal has resulted in both the coal and gas industries being frustrated in making investment in the provision of new power plants because, while the government may pretend that climate change is not real-or, at least, not very urgent-the gas and coal industries know that a carbon signal is coming. They know they are moving into a carbon-constrained economy, and they are not willing to commit substantial sums of money-indeed, as much as billions of dollars in assets-that may become stranded in this new environment. That is why, secondly, the gas industry needs a carbon price signal and a carbon emissions trading scheme to trade the carbon in. That is why on 7 February this year Grant King, Origin Energy’s Managing Director, told ABC radio that his industry wants to see a carbon trading scheme. He said: We’d like to see a commitment to introduce an effective carbon-pricing regime. We believe that that needs to be sooner rather than later. That’s necessary to ensure that companies who are making major capital investments which have 20, 30, 40-year lives can make decisions knowledgeable of the future regime in relation to carbon-pricing. This is also why on 22 February 2007 the CEO of the Petroleum Producers Association, Belinda Robinson, told her Australian Oil and Gas Conference that she was bewildered by the federal government response to climate change. She said: We do need to explore all options for all energy supplies that are cleaner and greener than we’ve had in the past but they’re out there; they’re 10, 20 years away. The bewildering part has been that we’ve got gas now, there’s no new technology that has to be advanced to be able to deliver on greenhouse gas emission reductions with gas. I think that says it very clearly. While the Howard government has continued to marginalise the gas industry by refusing to recognise its capacity to provide baseload, intermediate and peak power demands, and has refused to acknowledge its lighter carbon load, Mr Howard has simply continued to talk up the prospect of a future nuclear powered Australia. In this future-and it is a distant future that arrives only in the 2030s or later-Australia has dozens of nuclear reactors dotted along the eastern seaboard. According to Dr Switkowski, they will meet one-third of Australia’s energy needs. It is unclear how Australia will manage the tonnes of nuclear waste produced by such an intensive nuclear industry, nor is it clear where the waste will be stored, nor do we know where the reactors will be, and the cost involved in producing that power remains very expensive-and then, of course, the issues of risk around nuclear non-proliferation have somehow resolved themselves overnight, although we are not told how. Although all of these issues remain in abeyance, gas, which has the capacity to provide us with energy right now, is underrated and maligned. Of course, it is a fact that Australia’s emissions have been rising exponentially, but apparently that also is not a problem. If you believe the Prime Minister, nuclear power in the future will answer all of our energy needs. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, pursuing this nuclear future will not only drive up our carbon emissions through inaction on multiple fronts necessary-and the mining, milling and building of nuclear power plants will create MAIN COMMITTEE emissions-but will also radically increase the risk of accidents and proliferation and open up the prospects of terrorism on Australian soil. That is why this Labor Party under Kevin Rudd resolutely rejects nuclear power. When we look at the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Bill, we recognise that the replacement of nine different regulatory regimes operating across the country with one proposed national regime to streamline access to gas pipelines is necessary and welcome. But when we examine the potential and clear role that gas could play in assisting us to meet our greenhouse gas emissions in Australia at a time when climate change is an issue of significant importance, we can see very clearly the failures inherent in the Howard government’s approach. The Labor Party would ratify the Kyoto protocol. We would give Australian businesses and farmers access to income streams that flow from ratification and we would give Australians access to the international negotiations that are about to begin-negotiations that will determine how we move forward as an international community in our fight against climate change. This legislation is important, and it also emphasises why Australia’s gas industry has to be brought in from the cold and counted as a part of the solution to Australia’s spiralling carbon emissions. and Resources) (10.26 am)-Minister Macfarlane brought the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Gas Legislation) Bill 2006 to the parliament with the support of our colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy to continue our progress towards an efficient and effective national regime for the regulation of gas pipeline infrastructure. By passing the bill, the Commonwealth parliament will play a lead role in facilitating the Ministerial Council on Energy’s cooperative gas access regime. This regime will be underpinned by lead legislation enacted in the South Australian parliament to which the National Gas Law will be a schedule. The National Gas Law will then be applied by all remaining jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, but excluding Western Australia, through legislation known as applications acts. Western Australia will pass mirror legislation with content similar to the National Gas Law rather than applying the National Gas Law established by South Australian law. This bill amends the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 to apply the National Gas Law in the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction, including the offshore area and external territories. It also amends that act and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow three key Commonwealth bodiesthe Australian Energy Regulator, the National Competition Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal-to take on key roles within the regime. Except in Western Australia, the Australian Energy Regulator will take on the role of regulator within the regime, in place of various regulatory bodies that are currently undertaking this role in different jurisdictions. This will lead to more efficient and consistent regulatory decision making. The National Competition Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal will also have important roles in overseeing and reviewing the proper operation of this scheme to ensure economically efficient, competitive outcomes in the gas market to protect the long-term interests of the consumers of gas. The involvement of these Commonwealth bodies is an essential part of this cooperative scheme, and the Commonwealth must provide groundwork for the passage of the National Gas Law in the South Australian parliament by legislating for these functions and powers to be exercised. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Australian Energy Market Amendment Gas Legislation Bill 2006
188,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismThe National Gas Law is currently the subject of a rigorous consultation process engaging all relevant stakeholders. The Ministerial Council on Energy Standing Committee of Officials have released their policy response to issues raised during consultation on the exposure draft of the National Gas Law and they will be finalising the legislation, taking into account issues raised by stakeholders. The member for Prospect has raised industry’s concerns about the powers conferred on the Australian Energy Regulator by the National Gas Law, and particularly the Australian Energy Regulator’s ability to investigate matters of competition. These issues have been the subject of detailed discussions over some time, and the government will continue to work with the states through the Ministerial Council on Energy process to address stakeholder concerns and to ensure that the National Gas Law delivers an effective national gas regime. The National Gas Law is designed to reduce the regulatory burden on industry and to facilitate investment in gas pipeline infrastructure. The National Gas Law will introduce a new, light-handed form of regulation that allows gas market participants to negotiate economically efficient outcomes without the direct involvement of the regulator, whilst creating a fair and effective access regime. The National Gas Law will also continue the greenfields pipeline incentives established by the Ministerial Council on Energy in June 2006, incentives which create certainty for investors undertaking risky greenfield and international pipeline projects. In summary, passage of this bill will represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national gas access regime. The cooperative national gas law regime will ensure that Australia enjoys the benefits of a competitive and efficient gas market whilst minimising the regulatory burden on industry. This bill has the full support of Minister Macfarlane’s state and territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy; therefore, I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 February, on motion by Fran Bailey: That this bill be now read a second time. shadow minister for transport, I advise that Labor supports the Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007. We support it because it implements the recommendations resulting from the 2006 Uhrig review relating to corporate governance arrangements for Tourism Australia. We all understand that tourism is vital to Australia. This goes to the framework and the national responsibility to work with state and territory governments and local communities to do everything to maintain tourism as a viable industry in Australia that creates jobs and export opportunities, whilst also enabling Australians a wonderful opportunity to have a holiday. When you think about it, it is hard to imagine life without tourism in Australia, the so called ‘land of the long weekend’. Bustling city centres, vacant white-sand beaches, lush tropical rainforests and sunburnt sweeping plains-that is the international understanding of MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Australian Energy Market Amendment Gas Legislation Bill 2006
189,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.33 Am),"On behalf of the opposition and as thewhat is available in Australia but, unfortunately, statistics now indicate that too few Australians are taking a holiday. One of the challenges to business in Australia is to better manage their business and to facilitate people to take holidays on a regular basis. This would also be smart for business, because as wages go up their own liabilities in terms of accumulation of annual leave and long service leave go through the roof. So in addressing this bill today, I also challenge Australian industry to start managing their businesses better. They can reduce their liabilities whilst also facilitating their employees to have a better opportunity to perform their duties at work by actually having a break from work. That is a challenge to the Australian community for the foreseeable future. I also note that, posed in historic terms, officially tourism is a relatively new industry. The terms ‘tourism’ and ‘tourist’ were first coined globally about 70 years ago, in 1937, by the League of Nations and referred to the act of people travelling abroad for more than 24 hours. They had not heard of domestic tourism in those days. Historically, however, we know that for centuries the wealthy in our societies have always travelled. The reason is that they sought to explore distant parts of the world, to see great buildings, experience new cultures and to taste new cuisine. Since the time of the Roman republic, places such as the luxurious and fashionable resort of Baiae were popular with the rich. In Australia, the history is perhaps even more recent. The industry finally gained formal recognition in 1966 when the Holt government appointed the late Don Chipp as the first minister for tourism activities. A year later the Australian Tourism Commission was established through the allocation of $1.5 million of funding. If only it was so cheap these days in terms of the call on the taxpayer’s purse. More seriously, in just over 40 years the industry has grown substantially in every conceivable sense. The advent of technological developments, particularly in transport, has made it easier than ever for people to move from one destination to the next and the emergence of low-cost carriers in the aviation industry in particular have removed financial barriers that previously limited tourism to the wealthy. More recently, with the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet-and that is where Tourism Australia has concentrated its activities, with a current advertising campaign internationally trying to attract hits on the net to encourage people to come to Australia. Further, every year more and more destination choices are presented to the global traveller as countries recognise the huge economic and social benefit of a robust tourism sector. It has become an extremely popular global activity and each year, according to the World Tourism Organisation, almost 700 million tourists travel the globe. That is a huge number of people travelling around the globe at any point in time. Others peg the number of annual tourism travellers as high as 803 million a year. While the size of the growth may be in dispute, what is not is that the sector is rapidly growing. Estimates predict that by 2020, which is only a decade away, the number of people travelling each year through tourism will reach a huge 1.6 billion people-this is almost the entire current population of China-who will be more than ever on the move looking for new experiences. It also, unfortunately, represents a huge challenge to Australia, because recent indications are that we are going backwards in some of these key markets, such as Japan. We have to try to make sure that we have a program in place which enables us to get our share of that burgeoning growth in tourism. I say that because, of these 1.6 billion travellers, 378 milMAIN COMMITTEE lion will be long-haul travellers, which is of significant note to Australia, a country considered globally as a long-haul destination. It also raises huge challenges in handling the debate about climate change, because there are some who want to impose huge penalties on the airline industry for greenhouse emissions and who would require the industry to pay more with respect to their operations. These things have to be handled very sensitively and in a pragmatic and proper way because, if this debate goes wrong for aviation, Australia will be the big loser because of our need to encourage and attract long-haul fliers. It is about time that some of these people paid more attention to the responsibilities of Airservices Australia to manage flight paths and the departures and arrivals at airports, because you can do more in the climate change fight by introducing greater efficiencies there. I also note that the aviation industry has started to respond to the huge cost impost of recent increases in the price of oil with better management and technological change. So there is potentially a multifaceted approach to resolving this climate change debate for the viability of the aviation industry, rather than simply imposing new costs on the industry as part of the greenhouse debate. I think that is important. Global tourists have traditionally held back on long-haul travel as it can prove cost prohibitive but also requires more time. The last thing we need is to unnecessarily burden the industry with huge cost difficulties arising from the greenhouse debate. You cannot just duck over to Australia from London the way you can to Paris or to Amsterdam. It is, therefore, pleasing to see forecasts for long-haul travel growing slightly faster than intraregional travel. It is estimated its share will increase from 18 per cent in 1995 to 24 per cent by 2020. Global forecasts present further positive news for Australia. The South-East Asia and the Pacific region, which encompasses Australia, will be the second largest receiving region with growth forecast to increase by over five per cent, compared to the world average of 4.1 per cent. The growth opportunities are there, but we as a nation have to grab hold of them. This growth is largely due to two reasons: the emergence of new markets in Asia and particularly in South-East Asia; and, more importantly, the fall in Europe’s popularity from 60 per cent to 46 per cent of the market. These technological and transport advances have kept pace with rapidly changing consumer tastes. There are more tourists now than ever before and they have the levels of disposable income that mean they can travel. They are better educated and have more sophisticated demands. The old ‘sun, sea and sand’ mass market has fragmented as travellers seek out active experiences that engage with local culture. It is a far more sophisticated and demanding market that Australia has to confront. This effectively means that there has been a growth in niche markets catering for special interests or activities, including growth in destination hotels, as people seize upon opportunities to do something unique that is off the tourism track. This has led to a change in the way nations and regions market their tourism. Previously held notions have been abandoned that boxed travellers into the categories of countries of origin, mode of travel and style, whether it be backpackers, organised tours or self-drive. The traveller’s motivation and their travel lifestyle are now the key defining characteristics-attributes that cross national borders and create new marketing segments. Sometimes the attributes are universal, but not always. Some travellers cannot help but be influenced by their own cultural habits. MAIN COMMITTEE This is perhaps what we have seen with Tourism Australia’s $180 million global campaign ‘Where the Bloody Hell Are You?’ launched in February of last year-the campaign that, incidentally, appears to have undergone an unannounced name change to become a ‘Uniquely Australian Invitation’ in the light of criticism of such a controversial tag line. Mr Ciobo interjectingtourism industry-good for jobs and exports for Australia. The Tourism Australia campaign seeks to attract people who are avid users of technology, shun traditional media outlets, listen and value their peers’ travel experiences, want their travel experience to enhance them as a person and, perhaps most importantly, are high-yield tourists. They are commonly known in marketing as ‘experience seekers’. The campaign approach based on this model of defining people by their motivation to travel works to a point, as the $6 million spent by Tourism Australia on tourism research and polling tells us. In some markets, the tag line built on the existing goodwill towards Australia and cut through in a fiercely competitive global community. Yet it failed to cut through and inspire experience seekers in some critical markets, including that of Japan, which due to cultural differences meant the tag line simply did not translate. There were further problems in other key markets, and I do not wish to dwell on them today as that is not my purpose in speaking to the bill. I simply note that the opposition, federal Labor, has given bipartisan support to the campaign as it supports a viable and vital tourism industry, and a global campaign was desperately needed. It is about actually getting that campaign right rather than wasting money. I raise this point because it highlights a simple fact: while there is immense credit in the approach of segmenting a campaign according to lifestyle habits and motivation rather than just country of origin, any single theme campaign will not enable the industry to realise its full potential. Cultural differences that can be defined by our global origin have a significant impact on lifestyle choices. This factor that influences our purchasing decisions should not be overlooked as merely an outdated marketing model, particularly when $180 million of taxpayer funded money is put on the table. Taxpayers actually expect value in terms of the return on that investment to try and guarantee the future of the tourism industry. As the shadow minister for tourism, I therefore say on behalf of the opposition that I am concerned by the fact that $180 million was spent on an international campaign that relied perhaps too much on a single theme. This is a risky approach. Tourism Australia knew before the campaign was launched that there were translation problems in Japan as well as cultural differences of major significance in other key markets. From the opposition’s point of view this does not suggest that the campaign should be scrapped and that Tourism Australia should go back to the drawing board and develop a new Brand Australia campaign. We are not suggesting that as it would be a step back for tourism in Australia and we need to move forward. There are faults with the campaign. The industry and Tourism Australia accept that it is not perfect, and we have to look forward in trying to actually improve the campaign and learn from some of our past mistakes. It is about modifying the campaign as necessary and aiming towards building a brand that realises the enormous potential that is actually out there. The year 2005 was anything but a great year for tourism, and 2006 mercifully saw the industry gain back some ground, thanks largely to the Ashes cricket tour that attracted British tourists here in droves, even if it was to watch their team lose to the Aussies. The fact is that MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
190,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Yes, I am very partial to the coal industry. It is a bit like thethere was an increase of 5.8 per cent in British tourists; however, otherwise it was a flat period for tourism, with overall tourism numbers increasing by only 0.6 per cent. Where would we have been without the Ashes tour in terms of our performance over the last 12 months? Although the downward trend in tourist numbers from Japan continued, thankfully it has somewhat abated. The figures were interpreted by the government as good news as tourist spending was up but, as the head of Tourism Council Australia commented, while the aim of attracting higher spending, longer staying visitors was paying off, the lack of growth in market share was a huge concern to Australia. I argue that it is a real concern. As I outlined earlier today, global tourism is booming and the international industry has never been stronger. Why aren’t we as a nation grasping our share of that growth? I say that because, despite this growth, we have not actually increased our market share. New and highly lucrative markets are emerging and they are there for the taking. to tourism spending by state Labor governments, most particularly by Sandra Nori in New South Wales, but also the lack of real funding increases by the Queensland state Labor government and other state Labor governments? tralia. One of the huge successes is the work of the Queensland Minister for Tourism, Margaret Keech, who is well recognised in the industry and by Tourism Australia for doing the right thing by tourism in Queensland. She is not only seeking to promote domestic tourism but is also going out of her way to open up new opportunities internationally, in places such as Asia. She is also pursuing major new opportunities in the Middle East, which is exceptionally important to the member’s own seat on the Gold Coast of Queensland. I commend the activities of a range of tourism ministers in Australia, including Western Australia, where there have been substantial increases in tourism dollars, and the terrific campaign being put together by Jane Lomax-Smith, the South Australian tourism minister. I also noticed at Tourism Australia’s recent awards in Sydney that Victoria, through the work of the previous minister, John Pandazopoulos, dominated the awards on that evening. With respect to the issue of New South Wales, obviously New South Wales rested on its laurels in the aftermath of the Sydney Olympics. It represented a failure by government and industry to actually grab opportunities that should have arisen as a result of the Sydney Olympics. Irrespective of who wins the election this Saturday-and I am confident that the New South Wales Labor Party will win-it is a huge challenge to the new incoming minister and the tourism industry itself to review the structures that surround the operation of tourism in New South Wales and also put together a new funding package which is about not just the promotion of major events but also doing the right thing by key regional areas of tourism in New South Wales. I acknowledge that in Australia at a federal and state level there have been mixed results, but on balance the state Labor governments have actually done the right thing MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007

195,Mr Martin Ferguson,"The truth of the matter is that it is a mixed bag around Ausby tourism-that is, they have recognised, respected and supported the tourism industry Australia wide. If anything is a huge question mark in the minds of a lot of people in the tourism industry, it would be the performance of the federal Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, and weaknesses in respect of the Tourism Australia campaign. I think it is about time that we actually fronted up to the facts concerning the sluggishness of the tourism industry both domestically and internationally under the so-called leadership of the minister for tourism, Fran Bailey. Having said that, I welcome the opportunity to take questions from honourable members because the facts speak for themselves. The real question is the lack of leadership at a federal level from the minister and member for McEwen, Fran Bailey. That takes me back to the issue of new and lucrative markets which are emerging. Let us take the issue of the Middle East market. That is not yet considered a key market for Tourism Australia. Certainly, it meets the criterion of high yield. Increasingly, tourist hubs across the world are welcoming large travelling groups from the Middle East which are cashed up and ready to spend up on quality tourism products. The number of Chinese tourists has also soared in recent years thanks to a relaxing of travel restrictions and a growing middle class that has a disposable income. Some parts of the industry consider China’s export tourism to be one of the most exciting opportunities of our times. China is fast consolidating its status as Asia’s largest outbound tourism market, with 30.5 million Chinese travelling abroad in 2006-a rise of 11 per cent on the 2005 figures. I believe this presents Australia with enormous tourism potential, particularly as we are essentially on their back doorstep and can offer a tourism product that is unique when compared with other countries in South-East Asia. The latest tourism raw figures show that Australia attracted around 30,000 Chinese tourists to our shores, indicating vast opportunity for growth. Australia is positioned to be in the right place at the right time if we actually had some leadership at a government level and also a willingness on the part of industry to get more aggressive about their responsibilities to go out and grasp the opportunity that is in Asia. The question is whether the minister for tourism will ensure that the Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern markets do not become a lost opportunity. To ensure that this opportunity is realised, current barriers need to be overcome. There has been industry concern that rogue operators-and it is the Queensland government Minister Margaret Keech who has actually led the attack on rogue operators-are specifically undermining the industry. This is of special concern to the South Korean and Chinese markets because, unfortunately, they see their people being exploited through a scam known as rentou. Queensland recently brought in an accreditation scheme to eliminate rentou operations as it saw it as such a serious threat to its $18 billion tourist industry. Amid revelations in the media of the presence of rogue tour operators ripping off Korean tourists visiting Australia, the opposition is calling on the government for stronger leadership in helping ministers such as the Queensland minister to clean up the industry. Federal Labor has repeatedly called on greater federal leadership to address this serious issue that poses a real threat to our industry and to the 550,000 people employed in the industry. The industry’s integrity is placed on the line when media headlines, particularly in the international press, tell tales of unscrupulous tourist operators that take advantage of tourists on our shores, and the lack of federal government action in association with state ministers and the MAIN COMMITTEE industry on this front is a serious concern. Rather than doing nothing, the federal government Minister for Industry, Tourism and ResourcesMr Ciobo interjectingGold Coast. You have missed out yet again, my friend, despite a Queensland vacancy, so I will take the smile off your face if you keep intervening. I would like to remind you of your failures, despite your intense lobbying, to actually gain that front bench opportunity. More seriously, I think it is about time the minister for tourism hounded these rogue operators out. I know the member himself has serious concerns as he goes around the industry about the performance of the minister, whispering in their ears. There has been more than the odd media report of dishonest schemes. One of the worse I have heard of involved a group of four South Korean tourists who were charged a total of $440 for the privilege of walking on the Surfers Paradise beach, a pleasure that Australians and all international visitors normally would have a right to enjoy free of charge-and I am sure the honourable member would have done it at half the price. These claims, if true, are outrageous and are the last thing the industry needs when it is experiencing underperforming international visitor numbers. I believe a solution to the problem has been identified by the Queensland government, and it is about time that we had better cooperation at state and federal levels to pursue some of those realistic policy options. There are obvious efficiencies in having a national system of accreditation so that we demand a quality performance by those involved in what is a very important industry for Australia from the point of view of jobs and export earnings. I call on the federal government, in association with the ministers through the ministerial council, to actually get serious about maintaining the integrity of the industry. It is important, as Australia needs to build a quality brand. Tourism Australia has had a challenge in the past on this front. If we are to develop a new product with new experiences then we have to make sure it is a quality product based on integrity and not on unsuspecting tourists being ripped off by rogue operators. This effectively means that we cannot take the ball off the industry with domestic tourism either. It is the mainstay of the industry, and in many cases regional Australia depends on it, especially given the recent drought and bushfires in many areas of regional Australia. Despite increases in domestic tourism yield, the goal of getting more Aussies to take a break and travel in their backyard has proven troublesome, a matter that I raised at the commencement of this speech. The latest industry figures show a slightly healthier domestic tourism industry when compared with the same time last year, but the unfortunate fact is that 2005 was one of the worse years on record. So there is obviously room for improvement off a low base. There is still a long way to go to actually develop a robust domestic industry. I refer to the December 2006 national visitors survey, which showed a four per cent increase in the number of nights Australians spent away from home compared with those in December 2005, when numbers dropped to the second lowest since reporting started. It is perhaps a sign of busier lifestyles, the availability of cheap international airfares, a reluctance to take annual leave, a failure to actually manage a business and a trend towards purchasing home entertainment sysMAIN COMMITTEE",187,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
196,Mr Martin Ferguson,"It is a long wait to become a minister if you represent thetems that people are not taking holidays. They are the challenges that confront domestic tourism in Australia. Unfortunately, they have also encouraged some of our operators who were previously strongly focused on domestic tourism to turn their attention to the international market and direct their attention away from pursuing an increased slice of the domestic market. I simply say that tourism is important to Australia. It is a complex and challenging industry, and it is the responsibility of government to actually work with the private sector in all aspects of tourism-from aviation to the bus and coach industry and to the tourism providers and the theme park operators-to actually make sure we try to fix the difficulties that confront the industry in Australia at the moment and to guarantee proper commercial focus and flexibility in a complex environment. I note that the Uhrig review did suggest some operational amendments that will bring Tourism Australia’s governance arrangements more closely in line with best practice. Those amendments included the removal of the position of the government member on the board and a requirement for ministerial endorsement of the cooperative and operational plans rather than ministerial approval. These are sensible amendments, particularly the removal of the government member from the board, as it eliminates the potential for any conflict of interest for the government member while ensuring that the monitoring of Tourism Australia’s operations remains at arms length. More worrying are the amendments that allow the minister to terminate appointed board members and the reduction in the threshold for ministerial approval of contracts from $5 million to $3 million. You do not have to cast your mind back far to remember the numerous media reports surrounding the sudden departure of Tourism Australia’s general manager, Scott Morrisson, in August last year. Media reports hinted at a personality clash between the minister and Mr Morrisson-whatever the reason, Mr Morrisson was not talking and the whole episode cost taxpayers $500,000, the staff at Tourism Australia four months without a boss and a completely unnecessary interruption to operations at the statutory authority at a critical time of the launch of its global campaign. The only saving grace is that the amendment does necessitate that the minister provide established reason for sacking a board member, to avoid any further capricious terminations. For that reason, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern at: (1) the industry’s current poor health; (2) the need for greater collaboration between Federal and State Government; and (3) the need to heed caution in accepting a broadening of the Ministerial powers regarding the termination of Board members”, This amendment highlights the need to heed caution in accepting a broadening of the ministerial powers regarding the termination of board members while also highlighting the industry’s current static growth and the need for greater collaboration between federal and state ministers. I ask that the government seriously take on board some of our criticisms. It is a very important industry, as our representatives from Queensland know, not only the south-eastern division of Queensland but also the whole state of Queensland. We have to make sure that we get MAIN COMMITTEE the Tourism Australia advertising campaign right. We have to refine it, learn from some of our past mistakes and try to do whatever we can to work in association with industry to grab a better share, a growing share, of a burgeoning international capacity and also to try to encourage Australians to take a holiday. I commend the bill to the House. tralia Amendment Bill 2007 and to acknowledge the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Batman. WhilstI am not supportive of the amendment that he has put forward, it is very clear that tourism certainly is an exceptionally important industry to the Australian economy. I share some of the sentiments of not only the member for Batman but also a large number of government MPs. As someone who has the pleasure of representing Australia’s premier tourism destination-the fabulous Gold Coast-I am pleased to be a strong advocate for the needs of the Australian tourism industry. We know that across the country tourism employs over 550,000 people and accounts for $17 billion to $18 billion of export income, in addition to the domestic tourism spend-all of which means that the tourism industry is a most significant player in the Australian economy. I have been very proud of the Howard government’s track record when it comes to tourism. Under the Howard government we saw the introduction of the tourism white paper, a monumental and significant step forward, ensuring that the tourism industry went from almost being a cottage industry of sorts to an even more progressive, functional, sophisticated and efficient industry in an Australian context. When it comes to marketing Australia abroad, we know that Tourism Australia is the key driver of our success in making sure not only that we create and develop perceptions about what Australia is in the eyes of foreigners but also that we convert the aspirations of many people around the world to visit Australia into reality and that they come along and visit this great nation. We as Australians have a right to feel justifiably proud of this great country we live in. We as Australians have a right to feel justifiably proud of our Australian culture. If tourism is distilled to its most basic elements, we know that it is the desire of those who live abroad to travel to Australia and experience what it is like to be in Australia and to be an Australian, albeit for a short period. This bill ensures that Tourism Australia is brought into line more closely with the recommendations of the Uhrig report. The Uhrig report looked at corporate governance with respect to agencies such as Tourism Australia. I do not intend to dwell on the recommendations, but clearly this bill incorporates a number of those. Most particularly, it does two key things-that is, it removes from the board of Tourism Australia a government representative and thereby prevents as much as possible conflicts of interest, and instils greater independence in the Tourism Australia board. It also makes some changes with respect to the threshold for reporting to the tourism minister the approval of contracts that Tourism Australia enters into. In both of these respects, these are smart steps forward that are consistent with the Uhrig report and are also consistent with the industry’s desire for best practice. Having said all of these things, I must now focus for a short while on comments that have been made by the shadow tourism minister.

Where have the Australian Labor Party been when it comes to tourism? I have been sitting in the House of Representatives for about 5½ years and I think I could count on one hand the number of times that the Australian Labor Party have stood up to ask a question of the tourism minister about the tourism industry. In the life of this particular parliament, the member for Batman has been missing in action. I cannot recall the member for Batman having ever asked a question of the tourism minister. tourism in the House in the last year and why has the focus of the advertising program overseas-the national advertising program featuring Ms Laura Bingle-changed? member for Melbourne Ports had the name of the spokesperson, or spokeswoman in this case, correct. It is not Laura Bingle; it is Lara Bingle. But I will accept that the member for Melbourne Ports is perhaps not as across the tourism industry as he would like to be. I would certainly be happy to give him time to catch up and get some of the names of the key players in our advertising campaign right. Apart from that small oversight, with regard to the first question about how many times the tourism minister has spoken in the parliament, I simply say that I am sure the tourism minister would treat that question seriously and appropriately and come back to the member with the number of times she has spoken. Despite my reputation in this place for having a clear focus on trivia, I do not recall the exact number of times that the tourism minister has spoken in the lower house on tourism matters. Nonetheless, one thing I can be sure of is that, even if, on a worse-case scenario, the tourism minister had only spoken once in the chamber, I know that would be one more time than we have heard from the member for Batman on the tourism industry who, as I said, time and time again goes missing in action when it comes to Australian tourism. The simple fact is that not only does the member for Batman underscore the fact that the Australian Labor Party does not take seriously the Australian tourism industry by his lack of action in the area, but we see even further proof of the Australian Labor Party’s shoddy treatment of the Australian tourism industry by virtue of the fact that state Labor governments around the country have either not increased tourism spending in real terms or, even worse, have slashed tourism spending in real terms. That is what we have seen from the New South Wales Labor government. That is what we have seen from a Labor government that is actually coming to an election this very Saturday. Labor’s track record at a state level is one of looking at the tourism industry, one of our key industries in this country, and turning its back on the tourism industry. In the great state of Queensland, which has such a significant reliance on the tourism industry, what we have seen from Margaret Keech, the state Labor tourism minister, is a lack of increased funding in real terms. The Commonwealth government has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in additional spending on tourism and the result of that has been that state Labor governments have walked away. That is Labor’s track record. That is what the member MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007

203,Mr Danby,I have two questions. How many times has the minister for tourism spoken on,192,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
204,Mr Ciobo,"I will respond to the second question first. It would be advantageous if thefor Batman needs to account for. Despite the rhetoric in here and despite all of this faux concern about the Australian tourism industry, Labor’s policy on tourism is a repugnance to the tourism industry, and justifiably so, because its concern is nothing other than faux concern. If it were real concern, we would not see ministers like Sandra Nori turning her back, slashing, burning and cutting tourism spending in the state of New South Wales. We would not see the Queensland state minister failing to increase, in real terms, spending on tourism. These will be the anchors around the neck of the Australian Labor Party, and that is why I am very pleased to highlight Labor’s faux concern to the constituents of my electorate. In my electorate of Moncrieff, the tourism industry accounts for some 33 per cent of our local economy. That makes it exceptionally important and the single biggest driver of our local economy-some 33 per cent of it is connected to the tourism industry. It would be a very bad day indeed if the Australian Labor Party ever got their hands on the coffers of the Treasury, because we know that they would walk away from the tourism industry. The consequence would be that many Gold Coasters’ jobs and livelihoods and passion for the tourism industry would go straight out the back door. That would be the consequence of Labor in government. Let us be clear about this: Labor would walk away from the tourism industry in the same way that they have walked away from it in New South Wales and Queensland. As a consequence, we would see jobs going out the door on the Gold Coast. SoI say to all my local residents and tourism operators-many of whom engage in world’s best practice when it comes to tourism-that they should be fearful of just how savage an Australian Labor Party government would be if they ever got their hands on the Treasury coffers, because they do not take tourism seriously. I turn now to the issue of climate change, because the member for Batman had a few comments to make on climate change, and in this regard I also have to raise my concern. The member for Batman said in his speech that there are some who would like to apply stringent safeguards and try to turn away international tourists who use, for example, jet aircraft to get to Australia-and justifiably so given the distance involved. WhatI would like to clearly hear from the Australian Labor Party is: who is actually pushing this hard left agenda when it comes to climate change? I am willing to give the member for Batman the benefit of the doubt. The member for Batman has made a number of comments in the past which seem to me to make some common sense, but they stand in stark contrast to some of the loony left ideas that I have heard coming out of the Australian Labor Party. I know that there are a number of Labor members who push very seriously, and with a straight face, an agenda that would have a significant consequence on the Australian tourism industry. I would ask whether the member for Kingsford Smith, for example, supports the notion that people should have to offset carbon emissions from flying in jet aircraft. I would not be surprised if the member for Kingsford Smith believed, as part of his personal policy platform, that those people who fly internationally on jet aircraft should have to buy carbon credits to offset their carbon emissions. I ask the Australian Labor Party: are there members of the ALP who support and believe in that? We have seen a push from the hard left of the Australian Labor Party-through the trade union movement, at an organisational level-for some of these crazy ideas for carbon offsets. This would have dire consequences for Australia’s tourism industry. MAIN COMMITTEE We know that there is a strong green left agenda coming out of Europe, and we know that that strong green left agenda is being picked up by elements of the Australian Labor Party. WhatI want to hear from the Australian Labor Party with regard to the tourism industry is: who in the Australian Labor Party is signing up to that, and what will the consequences be for Australia’s tourism industry? It is all bad news. That is very clear, because if the Australian Labor Party have the opportunity to put their hard green left agenda into policy, we would see inbound tourism numbers into this country fall, including the numbers of high-yielding tourists-the kinds of tourists that employ Gold Coasters and Australians all around this country and account for some $17 billion of exports. A very large proportion of the jobs of the 550,000 people who work in the tourism industry, and a large proportion of that export income, would be at risk if the Australian Labor Party had the opportunity to implement their hard green left agenda when it comes to climate change. In that respect, the tourism industry should be very concerned about the secret agenda that I know the Australian Labor Party have. I now turn to the issue of rogue operators. I do share the member for Batman’s concern over some nefarious elements of the Australian tourism industry-that is, those who are engaged in rogue tour operations. In fact, I do not necessarily think that they are Australian operators. The market in which they operate is Australia, but I have reason to believe that a large number of these operators are in fact not Australian citizens. My concern is that there can be no doubt that tourists who come into Australia from overseas and are fleeced by going to the shops of rogue tour operators, perhaps paying exorbitant prices for so-called duty-free goods, will walk away with a bad taste in their mouths. They will walk away from this country thinking that it is not the great country that we know it to be. They will return home and tell their friends, their family and their work colleagues that Australia is an expensive destination and not one they should travel to. Of particular concern to me are some anecdotal reports that I have heard that indicate that there are some elements of our source markets that travel to Australia and are told that Australia is a very dangerous country and that they should not get off the tour bus and that they should not walk away from their hotel lest they face the great and serious danger of being assaulted or something like that. These kinds of stories do irreparable harm to our international reputation. In this respect I certainly reinforce the minister’s desire and the desire of all government members of parliament for a significant clampdown on these kinds of rogue tour operators. I welcome the proactive way in which the federal Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen, has worked closely with and tried to pull together her state Labor ministers-ragtag bunch that some of them are-to work together in a proactive way to ensure that we are clamping down on rogue operators. I congratulate the federal tourism minister for her great work in bringing together a task force that embraces the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, members of the ATO and members of the department of immigration, all of whom work closely with the various state police forces-and, as I believe is the case in Queensland, with the Queensland state based tourism bureaucracy-to look at the issue of rogue operators and to ensure that there is a clampdown on them. This is an important measure and it will ensure that there is a sustainable basis for the tourism indusMAIN COMMITTEE try to go forward and, most importantly, will ensure that we address the issue of rogue operators and the irreparable damage that they do. Finally, I would like to touch on and pay tribute to a number of key individuals that I turn to on a regular basis for advice on the tourism industry-Kerry Watson; Peter Doggett and Pavan Bhatia from Gold Coast Tourism; Matt Hingerty from the Australian Tourism Export Council; and Chris Brown and Owen Johnstone Donnett from TTF. All of these individuals talk to me on a regular basis and I am grateful for their input with respect to Australia’s tourism industry. I take tourism very seriously. The people of the Gold Coast take tourism very seriously. It is little wonder why when this services industry is generating some $17 billion worth of export income. I believe this is just the beginning. It is my sincere belief that, through a collaborative approach with the various tourism ministers and through some of these state based tourism ministers stepping up to the plate and increasing their tourism spending in the same way that the federal government has increased its tourism spending, Australia can bat well above its weight when it comes to attracting our share of inbound international tourists. This is not to disregard our domestic tourism industry, a very important industry, and on the Gold Coast 60 per cent of our tourism comes from the drive market. But the really highyielding tourism, the tourism that is ultimately going to generate significant export income for Australia, is of course our international tourism. In that regard, if we all work collaboratively to ensure that the state based tourism ministers and groups like Tourism Australia, the Australian Tourism Export Council and TTF develop a clear plan going forward which we can continue to build on, Australia can increase not only its share of the international market, of international tourists, but also our repeat visitor rate. All of these things will mean there are more jobs for Australians and that our export income increases from $17 billion or $18 billion to even higher amounts, and that is good news for the people of Australia. In January, I had the unique privilege of travelling to Las Vegas. I must say that Las Vegas is an interesting city to be in, even for someone from the Gold Coast. There is one thing that is crystal clear to me: the tourism authorities in Las Vegas understand what it is that they sell and they sell it very well. In Australia, we certainly are not lacklustre when it comes to blowing our own trumpet, when it comes to the professionalism of the individuals that work in the tourism industry, especially in the upper echelon, but it is also clear to me that there are some things we can learn from a city like Las Vegas. There are some decisions that they have taken across the city that have ultimately meant that Las Vegas as a brand is in the top five brands in the world, similar to Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and those kinds of brands. That is the power of destination marketing that has been achieved by the city of Las Vegas and I believe it is the kind of aspiration that we should have for the tourism industry in Australia. I truly believe that if we remain focused on this goal, and that if we get the very best people working collaboratively, we can ensure that Australia takes its place in the world. We must be mindful of threats to this. As I said, one of the most significant and rapidly emerging threats appearing on the horizon when it comes to the tourism industry in Australia is the climate change debate and some of the hard green left agendas being pursued within it. Make no mistake: there are elements within Europe, the United States and, unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party who would like to ensure that people do not use jet aircraft to travel. They say this is because it increases greenhouse gas emissions. I say to those people: get real, MAIN COMMITTEE get serious, wake up and recognise that international tourists flying on jet aircraft make only a very tiny contribution to carbon emissions. The very worse thing that we could do is swallow hook, line and sinker this hard green left agenda because it would threaten to the core the viability and sustainability of Australia’s tourism industry. Having said all of that, I commend this bill to the House for the significant steps it will take to implement the recommendations of the Uhrig report. I certainly believe that the industry, and Tourism Australia as an agency, will prosper as a result of this bill being passed. calling the member for MoretonI will just note-not being able to speak on the bill because I am in the chair-that I flew to the Gold Coast on Friday and stayed there Friday, Saturday and Sunday with my wife, daughter and two grandchildren at Main Beach. It was a magnificent experience, as it always is, and Gold Coast tourism is alive and well. and I never go there! The member for Moncrieff made a fantastic contribution. The passion, expertise and honesty that he brings to any discussion about tourism are appreciated by me. The member for Moncrieff has left the building, and his contribution made me think that if only Elvis had sung ‘Viva Australia’ maybe we would be on the map in the way Las Vegas is. It is the 30th anniversary of Elvis’s passing on 15 August this year. I am afraid that being an old rock and roll disc jockey never dies! I blame my years at MacGregor State High School, which got me started on that track. I will now turn to the Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007. Like the member for Moncrieff, I want to begin by saying that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism is ideally placed. Her virtue of understanding that tourism in this country is essentially a small business enterprise is a very important element in this discussion. It is very important to know therefore that tourism is enormously disorganised. This bill is dealing with recommendations from John Uhrig’s report to do with members of the board of Tourism Australia, ministerial power, reducing the threshold of ministerial approval for contracts and so forth. It is important that there be a greater sense of accountability for the enormous amount of money that government pours into assisting the tourism industry. There is nothing wrong with tourism being essentially a small business sector by any measure. Because of the initiative that individual small business owners bring to it and the energy and the vitality of the sector, it is important that it maintains its dynamism, but the disorganised structure of tourism does make it hard, as the member for Moncrieff said, to get consistency in the brand. Moreover, because of the marketing credentials-I will not say expertise-that I gained from Griffith University in my electorate, I know it is important that not only do we sell what Australia promises to be but we deliver and exceed expectations. As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which is currently inquiring into labour shortages in the tourism sector-it is all on the Hansard-there is no difficulty in my saying that I am concerned about the long-term possibilities of tourism meeting the expectations we are creating in the market. We are fundamentally short of people who can make beds, can clean toilets in hotel rooms or can serve in restaurants. It is a point of reckoning that Tourism Australia have to get their heads around. There has to be enormously strong and organised lobbying of government to change some of the approaches we have with regard to the styles of migration MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007

206,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.22 Am),"I live only 40 minutes from Surfers Paradiseto this country. There is going to be a need for us to get real about this. There is going to be a need for us to look very closely at the simple fact that when the full effects of the ‘So where the bloody hell are you?’ campaign-that is the first time. I have sworn in the parliamentkick in, potentially, the tourism industry in this country will fail to cope with the extra visitor numbers. Why? Because in so many of these small businesses they are unable to attract and retain staff while the mining sector and the resources sector are sucking the tourism industry dry. In Western Australia we have just been through Broome and Perth conducting the committee’s inquiry. We heard about the Chicken Treat store in Broome having to shut down because Cable Beach Resort opened a new restaurant and all the staff at Chicken Treat left. But it gets far worse than that. When you find entrepreneurial private business operators, who previously were trying to grow their businesses and start new opportunities, now having to go back to making beds, cooking meals and literally cleaning toilets-obviously washing their hands in between-you realise that we have a problem in that this sector may not be able to sustain itself. So the work of Tourism Australia is fundamentally important. It is absolutely vital that it is not separated too far from the whole-of-government strategies needed to accommodate the tourism industry. I note that my very good friend and very capable colleague the member for Blair is here, and the member for Moncrieff would understand too that another fundamental potential failure in the tourism sector is not investing properly in infrastructure. Three times a week Qantas flies direct from LA to Brisbane. When people arrive here, they hit the Gateway Arterial Road and a traffic jam-which they would not put up with in southern California-trying to get to Dreamworld, Movie World and Wet’n’Wild, all the great things located about a 30-minute drive south of Brisbane. It is a fantastic road once they get past the Gateway Arterial Road at Springwood. I do not think that is a very good start for their time in Australia. Mr Cameron Thompson-Abysmal. enormous earning capacity in tourism-$19.1 billion in 2005, increasing to some $31.6 billion by 2015-as a result of the proactive efforts of this government to invest wisely in good economic management and to encourage individuals to start businesses. If we are serious about encouraging people to take the opportunity to show off their wares in their local communities, unless we back those people with proper investment in adequate infrastructure, we are going to have a fundamental failure in meeting people’s reasonable expectations. The Gold Coast is a complete basket case when it comes to infrastructure. The Pacific Highway at the back of the coast is in gridlock from four o’clock in the afternoon, and this is a city of a couple of hundred thousand people which swells to probably one million people more weeks of the year than not because of all the visitors. I do not think that is a very clever introduction to Australia or indeed a very clever introduction to south-east Queensland. The failure of state governments to invest in this way is a problem. Equally, people arriving in Brisbane are going to be told, ‘You’re going to have your shower timed.’ We are going to get to a stage in Brisbane where, because of the shortage of water, there is going to be a push-button tap or a meter for the number of minutes you can run a shower in a hotel room. That is where it is going to get to. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
207,Mr Hardgrave,"It is absolutely abysmal. The member for Blair is right. We haveMr Cameron Thompson-It’s not tourism. failure of the Goss government to build the Wolffdene dam in the early nineties. The chief adviser to Premier Goss is now the Leader of the Opposition in this place. The member for Griffith, Mr Rudd, said to Wayne Goss, the then opposition leader in Queensland, in 1989: ‘Let’s get our green credentials right. We’ll oppose the Wolffdene dam, in the foothills of Mount Tamborine. We won’t allow this water storage plan that apparently has been on the books for decades to go ahead. We’ll create a political environment where we can say that there’s plenty of water in Queensland, we don’t need it, there’ll be no problem.’ Tourists now arriving in south-east Queensland are facing the prospect of having every drop of water they consume being metered. That is the sort of circumstance we are facing in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast, of course, is slightly more fortunate than Brisbane in one sense, because the Hinze Dam is overflowing. But again, it was a failure on the part of the Goss government to put in place a water strategy to share around the water resources of south-east Queensland. It is being hastily cobbled together by the Beattie government. Six years after the Beattie government were told water was going to be short in south-east Queensland, six years after they failed to tell the people of south-east Queensland, ‘Let’s start restricting your water usage now so we can make it last for longer,’ the mad panic is on. And what is that going to do to the tourism industry? Queensland-not the Smart State, not the Sunshine State; the dried-up state. That is where tourism is going to go in south-east Queensland. The reality is a big difference from the slogans and the marketing. There is this dumb approach by the Queensland government, which is saying, ‘All these people moving up from down south are stealing our water because they’re drinking it, using our power because they’re switching on lights, driving on our roads and causing traffic jams.’ The ‘Bombay express’, which is the Gold Coast to Brisbane train-literally missing are the seats on the roof of this train-only starts at Robina. It does not service all of the tourist strip anyway; it is just a joke. Every part of the basic infrastructure problem is being blamed on people coming up from other states, and yet the Beattie government are going to their mates at Virgin and saying, ‘Paint up your plane and put “Head to Queensland” on the plane.’ They are advertising in every part of Australia: ‘Move to Queensland.’ Fifteen hundred people a week are moving to Queensland, and they are wondering why the traffic jams are getting worse, why the water supply is getting worse, why the power system is about to fail and why the Bombay express is getting stacked with people every day. When you add it all up, the failure of state Labor governments, starting with the Goss-Rudd government through 1989point of order? was going to ask the honourable member for Moreton whether he would be prepared to answer a question.

So we find $1 out of every $4 that goes from the Australian government to the Queensland government for things like education goes to the bureaucracy, first and foremost. So my suspicion is that a failure to invest in infrastructure is because their priority is about paying a small number of people a lot of money instead of fixing up the services that need to be maintained. You would think that the state of Queensland would see investment in the basics like roads, rail, water and power-to make a trip to Queensland a fantastic experience, without any of the restrictions that are about to be applied to tourists-as a priority for the Queensland government. They just say, ‘Send us more money.’ They keep blaming the feds. I am sick to death of this state-federal blame game thing.

I have people from Salisbury to Kuraby who currently have to put up with a third rail track being put in, who have huge mullock heaps of leftover dirt being placed behind their homes, who are putting up with road crossings of rail not working, because the Queensland government is in complete panic mode.

Mr Martin Ferguson-I seek to ask the honourable member for Moreton a question. Mr Martin Ferguson-Given the need for cooperation between all tiers of government to facilitate the growth and development of the tourism industry, can the member for Moreton advise the House as to whether he supports the proposal by his good friend the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, to require the Queensland and Australian governments not only to fund the infrastructure costs in the Brisbane City Council area but also to meet the cost of rolling stock such as the bus fleet? Should this be a Commonwealth and state government responsibility? fact administered by Queensland government laws and regulations, and the Queensland government again is prioritising expenditure on bureaucracies despite the record amounts of money that are being sent. In fact, I have to say that I would prefer to quarantine a whole slice of the GST money going to Queensland and to give it to local authorities because Brisbane City, Gold Coast City, the Sunshine Coast councils, Paul Pisasale in Ipswich City, Beaudesert, Boonah, Logan, Don Seccombe in Redlands, and all of the other shires have a far better ideamayors all have a far better idea about what to do and, moreover, are more prepared to do it.

Federal Labor’s plan-the member for Batman’s plan and indeed the state government’s plan-is about keeping trucks forever running along Kessels Road.

227,The Deputy Speaker,Is the member for Moreton willing to take a question?,200,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
228,Mr Hardgrave,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to take a question because I wantber for Fisher. In my electorate I have an enormous number of people who come from places like Taiwan and China, and the family visits that come into our part of south-east Queensland add an enormous amount to our local economy. Sure, they go off to Australia Zoo and Lone Pine but they spend a lot of time in local restaurants around Sunnybank and in spending a lot of money building our local economy. Thirty years ago we had the Oasis and the Acacia Gardens at Station Road in Sunnybank. They were the beginnings of a lot of the great theme parks we now enjoy at the top end of the Gold Coast. They have gone now, and we no longer have busloads of people from all over south-east Queensland visiting those wonderful old swimming pools. There are all houses in those areas now. But one thing is for sure: what has not changed has been the quality of the infrastructure, and what has not been improved has been the quality of the facilities for visitors. If we get further big athletic events at the QEII stadium, the Queensland Sport and Athletic Centre at Nathan, the infrastructure in my area will not cope. Tens of thousands of people will come to Australia and they will see all the failings of state governments, in particular, to invest properly in these sorts of things. That is the sort of message that I think Tourism Australia have to deal with, no matter who is on the board and no matter what other tasks they may happen to have at hand. Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007. I think most honourable members would recognise that the tourism industry is one of the most vital industries in Australia and produces an incredible number of dollars towards benefiting our Australian economy and creating jobs. The area I am privileged to represent in the Australian parliament, the central and southern Sunshine Coast, has tourism as one of its key industries. We welcome people from right around the country and right around the world who come to spend their dollars on the Sunshine Coast. One of our great challenges is the need for infrastructure and, with the population of the areas likely to double over the next 10 to 15 years, we always struggle to get the infrastructure to meet the needs of our rapidly growing population. That is why I am so pleased that the Australian government recognises the importance of growth areas like the Sunshine Coast and, I suppose you would also say, sea change communities. Sea change communities are those communities that have a permanent population of a certain figure. We might have, say, 250,000 people living on the Sunshine Coast, but on any night of the year there might well be 350,000 heads on beds. Often the challenge for sea change communities is to attract government funded infrastructure to represent their actual populations rather than their permanent populations. The coast councils-the sea change community councils-have to provide infrastructure for the number of people who are in their communities at any one time, and I realise that that is an ongoing challenge for all members representing sea change communities. I think that Mr Neville, who is at the table, also represents a sea change community. Members on both sides of the House represent these communities, and obviously adequate funding for these communities will be a challenge regardless of which party is in the parliament. Tourism is a key driver for the Australian economy, not just for those economies in sea change communities, and contributes dramatically to Australia’s exports and gross domestic product.

231,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.42 Am),"I am pleased to be able to make a contribution on theThe Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007 seeks to implement recommendations arising from the review of corporate governance arrangements of Tourism Australia. These amendments are part of the response by the government to Mr John Uhrig’s review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, which, as the explanatory memorandum points out, examined and reported on improving the structures and governance practices of such entities. I suppose that it is simply a fact of life these days that everyone expects government bureaucracy to be open and transparent and to follow best practice, and that is why this bill is doing a number of things to improve best practice for the tourism industry in Australia and for the organisation known as Tourism Australia. We need proper corporate governance for Tourism Australia because of the absolutely vital role that tourism is playing in Australia and the important role that Tourism Australia is playing in encouraging people from right around the world-who have the right to choose where they visit-to visit this wonderful country, Australia. Earnings from tourism happen to be at record levels. International tourists spent $1.4 billion over 12 months in the year ending September 2006. I hate to think what situation the Australian economy would be in were this dominant industry absent. International tourists are staying in Australia for longer periods. Given the geographic location of Australia it is understandable that tourists are staying longer, with the average length of a stay increasing by close to 12½ per cent or 3.3 days in the year ending September 2006. The longer that tourists stay in our country, the more dollars they spend, the more jobs are created and the more the economy is boosted. Latest forecasts released by the Tourism Forecasting Committee estimate that total inbound economic value will grow at an average annual rate of 5.2 per cent, from $19.1 billion in 2005 to $31.6 billion in 2015. The strategy of the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and more generally of the government is to attract the high-yielding, long-staying experience seeker, and this is paying dividends-and I suspect that some of those might even find their way to your state of Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. When the results of the new international campaign are realised over the next 12 to 18 months, the outlook for tourism will be even brighter. I think it is instructive for us to pause for a moment and look at the job creation opportunities resulting from the tourism industry. Over half a million Australians-550,100 Australians-are employed by the tourism industry. That represents one person in 18 in the Australian workforce. Nationally, tourism provides much higher direct employment than the mining industry and more than agriculture, forestry and fishing combined. It is also a very important employer of younger Australians. Of course, any industry that gives young Australians employment opportunities ought to be fostered and encouraged. Studies by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that in March 2005 more than 35 per cent of employees in the accommodation, cafes and restaurants, and retail trade sectors were aged between 15 and 24, and that is more than double the all-industry average. Part-time positions in the tourism industry record even higher rates of young workers aged less than 25 years, with a high proportion of female employees. Overall the tourism industry accounts for about 10 to 11 per cent of total national employment in the 15to 24-year-old age group, double its share of total employment of 5.6 per cent. MAIN COMMITTEE A lot of people ask: ‘How long has Tourism Australia been around? Does it do a good job? Why was it established?’ It was established as a key strategy in the tourism white paper, coupled with the biggest ever funding package for tourism of close to a quarter of a billion dollars-in fact, $235 million. The former minister, the honourable member for North Sydney, played a fairly key role in relation to this. Tourism Australia is our window to the world. It is responsible for increasing the awareness, knowledge and desire of both local travellers and travellers from abroad to travel to and to travel throughout this wonderful nation of Australia. Research is conducted. In fact Tourism Australia likes to report on trends in international and domestic travel. It is pretty much the key player in the Australian tourism industry. It is the solid link that brings the tourism industry together. It encourages people to travel domestically from within Australia and it encourages people who make holiday choices from right around the world to choose to come to Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have seen some of the wonderful advertising campaigns that Tourism Australia runs overseas. Running a good campaign encourages people to travel to this country, and when they travel to this country as tourists they open their wallets and our economy is boosted and jobs are created. I mentioned at the outset that the purpose of the Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007 is to improve the governance arrangements for Tourism Australia. That is not to say that Tourism Australia was not appropriately governed before, but of course we always need to be at the cutting edge of world’s best practice and this is why the government is responding, as far as Tourism Australia is concerned, to the recommendations of Mr John Uhrig. Tourism Australia really has done a wonderful job during the period since its inception. With the changes mentioned in this bill to improve the governance of Tourism Australia, this effective organisation will become even more effective. Other honourable members have outlined the detailed amendments, but essentially the bill will remove the position of government member from the board; broaden ministerial power to terminate the appointment of board members; replace the process of ministerial approval of the corporate plan and operational plan with one of endorsement, while maintaining that the plans do not come into force until ministerial endorsement is received; and reduce the threshold for ministerial approval of contracts from $5 million to $3 million. I think that is important. Given the importance of this industry, I think it is vital that the minister does have the capacity to become more involved when a lower dollar figure is indeed the figure that is relevant. The amendments will improve the governance arrangements. The changes do not in any way, shape or form alter the general structure, the general function or the general objectives of Tourism Australia or the delivery of excellent service it provides both to Australia and abroad. As you would expect, Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill also includes some transitional arrangements just to make sure that when these changes provided for in this bill are actually implemented there is not any disruption to the operations of Tourism Australia. This is an important bill that seeks to make a wonderful Australian organisation even better. Any bill that will help Tourism Australia attract more people to this country and encourage more people to holiday within Australia is an important bill, and I am very pleased to be able to commend it to the Main Committee in the debate today. MAIN COMMITTEE Australia Amendment Bill 2007. I welcome the changes that will be brought about as a result of this bill’s passage. The changes to the governance of Tourism Australia are very important. Since much of the money that is appropriated to run Tourism Australia is obviously taxpayers’ money-up to 80 per cent of that money-it is important that we have good governance arrangements that are in line with best practice as identified by the Uhrig recommendations. Tourism is a very important industry for Australia. I think we often talk of the more traditional industries such as education, agriculture and mining as being important to Australia. But so often we do not necessarily talk in the same way of the importance of tourism to the economy of Australia. It is a very important industry. In fact, in my own electorate and across many parts of regional Australia, tourism plays a significant part in generating jobs in those rural and regional communities. Tourism Australia. I think has done a remarkable job. It is responsible for international and domestic marketing of Australia. Wherever you see those as promoting Australia overseas, I am sure that those who see them see Australia as a great tourism destination. It is something to be commended. It is a very competitive market out there internationally. We have to compete with the other countries of the world to gain those tourism dollars from those tourists who seek a holiday, business tourism or ecotourism destination. So the advertising done by Tourism Australia internationally is of vital importance. If we get that wrong-if Tourism Australia gets that wrong-it will certainly have an impact on the economy of Australia, given that it is now such an integral part of the economy overall in Australia. I said a moment ago that tourism has many forms. We have ecotourism, business tourism and holiday tourism. In my own electorate a very important element of it is fly-drive tourism, particularly for those coming from overseas. I just want to place on the record the importance to my constituency of tourism in the outback. In central western Queensland they have an outback tourism association, made up of the local councils and representatives who are an integral part of this outback tourism destination region. I often describe that part of my electorate as the cradle in which the national identity of Australia was born. There is no doubt, and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would agree, that the song Waltzing Matilda is part of our national identity. I often describe it as our unofficial national anthem. I know that wherever Australians are, whether they are touring Australia or overseas, when a few bars of Waltzing Matilda are played you will see Australians from all walks of life gathering to join in the singing of Waltzing Matilda. People who are seeking a tourism destination in the outback of Queensland can in fact go to Winton, which is the birthplace of Waltzing Matilda. It was not far from there, on the Diamantina, that Banjo Paterson was inspired to write that now famous song. Winton, with the Matilda Centre, is a great tourism destination. Of course, more recently there has been the discovery of the remains of dinosaurs, which is of fascination to people of all ages. That presents another opportunity for tourists to visit that region. They can hear the story of the dinosaurs and of many millions of years of history and what that can tell us about the times of this prehistoric creature. Winton is where the very first board meeting of Qantas was held. Now we have the home of Qantas and the founders museum in Longreach, right at the airport. That includes the original hangar where they in fact made their own aircraft in those very early days. It is a great MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
232,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (11.53 Pm),"I rise this morning to speak on the Tourismtourist attraction not just for Australians but also for people who are coming from overseas seeking a tourism destination. I would recommend that they visit places like Winton and Longreach. The Stockman’s Hall of Fame and the Royal Flying Doctor Service are iconic in terms of Australia’s outback and its early development. All of these can be seen out in central western Queensland. I am sure of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, is the Australian Workers Heritage Centre in Barcaldine. It is a great tourist attraction. Unfortunately, we had some very irresponsible people, as yet unidentified, who poisoned this great iconic tree last year. gum, with all its gnarled sides, standing there now dead. It is tragic, and those who would perpetrate such an act must be brought to justice, if only we could get some leads on those who poisoned that iconic tree. It is iconic as the birthplace of the Labor Party because it was from that meeting, where the fuhrers first met in Barcaldine to discuss political representation in the parliament, that the workers, as they united, identified someone whom they wanted to get into the state parliament of Queensland-and they did just that. I am sure our Whip, the member for Hinkler, would agree with me. You might be wondering what all this has to do with the bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is all about tourism and the iconic places that tourists can visit. Born out of that same conflict were the meetings of the pastoralists and graziers, who then also sought political representation in the parliaments of Australia, and thus the Country Party. So in many ways two great political parties were born out of hardship and struggle in western Queensland. That story can be told and seen in Barcaldine-another great tourist destination not only for people of Australia but for people from overseas who are seeking to retrace the history of the early development of Australia-at the Australian Workers Heritage Centre. One thing that is important if we are to see the growth of international tourism into central western Queensland is the Longreach airport. The Longreach airport, as it stands now, is run by the local council, the Longreach Shire Council, which does a magnificent job. That whole region of central western Queensland, the area that I have partly described in relation to the tourist attractions out there, is under what we call the Sustainable Regions Program. The Longreach Shire Council is working through the processes, with the support of the other local councils in that region, to get a commercial operator interested in taking over the management of that airport. It is seeking sustainable regional money from the government to assist with the upgrade of that airport to enable jet aircraft, rather than turboprops, to fly into that airport, which will bring tourism growth and tourists from many parts of Australia and overseas to that region. That airport is integral to the growth of international tourism in that part of Queensland. It would bring many benefits if we were able to get final approval through the due diligence which it is going through at the moment agreed and get that money into that airport. It would become a hub for the region for those fly-in fly-out tourists, whether they are from Australia or overseas. We have only got to look at places like the Gold Coast, Cairns or Hobart in Tasmania to see that you need to rely on good airport infrastructure if you are to maximise the opportunities that are out there for attracting tourists to your region.

234,Mr Bruce Scott,"I was there only last week to see this great structure of a ghostmuch as they can in the shortest possible time. I believe that that is why air travel is, in many areas of Australia, replacing the drive-in market. It maximises the time that they can spend in their tourist destination. Other parts of my electorate that have great tourism destinations which are promoted, I know, by Tourism Australia are Roma and Charleville. Charleville, of course, is the home of the bilby. It will be Easter very shortly. I encourage all Australians to buy an Easter bilby rather than an Easter egg, because the money that is raised through that process will go to preserving the bilbies in Australia. The bilby is an endangered species, quite a wonderful little mammal that is found in very few parts of Australia and that has almost been decimated by the wild cat population and other pests, including foxes. It is important that we are able to make sure that our bilby will survive, and we should all be encouraged to buy those Easter bilbies this Easter. Charleville is the home where that is being preserved. Another tourism destination for people seeking an ecotourism destination is the Darling Downs, in the granite belt of my area, where there are great tourism opportunities. Historic Jimbour House, outside Dalby, is becoming a very important tourism destination for special events. Very near there you can see the great Dingo Barrier Fence, parts of which are being preserved. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your early days in western Queensland, involved in the wool industry, that was the great barrier that-nearly always-separated dingoes from the cattle country and from the sheep country so that the sheep industry could thrive and prosper and create the jobs that were important to so many regional towns and rural communities. I did perhaps stray a little from the original intention of the bill, but I thought it was important to cover some of the important tourism destinations which are in my electorate and highlight their importance to the jobs and the wealth of those communities. Tourism Australia do a magnificent job in promoting Australia as a tourism destination internationally and also domestically. I want to make sure that they continue that work and that they continue promoting not only our coastal and major capital cities but also our regional cities and the outback of Australia, which has so much to offer. I support the bill and look forward to its passage, because it will mean that the governance arrangements will be improved. That is important, given that Tourism Australia is a statutory authority that requires federal taxpayers’ money for its operations. I commend the bill to the House. FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (12.07 pm)-I would firstly like to thank the members who have participated in this debateon the Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007-our tourism industry is a very important industry-but I understand that the opposition spokesperson wants to move an amendment. I have to say that this is very disappointing, given the undertaking that I had from the opposition that this was non-controversial legislation and could have been expedited in this chamber. I will just deal very quickly with the three points. The opposition spokesperson has mentioned the industry’s ‘current poor health’. There could be nothing further from the truth. This is now a $75 billion industry. In the last 12 months, we have had the highest number of international visitors coming to Australia. Most importantly, the yield in the last 12 months was $1.8 billion more than in any other year-that is right, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams: $1.8 billion more-bringing the total of export earnings for this industry to $19½ billion. MAIN COMMITTEE In areas like yours in Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, this is very important. In fact, your own state is one state that has been improving its numbers. One of the reasons it has been improving its numbers is that there is greater collaboration between Tourism Australia and all of the state and regional tourist authorities. The Commonwealth has now put $21½ billion dollars into research. This is not research that we keep locked up in a vault within Tourism Australia. This research is shared with the states on an ongoing basis. There probably has never before been greater cooperation between state and regional tourist authorities and Tourism Australia. One state sticks out and that is the state of New South Wales. The reason it is not performuty Speaker, is simply that the New South Wales government is spending less today in marketing tourism than it was spending five years ago. It is not rocket science to know that you simply have to put funding in if you are going to get results. I take my hat off to the Tasmanian government. I believe in giving credit where it is due and I think the states around Australia have recognised the value of tourism. The domestic market has been flat for some time but, because of the level of cooperation and work that the Commonwealth is showing through its leadership, the latest figures show that our domestic market has started to turn around. So when I am informed by the opposition spokesperson, the member for Batman, that there needs to be greater collaboration between federal and state governments, I do not know how on earth he could say that. In a press release put out by all of the state tourism ministers, they agreed to closer ties and they took advantage of the new intergovernmental arrangements which formally set out principles for cooperation and agreement. At a meeting of tourism ministers chaired by the South Australian Labor Minister for Tourism, Jane Lomax-Smith, issues discussed were based on sharing of market intelligence, tourism quality, international promotion, regional tourism, destination marketing plans, tourism and conservation issues and matters relating to the understanding of the real economic value of tourism. That is a pretty fair list on which all of the state tourism ministers agree that there is a very good cooperative working relationship between them and the federal government. When the member for Batman makes the point that there needs to be greater collaboration between federal and state governments, I think he should come back here and tell us what he is referring to. He should come back here now and tell us exactly what he is referring to. I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker: it will be the first time that the member for Batman has actually spoken about tourism in this place. He has also raised a point about broadening ministerial powers regarding the termination of board members. Do you know what he has done? He has taken one line out of a whole document which enshrines the flexibility of Tourism Australia and gives the board additional authority. Why would a government not want the ability, if a board member was performing in a most unsatisfactory manner, to get rid of a non-performing board member in the interests of a $75 billion industry? More than half a million Australians depend on this industry for their jobs and the government is really looking after the men and women and their family members who work in this great industry. I have to say that I am very disappointed in this pathetic political point-scoring by the member for Batman. I actually thought better of him. I can see that my trust was misplaced, and I think that it is shame on his head for trying to politically point-score about an issue MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
235,"Ing As Well As And Is Not Showing The Level Of Growth As Your Own State Of Tasmania, Mr Dep","backed by the whole of the tourism industry, Tourism Australia, the state tourist authorities and the regional tourist authorities. I say again: there is still some time left; why doesn’t the member for Batman come back into this chamber? If he wants to put these points forward as an amendment, he should be prepared to come into this chamber to debate them with me, because I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the points he has raised are nonsense. Let me just reaffirm those points again. Despite what the member for Batman says, the industry is in very good shape. Every industry can do better, and this government has provided unprecedented levels of funding to ensure that this industry gets every opportunity to do better. There has never been a greater level of cooperation between the federal government and the state governments for the simple fact that we all realise this is an industry that spans territorial boundaries. It is an industry that we all understand employs more than half a million Australians. Most significantly, it employs more than 200,000 people in regional areas of Australia, which of course is why the Australian government, the Howard government, is so keen and so prepared, as it always has been, not just to stand and talk mere rhetoric about this great industry but also to get in and back it with unprecedented levels of funding. The third point is about trying to point-score about one sentence in a 100-plus-page document that everybody in the industry supports. Many have acknowledged that the Australian government has taken a real leadership role on behalf of the industry in this matter; this of course follows the Uhrig review. The bottom line is that any government, no matter what level of government it is, is responsible for the taxpayer funds that are being used. As a marketing organisation, Tourism Australia gets more than 80 per cent of its funding directly from the Australian government. The board of Tourism Australia, charged with the responsibility of overseeing the expenditure of that money, must be accountable. It must also be accountable for the actions it takes. Once again, I will not-and this government will not-shy away from saying that if in the unlikely situation a board member is performing in an unsatisfactory manner then the government providing the funding to that organisation, the level of government that appoints the members of that board, has the right to say, in the interests of the more than half a million Australians dependent on this industry for their jobs, that the board has to do its job. As I said, I have given the member for Batman as much time as I can to get his skates on and get up here to try to justify this absolutely pathetic political point-scoring-the three points I have just dismissed. I have nothing further to add other than to say once again that there are members on both sides of this parliament who have a genuine interest in and commitment to ensuring that our great tourism industry continues to be one of the fastest growth sectors in our economy and, importantly, provides jobs and training and the delivery of real benefits not just to our national economy but to state, regional and local economies. I commend this legislation to the House. be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Batman has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
236,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Dgh Adams),"The original question was that the billDebate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Howard: That the House: (a) record its deep regret at the tragic loss of life and serious injuries that resulted from the aircraft accident in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, on 7 March 2007; (b) note that amongst the 21 people killed were 5 Australians serving their nation, working for: the Australian Federal Police-Mark Scott and Brice Steele; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-Liz O’Neill; AusAid-Alison Sudradjat; and the Fairfax Press-Morgan Mellish; and record its deep appreciation of their meritorious public service; (c) tender its profound sympathy to the Government and people of Indonesia, and to the families of all the people killed and injured in the accident; and (d) extend its best wishes to all those injured for a speedy recovery, recalling particularly Cynthia Banham, Michael Hatton, Kyle Quinlan and Roger Tallboys, who lost their lives and for those who suffered in the dreadful crash of the Garuda 737 plane. I particularly want to make some comments about Cynthia Banham, a crash survivor. The week before the crash, Cynthia was in my office discussing veterans and defence issues. As we were reminded yesterday by the member for Barton, Cynthia had sat through the Sea King crash inquiry and had clearly supported those involved in that tragic crash, and their families. Cynthia, a Sydney Morning Herald journalist, had also written a piece on a speech given by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Bruce Billson. In response to the veterans’ anger sparked by that speech, the minister suggested she had misquoted him, but Cynthia Banham strongly denied getting it wrong. Yesterday, all speakers, both government and opposition, remarked on what a wonderful and professional journalist she is. Mr Robert McClelland, the member for Barton, stated: I will return in my comments to Cynthia Banham. Interestingly, and perhaps profoundly, I became quite close to Cynthia during her reporting of the Sea King accident. I know that during that investigation she became quite an advocate for the families who had suffered loss in that accident. Cynthia covered a broad range of views, but I think that in her writings we can see-more than with any other journalist in Australia, I think it is fair to say-a real passion for those who have suffered injustice. I note the Minister for Defence nodding in appreciation. Cynthia really was an advocate for those who perhaps had been afforded less justice than we as a community and a parliament would expect. She will forever have our respect in that regard. Cynthia is receiving strong support from her partner, Mike Harvey. Mike is the journalist who was involved in the leaked document which exposed the government’s response to the Clark review. He is still enduring the ramifications of that issue. I had the opportunity to speak to Mike the other day; he is without doubt a man’s man. I know he is closely and strongly supporting Cynthia in the struggle she is going through. Cynthia is currently being treated in Royal Perth Hospital. I make a plea to the veterans community in Australia. Here we have two champions of the veterans and defence community. Cynthia is lucky to be alive but has suffered incredible injuries, including lower limb MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007
237,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (12.21 Pm),"I want to convey my deepest condolences to allamputation. She fights a daily challenge with an immense courage and spirit. She has the love and support of her partner, Michael Harvey. My plea to the veteran community is to get behind Cynthia. Offer her all of your support, encouragement, prayers and positive thoughts. Indeed, the veteran community in Australia should adopt Cynthia. I think the love and support of the veteran community will go a long way to helping her on the difficult road to recovery that she confronts. It is a road of marathon proportions and challenges. I call on the veteran community to make sure Cynthia does not walk that road alone. pm)-In rising to speak on the motion of condolence in relation to the Yogyakarta air crash of March 2007, I do so from a particular perspective-that is, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with specific responsibility for the activities of AusAID and also for the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Two of the members of those agencies perished in this crash. I refer here to Allison Sudradjat, who was the head of AusAID’s Indonesia office, which has a staff of approximately 100 people, and to Liz O’Neill, who was the head of public affairs at the Australian Embassy in Indonesia. In addition to those two fine Australians, three other fine Australians lost their lives: two Federal Police officers-Mark Scott and Brice Steele-both of whom had distinguished careers; and Morgan Mellish, a Walkley award winning journalist from the Australian Financial Review. In addition to them, of course, another five Australians were involved in the crash, four of whom suffered injuries. In fact, Cynthia Banham and Roger Tallboys suffered significant injuries. I will return to them later. I wish to offer my sympathy to the families of all 21 people-five Australians and 16 other souls-who perished on board the Garuda flight. However, I wish to speak in particular about Allison and Liz. Allison was, first and foremost, a wife and a mother. She leaves behind a husband, Ris, and four children, Jamila, Imran, Zaini and Yasmin. Our understanding of their loss and their grief can never be complete, but it is sufficient for everyone in this chamber simply to say that she was a wife and a mother. To Ris and the four beautiful children, whom I met on the day of the return of the bodies to Australia, we simply give you our support and our thanks. To those at AusAID who worked with Allison, you have lost a real and valued friend, and a profoundly important colleague. Your work, Allison, was of great merit and meaning. It was the work of a humanitarian who served Australia but who also more importantly served the developing world at a time when she was in a position to make real change. She was at AusAID for 18 years after joining the agency in 1989. She worked in Indonesia from 1992 to 1995, in Papua New Guinea from 1996 to 2001 and again in Indonesia, as I mentioned, as head of Australia’s aid work there from February 2005. Allison was in Papua New Guinea at a time of major development and humanitarian challenges. She managed Australian assistance during the crippling 1997-98 drought and contributed to the Bougainville peace process. That was an action of profound importance. She made a major contribution to long-term assistance to health programs, assisted survivors of the tsunami that hit Artape in 1998 and helped lead Australia’s response in Indonesia to the Asian tsunami similarly. Within Indonesia she was responsible for the implementation of the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, managing a program of $1 MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Yogyakarta Aircraft Accident
238,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12.25billion over a five-year period. She also played an important role in the lead-up to the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the work on the ground in Indonesia of helping to build 2,000 schools for Indonesian students. There could rarely be a more important developmental project than the building of 2,000 schools in a country that has had a desperate need to provide opportunities for its young people. That legacy of helping to oversee the creation of these schools for young people will perhaps be the most important thing she leaves as an aid worker. Allison worked on many fronts. She was an inspirational leader, she was a humanitarian and she was a warm friend to so many people. But first and foremost, more than any of these things-and I say this on behalf of AusAID, on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and on behalf of her friends and colleagues in the Australian government-Allison was a wife and a mother, and nothing can replace her loss. Similarly I want to speak about Liz O’Neill. Liz O’Neill was an amazing character, as is said by everybody who knew her. She was a person who had a belief in Australia and a belief in Australia’s role. She believed in our capacity for good and our capacity to have an impact on our region and the world and on the lives and futures of so many people. She was involved in Indonesia as Australia’s Counsellor for Public Affairs in the Jakarta embassy. She helped with some incredibly difficult challenges, including the embassy bombing in September 2004 and the effects of the Asian tsunami, which commenced on Boxing Day 2004. She was a member of the emergency response team sent to Bali following the first Bali bombing in October 2002, and she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to Australians in that period. During her career with Foreign Affairs, she served with the Peace Monitoring Group in Bougainville and at the embassy in Tokyo. But, as with Allison, whilst she will be missed by her colleagues and whilst her professional work will be missed, she was a wife and a mother first and foremost. I met Liz’s husband, Wayne, last Wednesday at RAAF Fairbairn and I met her beautiful little daughter, Lucinda, who is nine months old and has no comprehension of what has happened. Liz will be missed, and her loss will be felt much more greatly by her young daughter over time. To Wayne and to Lucinda: you have our deepest sympathy. Much has been said about the others who were lost. To the families of Morgan Mellish, Mark Scott, Brice Steele and all of those Indonesians who were lost: we cannot understand fully the extent of your loss but you have our complete sympathy. What this showed ultimately was the strength of cooperation between Australia and Indonesia, and the response of the Australian and Indonesian governments and the people who helped. This is indicative of the desire to do real things. Lives were saved. Cynthia Banham, I suspect, would not have been alive today but for the cooperation between people on both sides, and I think that their work deserves recognition. Cynthia and Michael Harvey: you have our support. You are good people, you will get through this and you will come back. To all of the people involved, I say thank you for your work. To the wonderful officers in the Australian Consular Response Group and consular crisis centre, led by Rod Smith, Simeon Gilding and Bassim Blasey, and to everybody who has helped: we thank you. But to those who have passed away-Liz, Allison, Morgan, Mark and Brice-you will be missed. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (12.35 pm)-I rise to speak on a motion that I do not think any of us would really want the opportunity to speak on-that is, when such a tremendous disaster hits so many people and affects so many people close to and far from this place. As we know, the Yogyakarta air crash on 7 March claimed 21 lives, five of them Australian. Much has been said both here and in the other place in the last 24 hours with regard to those five Australians. The reason for my participating in this condolence motion is that, as the member for Canberra-and I am sure my colleague the member for Fraser would agree with me-whilst I personally did not know all these people and may have regarded some of them only in passing, there is a connection for each one of them and their families to my community. It is on behalf of my community that I am here speaking today. I want to represent the many people from my community who would have known many of these sadly deceased Australians. Federal Agent Mark Scott and Federal Agent Brice Steele, both of the AFP, will have had very close connections. I know that Mark, in particular, began his policing career down in my patch of the world, in Tuggeranong, where he undertook community policing in the early part of his career. His career brought him back to Canberra on several occasions in the years to follow. I was able to attend the very moving service for him yesterday at St Andrews church here in Canberra. It is fair to say that his colleagues within the AFP are devastated by the loss of Mark and equally by the loss of Federal Agent Brice Steele. Mark is survived by his wife, Sally, and by their children, James, Stephanie and Emily. On behalf of my community, I wish to most sincerely convey condolences and sympathies to that family and to thank them for the fact that Mark Scott was able to perform the duties in his policing career that he did so well on behalf of our community. A similar comment could be made about Brice Steele, although I do not know quite as much about him-but again, a tragic loss. Both of these gentlemen were very experienced, Brice in particular. We heard many things said in relation to his capabilities and the work that he undertook in the AFP. To his wife Kellie, again, I convey our very sincere condolences and sympathies. Liz O’Neill, the DFAT officer who sadly perished in this crash, is survived by Wayne Adams, her husband, and their baby daughter, Lucinda. Allison Sudradjat, the AusAID officer, is survived by her husband Ris and their children Jamila, Imran, Zaini and Yasmin. In both cases, these people will have had many friends, colleagues and acquaintances within this community here in the ACT. We all bring different things to these particular motions, and when I hear of the work undertaken by Liz and AllisonI have a particularly close understanding. Even though it is some decades ago now, I did have the honour of serving in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and in the role that I now have I have seen from both sides the effort undertaken in our foreign missions by people who are posted to them. It is definitely not the cocktail circuit, I can assure everybody, and I think the evidence of the past few years has brought a finality to that particular argument. But having worked overseas in our foreign missions in the past and having now visited overseas as a parliamentarian with the assistance of the people within our foreign missions, I know and understand very clearly the sort of work undertaken by these people. It is dedication at the public level that many Australians really need to understand and appreciate. I think we are now beginning to do that. I wish to pay due regard to the accolades that have been laid upon both Liz and Allison. I know that in both cases, with families, friends and colleagues, there is going to be a long peMAIN COMMITTEE riod of mourning and a long period of remembering. I hope that during that period-for colleagues, in particular-there will be a period of celebration of two particularly impressive lives. I did not know Morgan Mellish, the journalist from the Australian Financial Review, but many people in my community will have known him. It was moving for me to hear the speeches made about Morgan. He is said to have had two really strong ambitions in life: one was to become a foreign correspondent and the other was to win a Walkley award. He has done both in a very short life. I am impressed with that: while some young boys might wish to become fighter pilots or foreign correspondents-there is a certain romance attached to that from youth-wishing for a Walkley award is a different thing. Not very many people even think about winning one of those, and they are a cherished award in the world of journalism. Morgan’s family, friends and colleagues would be most impressed, as am I, with his ability to do that and to be held in the regard that he was held in. I also want to send once again, on behalf of my community, our best wishes to Cynthia Banham and her partner, Michael Harvey. Again, they are two people who will be known very broadly within my community here in Canberra. The previous speakers have remarked upon Cynthia’s survival, and I have to agree that it is a bit of a miracle. But from what I have heard of her it should not be a surprise, given her strength, her fitness and her determination to achieve. To Cynthia and Michael, I send my very warmest wishes, and I join with my colleagues who yesterday in the main chamber made a very strong point of looking forward very much to the return of both of them-in particular of Cynthia-to their journalism roles here in the building. I am sure that all of the friends, colleagues and family of Cynthia and Michael have that in their hearts as well. I join them in looking forward to hearing of the continued progress that she is making and to knowing that she is going to re-enter this building as an active journalist with a good career ahead of her. I conclude by saying that we must also recall the other people who perished or who were injured, including Indonesians and people of other nationalities. We hope and pray that they can reach the end of this tragedy successfully and get on with their lives as best they can. In remembering our five Australians, I would like to also pay regard to the other people who perished and to the large number of people who suffered injuries in this terrible tragedy. ter for Defence) (12.43 pm)-I would like to express my sincerest condolences to the families and friends of the five Australians who have gone all too soon, tragically killed in the Garuda plane crash on 7 March in Indonesia: Morgan Mellish, Elizabeth O’Neill, Mark Scott, Brice Steele and Allison Sudradjat. I also offer my thoughts, prayers and encouragement to those who have suffered severe injuries in the crash, including Defence Force personnel, the many civilians from different parts of the world-particularly the Indonesian people on board-and especially the Fairfax journalist, Cynthia Banham. Prior to my current roles as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, I had the honour and good fortune to be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a year and a half. I speak today, as his former parliamentary secretary, about the dealings that I had during that time with some of the Australians who have lost their lives or were injured. I travelled to Indonesia twice and had the privilege of working directly and closely with Allison Sudradjat. In June 2005 I led an eight-member parMAIN COMMITTEE",210,Yogyakarta Aircraft Accident
239,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minisliamentary delegation to Jakarta and to Aceh, in northern Sumatra, to inspect the devastation caused by the Boxing Day tsunami and to discuss with officials, led by and greatly supported by Allison, Australia’s aid effort to help Indonesia recover from the tragedy. I remember marvelling at Allison’s fluency in the Indonesian language. She translated for me in our meetings with senior officials in Aceh and accompanied us to our meetings with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and also Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. Despite the enormity of the recovery process, the very deep sense of personal connectedness with hardship and grief that so many were feeling, the direct-hand experience of the immense devastation in the region and the strain that it placed on Australian officials, particularly AusAID officials, Allison was simply outstanding in the way she responded to the disaster not only as an AusAID official and an aid worker but as a remarkably compassionate human being who was valued and respected, and who moved very freely and easily and in a welcoming way amongst the Indonesian communities she was working with. In a vastly different working environment from Aceh, I again had the honour of working closely with Allison during another trip to Indonesia. Together, in August 2005, we put forward the Australian view at the ministerial meeting in Jakarta to discuss the Asia-Pacific region’s approach to the millennium development goals. Again, Allison, with great ease and professionalism, provided exceptional advice and support not only as a diplomat but as a very experienced and highly regarded aid policy adviser, with grounded practical experience that meant so much to that process. Although she was there with me representing our country, she was clearly incredibly committed to the outcomes that we were all aiming to achieve for communities in the region, to build better futures for their children and to share and develop some of the prosperity that everyone was reaching for. Perhaps Allison’s work is best described in her AusAID testimony. She was a distinguished diplomat, one of Australia’s most capable and dedicated aid workers. She was able to meet the demands of responding to some of the region’s worse disasters, as well as understanding the complexities of trying to support improvements in governance, health and education services for the desperately poor people of the Asia-Pacific region. It was a privilege to meet Allison. She was a remarkable human being and it was an honour to experience first hand the way she had devoted her life and her skills and, above all, her seemingly boundless and genuine compassion to those in need. My heartfelt condolences are with Allison’s family and the friends of Allison for the great sadness and sense of loss they must now be feeling. Indeed, her tragic passing as a committed aid worker and a person of great compassion is a loss for the entire region. However, with all the different cultures, religions and backgrounds that she helped both here at home and abroad we can truly say that the world is a better place because of her life. I also convey my admiration to the team at AusAID. Bruce Davis’s terrific obituary captured Allison and her work, Annemarie O’Keefe’s dignified account of the great loss that Allison represented was a fitting tribute to her. AusAID brings so much support to others in their darkest times. It is now our turn to bring some sunshine to AusAID and their people, because they are hurting and they have lost a wonderful member of their team. I would also like to pay my respects to Liz O’Neill and express my condolences to her family and her friends. The loss of Liz O’Neill as a wife, a mother, a friend and an outstanding government official is very tragic. Again, in my previous role as Parliamentary Secretary to MAIN COMMITTEE the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had the privilege of receiving public affairs support from Liz on my trips to Indonesia and benefiting from her insights. Although the working relationship between my office and Liz was brief, her assistance was exceptional. I am aware of the great number of tributes she, as the spokesperson in Jakarta, has deservingly received as her work is remembered by the Australian embassy there, and also for the Order of Australia that she earned so commendably for her tireless efforts after the Bali bombs and for what a wonderful person she was. My thoughts are also with Cynthia Banham. We have heard much about Cynthia. I had the good fortune of working with Cynthia, and I have been interviewed by her on a number of occasions in my current and previous roles. It is a true testament to her courage and tenacity that she survived this tragedy, and my thoughts are very much with her and her partner Michael Harvey, whom I also know well. To their family and friends: a new kind of marathon faces this delightful couple and those dear to them, and we wish them all the very best. May the support of her loved ones and her strength and determination continue to help nourish Cynthia’s recovery. As a result of this tragedy, these committed Australian embassy officials who were carrying out their role of supporting the democratic process are very much in our thoughts. They may not have been well known but they were enormous in the lives of those who were dear to them. They will be dearly remembered for their commitment to developing the understanding between our two countries and for doing what they believed in. They were proud and dedicated Australians. They were everyday individuals of Indonesia. They were very important to many people. Our thoughts are with them after this terrible tragedy. this debate, to of course support the motion moved by the Prime Minister. I have two capacities in which I wish to do that. To some extent that amalgamates the speeches made by the two previous speakers, because I do it as a member representing the ACT and as the shadow minister for international development assistance. When I come to those remarks, I will refer specifically to Allison Sudradjat, about whom the minister and former parliamentary secretary made such compelling remarks. This incident struck Canberra very hard. Of course, everybody in Australia was struck by it. It was dramatic; it was sad; it was tragic; and all Australians were affected. But this struck Canberra very hard for two reasons. One is that all the five people either came from Canberra or had very strong connections with Canberra-and I will speak of that in a moment-and the other aspect is that everybody in Canberra knows somebody who does what they were doing. Everybody in Canberra could put themselves in the place of that person or their family. Everybody knows somebody in the media, in the police, in the Public Service or in the Defence Force-in the case of the people who were injured but fortunately not killed-who go to work on behalf of the nation, who travel overseas. I have members of my family who have travelled to Indonesia in the service of the public, not in any dramatic way, in the high-profile way that we as members of parliament might, but as part of Australia’s relationship with Indonesia. I have very dear friends, one of whose family has been living in Indonesia for several months, who have just returned on behalf of the Australian government in different agencies. But I do not know anybody in this community who does not know somebody who does what Mark, Brice, Liz, Morgan and Allison did, even if they do not know those individuals. So that made MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Yogyakarta Aircraft Accident
240,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (12.51 Pm),"I rise, like everyone else who has participated init particularly telling and compelling. People come here to serve their country in the Public Service, in the media, in the AFP, in the military and in a hundred other ways, and their families do not expect them to pay such a high price in the process. But we all know that it is possible, and, when it happens, it strikes home very hard. It was a very powerful ceremony held last week at Fairbairn for the return of the caskets containing the bodies of the five Australians. You cannot hope to convey in a speech the mood that was there. It was quite a long ceremony, necessarily. There were five areas set aside for the families and one for those of us who had come in an official capacity on behalf of the Australian government, the opposition, the ACT government and the agencies that were represented by the people who had died. One thing struck me: for the whole duration of that ceremony, no-one spoke. Not one person in that area exchanged a word with the person next to them, because you did not know whether you could control your emotions if you spoke. It was too powerful. Of course, our hearts went out. We could not pretend that the suffering we were feeling was in any way comparable with that being endured by all the families whom we could see in front of us trying to cope with their grief. But we all had to nevertheless gear up and have our own strength as we coped, knowing that there but for fortune were people close to us. I join with all my colleagues in extending condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those who died. Our thoughts are with those who are struggling to overcome the consequences of their injuries-physical and psychological. In the time available for this debate, I want to turn my particular attention to some remarks in my capacity as shadow minister for international development assistance and speak particularly about Allison Sudradjat and those who go overseas in the service of AusAID. I think the minister has done an excellent job in his communication and support to the colleagues and families of those who died so tragically in this terrible incident. It was not my place to duplicate that; that would have been totally superfluous. I wanted to find a way of communicating, however inadequately, to the staff, many of whom are constituents of mine-probably at least half-and many of whom are friends of mine from my years and years of interest in this issue. I wrote a letter to the Director-General, which I am grateful he communicated to the staff, which makes clear that we support what the government and the minister have said about Allison and the people at AusAID-that it is the bipartisan, unanimous view of this parliament. I welcome this opportunity to expand on that, particularly with regard to Allison. It is notable that 600 people came to pay tribute to Allison Sudradjat in the Great Hall of the parliament last Friday, while many others watched from Jakarta as the memorial service was streamed live to AusAID offices in Indonesia, in a sad irony, via the IT infrastructure that Allison herself had championed and enabled. Allison was not afraid to try new technologies and new solutions and was supportive of change and innovation. She was described as one of Australia’s most respected and talented development experts and was also an inspirational leader to whom people looked with great respect, admiration and fondness. But, in the words of Allison’s sister, Simone Kerr, could we ever know just how many millions of people Allison touched in her lifetime? As head of AusAID in Indonesia, Allison’s work impacted on the lives of many, not only in her leadership and her management of Australia’s aid program with Indonesia but also in her compassion, her integrity and her manner. In Indonesian, one colleague told how local staff in Jakarta spoke with pride about the fact that it was Allison who hired them, because being MAIN COMMITTEE handpicked by her was considered to be an honour. Under Allison’s leadership, much effort has gone into improving national roads and there has been a particular focus on junior and secondary education. In Indonesia, as in Australia, this is the investment that opens two doors-the door to economic success and the door to opportunity-for those who might otherwise be denied it without that education. Progress has been made in improving access to education for children, but over 100 million boys and girls around the world are still not in school today. I conclude by saying that I want to pay my respects to Allison’s family and acknowledge with gratitude and admiration the large contribution that Allison made to the Australian aid program and to all those who work in AusAID with her. able members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

Such comments are reprehensible and unacceptable, and Australia joins the international community in unreservedly denouncing these and other similar remarks made by elements of the Iranian regime. In this context, Australia remains firmly committed to the pursuit of diplomatic efforts to address the concerns surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme and strongly urges Iran to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. (3) The Australian Government is putting in place financial sanctions against Iran as part of its compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. The resolution includes financial sanctions on individuals and entities listed by the Security Council or Sanctions Committee for their involvement in Iran’s nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems. Mobile Phone Towers (Question No. 3994) Ms Kate Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) How much has been spent on the establishment and maintenance of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency’s Electromagnetic Health Complaints Register. (2) Does he consider that the Electromagnetic Health Complaints Register has succeeded in “assist[ing] researchers in formulating research hypotheses, and contribut[ing] to public confidence in measures being adopted to minimise health risks associated with EMR”, as recommended by the Senate Environment, Communications and Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. (3) Can he provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Electromagnetic Complaints Register for each year since its establishment in 2003.",228,Questions In Writing
252,Mr Ruddock,The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to,229,Questions In Writing
253,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) What steps have been taken to advertise the Electromagnetic Health Complaints Register to the general public. (5) What action will he take to ensure that the Register accurately reflects the full extent of health issues arising from electromagnetic energy across the country. (6) Will he undertake a nation-wide health audit of people living and working near low and high impact mobile telephone base stations across Australia. (1) The design of the Electromagnetic Health Complaints Register involved widespread consultation and required approximately 0.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) at the Executive Level 1. The ongoing maintenance requires an annual 0.02 FTE at the same level. (2) The Government’s response to Recommendation 2.7 was – “The Government is aware of the concerns held by some users of radiofrequency technologies about the possible health effects of such devices. The Government accepts the establishment of a centralised complaints mechanism. It is proposed that ARPANSA will implement and manage a complaints register. The register may identify emerging issues as well as possible activities. This information would be shared with the public and industry (via ARPANSA’s website) as well as other Commonwealth agencies”. ARPANSA has established and maintained the Complaints Register and places an annual analysis on the protect against and to inform the public about potential adverse health effects from exposure to electromagnetic radiation in the environment. (3) No criteria have been established to judge the effectiveness of the Complaints Register. The register was launched via an ARPANSA media release on 4 July 2003. The media release was placed on the ARPANSA web site and a direct link to an information page and submission form has been on the ARPANSA home page since 26 September 2003. The media release was distributed to 168 major daily and major regional newspapers, posted on the Australian Associated Press web site and distributed to the Australian Medical Association, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australasian Science Journal. Later in 2003 it was further distributed to: The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges, Australasian Faculty of Occupational Medicine, Australian and New Zealand Society of Occupational Medicine and the Australian Divisions of General Practice. EMR and a large number of copies of the media release and complaints submissions form have been distributed to interested persons in the community. Through enquiries to ARPANSA by telephone and e-mail, nearly another 900 submission forms have been sent to interested persons. Links to the ARPANSA web pages concerning the register have appeared or do appear on the web pages of other government agencies and interest groups. During 2006 the ARPANSA website was viewed on over 900,000 occasions. The Complaints Register was viewed on 2,000 occasions and the submission form was downloaded approximately once per day. (5) The consensus of scientific opinion in Australia and internationally is that there are no established adverse health effects arising from exposure to electromagnetic energy at levels normally encountered in the environment. The most appropriate action is for ARPANSA to continue to monitor the published scientific literature and to advise government as appropriate. (6) Having regard for the answer to Question (5) there is no justification to undertake a nation-wide health audit of people living and working near low and high impact mobile telephone base stations across Australia.",229,Questions In Writing

(b) not applicable. (3) and (4) DFAT holds a range of personal and customer records, reflecting the scope and operations of the department. Arrangements for access to these records vary according to the type of information involved. Access to staff records, for example, is limited to the relevant work areas with that responsibility. Audit logs are kept of access, printing and for e-mail dispatch. In the case of the information held in our passports database (PICS), individual access to, and use of, personal data is recorded down to the keystroke and is subject to regular audits by the Australian National Audit Office. All activity generated in PICS is monitored by the System Administrator with monthly reports scrutinised by senior management. In relation to consular records our current consular case management system provides us with good audit trail capabilities on individuals who access the system with the ability to limit access to relevant case officers and supervisors. These capabilities are being further strengthened in the current development of our new system. Consular Operations staff have a strong privacy culture and protecting the privacy of our consular clients is an important focus of the Department’s consular and security training programs.

271,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In order to identify that an employee has accessed a file without authorisation, the logs of their actions must be manually examined. (4) As mentioned, logs are recorded by systems for every action a user makes when accessing customer records. Logs are kept, and held by system owners. At present user logs are audited in both a reactive and proactive manner. If it is assumed a user is wrongfully accessing records or if it is found that a record has been modified then logs will be examined. In addition, randomly chosen clients records are audited to determine if their records have been incorrectly accessed. Randomly selected user accounts are also audited; in this situation the records they have accessed are investigated for improper use. There are procedures in place to ensure staff access privileges are removed if they are no longer required. For example, if a staff member moves into a position where their previous access privileges are not required, their access will be removed.
